"Students have called on the universities minister to provide emergency financial support to cover fees and rent after she announced that most of them should not return until at least the end of January. Michelle Donelan also told international students preparing to travel from overseas that they should “consider whether they in fact need to travel to the UK at this time”. The spread of a new Covid-19 variant and the extension of tougher tier 4 restrictions across part of England were cited by Donelan as reasons why the government had to consider further steps to reduce transmission in education settings. However, the announcement on Wednesday evening left students scrambling to make plans, with some directly challenging Donelan on social media to help them with costs including rent for accommodation that will not be used and fees for course that will not be delivered as envisaged. “I’ll be blunt, students want to help but without the government helping them with this endeavour, and to make it cost-effective to them, the plan will fail,” Joshua Connor, an international relations and politics student at the University of Lincoln, wrote in a letter to Donelan. Giving an example of the financial burden he and others faced, Connor told her that he would have to pay £2,100 to the university for the spring term on top of having lost several weeks of accommodation because of travelling home for Christmas during a government-designated “student travel window”. From 5 December to 25 January, he would have paid £1,057 for accommodation he has been unable to use. Like others, he was considering whether or not to travel to use his rented accommodation. Further guidance from the government is expected next week. University authorities have been writing to students in the past 48 hours to advise them of the Department for Education announcement. Cambridge University’s vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, said in an email to students that the delay was “potentially disruptive and difficult to students”. The academic registrar of Newcastle University, Lucy Backhurst, told students: “We appreciate these last-minute changes will bring their own challenges to many of you.” Support would include January rent rebates for students living in university-owned, university-managed and partnership accommodation arrangements. Universities UK, which represents the sector, said the announcement by Donelan “would understandably raise further issues and uncertainty – for students, universities and staff – which will need to be addressed by government over the coming weeks, including the need for financial support, regulatory flexibility and assessment changes”. The government said it was asking universities to restrict the number of practical students returning from 4 January to those reading subjects in areas including medicine, dentistry and related subjects, social work and courses requiring professional assessments for January and which cannot be rescheduled. Other students with “compelling reasons to return” were also identified. In a separate letter to students, Donelan said her department had worked with the Office for Students to remind education providers that they could use existing funds for hardship support. She added that the government was making available up to a further £20m on a one-off basis to support those who needed it most.",education
"The UK’s largest teaching union has called for all schools in England to remain closed for two further weeks at the end of the Christmas break after a government U-turn which means all primaries in London will be shut next week. The call from the National Education Union came after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, reversed his decision that primary schools in some parts of London should open on Monday. The government bowed to protests and legal pressure from the capital’s local authorities. Williamson said the decision had been a last resort. Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said the government needed to close schools in England before infection rates got out of control. “If you allow the conditions to get so bad in the end you’ll be closing schools for longer. “What the government should be doing is what the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are doing. You don’t get this chaos in the other countries of the United Kingdom. And does the government really believe that somehow Covid in England is different than the other countries of the UK? “I find the government’s recklessness in this regard, both with educational professionals’ health, but also with community health, and the questions increasingly around children’s health, inexplicable.”  Under the government’s initial plan, secondary schools and colleges were set to be closed to most pupils for the first two weeks of January, while primary schools within 50 local authorities in London and the south of England were also told to keep their doors shut until 18 January. But the list omitted several London areas where Covid-19 transmission rates remain high including the borough of Haringey, whose leaders said they were prepared to defy the government and support any schools that decided to close to protect staff and pupils. The protests from local authority leaders came to a head with a letter to the education secretary from nine London authorities asking for their primary schools to be closed to all except vulnerable children and those whose parents were key workers. The action provoked an emergency Cabinet Office meeting on New Year’s Day, which signed off on the revision, adding the remaining 10 London education authorities to the government’s “contingency areas”. In the capital, Richard Watts, the leader of Islington council, said: “I’m very relieved to hear this news. There was enormous concern from parents and schools who couldn’t understand the rationale for why some boroughs were excluded. “We welcome that the government has, belatedly, listened to local areas. We will be working with our schools to ensure they offer high quality online learning and can welcome pupils back as soon as Public Health deem it to be sensible.” The Department for Education (DfE) confirmed the move in a statement: “In light of Covid case rates rising rapidly across the capital and ongoing engagement with London leaders and the evidence submitted, the government has reviewed the London boroughs where the contingency framework will apply, with all further boroughs added.” Pupils not eligible to attend in person will be provided with remote learning by their schools. Early years settings will remain open, as will alternative provision and special schools, the DfE said. “We must make this move to protect our country and the NHS. We will continue to keep the list of local authorities under review, and reopen classrooms as soon as we possibly can,” Williamson said. The move means schools in Camden, the City of London, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Islington, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth and Lewisham will be closed to most pupils from Monday until at least 18 January. After the move was revealed by the Guardian, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the news saying it would mean all the capital’s primary schools would be treated the same. But the decision leaves question marks over the government’s decision-making, and stands as a further humiliating reverse for Williamson during his tenure as education secretary. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “This is yet another government U-turn creating chaos for parents just two days before the start of term. “Gavin Williamson’s incompetent handling of the return of schools and colleges is creating huge stress for parents, pupils, and school and college staff and damaging children’s education.” Several local authorities had been preparing legal challenges to keep their primary schools closed. “We are advised by leading counsel that the omissions from the list are unlawful on a number of grounds and can be challenged in court,” the letter from the nine London authorities sent to Williamson stated. Schools in the contingency areas may remain closed after 18 January, with the Daily Telegraph quoting a senior government source: “We have been careful not to say they will definitely reopen on 18 January because we don’t know that.” Meanwhile, the DfE faces a further rebellion from secondary school leaders in England over its demand that coronavirus testing of pupils is to be mandatory from 11 January. School leaders and teaching unions have been meeting over the new year period to discuss a response to the demand, with many secondary heads arguing that the testing regime is impractical and unworkable.",education
"Until late on Friday evening, the answer had been that most primaries and attached nurseries would open on 4 January, but would remain closed within 50 local authorities spread across London and the south of England, including Kent and Essex. In a U-turn, however, the Department for Education announced that all London primary schools would keep their gates closed until at least 18 January. The schools are required to remain open for remote learning, and for the children of key workers and those classed as vulnerable to attend school in person. The government has not divulged the basis on which it selected the 50 areas where primaries had been told to shut. It said the “contingency framework” plans were being implemented in local areas “with high rates of infection and with significant increases in seven-day case rates, and pressure on the NHS”. All 50 were in tier 4 areas but others in tier 4 had not been included. This led to confusion in areas with higher rates of infection but where primaries had been told to remain open. Haringey council, which has higher rates of infection than some areas on the list, said it would defy government advice and advise its primaries to close to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers. The leader of Greenwich council, which was also not included in the government’s contingency framework, said: “There appears to be no logic to how this list was brought together.” A group of London councils, including Haringey and Greenwich, jointly petitioned the government, asking for their primary schools to be able to close from 4 January. The Department for Education had said it would review the decision on school closures in the 50 named local authorities by 18 January but that move is now redundant. Possible next moves include adding more councils to the list of areas where primaries should close, adding secondary schools to the closures or an even wider closure across England. The latter is a serious possibility on the basis of scientific advice, such as research by Imperial College London into the new Covid-19 variant, B117, which found that it was directly affecting a greater proportion of people aged under 20.",education
"In parts of England, parents face more uncertainty as some local authorities delayed the reopening of schools due to the rise in coronavirus cases in the country.

"The only black composer has been dropped from the syllabus of a popular A-level music exam, along with the study of jazz, because of course changes demanded by the coronavirus crisis, according to the examination board involved. Pearson Edexcel defended its decision to axe the work of the British jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine along with five others, including the Oscar-winning British composer Rachel Portman, because of “feedback from teachers that the volume of work was too high and needed accelerated change in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic”. Pine’s album Back in the Day had been included in the Pearson Edexcel A-level course’s “popular music and jazz” section, alongside Revolver by the Beatles and Hounds of Love by Kate Bush. But after next summer Pine’s work will be removed and jazz dropped from the renamed “popular music” category. In response to the decision, Pine said: “I was deeply honoured to be included in the A-level syllabus, it is a place in the UK education system that I never imagined to be in. “As a musician that tours the world representing who we are, to have a place in the awareness of our young during these times has been inspiring. I have met so many students who have told me that studying my music has contributed to their musical development, they are as aware as I am of the absence of British jazz composers to the syllabus until now. “I hope that there will be more UK composers who will be asked to contribute to such an important, influential subject.” Portman, the first woman to win an Academy award for best original musical score for her work on the 1996 film Emma, has also been removed after Pearson reduced the number of compositions to be studied from 18 to 12. The Cuban ensemble La Familia Valera Miranda was among those dropped. Those retained include the US film and television composer Danny Elfman, best known for his theme tune for The Simpsons, along with JS Bach and Igor Stravinsky. Only four women remain on the new syllabus, including the sitar player and composer Anoushka Shankar. A spokesperson for Pearson said: “We completely agree it is vital pupils get to study music by composers from different cultures and backgrounds. We want to ensure A-level music remains as rich and diverse as possible and will be reviewing this specification again in time for students taking exams from 2022 onwards.” The exam board said in its announcement that “although six set works have been removed from the specification and will no longer appear in questions on the exam paper, centres should add these to the wider listening list as they can prove to be valuable pieces” in answering exam questions. The A-level music syllabus offered by another exam board, AQA, has also been trimmed after Ofqual’s requirement last August “to accommodate potential public health requirements” as a result of the pandemic. In contrast to Pearson, AQA opted to shrink the amount of performance and composition required from students, without reducing its set works. The works in AQA’s pop music category include Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé as well as the black British composer Labrinth. Its jazz option includes the work of the Welsh pianist Gwilym Simcock, alongside Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.",education
"The government’s plans for mass Covid testing of secondary pupils after Christmas are in disarray after unions told members not to work on the scheme over the holidays, branding it “inoperable” and “undeliverable”. A statement by the four main teaching unions and the National Governance Association advised staff to delay preparations until the start of term on 4 or 5 January and refuse to work on the scheme over the Christmas break. “It is our view that due to the chaotic and rushed nature of this announcement, the lack of proper guidance and an absence of appropriate support, the government’s plan in its current form will be inoperable for most schools and colleges,” the statement said. “Schools and colleges simply do not have the staffing capacity to carry this out themselves. As such, most will not be in a position to carry this out in a safe and effective manner.” The Royal Statistical Society said it had “major concerns” that the government’s plans may be unsafe because the tests were “imperfect and must be used with great care”, and it called on ministers to “review them with urgency”. On Thursday the Department for Education announced that the return of secondary school pupils in England would be delayed by a week and replaced by remote learning for most year groups, to allow schools to test all pupils using rapid lateral flow tests. Students and pupils at secondary schools and colleges are to be offered two rapid tests three days apart during the first week of term, with positive results confirmed by a lab-based PCR test. But the government’s plan ran into controversy for lacking detail and for having been announced as schools close for the Christmas holidays. In a measure of the DfE’s desperation to complete its own work on the programme, the Guardian has learned that civil servants in the department have been offered a £1,000 bonus if they volunteer to work over Christmas. The offer was announced by Susan Acland-Hood, the DfE’s permanent secretary, to staff on Thursday. The DfE’s announcements have not included any additional payments for school staff working over the holiday period. School leaders have already been told to remain on call until 23 December to conduct track and trace for pupils who tested positive for the virus at the end of term. Teachers and heads have told the Guardian of exhaustion as they come to the end of “a year of hell”. “I know heads who haven’t stopped since March and it’s not sustainable. At the best of times we work 50-plus hours a week. Now there are some teachers pushing 70-plus,” said one teacher, Matt David. The advice from the four main unions – the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the National Education Union and the NASUWT – reflects deep-seated anger among teachers at the DfE’s latest demands, and its failure to publish more details until just before Christmas. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT, said that while teachers supported the use of mass testing, there was not enough time to safely organise the screening of hundreds of pupils packed into just a few days by 4 January. “Given the lack of detailed guidance or a coherent plan, we do not believe schools or colleges will be able to begin working on this before the start of next term. We will fully support members who choose not to implement the plan if they consider it to be unworkable in their schools, as the government guidance allows for this,” Whiteman said, emphasising that the DfE had labelled its plan an “offer”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of ASCL, said: “It is not possible to recruit and train all the people needed to carry out tests and put in place the processes that would be necessary, over the Christmas period, and it is extremely regrettable that the government has given the public an expectation that this will happen.” The schools minister, Nick Gibb, hosted an hour-long briefing for MPs at short notice on Friday and was unable to allay their concerns about whether schools would be given the resources they need to carry out the program. “It was just dire,” said one person on the call. “The thing that really riled people was that he said several times: ‘This is a good news story.’” The Royal Statistical Society said it had concerns about the scientific basis and safety of the government’s plans for testing in schools, and about “inaccuracies and omissions in the information provided to schools” by the DfE, noting that trials in Liverpool found tests missed more than half of positive cases, including 30% of those with high viral loads. “In the new testing programme for schools, individuals who have been exposed and have received a negative result will still have a significant risk of having the Covid-19 infection and spreading it to others,” it said. Anger at the lateness of the government’s announcement was also shared by school governors, whose national representatives were perplexed at suggestions by Gibb that they pitch in as volunteers. Sam Henson, of the National Governance Association, said: “We’ve heard from a lot of members today who are just angry. Some say they would support their communities of course and would do what they can but others feel that it’s just totally inappropriate. There seems to be an assumption that schools just have this bank of volunteers, which just isn’t true.” One chair of governors tweeted: “Not a chance of any of us volunteering for this. We are eyes-on, hands-off, and certainly not spare capacity to help the government. I do have some time during the day but this crosses a line.” Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “We have been calling for mass testing for months, it’s a really important thing to do – but the implementation of it, coming out in the most half-baked way in the week before Christmas, when school leaders and staff are exhausted, is really unsatisfactory.”",education
"My husband, Karl Chidsey, who has died aged 83, was a popular teacher at Brighton Polytechnic (now University) on various subjects related to psychology and business within the business school. He was a lecturer there from 1969 until taking early retirement in 1991, after which we moved to Valencia in Venezuela, where he worked as an unpaid adviser to the catholic priest Padre Rivolta, founder of Hogares Crea, a local organisation set up to help with the rehabilitation of drug addicts. Karl also established his own clinical psychology service, running it at our home until 2011, by which time he had dealt with 4,000 cases. Karl was born in Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex to Patricia (nee Le Beau), a care assistant in an old people’s home, and her husband, William, a fitter for the Hunslet Engine Company. Karl’s early days were spent in south Wales in the village of Senghenydd, where his paternal grandfather was a miner. He passed the 11-plus at the age of nine, after which he was awarded a scholarship to start early at Cockburn high school in Leeds, when a family move took them to the city. After national service in Aden in the early 1950s, Karl gained a degree in psychology at the University of Liverpool in 1963, followed by a master’s in ergonomics at Loughborough University in 1966. He then worked at the Furniture Industry Research Association, designing ergonomic chairs, before moving to Lewes in Sussex to lecture at Brighton Polytechnic.  Karl’s first marriage, to Catherine Platt in 1960, ended in divorce in 1980. He and I met at the University of East Anglia, where he was teaching an Open University course and I was writing my PhD thesis. We married in 1981. He is survived by me, two daughters, Karen and Jenny, from his first marriage, two of his three siblings, Bob and Philip, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",education
"Imperial College London has blamed a “clerical error” after it emerged that its longstanding policy on bullying was altered days before staff were told of a completed investigation into bullying allegations against the world-leading university’s president. Alice Gast and the chief financial officer, Muir Sanderson, this week admitted to bullying colleagues after allegations against them were investigated during the summer by a QC who was commissioned to carry out an inquiry. They have remained in post at the London university despite mounting pressure to step down. The Guardian has now learned that changes were made without customary oversight earlier this month to a policy, which had the effect of watering down how severely bullying was regarded. The previous version said that bullying was “gross misconduct”. After the changes, the policy said that “all incidents will be taken seriously”. Hours after it was contacted by the Guardian about the changes, the university said that the policy had been “mistakenly edited and published without approval from the director of HR or due process”. It said the original policy would continue to apply. Clarifications have now also been published on the university’s website stating that the changes were due to a “clerical error” and the provost has launched a formal investigation to find out what occurred. The Office for Students (OfS), which has a role in regulating universities, is now looking into the controversy amid mounting disquiet among staff, students and others who are concerned that Gast and Sanderson are still in post. Anger has been exacerbated by the fact that at least two of the people who were bullied have left the university. Before the changes, Imperial’s policy on harassment and bullying stated: “Harassment, bullying and victimisation are viewed as gross misconduct, and disciplinary action, including dismissal, may be taken if any complaint of harassment, bullying or victimisation is upheld.” It was this wording, which had been in place for at least three years, that informed the investigation into the bullying allegations. However, shortly before staff were told of the inquiry, the wording of the policy was changed to read: “Zero-tolerance means any complaints must not be ignored and will be investigated. All incidents will be taken seriously and could provide grounds for disciplinary action that may lead to dismissal from the College.” Days after the new wording was put in place, an email to staff on 4 December first mentioned the investigation into the conduct of the president. In its clarification, the university said it was a mistake in the updated policy that meant that the passage referring to “gross misconduct” was left out. It is alleged that the revised policy, published after questions from an MP in parliament first made public mention of the bullying inquiry, was relied upon to provided a post-hoc justification for Gast and Sanderson’s conduct. A spokesperson for Imperial said: “We reject these allegations.”  Imperial said on Friday that the policy, which was in place from earlier this year, continues to apply and the passage flagged by the Guardian should not have been removed. The definition of zero tolerance, which had also been inserted, had not yet been consulted on, according to the clarification. The Imperial branch of the University and College Union called this week for the resignation of Gast and Sanderson for gross misconduct, with the union citing the college’s own statutes. It is unclear who approved the revised policy or who was responsible for setting in motion moves to make the changes.",education
"With our exit from the European Union just days away, we should be saying a very firm and British goodbye. Yet for many in the UK, it seems that on the eve of departure it is more a case of au revoir. The number of people learning a language in Britain has risen twice as fast as the rest of the world in the last year, according to online learning platform Duolingo, and one of the fastest growing groups is those learning French. Thousands more are learning Spanish, German, Italian, or other EU languages – with some of them hoping to improve their language skills to a level where they qualify for citizenship of a European country. Maxine Brown, a 27-year-old second year economics student, has been learning Danish for the last six months with the intention of moving to Denmark to pursue a postgraduate degree and work in environmental projects. “I’m interested in the resource side of economics and Denmark is really leading the way,” she said. “So I started learning Danish in May. Very quickly I was able to start reading newspapers and I joined online forums to really immerse myself and started listening to the radio to pick up the tones and the sounds.” Since British citizens will no longer have the right to live and work in EU countries after 31 December, Brown will need to pay tuition fees in full and needs a residence permit which requires a grasp of Danish. “If you want citizenship in Denmark, you need to be resident there for nine years without breaks,” Brown said. “But they also have other routes, so you can get a job or go via education or invest. Just because we’re leaving the EU, that doesn’t deter me because it’s something I want to do.” The UK is now one of Duolingo’s top five countries by the total number of daily learners, according to the app’s UK general manager, Colin Watkins, with a rise in new learners of 132% on last year. “Events like Brexit and Covid plus cultural moments like the Olympics [in Japan] are driving the change,” he said. “Brits now want to be better citizens of the world when we travel, when we do business, when we meet people in the UK.” Watkins said many of the 15 million people who have signed up to Duolingo’s online courses are not aiming to become fluent but to gain a basic level of understanding. “As one of our first courses French was already very popular, so to see it make the top five shows new learners have chosen it because they want to travel there in the future, maybe want to do business, emigrate, or just pick up on what they learned in school.” Other language learning apps are seeing similar rises. Memrise saw a large increase in new users in March, and 70% of people using its platform are learning Spanish or French, while German, Italian and Japanese are also popular. Formal language learning in schools has declined substantially over the last 15 years, but there are some signs of encouragement. The British Council’s annual Language Trends survey showed a marked increase in children who took French or Spanish at GCSE in 2019, although A-level entries were still down. And despite the decline at schools, adults continue to value language highly, the British Council found. During the spring lockdown, 10% of adults in the UK began learning a foreign language or returned to one after a break. A third of those surveyed said that Spanish was the most important language for young people to learn, followed by French at 20% and Mandarin at 18%. ",education
"Guidance warning schools against using resources from organisations that have expressed a desire to end capitalism will be reviewed by the Department for Education (DfE) following the threat of legal action. The guidance, published in September, was criticised by teachers, MPs and human rights groups over the risk it could impinge on freedom of belief, speech and expression in the classroom. In a pre-action letter sent in October, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators (Care) and Black Educators Alliance (BEA) said the guidance would prevent teachers using material from groups including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, limiting anti-racism teaching. On Monday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, notified the group’s lawyers that “the wording of the guidance is being reviewed in light of issues which your clients have raised”. In the guidance issued for school leaders and teachers in England, the DfE categorised anti-capitalism as an “extreme political stance” and compared it with opposition to freedom of speech, antisemitism and endorsement of illegal activity. The guidance said schools should not “under any circumstances” work with or use material from groups that do not “condemn illegal activities done in their name or in support of their cause” or promote “victim narratives that are harmful to British society”. A letter sent to Williamson in early October by the law firm Bindmans on behalf of Care and BEA claimed the guidance failed to properly account for issues of discrimination, and that it was vague and poorly written. The groups launched a crowdfunding page to proceed with a judicial review if the department refused to withdraw the guidance. The announcement of a review was welcomed. “Within the process of evidence collection, we have heard from many students, teaching staff and parents of the impact of the guidance, which would see conversations on injustice and inequality outlawed from the classroom,” a spokesperson for Care said. Rachel Harger, of Bindmans, said: “We hope that given the obvious failures and shortcomings of the current guidance the secretary of state will accept that, as part of this review, a broad consultation with teachers, parents and trade unionists is not just desirable but entirely necessary. We will now stand by our clients as they anxiously await the outcome of this review.” A DfE spokesperson said: “We have provided schools with the materials that will give them the confidence to construct a curriculum that reflects diversity of views and backgrounds, including how to offer a balanced presentation of opposing views where political issues are brought to the attention of pupils. “We are clear that schools should not under any circumstances work with external agencies that take or promote extreme positions or use materials produced by such agencies and have set out a non-exclusive list of extreme political positions in the guidance. “We are reviewing wording of the guidance to explore where we can provide further clarity on these points.”",education
"My dad, Michael Richardson, a nationally prominent figure in the field of lifelong learning, has died at the age of 81. Mike began work within the education setting at Alfreton Hall Adult Community Education Centre run by Derby county council. He joined the Open University in 1970 and was based at Newcastle and then Manchester. After 21 years he was appointed pro-vice-chancellor of the OU, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1994. Throughout his time at the OU, Mike was hugely humbled by the stories of countless people who sacrificed so much to continue their learning as adults. In 1990 he was appointed the director of the Board of Extramural Studies at Cambridge University (now the Institute of Continuing Education), based at Madingley Hall, and the family moved to Cambridge where my parents perfected the art of punting on the Cam. At Madingley, Mike was instrumental in moving the continuing education programme into a recognised credit framework, raising the status of Cambridge’s provision. He oversaw the completion of a major building project to provide better facilities for residential learners. He was born in Aurangabad, Maharashtra State, in India, to Emery Richardson, a missionary and vicar, and Margaret (nee Elliott), a teacher and “vicar’s wife”, and had a sister, Ann. After attending Pocklington school in Yorkshire, he went into national service as an officer cadet in Cheshire. He studied theology at St John’s College, Cambridge, where, through his sister, he met Gillian Jones, who was at Girton College. They married in 1965. A highly regarded member of the wider academic community, Mike was a fellow of Wolfson from 1991 to 2003 and emeritus fellow from retirement. He was secretary of the Universities Association for Lifelong Learning (formerly the Universities Association for Continuing Education) from 1998 to 2002, a time when there were many challenges facing the adult education sector. He retired in 2003 and the following year he and Mum moved back to Corbridge, Northumberland, where they had lived from 1970 until circa 1978. There, Dad became a well-known member of the Rotary Club. He found the years following Mum’s death in 2015 very difficult. After a stroke in 2019 he was determined to live an independent life at home. The restrictions of the past months made him feel very isolated, but he remained in regular contact with his family and friends. He received a huge amount of practical and emotional support from the Corbridge community, which gave him care and companionship. Known for his integrity, tenacity and desire to make a change for good in people’s lives, Dad was a modest, approachable, generous gentleman who touched the lives of many people and inspired countless others.

"Schools should be allowed to remain closed for the first two weeks of next term, the UK’s biggest teaching union has said, as a leading scientist warned of early signs that a new Covid strain may infect children “slightly more effectively” than previous variants. The National Education Union (NEU) called for online lessons to replace in-person teaching for all but vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers in England’s schools, so that children can be tested. Prof Neil Ferguson, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said preliminary data hinted that the variant could more effectively infect children, though causality had not been established. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ferguson, whose modelling led to the first UK lockdown, said: “I think what we’ll see in the next two weeks, while schools are still closed, is probably all the variants of the virus in circulation declining, but we’ll be tracking very carefully whether we can see differences in that rate of decline.” Prof Wendy Barclay, another Nervtag member, explained how the mutations on the variant’s spike protein – the part of the virus that allows it to infiltrate cells in the lungs, throat and nasal cavity by interacting with a receptor called ACE-2 – could explain the potential link in children. “The previous virus had a harder time finding ACE-2 and getting into cells, and therefore adults who have abundant ACE-2 in their nose and throat were easy targets and children were difficult to infect,” she said.  “The newer virus has an easier time doing all of that and therefore children are equally susceptible, perhaps, to this virus as adults … It’s not because the virus is specifically targeting them, but it’s just that it’s now less inhibited.” Many secondary pupils in England face a staggered return to class from 4 January to accommodate mass testing in an effort to address the high number of cases among children. The latest data from the Office of National Statistics showed that the Covid positivity rate in England was highest among school-aged children. Data on the new variant’s spread across all age groups suggests it has a growth rate of up to 71% higher than other strains. Based on modelling that incorporated genomic data and results of positive tests, scientists on Monday said they had “high confidence” that the variant appeared to be more transmissible, though causation is unclear. There is no evidence the variant makes Covid more severe or undermines the effectiveness of vaccines, though monitoring is ongoing. Scientists interviewed by the Guardian suggested it was too early to reach conclusions on the variant’s transmissibility in children, particularly given factors such as underlying community infection rates partly due to laxer attitudes to social distancing. “We’ve got to be really careful not to speculate because there’s already a lot of speculation about this particular variant – there’s circumstantial evidence that it’s more infectious but there’s still a lot of work to be done,” said Prof Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London. Dr Muge Cevik, a member of Nervtag, said: “I think it’s not unsurprising that … if the variant is more transmissible, you would expect more transmission across all age groups … We need to have much more contact-tracing data to understand the relative effects of transmission among the children, so I think the data to analyse this is limited.” Cevik added that it was easier to detect infections in schools because there was more of an appetite for testing compared with sectors where there were economic consequences if workplaces closed down. Closing schools should be the last measure taken, if at all, the scientists argued. “It’s easy to start to think of this variant as a different virus, but no, it’s the same virus. And it’s transmitted in the same way,” said Pillay, suggesting that the focus should be on supporting schools to operate safely. In an open letter to Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, the NEU said a two-week delay to in-person teaching should be used to begin vaccinating staff as well as NHS and care workers. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the NEU, said local directors of public health should spearhead mass testing. “We believe that the government could support them via a national advertising campaign to find the staff and volunteers needed, as you did in finding the volunteers to help the NHS at an earlier stage,” they said. “We would hope that such a system could then test all children, at their school site, prior to a return to in-person teaching from 18 January.”",education
"My former colleague John Friend, who has died aged 89, was a biochemist at Hull University, where he was head of the plant biology department from 1969 until his retirement some 30 years later. He was also a keen advocate for Judaism in the Hull area, encouraging local people to gain a better understanding of the religion into which he was born and committed to promoting interfaith understanding. John was born in Liverpool to Richard Friend, a draper, and his wife, Lilian (nee Jonas). At Liverpool Collegiate school he gained his A-level equivalents when only 16, so had to wait two years before attending Liverpool University, where he achieved a first in biochemistry, followed by a PhD. He then moved to Cambridge University to study the effects of low temperatures on plant pigments that contribute to photosynthesis and which give many fruits and vegetables their distinctive colours. This work, important for food transport and storage, gained John another PhD. I met him when he was appointed as a lecturer in botany at the University of Hull in 1960: I attended his first lecture there as a new undergraduate. John soon became a senior lecturer and then, in 1969, professor and head of the botany (later renamed plant biology) department. At Hull he continued his earlier research, together with new studies of how crop plants resist infection by pathogens, and his wider activities included becoming a signatory to the 1972 Blueprint for Survival, an early environmental manifesto. He also served as dean of science, then pro vice-chancellor (science) of the university. Visits to other biochemists around the globe took him to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, leading to a renewed interest in the teachings of Judaism. Being liberal-minded and not uncritical of Israeli politics, John believed in tolerance and the need to foster intercultural understanding through collaboration. He therefore became the first chair of the Hull Academic Study Group on Israel and the Middle East, organising academic exchange visits. After he retired, John became active in the Hull and East Riding Interfaith group, welcoming schoolchildren and students to the Hull Reform Synagogue and patiently answering questions with his characteristic quiet enthusiasm. He also chaired the local Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education. John was a gentle, cultured and compassionate man with an infectious sense of humour and an acute appreciation of life’s absurdities. He was a generous friend to many, and a dedicated family man. He is survived by his wife, Carol (nee Loofe), a former student counsellor at the University of Hull, whom he married in 1956, and their three children, Mark, Jenny and Richard.",education
"After months of insisting A-level and GCSE exams in England would go ahead, the government confirmed this week they would be cancelled, with Northern Ireland also cancelling exams on Wednesday night. This follows the precedent set by Wales and Scotland, which made the announcement months ago. The Guardian spoke to four school students about their reaction. In Sheffield, 16-year-old James Childs said that while he wanted to sit his GCSEs, making students take them as normal would have been unfair. Since he had returned to school in September, he had been required to self-isolate three times, missing six weeks of in-person learning, whereas some students had not had to isolate at all. “I don’t think that being at home is the same as being at school, because you miss out on class discussions and the sharing of ideas, it’s not the same when it’s a Powerpoint and a worksheet,” he said. “Really, there’s no way exams could go ahead, because it wouldn’t be a level playing field. I know some kids who haven’t isolated once, and others who’ve had to isolate for every [coronavirus] case in our year group. It just wouldn’t be fair.” Childs felt frustrated about the government’s communication over exams. “From September, the government kept insisting they wouldn’t cancel exams, then with the announcement on Monday, they said that exams couldn’t go ahead but that there would be alternative arrangements,” he said. “But, you think, what is that alternative arrangement? You shouldn’t have done that until you’ve got a concrete plan.” Grace Leaman, who is studying A-levels in history, English literature and philosophy in Dover, said she would have preferred to sit her exams, as they were the most fair and accurate method of assessing students. “People tend not to work as well throughout the year,” Leaman, 18, said. “They aren’t as motivated, or they have other things to do like university applications. There’s a different mindset during the end-of-year exams, because you know that those exams will get you into uni.” Leaman felt the government had not truly understood the impact their handling of exams had had on students. “Last year, the issues with the algorithm [which under-marked many students], showed the government didn’t trust the opinions of teachers who had been teaching students throughout the year,” she said. “I understand the government have to deal with it somehow, but I don’t think they realised how heartbroken people were, and how anxious they’ve been through the pandemic to get the grades they deserve. “I do worry that the most disadvantaged students will miss out on fair grades,” she added, “because of their teachers underestimating their ability through centre-assessed grades, or another classist algorithm which forgets the humanity of a child and reduces them to a letter which does not represent their true ability.” For 19-year-old Omer, also from Sheffield, the news was deeply disappointing, and he worried it could have serious implications for his future career as hecould no longer resit an exam to achieve the grades he would need. “I was studying for my A-levels last year, but I didn’t get the grades I wanted to do nursing, so I thought I’d resit my A-level biology this year,” he said. “I had a mock exam coming up in a few weeks, but that got cancelled, so now they don’t have anything to use for my centre-assessed grades.” Omer said it felt like “another year has been wasted”. “I prepared for it [the exam] really, really well,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do now. I’ve got my grades from last year, but I wanted to improve them and do a course I really wanted to do. It’s really frustrating and stressful.” Max Hamilton, a 17-year-old student taking A-levels in English literature, history, and sociology in Cambridgeshire, described the cancellation of exams as “too little, too late”. “The lack of clarity given to students who are sitting exams in summer is honestly astounding,” he said. “Throughout all lockdowns, students have lacked effective communication with the government and have been treated almost as an afterthought. “The past two years have been extremely strenuous for students, due to uncertainty and having to adapt to remote learning both in lockdown and while self-isolating. It’s been very stressful. Even over the Christmas holidays, I haven’t been able to focus properly because of all the stress.” While Hamilton was concerned about the implications of personal opinion or bias in teacher-assessed grades, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds or people of colour, he was relieved exams would not be going ahead. “I’m thankful that the government has finally listened to reason and closed schools, which will hopefully prevent thousands of potential cases and deaths as a result of transmission between students and vulnerable people,” he said. “I’ll miss the opportunity to show my talent, but you can’t show your talent if you don’t know the content.”",education
"The week of chaos in England’s schools deepened on Wednesday after education secretary Gavin Williamson was unable to explain how students will be awarded exam grades this summer and threatened teachers with inspections. The confusion came as heads around the country reported primary schools being inundated with children despite the national lockdown, and urged parents to be honestabout whether they are really key workers and need the emergency provision. Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Williamson said it was “time to trust teachers, not algorithms”, and that school-based assessments would be used to award GCSE and A-level grades to avoid a repeat of last year’s exam disaster. But in the same breath, Williamson urged parents to report teachers they thought were failing to meet the government’s new targets for three to five hours of remote learning each day, and said inspectors from Ofsted would be called in to investigate their complaints. School leaders were left frustrated by the lack of support or detail in the statement over how to prepare staff and students for assessing A-level, GCSE and BTec grades, coming after Boris Johnson admitted schools could have to continue remote teaching beyond February. “It is frustrating that there is not an off-the-shelf plan B ready to go. We have repeatedly called on the government and the regulator to prepare such a plan in the event of exams being cancelled, and have repeatedly offered to work with them in doing so,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. “However, ministers have been so busy insisting that exams will take place that they have failed to ensure that there is a contingency system which can be immediately rolled out. This is, frankly, a dereliction of duty.” Schools across England yesterday reported a huge rise in demand for places for the children of key workers, with one primary in Manchester saying that the numbers attending had now risen from 30 pupils during the first lockdown in March to more than 200, out of 500 on its roll. The increase has been partly driven by new guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) widening the expansion of “critical workers” to include university staff and other professions, while the DfE has also allowed pupils without access to digital devices or adequate study space at home to choose to attend school. University employers in centres including Oxford, London and Nottingham have written to staff this week to highlight their children’s eligibility for school places, including among parents working from home. Among those encouraged to attend in-person are children classed as vulnerable by the government, with school intended as an important place of safety. Alternative provision and special needs schools are also remaining open. Williamson’s statement gave schools little hint of how they will be expected to assess grades, claiming that “the department and Ofqual had already worked up a range of contingency options”, but that “the details will need to be fine-tuned in consultation with Ofqual, the exam boards and teaching representatives”. Government sources say one option being considered would resemble the model being used by Wales, with school assessments “informed” by the sitting of formal assessments for core subjects such as maths and English.  In Wales, the assessments are to be produced and marked externally by the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) examination board. In answer to a question from an MP, Williamson did announce that Sats – national standardised tests taken by in years two and six at primary schools – would also be scrapped this year. That announcement caught school leaders by surprise, with some suggesting that Williamson had not intended to make it. The crush of pupils attending school in person has deepened the difficulties faced by teachers having to also provide remote instruction for those remaining at home. Williamson again surprised the profession by revealing a new mandatory requirement for “high quality” remote teaching of up to five hours a day depending on the age of the child. “If parents feel their child’s school is not providing suitable remote education they should first raise their concerns with the teacher or headteacher and, failing that, report the matter to Ofsted,” Williamson said. “Ofsted will inspect schools – of any grade – where it has serious concerns about the quality of remote education being provided.” But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the government was still failing to provide many schools with devices such as laptops to allow disadvantaged pupils to access remote learning, despite the pandemic being in its 10th month. “It is therefore nothing short of disgraceful that the government should choose today to start threatening schools about the quality of their remote learning offer,” Whiteman said.  “Schools are keeping going in the most extreme circumstances right now – support is needed to overcome the challenges they face, not threat or sanction. “The profession has predicted all the difficulties the government has failed to navigate schools through. I therefore appeal again to government to work alongside the profession constructively in place of threats and empty words.  “The announcements today do nothing to redress the damage the government has caused to children’s education.” Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, accused Williamson of leaving “chaos and confusion” in his wake, but the government’s press secretary Allegra Stratton insisted that Boris Johnson continues to support Williamson. “It’s a huge brief and the prime minister believes the education secretary is doing it to his utmost ability,” Stratton said. Asked whether the prime minister believes Williamson is the best person for the job, she replied: “Yes.”",education
"Pressure is mounting for universities in England to offer rent rebates and academic safety nets for students, as staff and students say they have been left in limbo while institutions await further instruction from the government after a last-minute change to the start of the spring term. The National Union of Students and the University and College Union, which represents staff, are urging universities to waive charges for the accommodation students are unable to use until face-to-face teaching resumes. For most students this is scheduled for when lockdown ends in mid-February, although the UCU, which tracked more than 50,000 Covid cases across campuses last term, is pressuring universities to remain online until Easter. Some universities have already committed to moving teaching online longer term. The London School of Economics (LSE) has informed students that all compulsory teaching, learning and assessments will be online for the remainder of the academic year. Halls of residence and some parts of the LSE campus will remain open, including limited access to the library. Its management said it hoped to provide voluntary in-person teaching from mid-February, depending on the progress of the pandemic. LSE’s director, Minouche Shafik, said: “We have made these decisions with a heavy heart … We appreciate that students and staff valued face-to-face teaching in Michaelmas term, which was successful due to us all working together. However, the safety of our community is paramount.” University College London has told its students to avoid returning to campus until the end of February, with studies online until at least 22 February. The University of York has moved all teaching online for the entire spring term, but specialist teaching in labs and performance spaces may go ahead in person later in the term if government guidance permits. Financial support for students is patchy across universities. Some, such as Newcastle, have said no students will pay rent for the halls it operates until they return to campus. Universities where there has been pressure from student activists withholding rent as part of a growing wave of rent strikes, including Bristol and Manchester, have introduced 30% discounts on rent until face-to-face teaching resumes. Other universities have no plans for rebates at present. Lancaster is instead offering some hardship bursaries, while Middlesex is considering requests on a case-by-case basis. Student Roost, which runs private halls across the UK, is also not offering rebates, although this is under review. The NUS is also asking universities to reinstate “no detriment” policies, which provide a safety net for students from achieving below the average of their earlier grades due to disruption of their education. This demand has been echoed by thousands of students at universities across the UK, including Nottingham, Edinburgh, UCL and Exeter, who have signed open letters. Many universities are awaiting government guidance before taking final decisions on the compensation and adjustments to offer their students. The Department for Education does not yet have a publication date for this and has not outlined what it will contain. This guidance will also not apply to the majority of students who live in private rented accommodation. A parliamentary petition asking that students in England be allowed to leave their accommodation contracts early due to Covid-19, which would replicate law in Scotland, has gained more than 50,000 signatures. Matthew Robinson, a third-year student at Liverpool who signed the petition, said the student-focused letting agency that runs his property contacted him by email after the government’s announcement. “They preemptively told us all they wouldn’t be giving rent rebates because the property was still ‘available for use’, which when we’re not allowed by law to return I find questionable,” he said. Students are also stepping up grassroots campaigns for fee discounts. A parliamentary petition asking that fees be reduced from £9,250 to £3,000 has gained nearly 350,000 signatures. On 5 January, the Open University trended on Twitter as students turned to social media to complain that their degrees were now more comparable with its online courses, which cost £6,192 annually. Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president, said: “As a result of [the government’s] incompetence students and the higher education sector are left scrambling for answers and guidance. Students urgently need the certainty that, having lost out on so much, they will now receive proper support on everything from housing to exams, to mental health.” Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said: “Yet again, ministers have failed to prioritise education, and the chaotic way Boris Johnson has told institutions to move online has left staff and students in limbo. “The government needs to let students learn online until at least the end of this term, allow university students to be released from accommodation contracts if they wish, and provide staff and students with the resources to make sure everyone can study remotely and gets sufficient mental health support. “The government must also underwrite the sector against any lost income and any extra costs created due to these last-minute changes.”",education

"Secondary schools in England are unlikely to fully reopen until after mid-January at the earliest, according to new plans being thrashed out within government that would also see school staff be given high priority for Covid vaccinations. According to government sources, ministers are torn between heeding its scientific advisers over the rapid spread of the new Covid variant, and warnings from the Department for Education that switching to remote learning for the whole of January would make it hard for schools and colleges to reopen again before Easter, jeopardising summer exams. The revised timetable being discussed would see only older students who are taking exams, such as A-levels and GCSEs, receiving remote teaching for the week from 4 January, effectively giving most secondary pupils an extra week’s holiday while schools and colleges gear up to carry out mass testing. For the week beginning 11 January, those taking exams, mainly years 11 and 13, would be allowed back in the classroom while others were taught remotely, followed by all year groups returning in person from 18 January. Primary schools are unlikely to be affected, and would return according to their normal timetable. Vulnerable secondary-aged children and children of key workers would be able to return to school from 4 January, regardless of year group. Boris Johnson is said to be considering the proposals and the final decision is likely to be announced on Wednesday alongside the tier review for England and more data on the national infection rate. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We haven’t had any contact from the government since Christmas about whether or not the spring term will go ahead as planned, and it has been intensely frustrating that there has been a swirl of speculation with no clarity and with less than a week before term begins. “We are expecting to speak with the government shortly and we will be pressing for schools and colleges to be given clear guidance as soon as possible.” The government is also likely to reveal that school staff, including teachers, would be moved into a higher priority group to receive Covid vaccinations, but still below NHS workers and the most vulnerable groups. “We would very much welcome any plans to prioritise school and college staff for Covid vaccinations because they are being asked to go into an environment which is inherently busy and crowded,” Barton said. “Vaccinations would give them extra reassurance, reduce the need for staff to self-isolate, and mean less disruption.” The new timetable effectively pushes back the government’s plans for a staggered start by a further week compared with the plans it announced before Christmas. The DfE will also recommit to regular mass testing of asymptomatic school staff and secondary school and college students. The government is expecting secondary schools and colleges to recruit and organise volunteers to conduct testing, while those unable to do so will require 10-days self-isolation for staff and students before returning to school. The government has promised headteachers the assistance of 1,500 military personnel to prepare for the mass testing regime already announced. But with nearly 4,000 secondary schools and colleges in England, in most cases the direct help will be limited to phone and video calls. The debates within Whitehall were given fresh urgency after advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that the rate of infections could spiral out of control unless schools are closed for the whole of January. The new timetable supported by the DfE is seen as treading a fine line between extended school closures, which would imperil the sitting of GCSEs and other exams in summer, and the demands to tackle the spread of infection. But concerns remain over how parents and teachers will react to minimal closures, with fears that both groups could vote with their feet and stay away while the virus remains unchecked. The prime minister’s spokesman said on Tuesday: “We’re still planning for a staggered opening of schools and we’re working to ensure testing is in place. “But as we’ve said throughout the pandemic, we obviously keep all measures under constant review.” Pressed on whether all parents could be assured there would be no changes to the timetable next week, the spokesman insisted the government was “planning for a staggered opening of schools” but reasserted that all measures were under review. Asked if there were any plans for education staff to be prioritised for the vaccine after teaching union leaders called for them to receive jabs alongside health workers, the spokesman said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had clearly set out the first phase of those who should receive the vaccine. “We’ve always been clear that we need to ensure that we provide the vaccine to those who are seen to be the most clinically vulnerable and that’s what we’re doing,” he added. Labour called on the government to publish in full the advice it had received from Sage, saying it was “completely unacceptable” that the scientific advice had only appeared in leaks to the media. “The government has lost control of the virus and children’s education is suffering as a result. It’s time for the prime minister to own his mistakes and be honest about whether students can return to schools and colleges in a week’s time,” said Kate Green, the shadow education secretary,",education
"More than half of university students (52%) have become more politicised as a result of the pandemic, a survey suggests, as grassroot rent strike groups continue to gain support from undergraduates over the festive period. The poll, conducted by the National Union of Students (NUS), also found that almost two-thirds (63%) of the 4,193 respondents did not believe the government was acting in their best interests. Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president, said ministers’ failings were “politicising a generation” and prompting students to withhold rent payments across the country as anger mounts over online teaching and residency conditions. “Whether it be the A-levels fiasco, the masses of student lockdowns or the financial exploitation students are facing, we are fed up and acutely aware that the problems arising are indicative of foundational flaws in our education system that this government has failed to reckon with,” she said. In the largest wave of university rent strikes in four decades, at least 20 institutions, including Oxford and Edinburgh, will see students withhold accommodation payments when they return in January. Many activists were galvanised by the success of University of Manchester rent strike campaigners, who were told last month all students would receive a 30% cut in rent – about £4m in total – for the first half of the academic year. The group, whose action culminated in 15 students occupying university building Owens Park, say students are increasingly disillusioned with the institution’s leadership. Hannah Virgo, one of its organisers, said: “The university’s handling of the pandemic has made it clear to students that their primary motivation is profit. I personally have definitely lost my respect for the Russell group. The overwhelming support we got as tower occupiers and as rent strikers show that this is felt across the student body.” “Over the Christmas holiday the rent strike movement is only growing. We are helping local activists to organise in campuses across the country, and are planning to rent strike in January to get more compensation for the second half of the academic year.” The NUS poll, which was carried out last month, also found 65% of students did not agree the government has adequately considered the difficulties that students may face. Hall lockdowns, the prospect of paying for empty rooms while at home and little face-to-face teaching times were some of the main reasons behind the growing frustration. A Department for Education spokesman said: “We understand this has been a very difficult time for students, which is why we have prioritised their education and wellbeing from the start of this pandemic, supporting universities to provide a blend of online and in-person learning in a Covid-secure way. “The government has recently announced up to £20m to help students most in need of support in these exceptional circumstances, in addition to work with the Office for Students to enable universities to draw upon existing funding of £256m to help those facing financial hardship. “We also worked closely with the Office for Students, providing up to £3m to fund the mental health platform, Student Space, which is designed to work alongside university and NHS services.”",education
"School leaders have demanded urgent clarity about the government’s flagship mass-testing strategy for schools after the UK’s medicines regulator said daily coronavirus testing should not be used as an alternative to self-isolation. Headteachers said they were alarmed after the Guardian revealed that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had not authorised the use of 30-minute lateral flow tests to allow students to remain in classrooms instead of sending whole “bubbles” home. The daily testing policy is at the heart of Boris Johnson’s £100bn “Operation Moonshot” strategy because it allows people who test negative to stay in school or work when they would otherwise have to self-isolate. However, the MHRA has expressed serious concerns about using the tests in this way and told the government on Tuesday it had not authorised them for this key purpose. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) claimed on Friday that the primary purpose of using rapid testing in schools was to find positive cases and that this did not require the MHRA’s approval, but that it was providing regulatory oversight. Ministers have repeatedly said the use of daily Covid-19 tests is critical to keeping children in education because it means those who test negative can remain in classrooms, instead of whole year groups having to self-isolate. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said last month: “Testing on this scale brings real benefits to education, it means more children, teachers and staff can stay in their classes in schools and colleges without the need to self-isolate.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “School leaders and staff are utterly tired of this endless confusion over lateral flow tests, alongside much else that has been landed on their plates during this crisis. “All they want is clarity about what is the right thing to do, and the reassurance that there is a sound scientific basis for what is proposed. What is obvious is that there are severe misgivings in many quarters about the use of lateral flow tests as an alternative to self-isolation for close contacts of positive cases. We call on the government to provide a clear and unequivocal statement on this matter.” The MHRA said on Friday that anyone who had been in close contact with a positive case who tests negative with a self-administered test should still self-isolate – undermining the core strategy to keep children in schools – but later said this did not apply to schools. The regulator said it was not required to authorise the daily tests used in schools because they were supervised by a trained person, usually a teacher. There was confusion and anger among headteachers, including those in secondary schools where daily testing was introduced last week. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said the government had “serious questions to answer” about its schools testing policy. “The suggestion that the MHRA have not approved these tests to be used as an alternative to self-isolation is alarming, as that is precisely what the government are suggesting schools should do as part of their testing strategy. The government also needs to urgently explain why it took such an approach if the MHRA approval was not in place,” he said. The use of the lateral flow tests, which take up to 30 minutes to produce a result, has divided experts. Some say they should be welcomed because they can quickly and cheaply identify infected people that would otherwise not have been identified. But others point to their low accuracy and say they risk doing more harm than good, especially when used in the way proposed by government, which is centred on keeping children in schools. The Labour MP Maria Eagle said she had written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to explain the “safety and lawfulness” of the daily testing policy, amid concerns about a sharp rise in cases at a Jaguar Land Rover site in Merseyside that has been carrying out rapid testing of workers. Prof Jon Deeks, a biostatistician of the University of Birmingham, said: “It’s clear that the regulator has agreed this is not a safe way of using these tests. We urgently need clarity from the government about what their mass-testing plans are for the future. It’s important for schools, teachers and children to know what the position is.” The government has spent at least £1.5bn on the lateral flow devices and they have been used by universities, care homes and hospitals. Ministers announced this week they would be distributed to all 317 local authorities in England. A senior MHRA official confirmed its position in an email seen by the Guardian on Friday. The official wrote on 29 December that its approval “ONLY allows for the test to be used to ‘find’ positive cases. MHRA HAVE NOT approved the test for use in a ‘test to enable’ scenario” – such as allowing those who test negative to remain in school or the workplace. The email added: “Any other use of the kit is outside of MHRA’s remit and at the manufacturer’s own risk. We are therefore unable to comment any further on this matter.” A Department for Education spokesman said: “Daily testing of close contacts as a replacement for self-isolation is only possible on test sites in secondary schools and colleges, where a trained member of staff oversees the testing. The MHRA themselves have made clear that they do not need to authorise this programme. “We continue to evaluate this programme to make sure it is delivering on its aim of keeping students in education while reducing transmission across the community.”",education
"The number of children starting school without basic skills such as being able to go to the toilet unaided, put on a coat or respond to questions is at record levels because of nursery closures, according to research. Experts say further closures could widen gaps in school readiness between children from rich and poor backgrounds. Research commissioned by Kindred2, a charitable foundation working to improve early education and child development, found that a record proportion of children were starting school without basic skills. Nearly half (46%) of children who started reception class in 2020 were not “school ready”, compared with 35% in 2019, a survey of more than 500 British primary schools found. Less time spent at nursery due to lockdown restrictions was the key reason for this decline, teachers said. Unlike primary schools, nurseries and childminders in England are now open to all children. There is mounting pressure on the government to introduce further restrictions to contain the pandemic, and a recent Observer poll found 61% of people were in favour of shutting nurseries. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has also flagged nurseries as an area where restrictions could be tightened.  Helen Dodd, a professor of child psychology at the University of Reading, said: “We need to accept that this year’s intake of children and next year’s – particularly if nurseries close – may be a bit behind where they would be otherwise. We need to give children the chance to, in their own time, get to where they need to be. And we also need to allow schools the space to give the children space.” Research interviews with 208 registered early years providers conducted by Ofsted highlighted lapses in children’s personal, social and emotional development as a result of the first national lockdown. “Many children were more anxious and had struggled when they first returned to the setting, finding it difficult to separate from their parents,” inspectors said. “Some children were less confident with others and slower to join in. Others returned using nappies, comforters and dummies at an older age than providers would usually expect.” However, not all children suffered equally, and those whose parents were available to spend quality time with them often thrived, Ofsted found. Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez, of Oxford Brookes University, who is leading a study of more than 500 families with nursery-aged children to better understand how lockdowns and social distancing affect their development, said: “A key purpose of nurseries is that they provide high-quality education and enriching activities which improve children’s cognitive and social-emotional outcomes.” Preliminary results of her research suggest that children whose parents were available to do enriching activities such as reading, arts and crafts or gardening with them during lockdown showed a growth in their vocabularies and cognitive skills associated with mental flexibility and self-control, which was less evident in those who spent less time doing such activities. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to fall into the latter category and also more had higher daily screen use. One reason may that they had less access to resources such as age-appropriate books and private gardens. “This pandemic is widening the deep inequalities that already exist in children’s early experiences and life chances,” Gonzalez-Gomez said.  If nurseries were to close now, such children could face an additional disadvantage, because getting outdoors to play games or investigate nature required access to warm, weatherproof clothing, which may be unaffordable for some, she said. Dodd has conducted extensive interviews with the parents of two- to four-year-olds to understand the impact of the pandemic on families’ mental health. “We found that children’s emotional problems stayed the same, and behaviour problems actually reduced very slightly, which is probably due to fewer tantrums about putting shoes on and getting out of the house in time in the mornings,” she said. However, 73% of parents reported feeling they were unable to fully meet the needs of both their work and their child, and 53% were very worried that they were not doing enough for their child. If nurseries do close, being conscious of what young children are most missing out on will be important, Dodd added. The biggest factor is social contact. Nurseries allow children to learn about friendships, sharing and collaborative play. So if they close then continuing to allow families to form a childcare bubble with another family will be important, said Dodd. Childcare bubbles also take some of the pressure off working parents, giving them some space to get work done and reducing stress. Although children may need time to catch up on missed play opportunities and develop the skills needed to succeed at school, Dodd is confident that most will do so eventually. “Children should be with other children. But also, children are resilient, so they probably will be OK.”",education
"After the government decided to announce a new lockdown in England and close schools to most pupils, parents have been juggling working and home schooling once more. From practical issues such as broadband and printing, to concerns surrounding mental health, four parents spoke about how they have been coping this last week. “Yesterday and today I mainly battled a migraine brought on by the sheer anxiety of trying to juggle a full time role with a child at home for the next six weeks at least,” said Esther Dusabe-Richards, a 39-year-old academic who lives in Leeds, and has twins, aged two, in nursery, and a five-year-old daughter in primary school. Dusabe-Richards said her school has asked parents to send in evidence of home working every three days, which she said was well-intentioned but came across as “punitive”. It is sending about 10 worksheets a day, although pupils don’t have to complete everything, and the school doesn’t offer online learning because of safeguarding policies. “When Gavin Williamson said kids needed three to five hours of home schooling each day, for parents of five-year-olds, it essentially means you have to teach them,” she said. “To expect that of parents is laughable, even if they aren’t working. We’re not trained as teachers.” “The rhetoric needs to be: we’re in a huge crisis, let’s forget about targets and support one another. I have an incredibly supportive line manager, but if I stop and think about everything I’ve got to do today, I would just keel over.” In London, Roger Mortimer, who owns a marketing company and his wife who works in publishing are working late into the evening to compensate for the time lost to teaching their five- and nine-year-old sons through the day. “It’s difficult, I’ve had Zoom calls with the kids wandering in as I talk to clients. I’ve definitely lost sales because of the kids, but it’s not their fault, I just have to have a massive sign on the door saying, ‘don’t come in’,” he said. “At the start of the day, my wife and I work out which calls we’ve got and whether they overlap, otherwise we just tag team.” Despite the difficulties, Mortimer said he felt better prepared for home schooling than he did during the first lockdown. “The first lockdown was a nightmare. We were pretty much left to figure it out ourselves, no Zoom classes, just weekly packs of schoolwork to complete that was never marked. I’m still amazed I still have a job and marriage,” he said. “This lockdown, admittedly still in the first week, seems much more organised. The days are structured and the boys respond to that so much better than the ad hoc chaos of the first lockdown. As parents we’re better prepared and have a better understanding of any gaps in our kids’ education.” For other parents, the expectations of online learning were impossible to meet. In the seven years recently unemployed mother, Victoria Pattinson, 38, has lived in her home in North Lincolnshire, she has tried several broadband providers but has always had poor quality, which has made online teaching almost impossible. The costs of ink cartridges for her printer were also becoming “utterly untenable”. Instead, Pattinson is teaching her twins, in year 1 at school, her own programme of reading, writing and maths in the mornings, with creative activities and supplementary themed work in the afternoon. She said the school have made “snippy” comments, requesting that the family attempt the work set by the school. “If I were to try and do the school set work, the stress levels in the house through battling the connection, formatting and printing issues would go through the roof. We’re stressed enough as it is without being expected to be PGCE level teachers to our children,” she said. Emma*, a 39-year-old mother of three primary school children in Yorkshire, has been forced to suspend her master’s degree as a result of home schooling demands, less than two months before she was due to complete it. “I’m wrestling with the schooling during the day and trying to work in the evenings, but I can’t concentrate with them around me and I start snapping. It’s not fair on them,” she said. “As long as I finish my dissertation by May, I can graduate this year, but I’ve got no certainty about when the children are going to go back. I’ve spent this week applying for two jobs which I had hoped to start in February after I finished my course, but I can’t work out how I can start a new job and finish a masters.”  “I have nothing left of myself to give this time. I feel like I’m stuck. I’ve paid money to do my masters, and I can’t get an income from it.”  As a result of the pressures of home schooling, and having to suspend her studies, Emma’s mental health is suffering. “My last resort is to call my GP, and say, please get the kids into school because I genuinely can’t cope,” she said. “They’re not registered as vulnerable kids, but I will get to a point where I can’t do this for a huge amount of time. If I could just have one school day, 6 hours a week, to catch my breath, it might save us.”",education
"Twice as many mothers as fathers say they will have to take time off with no pay due to school closures or a sick child, according to a survey, raising further fears that the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic is falling disproportionately on women’s shoulders. According to the survey, carried out by a group of women’s organisations across the UK including Women’s Budget Group and the Fawcett Society, 15% of mothers said they had to take unpaid time off work, compared with 8% of fathers, while 57% of fathers said they would be able to work from home during school closures, compared with 49% of mothers. “With England now in lockdown and strong restrictions in the devolved nations, parents of school-age children working from home will be struggling once more to combine lesson supervision with paid work,” said Dr Mary Ann Stephenson, the director of Women’s Budget Group. “Mothers are more at risk of having to take time off on no pay when schools close.” At the end of October, there were 1.19 million women furloughed, compared with 1.14 million men, with women making up over 51% of those on the job retention scheme. But the gender disparity was much greater for young women, who made up 57% of furloughed under-18s and 53% of furloughed 18-24-year-olds, according to Guardian analysis. Among women aged 24 and under there were 196,800 jobs furloughed, compared with 172,400 for men of the same age, a difference of around 14%. Initial HMRC analysis also appears to show that women were more likely to be let go after the furlough scheme ended, with 91% of previously furloughed men back on their original payroll as of August, compared with 89% of women. Overall, around 10% of those formerly on the furlough scheme were no longer working for their employer at the end of August. A recent report from the Young Women’s Trust found that 1.5 million young women had lost income since the pandemic, 69% who claimed benefits did so for the first time, and 750,000 had to go to work despite fears for their safety. “Young women on low pay were already struggling to get by before the pandemic hit and since then many lost earnings because of furlough, redundancy or because they had to juggle precarious and insecure work with caring responsibilities,” said Abi Shapiro, the interim chief executive of Young Women’s Trust. Gemma Hirst, 25, was furloughed in March from the retail job she had worked in for six years. The store she worked in did not reopen, and in June she was offered just four hours a week in a different store despite having worked as a supervisor previously. Not able to survive on the hours, she had to go on universal credit for the first time. “When it comes to it, actually, you’re just a number, they don’t care about you at all,” said Hirst. The figures have raised fears that young women are at particular risk of having their economic futures and mental health blighted. Recent research from Agenda, which campaigns for women and girls at risk, found a quarter of young women were suffering symptoms of depression or anxiety, three times the rate of young males, and one in five young women with severe money problems had self-harmed in the past year. It raised concerns that young BAME women were particularly at risk. “Our concern is that we are creating a future mental health epidemic among young women,” said Jess Southgate, CEO of Agenda. A May report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL Institute of Education revealed that mothers in England were more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, and were only able to do only one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by men. The new Survation survey of 1,308 parents in the UK with children aged 14 and under found that parents with an annual household income of £20,000 or below were nine times more likely to say their jobs were at risk because of school closures than parents with an annual household income of £40,000 or above – with 9% of low-income parents reporting this compared with 1% of those earning over £40,000. Twelve per cent of parents earning below £20,000 a year and 13% of parents earning between £20,000 and £40,000 a year said they would have to take time off on no pay if schools closed or their children had to self-isolate, compared with 7% of parents earning more than £40,000 annually. The TUC has asked companies to “do the right thing” and allow staff to furlough for childcare, as well as offering the right to flexible working and 10 days’ paid parental leave a year. “Without further action, many will have no choice but to cut their hours or take unpaid leave from work. This will lead to further hardship and will hit mums and single parents hardest,” said the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady. Felicia Willow, the Fawcett Society’s interim chief executive, said that there had been positive developments since the introduction of the job retention scheme such as the right to take furlough for childcare reasons, as well as the ability for furlough to be shared between parents but said the government needed to urgently put in place a rescue package for the childcare sector and carry out an equality impact assessment. “But women remain on the sidelines of the government’s coronavirus response,” she said. “We urge the government to put women at the centre of its decision-making.”",education
"With much of the focus in recent weeks on schools, UK university students have reported feeling forgotten by the government, with no rebates offered on tuition fees and calls growing for rent refunds as many students are asked not to return to campuses. As they prepare to begin the second term, five students speak about their concerns.  “Last week, Boris Johnson didn’t address us in the press conference announcing the national lockdown in England at all. It shows he doesn’t really have any care or concern, especially for our mental health,” says Sophie Sengupta, a 19-year-old first-year student at the University of Liverpool. “There’s a real emphasis on schoolchildren at the moment, and I understand it’s hard on everyone, but they aren’t away from their families. They get to go home to their mum and dad and have that support. When you’re at uni, you’re on your own.”  Like many students who contacted the Guardian via a callout, Sengupta says her mental health was at “the lowest it’s ever been” during the first term. “What I’m concerned about now, and a lot of my peers feel the same, is that we’ve all got exams coming up in January, and we’re all feeling broken and defeated,” she says. “Gavin Williamson cancelled A-levels and GCSEs, but there was no mention of our exams in a few weeks.” “My mental health has been very poor,” says Alex*, a University of Exeter psychology student. “I have had numerous friends express their own increasing difficulties with depression and anxiety.” Moreover, Alex is concerned by how difficult it has been to access wellbeing services. “The university says that they are easily accessible but in reality making contact is difficult,” she says. “On one occasion I did try to call the team for some support, but the phone line was shut with a message to call emergency services if you were having a crisis and if not to email them to book an appointment.” She says the university has said marking will not be relaxed. “We are in the middle of a mental health crisis and no one is talking about it seriously; no serious action is being taken,” she says. Reece Lawson, 19, a first-year international politics student at the University of Liverpool, decided to return to the city in late December. “There were restrictions at home [in Northern Ireland] and I wanted to make sure I’d be able to get back over,” he says.  He feels “a little disappointed” by his university experience so far but says he did not consider staying at home as his university has not yet offered rent rebates. “It would just mean paying money to not be here.” With part-time work scarce, Lawson is one of many university students whose financial situation is increasingly dire. “It’s almost impossible to find a job either in Belfast or Liverpool due to the closure of bars, restaurants and retailers. If I was to leave university, I’d just be sitting at home with nothing to do. I feel I have no alternative options,” he says. “Fingers crossed, this lockdown will end in February or March and I’ll be able to get a hospitality job then. I do feel like I’m missing out on the full uni experience but hopefully by second or third year things will be back to normal.” Emily* is not returning to university in Dundee, where she is in her second year, until the course of the pandemic “changes dramatically”. For her, the main difficulty has been divisions with her housemates over coronavirus regulations. She says one housemate has been breaking public health rules to make regular trips to nearby cities, attend parties and have visitors over. “When I once spoke to her about going to one of these parties, she didn’t see the problem, saying that she left before the police turned up,” she says. “She also had one of her friends spend the weekend at ours, which I first found out when I found a stranger in our kitchen.” Emily has found online learning frustrating. “I was spending all day sat at a tiny desk, then moving to my bed a hand width behind me. By the time I finished my work it was dark outside and I didn’t feel safe going out for a walk,” she says. “Working from home isn’t ideal: the wifi isn’t perfect, and my family will interrupt me. It’s also frustrating knowing I won’t be able to see my friends from uni,” she says. “But all in all, being at my uni house is not worth the stress.” Mary-Grace Oludoyi, who studies law at the LSE, has found the workload difficult to manage without in-person learning and normal social activities to balance her time. Reduced student numbers meant she shared a flat with just two people and she was unable to invite anyone over. “That was really hard for me,” she says. “The main difficulty of it all was trying to deal with your own issues at home, settling in to uni, coping with your mental health, and on top of that, a crazy workload that can drown you. The workload made the isolation worse because you’d get up to do work all day and not speak to anyone. “Even stuff like who I will live with in second year is difficult,” she adds. “Do I know anyone well enough? I’ve only met them about three times.” *Some names have been changed.",education
"Primary schools in England have reported a big increase in the number of pupils attending during the latest lockdown, leading to warnings it may increase the spread of Covid-19 and prolong the need for school closures. A survey of school leaders and classroom teachers revealed a sharp turnaround in the numbers of children attending school this week compared with those who attended in March 2020 during the first national lockdown. The survey by the Teacher Tapp app found that one in six primary schools in England reported that 30% or more of their normal roll was attending in person this week, far more than in the first week of the March lockdown. Nationally the figures would equate to more than 2,500 primary schools in England with a third or more of their pupils in their classrooms. More than 300 of those schools said at least half of all their pupils attended in person. The figures are the first evidence that parents have been sending their children to school in increasing numbers. Headteachers have complained about their schools “rammed” with pupils and of parents making implausible claims of being eligible “critical workers”. One headteacher reported that a parent whose job was a dog-walker claimed to qualify as a key worker because many of the dogs’ owners were NHS staff. Rebecca Allen, a professor of education at the University of Brighton and chief analyst at Teacher Tapp, said: “The much higher number of children attending primary schools each day during this lockdown will make it more difficult to reduce the rate of transmission. “This, in turn, may mean that schools will need to stay closed for longer, thus delaying the speed with which we can get other children back to school.” While schools are closed to most pupils during the lockdown, many children are still eligible to attend, including those classed as vulnerable by the government because of special needs or social support, and children whose parents work in critical sectors, such as food distribution or national infrastructure. But the government has also expanded its offer of in-person school places in England to children who lack digital devices for remote learning and to those without quiet spaces or workplaces in their homes. Earlier this week, the Department for Education made it clear to school leaders that they could not limit places for the children of key workers, and that one parent’s status was enough for eligibility. In the March lockdown, 72% of primary schools had fewer than 10% of their pupils attending. This year, only 17% of primaries had below 10% attendance. The results were drawn from teachers at 1,600 primary schools surveyed this week and compared with the results of a similar snapshot from teachers at 2,000 schools conducted on 23 March last year. The results came as the ONS released figures showing a rapid spread in Covid-19 infections among school-age children. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “If the government is serious about having more children at school during this lockdown it should reduce bubbles and groups sizes to minimise transmission risks. “However, with current staff already fully engaged in providing remote learning to the children at home, reducing bubble sizes will require more staff. The government should demonstrate its commitment to our young people by mobilising supply staff, many of them currently furloughed or even without pay, for this task.”",education
"The flawed advice to schools last May on how to grade students when exams were cancelled because of the pandemic has been withdrawn from the government’s website and the damage it did consigned to history. But out in the real world there is no such magic wand for thousands of students still seeking justice after their grades were wrongly reduced. One is Harry-James Brioche, who lost a hard-won degree apprenticeship with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) that would have paid his university fees for four years, plus a salary to cover his living costs, and work placements and the chance of a job on graduation. Another is Helen Prior*, whose teachers at her Oxfordshire school thought she would achieve AAB based on her end-of-term tests and mock exams, but who lost her place to study pharmacy when her grades were unaccountably reduced to BDD. They are just two of 1,500 teenagers whose families have joined a Facebook group to campaign for justice for students whose schools closely followed the guidance of the exams regulator Ofqual, which then used a computer algorithm that wrongly graded about 40% of A-level candidates. The affected students attended schools and colleges that followed the advice of bodies, including ASCL, the headteachers’ union, that to comply with Ofqual’s guidance, they needed to alter their teacher-assessed grades to bring them in line with what students had achieved over the previous three years. Ofqual feared that teacher-assessed grades alone would be too optimistic, and designed an algorithm that took a school’s historic results into account in order to avoid national grade inflation. But while some schools lowered their teachers’ assessments – often against their better judgment – to bring them in line with previous years before submitting them as Cags (centre assessment grades) to Ofqual, other schools did not alter grades when they submitted their Cags, and instead left Ofqual to number-crunch. In the end this meant that some students suffered even more because their school had already lowered their grades before submitting them. Wind forward to August 2020 and, when it emerged that Ofqual’s algorithm to standardise the grades had not worked, the government ordered that students be given the choice of accepting the grades they were awarded by Ofqual’s system or using their schools’ Cags instead. Prior, who was downgraded from AAB to ABC when her school submitted its Cags, was horrified to find her grades further reduced by Ofqual’s algorithm to BDD. She believes its algorithm failed to pick up that the school had been rapidly improving under a new headteacher, attracting stronger students to its sixth form. When the government announced in August that students could choose their Cags instead, hers went up to ABC – still short of the ABB she needed to study pharmacy. On Friday, launching a consultation, Williamson confirmed that teacher assessment will be the prime method of setting grades this year and proposed that results be published in early July, allowing more time for appeals. But students let down last year say a better system is needed where students themselves can appeal, not have to rely on their school. Dennis Sherwood, an independent assessment consultant who has worked with Ofqual, says: “Ofqual kept insisting last year that its system had to be fair – the word was used 14 times in one of its statements – yet unfairness to individual students is still not being acknowledged or resolved. Trusting teachers is a good thing, but last year has shown that advice given to them can be unclear and subject to change, so it’s very important that this year’s candidates have a fair and timely appeals system.”  Brioche’s school, St Ambrose College in Altrincham, Cheshire, appealed to the exam board OCR for his computer science grade to be increased from the A submitted by the school to the A* they had originally assessed, sending a copy of the form filled in by his teacher, an OCR examiner in the subject, saying he would get an A*. It argued that it had entered only five candidates for the subject, and Ofqual admitted in August that its standardisation historical method had broken down and did not work at all with cohorts of five or fewer. But although Brioche’s grade was therefore based on faulty data, the appeal to OCR failed. “The centre’s approach to determining Cags is consistent with Ofqual’s guidance,” it ruled – referring to the same guidance that has since been withdrawn by the Department for Education. Brioche’s school decided against appealing the B grade it had submitted for his physics A-level because the number of students sitting the subject was larger, making it harder to prove that the historic data was misleading. “I’m very grateful for the school’s support,” says Brioche.  OCR said it was following the advice of the Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents examining bodies, which had advised that the fact a school had taken account previous years’ grades when calculating its Cags was not grounds for appeal. St Ambrose’s headteacher, Dermot Rainey, said he did not think it appropriate to comment. Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, has called for candidates to be able to use their teacher assessed grades if higher than their Cags. Williamson, however, has refused, telling the Commons education select committee last September that he feared “every school would decide that it had been too strict on their centre assessment grades and that you would have every school submitting again”. Barton says many schools and colleges were placed in a very difficult position last year. “They worked extremely hard to apply Ofqual’s methodology, only to find that the algorithm then proved a disaster and had to be abandoned. They then faced irate parents who felt their children’s grades had been pulled down unfairly and Ofqual turned down our requests to open up an avenue of appeal. We also requested that the government commission an independent review of exactly what went wrong with last year’s system, but that didn’t happen either. “We will look closely at details of how the teacher assessment system announced by the education secretary will operate this year, but it is obviously imperative in the light of last year’s disaster that the guidance to schools and colleges, and the system for moderation and appeals, is clear, logical, and demonstrably fair.”  All this will come too late for Brioche, who was accepted on the same computer science degree – but without the PwC apprenticeship for which he had been selected from more than 900 applicants. A spokeswoman for PwC said more students than expected had met its entry requirements. “Across the four tech degree programmes we have there were 110 places available. Due to the unusual circumstances and changes in grades, that meant more students were eligible compared to a normal year, so we extended this to accept 132. Unfortunately, some candidates didn’t achieve grades in either scenario,” she said. Brioche says he lost his place through no fault of his own. “I feel cheated. I worked so hard to make sure all my marks were A or A* in all my subjects throughout the year and then the grades were taken away and all the safety nets have failed me. It’s too late to change what happened to me and many other students, and it’s hard for me to speak publicly about it, but I just don’t want to see more students suffer from the same mistakes this year,” he says. His mother, Catherine Brioche, says: “My son and others like him worked hard and have done everything asked of them, and now they have lost trust in the system that let them down so badly. They have been cruelly cast aside. It must not happen again this year.” *The student’s name has been changed at her request",education

"Once again, Marcus Rashford has scored against the government, after Boris Johnson was forced to admit at prime minister’s questions that food parcels being sent to England’s poorest families were “appalling” and “an insult”. Keir Starmer attacked the prime minister for trying to dodge the blame, pointing out that the stingy-looking packages – pictures of which had been shared by Rashford, and by furious parents, on social media – appeared to reflect government guidance. But Johnson’s abject apology, which followed a hastily arranged phone call with the footballer, did mark a change of approach from last year.  No 10 had initially sought to brush off Rashford’s calls for free school meals provision to continue throughout the 2020 summer break, before changing its mind and setting up a voucher scheme.  Then in the autumn, the government again resisted a holiday voucher scheme – one backbencher, Brendan Clarke-Smith, even warned against “nationalising children” – before ministers caved in. This time, the Department for Education had dropped its “food parcel first” guidance by Wednesday afternoon, allowing families to use vouchers if they prefer, once the scheme is set up. Conservative insiders say the children’s minister, Vicky Ford, was involved in pushing for a swift response on the issue. And Johnson’s language suggested the Downing Street machine has learned a tangle with Rashford only has one outcome. But some of Johnson’s backbench troops despair that No 10 continues to be outflanked by the footballer – something they see as part of a pattern of flat-footed political management. On a call with Boris Johnson’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, on Tuesday, backbench Conservative MPs complained that No 10 remained too slow at rebuttals – and too vulnerable to elephant traps set by Labour. Throughout the pandemic, Starmer has repeatedly stolen a march on Johnson by pushing for moves the government’s scientific advisers have demanded. In a pattern that has become wearily familiar, Johnson instinctively hits back, before giving way to the inevitable a few days or weeks later. The clearest recent example was the prime minister’s attack on Starmer on 16 December for wanting to “cancel Christmas”, delivered in a tone of injured indignation, before Johnson announced last-minute changes to the festive mixing rules three days later. This about-turn, and the more recent one on schools reopening, came more than a month after Stratton’s arrival and the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, who were often blamed for Johnson’s pugnacious style. There have been modest signs in recent weeks that the prime minister is picking fewer fights, and trying to restrain his irrepressible boosterism – urging caution about when the lockdown can be lifted, for example. But it is unclear as yet whether that is the result of a fresh approach to communications or the severity of the current phase of the pandemic. And no amount of fancy political footwork will help if the government is failing the public, in the way a slick campaign such as Rashford’s can relentlessly expose. Ultimately, the reason the government continues to be caught out over child food poverty is a more fundamental one: the fact that the threadbare social safety net means children are going hungry in the first place. Once housing costs are taken into account, the incomes of the poorest families were falling even before the pandemic hit. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says in its annual report on poverty on Wednesday, the squeeze on incomes was happening predominantly as the result of deliberate political decisions taken by Conservative governments to reduce the welfare bill – in particular, the 2016-20 benefits freeze. Rishi Sunak increased universal credit by £20 a week early in the pandemic, in an implicit admission that the payments had become too paltry to live on. The chancellor has not yet said whether that will remain in place from April, choosing instead in a recent Spectator interview to highlight the necessity of “hard choices” to tackle the deficit. With Rashford already on the warpath, extending the £20 a week increase looks all but inevitable; but the government will continue to remain vulnerable to the campaigning footballer’s attacks as long as there are parents in 21st-century Britain who cannot afford to feed their kids.",education
"Ministers are under pressure to overhaul the way in which free school meals are being provided to vulnerable children under the latest lockdown, after Marcus Rashford highlighted “woefully inadequate” food parcels estimated to be worth little more than £5. Food poverty campaigners, paediatricians and nutritionists called on the government to review its “food parcel first” approach to feeding disadvantaged families, after parents posted photographs on social media showing the apparently meagre contents of their food parcels. One was made up of a white loaf, a pack of sliced cheese, two potatoes, two carrots, two bananas, two mini Soreen bars, two tubes of Frubes, a tin of beans, a small bag of pasta and three apples. Commenting on the photograph, Bridget Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation said: “The variety of foods shown in this image is very limited, especially when it comes to fruit and vegetables and protein-rich foods. A balanced lunch for a child should provide some starchy foods, wholegrain where possible, at least one and ideally two or more portions of fruit and vegetables, some protein-rich foods like beans, eggs, fish or meat and some dairy foods or alternatives.” According to Twitter user Roadside Mum who posted the picture, the parcel was supposed to provide the equivalent of the two weeks’ worth of £15 free school meal vouchers provided to parents and carers in the first lockdown – or £30 worth of food. “I priced that like-for-like from Asda and it came to £5.22. Where’s the other £25,” she said. Chartwells, the school catering company that supplied the package, claimed the photograph showed five days of free lunches, not 10, and the charge for food, packing and distribution was £10.50 not £30, but added: “We are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.” A spokesperson said: “Our 10-day hampers typically include a wide variety of nutritious food items to support the provision of lunches for children.” The company announced late on Tuesday that it would be refunding the costs of any below-standard parcels, would contact schools to establish where any shortages may have occurred, and from next Monday would ensure food hampers reflect the additional £3.50 a week allocation per pupil receiving a food parcel at home. The children and families minister, Vicky Ford, said: “The photos being shared on social media today are completely unacceptable and do not reflect the high standard of free school meals we expect to be sent to children. “Chartwells has rightly apologised and admitted the parcel in question was not good enough. I met their managing director earlier today and he has assured me they have taken immediate action to stop further deliveries of poor-quality parcels. They will ensure schools affected are compensated and they will provide additional food to the eligible child in line with our increased funding.” Ford said the government will demand all caterers meet the standards set for high quality lunches, adding that they would set out further details on Wednesday. Footballer and campaigner Marcus Rashford, who forced the government into a U-turn on funding free school meals during the holidays, had earlier described the food parcels as unacceptable and demanded swift action, tweeting: “Something is going wrong and we need to fix it, quickly!” Department for Education (DfE) guidance issued last Friday actively encourages schools to provide parcels for children on free school meals. Although schools can also choose to issue food vouchers, the guidance says schools are “strongly encouraged” to adopt a “food parcel first approach”. Some schools have already opted out of providing parcels in favour of established local voucher schemes. Cllr Ed Davie, Lambeth council’s cabinet member for children and young people, said all 90 schools in the borough had chosen to keep the voucher system it adopted over the Christmas holidays, rather than use parcels. “We want families to have cash or vouchers because it is more dignified and affords them more choice in what food they buy,” Cllr Davie said. Labour has called for the government to restart the national food vouchers scheme, which operated during the first national lockdown. Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: “The images appearing online of woefully inadequate free school meal parcels are a disgrace. Where is the money going?” Other food parcel photos on social media included one posted by Lisa T, which included half a carrot, half a pepper and portions of food packed into small bank-style clear plastic bags. “It wasn’t nice, when you are already feeling at rock bottom to then be given this. But it was rectified very quickly by our school and for that I’m very grateful,” she tweeted.  Cook, food writer and anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe retweeted examples of hundreds of messages sent to her regarding the food parcels, using the hashtag #bringbackvouchers. Calling them “ill-thought through, meagre scraps” she compared the parcels with a voluminous spread of £20 worth of food bought at her local supermarket two months ago. “Have we had enough examples yet that they can’t say this is an isolated incident or do I need to keep going?!” she tweeted. There were calls for the system to be replaced by a “cash transfers” in which families were supported directly through payments made via child benefit or universal credit. Prof Greta Defeyter of Northumbria University, an expert in school food, said: “Cash first is the easiest and most effective route in ensuring families are supported with dignity, respect and freedom of choice.” The DfE guidance says there are “significant benefits” to offering food parcels, including “the confidence that a nutritious and varied range of food is being provided in line with guidance”. An added benefit, it says, is “the continuation of financial support to school caterers”. It says food parcel contents should be sufficient to “allow parents and carers to prepare simple and healthy lunches for their children across the week”.  A statement by LACA, the professional body for school meals providers, which helped draw up the DfE guidance, said: “[We are] disappointed to see the pictures of food parcels circulating on social media. They simply do not meet the standards.” ",education

"Members of the armed forces will be deployed to support coronavirus testing operations for thousands of school and college students in England, the government has announced. The Ministry of Defence said 1,500 military personnel would ensure testing systems were implemented by next Monday, when pupils are due to begin a staggered return for the new term. It said the majority of the personnel would form local response teams, providing support and phone advice to institutions needing guidance on the set up of testing facilities. Students will swab themselves in the vast majority of cases, under the supervision of a school staff member or volunteer trained for the role, while teachers are not expected to take a role in the testing process. The decision follows successful testing pilots conducted in schools in November and December. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “It is a true cross-government effort to make sure secondary schools and colleges have the support, guidance, materials and funding they need to offer rapid testing to their staff and students from the start of term. “I am grateful to the armed forces personnel, and all the school and college staff, leaders and volunteers working to put testing in place.” Any students who have been in contact with a positive case will be offered seven days of daily testing while teachers can have weekly Covid tests. However, at the end of the autumn term teaching unions described the testing scheme as “inoperable” and “undeliverable” and advised staff to refuse to work on the scheme over the Christmas break. A joint statement from all four major education unions, school governors and the Church of England, which runs about a quarter of the nation’s schools, accused the government of making a “chaotic and rushed” announcement on the final day of term. Year 11 and year 13 pupils who are preparing for their GCSE and A-levels are to be allowed to return to school next Monday along with those taking vocational qualifications that week, the children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters. Most secondary students will not be back in the classroom until 11 January and will be taught remotely. However, a split has emerged between ministers over whether the plans should go ahead after the government’s scientific advisers urged a delay to the start of the new term amid a surge in cases. The Department for Education has said the return to schools is being kept “under review”. Williamson is understood to be mounting a “rearguard action” against what one source described as “senior colleagues” who have been alarmed by advice that reopening schools will make it impossible to keep the R number below one. Williamson is expected to meet Downing Street officials to consider whether schools in tier 4 areas should remain closed until February.",education
"Music education in schools is facing an “unprecedented crisis” as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with singing, instrumental lessons, extracurricular activities and end-of-term concerts all badly hit, a new report says. There is “genuine cause for alarm” over the impact of the virus on music provision, says The Heart of the School is Missing report produced by the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM). “Beyond the intrinsic value of studying music for its own sake, there is a plethora of evidence that studying music builds cultural knowledge, creative skills and improves children’s health, wellbeing and wider educational attainment.” More than two-thirds (68%) of primary school teachers and more than a third (39%) of secondary school teachers reported a reduction in music provision as a direct result of the pandemic in a survey carried out by the ISM at the beginning of this academic year. Almost one in 10 primary and secondary schools are not teaching music as part of the curriculum at all. Some lessons “contained no practical music-making”, the report says. Singing has ended in more than a third (38%) of primary schools, and instrumental lessons have ceased in almost a quarter (23%). Extracurricular musical activities have been discontinued in nearly three-quarters (72%) of UK primaries and two-thirds (66%) of secondaries. Schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been hit harder than those in England. In addition, more than half (53%) of primaries and almost two-thirds (63%) of secondaries that normally hold a festive concert at the end of the first term of the academic year will not do so this year. “We cannot sing, and the children are hugely disappointed when they ask to sing and we tell them no,” one primary teacher told the ISM. Another said: “Due to staggered breaks/lunch and the need to constantly wash hands, the amount of time spent on music has been reduced.” A secondary teacher said: “Honestly, it’s impossible to state how devastating this will be in the long run for music as a subject. There is no provision at all for instrumental lessons, ensemble projects, bigger inclusive performances or even classroom ensemble work. This will, of course, harm students emotionally and academically.” The health and wellbeing of both children and music teachers had been affected by the changes to music provision, according to the report. “Music is central to the recovery curriculum, playing a vital role in schools helping their students to explore and express the varied emotions and challenges that they will have experienced during the pandemic, building stronger relationships and communities within schools and with families.” Almost all instrumental teachers (99%) reported that teaching had changed for them this year, with a third (35%) of primaries and just over a quarter (28%) of secondaries discontinuing instrumental lessons in person. One teacher told the ISM: “They [pupils] need instant feedback and guidance on their vocal pieces in order to build confidence and control in their voices and performance. It’s almost impossible to do this if they record and send it to me.” Deborah Annetts, the ISM’s chief executive, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised to discover that music provision is being reduced in our schools as a direct result of the pandemic, with opportunities for pupils to make and create music becoming severely limited both in and out of the classroom. “It is vital that every child can access a quality music education. Therefore there needs to be sustained and meaningful leadership across all levels of government, actively encouraging safe music teaching in schools and in the wider community. We need to see clear, timely and consistent guidance across all four nations for the rest of the 2020/21 academic year, and beyond, so that music education is not disrupted further.” The ISM surveyed more than 1,300 music teachers across the UK in September and early October this year.",education
"My mother, Sonia Hall, who has died aged 88, left her home in Sri Lanka in 1951 to study medicine in Britain, and lived in England for most of the rest of her life.  She was born in Colombo into the Bandaranaike family, which had held prominent positions in Sri Lankan politics and law. However, her father, Sammy Dias Bandaranaike, did not have a political life, and was an agricultural officer in the department of agriculture. Her Indo-Trinidadian mother, Esther (nee Ramkeesoon), was technically a housewife but in fact was formidable at running the Bandaranaike coconut and rubber estates that her husband had inherited. She was also the one who had the drive to get her three girls through school and into university. Sonia went to Bishops College boarding school in Colombo, and when the second world war broke out she and her two sisters continued their education in a temporary school 120 miles outside the capital, in Bandarawela. In 1951 she travelled to England to study medicine at Cambridge University, and after three years at Girton College and another three training at the Royal London hospital she graduated in 1957, after which she did one-year’s pre-registration as a houseman at the London hospital, specialising as a paediatrician. A brief return to Sri Lanka saw her practising paediatrics at Colombo Hospital, and it was there in 1959 that the then prime minister SWRD Bandaranaike was admitted after he was shot at his home. Sonia was his second cousin once removed, and was summoned to the ward where he was fighting for his life. “Do you think he’s going to survive?” his wife, Sirimavo, asked her. “I had absolutely no idea!” Sonia recounted to us. “What with the press of doctors and others all around him, I wasn’t even close enough to see him properly.” A short while after the assassination, Sirimavo led the Sri Lanka Freedom party to an election victory that made her the first female prime minister anywhere in the world. On Sonia’s return to England, in 1961 she married Digby Hall, a fellow doctor, and they moved to Edinburgh, by which time she had given up hospital work so that she could bring up their young family. Eventually, after a move to Woodbridge in Suffolk in 1969, she returned to medicine as a consultant haematologist and dermatologist at Ipswich hospital, staying there until she retired in 2006, aged 74. Sonia always enjoyed bright, inquisitive female company, and when she and her university contemporaries started one by one to reach 60 years of age, they hired cottages in the Cotswolds, Lake District and elsewhere, from which they would venture on walks as they swapped stories and explored the local area. When she couldn’t hook up with them, she treated her family members to trips to museums, exhibitions, lectures, concerts and the theatre, both at home and abroad. Digby died in 2009. She is survived by her four children, William, James, Mary and me.",education
"Vulnerable children expelled from mainstream schools are at risk of being “preyed upon” because of worryingly poor attendance at the specialist institutions tasked with teaching them, the chief inspector of schools in England has warned. Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, said that the vast majority of pupil referral units (PRUs) and other providers who accepted excluded children were able to turn around the life chances of their pupils. She said they should not be viewed as a passport to criminality, as they are sometimes portrayed. However, before the publication of Ofsted’s annual report this week, she warned that those educators had to do more to ensure that pupils were actually attending classes. The rate of truancy at many of the schools is raising concerns about what is happening to the children outside the classrooms about what is happening to the children outside the school gates, with growing evidence that vulnerable children are being targeted by “county lines” drug gangs. Ofsted’s analysis will show that in some PRUs and other “alternative provision” (AP) settings, pupils are only in class for a fraction of the week. The persistent absence rate is almost four times higher than in mainstream schools. The issue has been compounded by the Covid-19 outbreak, with estimates that only just over half of pupils are attending state-funded AP schools this term, compared with 78% attendance in mainstream secondaries. “Exclusion does not have to leave a young life on the scrapheap,” Spielman told the Observer. “Children who are permanently excluded deserve a good deal elsewhere that will help them overcome their challenges and give them a shot at a successful future. High quality AP and PRUs can and do turn young lives around. “But they cannot do what they do best if children aren’t in class. It is a sad fact that these children are often preyed upon. Getting children engaged and into the classroom is so important – for their safety and to help them make the right life choices.” She said that the reality of referral units and APs was often very different to the common perception that the institutions were steering children towards gangs and exploitation. She said more than 80% of registered state-funded providers were rated as good or better by Ofsted. Meanwhile there are also concerns about the levels of attendance at mainstream secondary schools. Teaching unions warned of a “collapse” in attendance after official figures showed that more than one in five pupils in England missed school two weeks ago. While attending classes for a few hours each week marks an improvement for some children who have been excluded from their previous school, Spielman said that expectations should be set higher for daily attendance at PRUs. She said the most successful settings for excluded pupils had shown impressive results. Harmonize Academy, an AP free school in Liverpool that works with children who have been excluded or are at risk of being excluded, improved pupils’ attendance by more than 20% on average when they joined – the equivalent of an extra day a week in school. Marie McConville, its principal, said that there was a common misconception about what excluded students could achieve. “As soon as you mention alternative provision, people think it’s just a little shed somewhere and the students doing the same thing every day, they’re not making any progress – that those students are certainly not attending and then getting involved with criminal activity and gangs,” she said. “It’s certainly not like that here. We offer many subjects and we’re in a nice school building. We have small classes with a maximum of nine per class, we have really outstanding teachers. Students are attending every day, achieving more qualifications than they would in mainstream education. “The attendance is really important here. I do agree with Amanda Spielman when she says attendance is crucial. We say to students that they need to be in school everyday in order to succeed. If a student is struggling to manage their anger, or dealing with suicidal thoughts or depression, or they have a lot of issues that they need to get through in order for them to be able to learn, they can see our clinical psychologist once a week. They get lots of additional support. We tell them that we are outstanding because they’re outstanding, and it may be the first time that they’ve had that recognition.”",education
"The government’s plan to test all students before they leave university was thrown into question on Sunday after the UK’s largest academic union raised “grave concerns” about the accuracy of the Covid-19 tests being used and warned that this week’s mass evacuation of students was a “recipe for chaos”. The University and College Union (UCU) also said that many students have already returned home without being tested and it expects some will decline to take the voluntary test, because they do not wish to self-isolate in their halls of residence. The union also stressed that not all universities have agreed to participate in the government’s mass asymptomatic testing scheme, which begins on Monday. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Saturday that only 130 higher education institutions in the UK - 79% - have expressed an interest in taking part in the testing scheme. It is understood that at least 35 institutions are either carrying out their own testing regime, or not testing students at all. The government is supplying universities with lateral flow tests, which can be self-administered by asymptomatic students and do not require laboratory processing, offering “rapid results within an hour”. However, these tests have been criticised by experts in the British Medical Journal as an “unevaluated, under designed and costly mess”, with particular concerns raised over infected people receiving false negative results. Government-backed assessments carried out by Public Health England’s Porton Down laboratory and the University of Oxford suggests the tests may miss as many as half of Covid-19 cases, depending on who is using them, and that they are unsuitable for a “test and release” strategy that will allow asymptomatic students to go home. The study found that the sensitivity of the test dropped from 79% to 58% when it was used by self-trained members of the public as opposed to laboratory scientists. In its guidance to students returning home, updated last Tuesday, the Department for Education admitted that the test would not detect all positive cases. “The flaws in government plans for mass testing are a recipe for chaos that risk spreading the virus – the very thing they are designed to prevent,” said Jo Grady, UCU general secretary. “We have grave concerns over how this programme will be carried out, particularly the risk of students being told – incorrectly – they do not have Covid, then relying on their test result to travel home and spend Christmas with vulnerable relatives. There are also questions to answer on whether staff responsible for administering the tests have received the medical training to evaluate them properly.” Students are being urged to take two tests, three days apart. All tests need to be completed by the end of term (9 December) and students who test positive will be expected to immediately self-isolate at their university accommodation for 10 days, along with contacts and members of their household. Those who test negative are being advised to return home “as soon as possible” after receiving their result: Exeter University, for example, is advising students to “aim to leave within 24 hours”. The student “travel window” – the period in which all students are being asked to travel home by the government – will run from 3 to 9 December, meaning that mass testing and the travel window will finish on the same day. UCU said many students do not yet know which days they will receive their tests, and that testing hundreds of thousands of people in such a small timeframe – while following social distancing rules – would be “extremely challenging”. ‘The government chose not to listen to us when we warned that the mass movement of students in September risked the nation’s safety, and it has ignored requests from its scientists, and UCU, to move learning online to help control the virus,” said Grady. “By choosing to continue with in-person learning until the last minute, ministers are gambling with the safety of staff, students and the nation, betting everything on an untested testing programme.” Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Over the past few weeks university staff across the UK have worked with the government at considerable pace to develop and roll out enhanced asymptomatic testing for students, as part of the next phase of pilots for the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in British history. As well as ensuring students can return home this Christmas, these pilots will enable vital lessons to be learned on the nationwide scaling up of asymptomatic testing that other industries and society as a whole will substantially benefit from.” A government spokesperson said: “We have set out tailored guidance to universities designed by public health professionals to enable students to return home for the Christmas holidays while minimising the risk of transmission. “The tests are safe, simple to use and do not require medically trained staff to administer them. Just like the tests available across our regional test sites, individuals will be asked to self-swab under guidance from trained staff.”",education
"Women who say they were raped and sexually harassed at the University of Warwick have accused the vice-chancellor, Stuart Croft, of failing to protect female students. Five women, including one who said she had been raped on campus, told the Guardian the university had not addressed the toxic culture exposed in 2018 when female students discovered they had been targeted by male peers in a “rape chat” group. Jane, not her real name, said she had been raped in March by a male flatmate who had previously denounced the behaviour of the students behind the sexually violent texts two years ago. The second-year student, who reported the assault to the police and the university, has since studied remotely because of concerns about her safety on campus. The 19-year-old, who wrote an open letter to the vice-chancellor about rape culture on campus, said he did not seem to recognise how prevalent sexual misconduct and assault were at the university. “He has a duty of care. So many students have to get mitigating circumstances or support to get them through the trauma of sexual assault, which has been having an impact on both my and fellow students’ degrees, which isn’t acceptable.” One first-year student said that when she submitted a report of sexual misconduct to the university “nothing was done to reprimand the assailant”. The 19-year-old added: “I was sharing a campus with a known assailant, and I still am, and there are likely plenty of others who go unreported. The university wasn’t able to give me any information, other than tell me that I could move if I felt uncomfortable. The rape culture at Warwick goes completely unaddressed by the student union and the university itself.” A petition calling on the university to address sexual violence has attracted more than 3,000 signatories. Its creator, the student Laila Baghdadi, said she wanted the university to know how many women felt endangered. “I’ve heard boys make rape jokes to their mates and even discussing how another boy was having sex with a girl and then took the condom off, and didn’t tell her until after,” she added. “They didn’t see anything wrong with that.” She and other female students want the university to introduce mandatory sexual consent workshops for all new students, hire more specialist support staff to help victims, and provide attack alarms and self-defence classes. Emilie Eisenberg, one of the organisers of a protest against sexual violence on campus last weekend that attracted hundreds of people, said she thought sexual violence was common on campus because perpetrators knew that some of the male students involved in the rape chat scandal of 2018 had been allowed to return to the university. She said this encouraged the belief that perpetrators could get away with assaults. “We’re not going to stop putting pressure on the university until they make some real change.” A Warwick confessions page on Instagram posted an open letter to the university and students’ union last week in which an anonymous student wrote: “I receive countless stories of girls being touched, raped and taken advantage of … I have both witnessed this many times and also been a victim of it since coming to the university. This cannot go on any longer.” Tasha Hardaker, vice-president of It Happens Here Warwick, a student society which supports survivors of sexual assault, said it received about 25 messages a month from female students who had experienced sexual harassment or assault. Hardaker said her drink had been spiked at a club on campus during freshers’ week last year and she had been found unconscious in a bathroom. She said she had been interviewed by security but they had not told her she could make a complaint. “They said they were investigating the incident but never got back to me,” she added. Warwick University said victims of sexual misconduct could make anonymous reports online or speak to an independent sexual violence adviser. A spokesman added: “We are horrified to hear of the incidents the survivors have raised. Where incidents do happen and are reported to us, we continue to take strong action against those who are found to have broken our policies. This may include their complete suspension or permanent expulsion from our university.”",education
"Graffiti demanding the resignation of the president of Imperial College London over bullying allegations has appeared on walls outside of her residence as the chair of the parliamentary education committee added his voice to calls for the release of a report into the claims. Unease has been growing among the student and the wider academic community after the university’s authorities refused to publish the findings of an investigation into “a dysfunctional culture and alleged bullying”, leading to further accusations of a cover-up. Allegations against Imperial’s “most senior staff” were followed by a disciplinary process involving some of the individuals who were subject to whistleblowing allegations, the university’s authorities said. While the content of the report compiled by Jane McNeill QC has not been made public, the disciplinary panel constituted by the university council has decided that the dismissal of Imperial’s president, Alice Gast, was not warranted. Apologies have been issued by Gast and Imperial’s chief financial officer, Muir Sanderson. The university has declined to say what they apologised for. Gast receives £554,000 a year in pay and benefits as Imperial’s president, a role she has likened to being its “chief executive”. The Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs of theeducation select committee, said the report should be published for transparency, “so that all those affected can be assured that proper action is being taken”. A university spokesperson for Sanderson said the CFO was “fully supportive of the changes that have been put in place as a result of this process, and … has offered full apologies to those people who were affected by his conduct”. Asked whether “conduct” was a reference to bullying, the spokesperson said: “We cannot clarify this as the report remains confidential.” One of the whistleblowers who gave evidence to the investigation said members of staff were still “living in fear” of Gast and Sanderson and felt “let down” by the university and its governing council. A spokesperson for Imperial said: “As the appointment of an independent QC and disciplinary panel in this case shows, we treat any reports of bullying with the utmost seriousness, and have processes in place to provide support and investigate any allegation thoroughly, whatever the seniority of those involved.” Student leaders at Imperial have expressed disappointment at the authorities for refusing to publish the findings in a redacted form to protect the identities of those who gave evidence. They were responding to a letter from John Allan, the council’s chair, and Prof Ian Walmsley, the university’s provost, which said the allegations “concerned a dysfunctional culture and alleged bullying of some staff members”. “Our policy is clear that zero tolerance means any complaints must not be ignored and will be thoroughly investigated. That’s exactly what happened,” the letter said. But a response from Abhijay Sood, the president of Imperial College’s student union, and other union trustees, said: “To us, zero tolerance implies severe consequences. At the most senior level, it is hard to imagine what this could entail other than removal from the organisation. “We are concerned that this dysfunction may now grow, as the perception of a light touch response might prejudice the ability of staff members to properly manage similar disciplinary cases when more junior staff members are accused of similar indiscretions.”",education
"Cambridge University’s vice-chancellor is being urged to re-invite the controversial Canadian professor Jordan Peterson to take up a fellowship in light of a vote allowing “tolerance” of differing views. An offer of a visiting fellowship for the self-styled “professor against political correctness” was rescinded last year after protests from faculty and students. The university’s policy now emphasises “tolerance” of differing views instead of being “respectful” of them. And another amendment, covering “platforming”, stresses that those invited to speak at the university “must not be stopped from doing so” as long as they remain within the law. The journalist Toby Young said he would be writing, as a director of the Free Speech Union, to Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, to ask for the invitation to Peterson to go ahead following Tope’s welcome of the vote this week as “an emphatic reaffirmation of free speech in our university”. A dozen members of the Free Speech Union were said by Young to have been among the academics on the university’s governing body, Regent House, who voted by an overwhelming majority (86.9%) in favour of the changes to the proposed freedom of speech policy. Initially the policy would have required Cambridge University staff, students and visitors to be “respectful” of differing views. This was overwhelmingly rejected in a vote by the university’s governing body. Though chalked up by some as victory for one side in ongoing “culture wars” around freedom of speech and identity, the issue is unlikely to be mirrored at other campuses due to the relative uniqueness of legislative powers at play at Cambridge and Oxford University. At other campuses, policies are largely top down. But Arif Ahmed, a reader in philosophy at Cambridge who led the move, said he believed it would now be less likely that people would try to have others “disinvited”. He said: “I hope it will also embolden people to invite others to events where they may have previously had concerns.” He cited the case of Selina Todd, an Oxford University professor whose invitation to speak at the Oxford International Women’s Festival was withdrawn. Todd said she was told by the event’s organisers that the decision was due to pressure from trans activists. “That would be the example of the kind of disinvitation that could not now happen, and I hope that societies would also be more comfortable about deciding to invite controversial speakers,” said Ahmed. He declined to comment on the issue around Peterson but said: “In general terms I think that showing a lack of respect through speech, writing or research for, say, religion, or climate change denial, should not be grounds for being disinvited.” Others at Cambridge have continued to offer a different view. Priyamvada Gopal, a professor of postcolonial studies, said: “A government-ordered regulation suppressing protest (under the guise of free speech) has been pushed through with enthusiasm by a large number of traditionalist (mostly) men.” Ted Tregear, a research fellow at Cambridge University who was previously branch secretary of a union for academic staff, said the policy had come about due to pressure from the Department for Education and Office of Students.While he did not support the original policy, he believed that the new wording “made it even worse” and had been used by some people to “to rehash a kind of moral panic about free speech”. “I am particularly disturbed personally by the notion that once you have invited someone then you can’t decide not to invite them,” he said, giving the hypothetical example of how conference organisers’ hands might be tied in cases where it emerged that an invited participant planned to use it as an exercise to air easily debunked, pseudo-scientific, racist positions. A spokesperson for the University and College Union (UCU), a union representing more than 120,000 academics and support staff, said: “Academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law is absolutely vital in any civilised society. “It is crucially important that our universities stand against any attempts to curb the freedom to challenge opinion and explore sensitive issues, including through protest.”",education
"An investigation into the free school meal voucher fiasco, which left many families without food during lockdown, has found the government signed contracts worth up to £425m with a company for which there was “limited evidence” of its capacity to deliver. The troubled scheme was set up in just 18 days and awarded to the French-owned company Edenred, despite the government’s own assessment that the company’s UK arm did not have the financial standing that would normally be required for the scale of contract, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO). The public spending watchdog said Edenred was appointed to run the scheme using an existing government framework contract, as it was already a supplier to a number of government departments, which meant there was no need for a lengthy tendering process. Within weeks, however, problems began to emerge, with schools across England complaining of problems in registering for the £15-per-child weekly vouchers. School staff worked into the night to try to log on to Edenred’s website and parents waited up to five days for their vouchers. At one point in April, the Edenred helpline was receiving almost 4,000 calls and nearly 9,000 emails a day from frustrated school staff and parents. At the height of the crisis, ministers were forced to intervene directly and Department for Education officials held daily calls with Edenred to monitor progress. One of the key problems identified in the NAO report was Edenred’s IT capacity, which was inadequate to meet the challenge of supplying vouchers to up to 1.4 million children who were eligible for free school meals. The report says performance improved following DfE intervention, with processing times for orders dropping from an average of five days in April to just hours in July, and waiting times to access the website falling from 42 minutes to virtually no wait over the same period. According to the report, Edenred issued 10.1m vouchers in total at a final cost to the DfE of £384m, significantly less than the original cost estimated at the start of the scheme. The report says the DfE “does not know whether Edenred made a profit” on the scheme, but while the government paid them the face value of the supermarket vouchers, Edenred was able to generate revenue by buying vouchers at a discount on their face value. Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said: “DfE chose an adapted off-the-shelf system to save time. But when it launched, families typically had to wait five days to get the vouchers they needed to buy food. “Edenred’s systems buckled under the pressure, and schools and families found it much too difficult to get in touch when things went wrong. DfE and Edenred eventually managed to turn things around – but too many parents had to wait too long to get the support they needed.” Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Problems at the start of the scheme led to a frustrating experience for many schools and families, but DfE and Edenred worked hard to get on top of these issues. Performance steadily improved as the scheme progressed.” Edenred said it had delivered a scheme of unique scale for the DfE, which the majority of parents said worked well and translated every pound of public money into vouchers. “The report is fair in its reflection of the challenges faced in the first four weeks,” a spokesperson said. “We welcome the recognition of the hard work and investment we put into solving those problems, resulting in improvements to a scheme which delivered for parents and schools in the final four months of the programme, when it saw the greatest demand.” The children and families minister, Vicky Ford, said: “The NAO has recognised the swift action we took so that eligible children could access this important provision while schools were partially closed, with £380m-worth of voucher codes having been redeemed into supermarket gift cards by the time the scheme ended.”",education
"Students have begun receiving their BTec grades, a week after the exam board Pearson withdrew some and delayed the publication of others to give itself time to recalculate scores in the week of the A-level results fiasco. About 200,000 people who had taken the level one and two vocational qualifications were told last week, just hours before results day, that they would not receive them on time. A further 250,000 level-three grades, which had already been awarded, were also reassessed. It came after an outcry over A-level and GCSE results led to the scrapping of an algorithm that had calculated pupils’ grades in lieu of exams. After the algorithm downgraded the results of many pupils from the estimates given by their teachers, while apparently favouring pupils from private schools, pupils held multiple protests with many calling for the resignation of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. In many cases, BTec level-three students had also been given lower grades than they had expected. Pearson subsequently said regrading was needed to “address concerns about unfairness in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and ensure no BTec student is disadvantaged”. BTec results will now be given on a rolling basis over the week, with the priority going to level-three results, which may be used for applying to university. Pupils will receive results for level one and two qualifications from Thursday. A Pearson spokesman said: “We know this has caused frustration and additional uncertainty for students and we are truly sorry. No grades will go down as part of this review.” Jenny Cameron, the director at Stagedoor Learning in Cheltenham, who teaches level-three BTec performing arts, said almost all of her students’ original results had been two grades lower than they should have been. “The students have been treated really shoddily ... it’s been two weeks of unnecessary stress and worry for my students, as well as me,” she told PA Media. “It was just bewildering what [Pearson] did ... it didn’t make sense at all.” Kieran Cody, a year 12 student at a technical college in north-east London, was given a U in mathematics for engineering and a near-pass in his other subjects. The 17-year-old had earlier received some of the highest mock exam grades in his class and his teachers said they expected him to earn a distinction and merits in his final grades. “It feels like I’ve been treated like crap,” he said. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said:“It is right that Pearson recognised the oncoming chaos and played their part in rectifying the situation, but students and their families will not forget this results season in a hurry. It was an entirely avoidable state of affairs, and the weaknesses of the system are now fully exposed. “Gavin Williamson must put things right for 2021 as a matter of urgency. There needs to be a reduction in content assessed in exams next summer, collaboration with the profession to develop a robust national system of moderated centre-assessed grades in case of further outbreaks of Covid-19, and a thorough independent review into assessment methods along the lines announced for Scotland.”",education
"Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland hoping to use BTec qualifications to win university places have been given a lifeline after an examination board performed its own U-turn to scrap the flawed system it had used to award grades. Pearson, which offers BTecs to 250,00 students, including around 100,000 sixth formers who take them as a vocational equivalent to A-levels, announced on Wednesday that it would now use internal assessments and marks to set the final results for each course, meaning many young people could be awarded higher grades. However, Pearson’s decision means its level 2 BTec – equivalent to GCSEs – will not now be given to pupils on Thursday, as it will also be replaced by centre-assessed internal grades, causing school leaders hurriedly to rip up and reprint results slips. “We will work urgently with you to reissue these grades and will update you as soon as we possibly can. We want to reassure students that no grades will go down as part of this review,” said Cindy Rampersaud, Pearson’s vice-president for BTecs. “We appreciate this will cause additional uncertainty for students and we are sorry about this. Our priority is to ensure fair outcomes for BTec students in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and that no BTec student is disadvantaged.” Kate Green, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said the delays in revising BTecs were “totally unacceptable”.  “Gavin Williamson and the Department for Education should have had a grip of this situation days ago. It’s appalling that thousands of young people should face further confusion and uncertainty because of the government’s incompetence,” Green said. “This repeated chaos is simply no way to run a country. The government must urgently set a clear deadline for every young person to receive their grades.” School leaders and teachers in England had complained that the algorithm used by Pearson penalised high-achieving students, and paradoxically made it more likely that they would be treated harshly in the external assessments that replaced exams. Several schools and teachers contacted the Guardian to say that because of the flaws, a substantial number of their pupils had received lower grades than their internal assessments had suggested and were in danger of missing out on university places. Plympton academy, in Plymouth, said one of its students taking an engineering BTec was awarded distinctions in all four internally assessed units. But Pearson gave the course’s single external unit a U or fail grade, and the student was awarded a U overall rather than the expected top mark of a starred distinction. While students taking A-levels this year had benefited from the U-turn by the exam regulator, Ofqual, which announced on Monday it was dropping calculated grades in favour of more generous school-assessed grades, those holding BTecs looked set to miss out. “Although we generally accepted centre assessment grades for internal units, we subsequently calculated the grades for the examined units using historical performance data with a view of maintaining overall outcomes over time. Our review will remove these calculated grades and apply consistency across teacher-assessed internal grades and examined grades that students were unable to sit,” Pearson said in a statement. Ofqual confirmed the decision, saying: “Pearson, which initially did not think there would need to be significant changes made, has now decided to revise its arrangements to ensure that students’ qualification-level results better reflect the unit-level results that students have already secured through internally-assessed units.” Meanwhile, the OCR exam board, which covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said that its Cambridge National results, which should have been published on Thursday along with GCSE results, would not be issued until next week.",education
"Tens of thousands of frantic school-leavers are still waiting to hear if they will be accepted at the university of their choice after receiving better A-level grades this week. But vice-chancellors are warning that taking large numbers of extra undergraduates would put students, staff and local communities at risk from coronavirus. Elite universities are racing to revise their social distancing plans, after the government U-turn led to 160,000 students having their A-level grades marked up. Some Russell Group universities say they took tens of thousands of calls in just two days this week, as students begged to be reconsidered for offers they had missed last Thursday. Ucas has confirmed that about 15,000 students rejected by their first-choice university last week now have the grades they need. The vast majority of these had chosen the most prestigious universities, which could be under most pressure to expand this year. Despite extra government funding for high-cost subjects, university chiefs are warning that ramping up numbers could be unsafe, and the capacity of lab-based subjects will be hardest to increase at short notice. Most institutions are nervous about publicly saying they cannot take more students, in case the government tries to blame them for the chaos. The head of one leading university says: “We were already full and already worried about managing social distancing before the U-turn. Right now we have no clue how many more students will want to come, but our worst-case scenario is having to accept thousands extra.” Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, says: “We can’t use all our buildings and rooms to full capacity. We are going to have to be pragmatic. The health and safety of our students and staff has to be uppermost in our minds.” The Independent Sage committee will publish a report on Covid and universities on Friday, which is expected to say that universities should be focusing on improving online learning rather than trying to get students back on campus. Vice-chancellors say organising “blended learning” within government guidelines, with lectures online but lab sessions and small seminars or workshops taught face-to-face, was challenging enough for the numbers they had been expecting before the A-levels fiasco. Some are now considering asking staff to work overtime to fit in more small-class teaching. But they admit the biggest headache may be getting students to obey distancing rules outside the classroom. One elite university head said they had already uncovered plans for a big student party, which will be closed down. Students at Cardiff University will be expected to sign up to a new behaviour pledge and other universities are planning new Covid clauses in their student contract, which will allow them to deter antisocial behaviour on and off campus, such as house parties. The vice-chancellor of another Russell Group university, which the registrar is insisting cannot safely take more students, says: “Students have been cooped up with parents. They are going to want to let their hair down and who can blame them? But we are looking at disciplinary procedures if they do things that could damage the health of the community.” Some universities, including Warwick, Sheffield, Cardiff and York, have confirmed students must wear masks in campus buildings, and at Southampton University students will have to wear them in their student kitchens too. Some leading institutions, including UCL, the University of York, the University of Southampton, and Queen Mary University of London, have confirmed they will accept all students who have met their offer grades, except in subjects with strict caps such as medicine. However, in many cases elite universities are planning to offer deferred places. Southampton has built four new teaching buildings to help with distancing, but Kieron Broadhead, the university’s executive director of student experience, says: “In a Covid-19 world the safety of our student and staff population is key, so this means that for some courses that offer will have to be for next year.” Russell Group universities say they have had legal advice suggesting that although an offer of a place is a legally binding contract, deferring it to next year should be acceptable. Nonetheless some remain anxious about the possibility of legal challenges from students. Sandy Lawrence, from Newquay in Cornwall, is furious that her 18-year-old son, James, has been deprived of his first-choice place. Despite achieving a starred distinction in his triple-science BTec he had not met his offer to study biosciences at Durham University because his biology A-level had been downgraded from a B to a D. Durham has now said there is unlikely to be a place until next year. She says: “We’d bought champagne and we should have been celebrating his triple-starred distinction, but he was devastated.” After spending results day trying to phone other Russell Group universities, James was offered a place at the University of Bristol. But his mum says: “He had set his heart on Durham. He’d even started making friends with other students on Zoom.” At Cardiff, Riordan has sympathy for this year’s school-leavers, but is determined not to take more students than he thinks safe. The university was about to close its admissions call centre when the U-turn was announced. “We were suddenly inundated with frantic calls,” he says. “It is not the applicants’ fault they have met the conditions a lot later, but on some courses there won’t be much we can do. There will have to be compromises such as offering deferred places for next year.”  Riordan is unapologetic about the need for student life to be very different from before to control the spread of coronavirus. “Many young students may feel they won’t be particularly affected if they get it, but we need to get across the burden this places on the health service, and the risk to others in the community who are vulnerable.” Cardiff, he adds, will be “absolutely clear” about the rules all students will be expected to follow. “We can watch out for parties in student houses and be clear that is not allowed, and we will respond to complaints and calls about behaviour. Mostly there has to be a lot of communication,” he says. Mike Merrifield, professor of astronomy at the University of Nottingham, says his department put in a “huge amount of work” calculating how many physics students they could safely take, with many extra lab sessions to keep them small. “We’ll take about 200 students, but maybe 10 or 15 more might now meet the requirements. Even that number would break the system as we’ve already pushed things such a long way,” he says. Levi Pay, a former director of student services who advises universities on the student experience, agrees. “Space on campus was already squeezed to within an inch of its life. Universities are planning on spaces holding 20-50% of their previous capacity. Increasing numbers by a few thousand would create a lot of pressure.” Universities are also braced for local lockdowns. In Birmingham, which could soon be on a “watchlist for intervention” after a significant rise in cases, Aston University says it is working closely with the city’s director of public health. Saskia Hansen, Aston’s deputy vice-chancellor, says although they will be running labs and intensive teaching sessions on campus, there will be a parallel online-only option for students who are shielding or who can’t get flights from abroad. This makes switching everybody online in the event of lockdown much easier. Aston is considering which areas it can expand while still keeping students safe. But Hansen adds: “We will be doing everything we can to contribute to Birmingham hopefully not getting new problems with Covid. We recognise the risks of asymptomatic younger people inadvertently spreading Covid into the wider community.”",education
"The algorithm used by the exams regulator Ofqual to determine A-level and GCSE grades in England following the cancellation of exams has been scrapped, prompting chaos and an urgent review by the UK’s national statistics regulator. The U-turn followed a series of warnings over its potential volatility and fairness. With schools closed and the pandemic gathering pace, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, warns the head of Ofqual the regulator “should ensure, as far as is possible, that qualification standards are maintained and the distribution of grades follows a similar profile to that in previous years”. In a letter to Sally Collier, Ofqual chief regulator, he says students should be issued with calculated results based on schools’ assessments of their ability in the relevant subjects, supplemented by other evidence. Ofqual begins to test a range of algorithms, simulating predictions of results for 2019 exams and comparing the outcomes to the actual results. Ofqual launches a consultation on the arrangements for awarding GCSEs, AS and A-levels, which draws responses from more than 1,000 schools plus unions, teaching bodies and employers. It publishes an analysis of responses, which includes the concern that “some arbitrary algorithm [is] making standardised adjustments”. Calls are made for transparency. One respondent says: “BAME – feedback from some local communities has noted that they are concerned that grade calculation will have a negative impact on their results.” When schools begin submitting teacher-assessed grades, flaws in the algorithm become evident, an adviser who reportedly helped develop the Ofqual software told the Daily Mail. There was “always an understanding there would be winners and losers … there was a very specific point when it became doomed,” the source reportedly said. Sir Jon Coles, a former director general at the Department for Education (DfE), writes to Williamson expressing concerns about the algorithm used by Ofqual. He warned it would be 75% accurate at best when applied to GCSE and A-level grading, according to the Times. Williamson holds a video conference with Coles to discuss the concerns but opts to press ahead. External advisers meanwhile sound warnings to Ofqual that the formula was “volatile” and risked producing erratic outcomes, the Guardian reveals. MPs on the education select committee raise concerns about the grading system in an interim report, warning that some pupils risked being “systematically disadvantaged by calculated grades”. It calls on Ofqual to publish details of the algorithm immediately, adding: “Ofqual should not be afraid of scrutiny or open debate over whether its model offers the fairest outcome for every pupil and provider.” But the exams body refuses, with Ofqual warning that publishing the model would help some schools to calculate awarded grades. Coles also calls on the schools minister, Nick Gibb, who holds a meeting with Ofqual and senior officials at the DfE, to examine the concerns raised. “He felt that the model as devised would disadvantage young people from poorer families and so we discussed that in great detail and I was reassured that it would not,” Gibb said on Thursday. Ofqual runs a summer symposium about the exam arrangements, as it comes under increasing pressure but continues to resist calls to publish the model it will rely on. However, it admits for the first time that it has tested 12 different approaches. Slide 17 of a slide pack used at the event states the statistical model it has selected is the “Direct Centre-level Performance (DCP) approach”. The algorithm is finalised, with the diktat issued by Williamson on 31 March understood to have been the overriding factor that led Ofqual to reject warnings from its external advisers. The failure of the approach becomes apparent when A-level grades are announced, with teachers in England having 39% of their assessments downgraded. A U-turn by Scottish authorities has already taken place. While Ofqual has yet to publish the actual algorithm, it publishes the rationale in a “Annex E” addition to a document first published on 7 July: “Requirements for the calculation of results in summer 2020.”",education
"Prof Pat Thomson, known for her award-winning work on creativity, the arts and education, has quietly been on a darker mission: for the past six years behind the scenes she has been collecting reports of what she calls corruption in the school system. Academy sponsors siphoning off money from school budgets, teachers fiddling test results and heads claiming unlawful bonuses are not just a case of a few bad apples, she claims. Instead, says the professor of education at the University of Nottingham, such dishonesty and greed are evidence of the unethical system in which schools work. Her 3,800 examples of bad practice, mainly from England but also from other countries where market forces have been injected into public services, tell a story of nepotism, fraud and cheating. In England, they also highlight structural “reform”, with its waste of money on free schools that never open, the horrendous ongoing costs of successive private finance initiatives (PFIs), and the way schools are pitched against each other for survival. But the source lies at the heart of governments that have allowed spin and perception to replace decisions for the public good, she says. She has written a book on her findings, explaining how what she regards as corrupt practices are built into the system through competition, market forces and wasteful procurement. Although most people work ethically within this corrupted system, the book provides ample opportunities of the less honest furthering their own or their school’s interests if they think they can get away with it. She gives the example of the boss of an academy telling teachers to cheat in tests, and the widespread off-rolling of students to improve schools’ results. What the country needs is an independent public commission to start the conversation about what we think a school system should be doing and how best to educate young people for the future, instead of focusing on fiddling with school types and the curriculum, she argues. “Money urgently needed in schools has been spent on tinkering with the system, structural change that doesn’t alter what happens in the classroom between students and their teachers,” she says. A prolific researcher, journal author and enthusiastic blogger, Thomson usually visited schools with successful teaching and learning but felt unable to ignore the disastrous events she saw across the wider system, such as the bullying of staff by heads buckling under pressure to improve results at any cost. Included in her hit list of bad practices are failed government initiatives that deprive schools of badly needed cash. Malmesbury school in Wiltshire, for example, has to pay £40 a month for “managing” a canteen bench bought by PFI, on top of installation costs. With 13 years of the contract still to run, it works out at £6,240 just for its “management”. Thomson lays the blame at the top of government. “We have been living with this culture of spin and deceit for a long time,” she says. “I’ve continued to collect examples and now have many more than 3,800 – one of my three clips last week was a decision by the Office for Statistics Regulation to uphold a complaint that Boris Johnson was misusing statistics on child poverty.” Johnson said there were 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than in 2010, a claim found to have no factual basis. “If the prime minister manipulates statistics and the Department for Education is being told off several times for not using statistics appropriately, then you can see right at the top is a culture that says it is acceptable to massage the figures and do what you can get away with,” she says. Unless policy agendas are framed by a commitment to the public good and structured and regulated accordingly, there will be corrupt behaviour and practices, she warns. So does that excuse the head who gave a contract to his mother’s firm or the academy trust that claimed hundreds of thousands of pounds for school repairs it didn’t carry out? No, but it’s important to look at the root causes, she says. Raising money for buildings and repair through PFI, with its expensive ongoing costs borne by schools, and bringing market forces into education through contracting out resources and services once provided by democratically elected bodies, have created opportunities for fraud, she says. She is most worried about England but she sees the same disreputable practices eating into education systems in countries such as the US and Australia, where she was born and worked as a teacher and head before moving into academia at the University of South Australia. The pressure on schools in England surprised her when she moved to the University of Nottingham in 2003. “I was shocked when I arrived by the punitive regime of inspection,” she says. “In my very first class, which was a master’s class of mostly headteachers, one introduced herself saying ‘Hello, I’m a failed headteacher’. It upset me that someone should take on that as their identity.  “Then I started to see waste of money, not at school level, but higher up with people spending a lot on schools that never opened, while those that were open were having to cope with the most appalling buildings,” she says. Critical though she is of the Conservative government, she acknowledges waste was rife under Labour too. For example, the Blair government’s early academies cost on average £3m over budget, with the shortfall covered by the government, not sponsors, according to the National Audit Office. She regards the scandalous costs of PFI as corruption, citing the new school in Liverpool built with private finance that failed to attract enough pupils and closed, but continued to cost £12,000 a day, with Liverpool council facing a £25m bill to buy itself out of the PFI contract. A teacher tells her how “management” of a new sink has cost the school £88 a year for the past 14 years. With nine years left on the PFI contact, that one sink will have cost £2,024. Despite Thomson’s concern, she is not calling for academy status to be abolished or Ofsted scrapped. What the country needs is government to be “re-moralised” and the civil service reorganised so that public resources are used in the interest of all. “The call is now even more urgent to a world living with the aftermath of Covid-19,” she says. “The private has been elevated over the public good. We need to think now about how we might do things differently, how government might forge a new contract with the public to organise the nation in the best interests of all of us. A commission could bring together everyone in education to foster a renewed sense of solidarity and trust.” But can 3,800 examples and one book turn the tide? “I don’t imagine this book is going to do a lot by itself but it could get people talking. I hope it will inform debates about what might be done now to help save teachers and students from a school system bruised from decades of political pet policies and projects,” she says.

"Sheffield University has halted proposals to cut salaries and promotions for staff due to financial concerns related to coronavirus after the institution found that more students planned to go there than expected, boosted by the government lifting its cap on intake numbers. In an email to staff, the human resources department said that a recently launched consultation on cost reductions would be closed. They said the pandemic had not “put students off going” and the government lifting the cap on how many people they could accept meant their intake could be higher. They noted that other cost-saving measures had also helped, including voluntary redundancies resulting in “£12m in staff salary savings for 2020-21”. The measures that were being proposed included pay freezes, pausing incremental pay progression, cancelling or deferring promotions and a reduction in pay. The University of Sheffield branch of the University and College Union said in July that any planned changes would be premature. In a tweet, it said: “Uni management has told staff that if an agreement is not reached in the 90-day consultation, they may unilaterally impose any/all of the above changes to terms & conditions via dismissal & re-engagement.” This means in effect that staff would be dismissed and rehired under new terms and different contracts. On hearing news of the end of the consultation, the union said: “The university has withdrawn its s188 notice and the threat of dismissal and re-engagement that was hanging over staff has been removed. We’re pleased to see this but remain disappointed at what was always a premature and unnecessary move by our employers.” The university had praised the lifting of the government cap on student numbers, saying it meant it could accept more students who met the terms of their original offer. But Mark Pendleton, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies, said: “We cannot accept significant increases in student numbers. It is unsustainable and dangerous in terms of F2F [face-to-face] teaching, bad for student experience, terrible for staff workload and stress, and potentially devastating for the sector.” The university said the changes that prompted its new course were: “Firstly, the furore surrounding the A-level results and university places has shown that the pandemic has not put students off going to university and has actually demonstrated an increased demand. “Secondly, the government’s decision to change how A-level results are awarded, and the subsequent lifting of the cap on student numbers, also means that we can accept more students who meet the terms of their original offer. In light of this, there is also the potential for further government support and our university continues to push for this.” In its email, the university said since launching the consultation it had reduced spending on many non-staff areas, improving its financial position. “Over the past few months, colleagues have worked tirelessly to put us in the best possible position for this coming academic year and beyond. As a result of these collective efforts and changes, it is now our view that such an extreme adverse financial situation is less likely to arise. We have also put in place additional steps to mitigate significant reductions in our income,” the email read. The university has been approached for comment.",education
"This time last week, Gavin Williamson was sticking to his guns. The algorithm had worked. There would be no U-turns. Within 48 hours – hours that had been excruciatingly painful for tens of thousands of disappointed students, their parents, teachers and universities – Williamson had changed tack. The algorithm hadn’t worked, he had ordered a U-turn – and was apologising to all the young people who had suffered as a result. In politics, about-turns don’t come much bigger than this. But if Williamson had thought his considerable embarrassment would end there, he was wrong – again. His explanation that he had only become aware of the scale of the problems “over the Saturday and Sunday” is under intense scrutiny – it now appears both he and his department were warned at least four times in July and August that the algorithm-based system for calculating A-level and GCSE grades in England was seriously flawed. So how did this blow up in his face? The roots of the crisis date back to March, at the height of the pandemic. While countries such as Germany went ahead and held school exams despite the coronavirus, the nations of Britain did not, each deciding to award grades by algorithm. On 31 March, Williamson hurriedly issued an instruction to the exam regulator, Ofqual, insisting “the distribution of grades follows a similar profile to that in previous years”. Few paid much attention. In the months that followed the main issue was how to reopen schools, with Williamson focusing on fighting with teachers’ unions over the issue. But as the pandemic eased, the worries about the exam system began to mount. Early in July, the education select committee complained the approach meant there were “potential risks of bias” affecting disadvantaged groups. That same month a worried former senior official, Sir Jon Coles, approached the schools minister, Nick Gibb. Privately, Coles warned him “it would disadvantage particularly children from poorer backgrounds” – and would only be 75% accurate. Huy Duong, a former medical statistician, with a son facing exam results of his own, calculated – presciently – that 39% of A* to D grades would be lower than teacher assessments. The findings led to a front page story in the Guardian, six days before the England’s A-level results were due. “It should not have taken a genius to work out that any model that was only 60% or 75% accurate would have led to too many individual injustices,” says Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service. “Was there any algorithm that could have done the job ministers were looking for?” There were other warning signs, and they were flashing red. Scotland was embroiled in its own exam storm. On 4 August, the Scottish Qualifications Authority downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended results – 124,000 – on the basis of its own algorithm. A deluge of complaints followed. Poorer pupils had been hardest hit in Scotland, but journalists were reassured that England would be different and that the algorithm about to be unleashed on thousands of young people was better designed. It turned out not to be the case. The Scottish model could not survive contact with political reality. The SNP education secretary, John Swinney, scrapped all the downgrades a week after they were announced, and allowed pupils to receive higher teacher assessed grades. “It’s deeply regrettable we got this wrong,” Swinney said. The English A-level results were far more dramatic than anybody expected. While 39.1% of the 700,000 teacher assessments submitted were downgraded, it was Ofqual’s insistence on benchmarking results against the prior three years’ attainment in the same subject in that school that cause the most serious problems. Yet, small classes, of the type favoured in private schools, were curiously exempt. That helped fee-paying schools record 4.7 percentage points more A or A* grades. For comprehensives the figure was 2 points, below the overall 2.3 average in England. Downgrades for some students were dramatic – with schools reporting some pupils unexpectedly receiving a U. One of the causes was that the algorithm decided that poor grades in the past meant somebody had to be marked down sharply again. Protests were immediate and stories of upset and frustrated students dominated the media. On Monday, the day of the climbdown, a spirited group marched on the Department for Education with handmade placards, chanting “fuck the algorithm”. Sam Freedman, a former adviser to Michael Gove at the DfE, said ministers had few good choices when the pandemic struck, but added: “Why couldn’t schools have seen the grades days or weeks in advance for verification, so they could say ‘this looks out of whack’?” Instead, such were the suspicions about teacher assessment, schools were told the day before just as if tens of thousands of exam papers had been marked. There was no safety valve in the system to protect students, and even ministers. As the crisis hit, Williamson became erratic. On the Saturday after the results were out, he told the Times “this is it”, there would be “No U-turn, no change”. Protests grew, and a complete U-turn was announced on Monday afternoon, where teacher assessments could replace algorithm-based grades. “Over the weekend it became apparent,” Williamson belatedly said “there were real concerns about what … [grades] a large number of students were getting”. It was accompanied by a picture of Williamson, a former chief whip, sitting at his desk with a riding whip and a red book at the front. “It was there when I arrived, so I made sure it got in the picture,” the photographer, Stefan Rousseau, said. The unsubtle message was not lost on anybody, coming from a figure who was once Theresa May’s key enforcer before she sacked him and he switched to help run Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign. The current prime minister, on holiday in Scotland, has already shown himself to be a reluctant sacker, and Williamson appears insulated for now. But few in Westminster believe the education secretary can survive much longer if there are problems with schools reopening in September. Meanwhile, for a government that won dozens of working class seats from Labour at the election, it was politically damaging. A former Tory aide who worked in government before the election said: “Why have Dominic Cummings if he or people close to him don’t raise the alarm in situations like this?” Duong too is sure Williamson should have stopped the process in its tracks. “If a software failure causes a train crash, the boss can’t say, ‘I only saw the lines of code after the crash’. He should have known that in testing it failed 25% of the time and scrapped that software.”",education
"Over a quarter (27%) of university students were unable to access online learning during the Covid-19 lockdown, according to new research which suggests that disabled students and those from poorer backgrounds were worst affected. The survey, which was carried out in July by the National Union of Students (NUS), found that disruptions to studies arose from a lack of IT equipment and software, insufficient course materials, and poor internet connections. Of the 4,178 respondents, 18% said they lacked the support necessary to deal with Covid-19, such as counselling or financial help. Disabled students and those with caring responsibilities were more likely to have not received this support. The survey called for more help with students’ mental health and wellbeing, as well as more targeted, personalised teaching. Among the students who have struggled with the shift to online learning is Aqsa Rabbani, a third-year midwifery student at Middlesex University. “I found remote learning quite hard,” she said. “I feel like there was a lack of communication from the university and there wasn’t much support online. My classmates would often have technical difficulties and it was hard to get used to. The government could have supplied more grants or reduced fees this year, especially for healthcare students like myself who have been working on placement throughout coronavirus.” The NUS figures come after a similar poll published last week by the Office for Students (OfS), which highlighted the impact of digital poverty on students. Over half of respondents said they lacked access to online course materials during the pandemic. Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students, said: “These findings chime with our own research which shows that a significant number of students were impacted by digital poverty during lockdown. Since the beginning of the pandemic, universities have been working hard to deliver high-quality education in extremely difficult circumstances. But as the new term starts, universities must ensure their digital offering is accessible for all and that no students are left behind, particularly the most disadvantaged.” Last week, Barber announced a review of digital teaching and learning in English higher education to address the problem. “We want to know about what worked during the pandemic, what didn’t, and opportunities for the future. We cannot risk students being left behind in the rush for online innovation,” he said. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice president for higher education, said: “It’s evident from our research that the demand for academic support by students is going to go up even more than we’ve already seen during the pandemic, with many already turning to their students’ unions which have also been hit hard financially by Covid-19.” As a new term begins this month, over half (56%) of the students surveyed by the NUS also said they were concerned about contracting the virus on university campuses. In a recent interview with the Guardian, NUS president Larissa Kennedy said she was worried about a lack of consistency in universities’ safety measures. “[Universities are] committing to in-person teaching, which they haven’t necessarily thought through from a safety perspective because they’re in competition with other institutions,” she said. “Immunocompromised students and disabled students are once again being erased from the conversation, and of course their staff counterparts.”",education

"As many children in England go back to school for the first time in months, we talked to parents around the country about their expectations, anxieties, and how they hope to navigate their way through the new normal in the age of the pandemic. There were a few tears, one or two lips being bitten nervously and some of the younger children clutched firmly on to their parents’ hands as they were marched up to the school gates. But most of the 840 pupils returning to Bishop Road primary school after their very extended break had a spring in their step. In their bright purple jumpers and cardigans, they greeted friends they had not seen for months joyfully; they excitedly began to tell teachers about their adventures in lockdown; some demanded parents take a picture to record the occasion. Then they started to get used to the differences – the one-way routes, the hand-washing regimes, the subtle changes to playtime. “It’s great to see them back,” said Jon Martin, who was dropping off Bowen, six, and Nia, nine. “My daughter barely slept last night, she couldn’t wait to get back in. My son didn’t grumble as we got out of the door so that’s a win too. “Trying to do home learning has been really hard and they’ve missed out on the social side. We’re all desperate to get back to some sort of normal.” Sara Kelly-Smith, a single parent, was escorting Mia, seven, back to school. “It’s been a bit of a nightmare,” said Kelly-Smith, who has been trying to juggle her beauty business with childcare. “There’s only so many bike rides you can do.” Most were happy with the safety regime the school had put in place, with only a handful turning up in masks. “I’m sure they’ll do it well,” said Kate Macleod, who was dropping off her seven-year-old daughter, Jessie. “More than anything, I don’t want their lives, their education, their futures to be affected any more than they have to be. They’ve missed learning, friends, socialisation.” It felt familiar – but there were differences. Pupils and parents faced a web of lines and arrows painted on to playgrounds to follow to make sure they got to the right place at the right time. Day one involved a staggered drop-off. Years one, three and five were asked to arrive from 8.30 – 8.45am, years two, four and six from 9.15-9.30am. If sibling drop-off times differed adults needed to go through the process twice. To help, the school had posted a series of videos online explaining the procedures. The school made it clear all children were expected to attend unless they were self-isolating because of coronavirus symptoms or a positive test result, or if they had been advised not to attend by a health professional because of an underlying condition. Pupils were remaining with their class throughout the day and were not mixing with other classes for break or lunch. Events such as assemblies will happen remotely. The school followed government guidance in not requiring staff or children to wear face coverings. But it says any person choosing to wear a mask at school will not be prevented from doing so. There were new desk layouts, “enhanced” cleaning and, where it was safe, windows and doors were kept open to increase ventilation. It helped that day one turned out to be bright and warm. In corridors, a “keep to the left” rule has been introduced, with clear markings on the floor. Pupils were asked to bring in packed lunches and snacks. Children who are eligible for free school meals and were previously receiving vouchers are being provided with a packed lunch. There will be up to three classes on a playground at any one time but each class will be allocated their own playground space. Children will be encouraged to avoid games that involve substantial physical contact and are not allowed to bring in equipment such as footballs and table tennis bats. Nor were they allowed to bring pencil cases, toys, balls or games. They were also not to bring in sweets, cakes or other items on their birthdays. Joe Emissah, the deputy head, said the school was delighted to be welcoming pupils back. “We are fantastically pleased that we are all going to be back in school doing the things that we love – sharing stories, reading books, hearing about all the things everybody’s been getting up to and getting started with our learning.” Most pupils and their adults seemed to be coping with the rule changes admirably. Robert Jones, who walked Arthur, five, up to the school gates, said his son was excited to meet up with his classmates. “We’re glad everyone is getting on with it,” he said. Mohammed Ibrahim, who dropped off Mayadea, six, said: “It’s been almost five months – we really need to go back. Of course, we’re still concerned about coronavirus but we’ve got to do our best to stay safe and get on with it.” SM Though many schools in the North of England had taken an inset day on Tuesday, all pupils were welcomed back at staggered times by Chesham primary school in Bury, Greater Manchester. Despite initial concerns over safety, most parents at the school’s gates were keen to see their children off into their new social bubbles. “I think we were getting to the stage of them needing something else – they’re excited to get back,” said Kristie Harkness, who was waiting with her daughters Kenzie, eight, and Harper, four. Throughout the lockdown, Harkness and her husband, Brett, had been trying to teach the girls at home – although Brett clarified that he “wouldn’t call it homeschooling” and that much of it had involved creating things like Egyptian tombs out of cardboard. The family were ready to get back to normal – with Kenzie aching to see her best friend, Emma, and Harper wanting to get stuck in with painting. For Kelly Ralph, a retail worker, and Rebecca Dewhurst, a social worker, school offered some much-needed routine for their children following the summer holidays. “They’re not apprehensive about going into school,” said Ralph, who has two children: Noah, four, and Gracie, 10. “I think we’ve managed to keep some of that normality in our house because I’ve been at work the whole time – so it doesn’t feel that different.” Dewhurst added that she felt the government’s changing policies on schools reopening had been confusing. “No one knows what the impact of it will be until after it’s happened so how can they really know it’s safe.” Still, she had instructed her sons, Bartle, four, and Starson, six, on how to keep as safe as possible at school. “I’ve been very vocal about Covid and its implications for people and society with them. They know how to socially distance, they know all about hand washing.”  But for parents in the high-risk category for developing severe Covid symptoms, the decision to send their children back was something of a catch-22. “I’ve put [my son’s] mental health first and decided to send him back to school because he needs some normality. But I’m extremely apprehensive,” said Zoe Bailey. Bailey, who has Crohn’s disease, arthritis and asthma, has been shielding since March. The thought of Alfi, six, passing Covid on to her is something that frightens them both. “He’s become so anxious that he shouts at people in the street for not wearing masks and tells them to get away from me,” said Bailey, adding that there was little advice from the government over high-risk parents sending children to school. “To go from telling [shielders] not to go outside, it’s a scary place, to on 31 July saying we could just go about life as usual – you feel very unsupported,” she said. But the school had instilled some confidence where the government had not, Bailey felt. In the event of a child or staff member having suspected Covid symptoms, Alfi will be allowed to learn at home again. “There’s a digital learning plan set up for him already,” she added. AW At the entrance of Charles Dickens primary school in Southwark, Angel McCall was the only parent who wore a face mask. As she cradled her nine-year-old son’s head in her latex-gloved hands, she admitted that she found sending him back “very, very nerve-racking”. “I see there are not many people wearing masks, either,” she said. “So I’m thinking: am I the only one? Are we not worrying any more?” Her son was not wearing a mask but he admitted he was nervous too. “All I can tell him is be sensible and wash his hands and don’t touch anything,” McCall said, but she added that she did not think it would be easy for children to observe physical distancing rules. “He hasn’t seen any of his friends since March,” McCall said, explaining that she had kept him at home and not mixed with other families since the government-mandated lockdown began. Close by stood Ifeanyi Kamalu, waiting with his seven-year-old daughter for her turn to enter school – his four-year-old had already gone in. He had mixed feelings about returning his children to school. “As much as I know that the coronavirus is still out there, they have been out of school for about six months so I kind of feel that they should be back at school to continue learning – as much as all of us are scared of the virus,” he said. Kamalu was sceptical about the ability of the school to contain any outbreak. “I know that parents are bringing children from various homes … what if those kids have it? You have a huge window for passing the virus around. Here they are not necessarily observing the 2-metre rules or the face coverings. “I wish I could homeschool them, but I haven’t got the resources.” Not all parents were anxious. “It’s good to be back, let’s just say,” Tatjana Pisarski said. She was reassured by the school’s efforts to institute a regime of hygiene and precautions to keep pupils safe. “The school sent a little video to show what to expect inside, what we can’t see from the outside, all the washing basins and routines … it sounds really good.” High on the fence, a sign informed parents of the staggered times in which their children would be allowed inside: reception and year six first, at 8.15am, followed at 15 minute intervals by pupils from years four and five. “Follow the lines; join the queue; please keep your distance,” a sign instructed. As Marina Harrington queued to hand her son over to staff she said: “I can’t wait … Freedom; work; life.” Then, peering at her son, who had screwed up his face and stepped away, she added: “I love him dearly …” Harrington’s husband, Mark, cut in: “I love him enough to let him go, I think that’s the thing.” Marina Harrington said life with three children at home had been stressful. She explained she and her husband had been waking at 5am each day – before their children – to get in a couple of hours of work, then taking on homeschooling responsibilities when their children got up. Asked if they were concerned that their son had fallen behind in his studies during lockdown, Mark Harrington laughed: “He’s nine … that’s people who worry too much.” DG",education
"Is it too late to apply for student finance? No – but you’d better get a move on! You can apply for student finance up to nine months after you start your course but your application could take up to six weeks to process.  How will I receive my student loan? Your maintenance loan is paid at the start of every term into your student bank account. This doesn’t include extra funds you might get from your university if you’re eligible for further financial support. What costs do I need to consider? First up, rent and essential bills. These are all-inclusive (ie one fixed rate) in most student halls, as well as some student houses and private accommodation blocks. Otherwise, you and your housemates will need to organise payments for broadband, gas and electricity, water, streaming services, and a TV license if you want to watch the BBC (yes, even on catch-up.) To give you an idea of costs, Save the Student reckons the typical student will pay £32 a month for their essential bills, though you might pay less by going without a TV or streaming and using less water/energy (ie taking showers instead of baths). And don’t forget your personal bills, like mobile contracts and subscriptions. You may also have travel and course expenses on top of your day-to-day costs. Plus, I strongly recommend student insurance for things like laptops, as well as antivirus software and a hard drive to back up your work. Do I need to pay tax? If you get a part-time job, you’ll have to pay income tax if you typically earn more than £1,042 a month and national insurance if you earn more than £183. Your employer will deduct this from your wages through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). If you make money online you keep the first £1,000 as your trading allowance but beyond that, you’ll need to contact HMRC. You don’t have to pay council tax in a pure student house, but you may need to apply for an exemption. How do I organise the bills? Inform your suppliers you’ve moved in ASAP. Provide them with accurate readings of your meters so you don’t overpay for estimated readings. Once you get a handle on usage/needs, switch to better broadband and energy deals through a comparison website. Opt for shorter contracts if you’ll only be in the house for nine months and pay by monthly direct debit rather than annually – it’s simpler and cheaper. Work out how much each housemate owes and nail down a system for paying up. This could mean paying into a joint account or using a bill-splitting app like Splitwise. Only share accounts with housemates who will always pay on time to avoid damaging your credit rating. How do I make my student loan last? One word: budgeting. Figure out how much your rent, bills and contracts cost each month and subtract that from your maintenance loan. Transfer that amount into another bank account (it’s a doddle to open one these days) as soon as you receive your loan. If possible, leave an extra £100 in there for unexpected expenses or an expensive period like Christmas. Split the remaining loan into a weekly or even daily sum. Then bingo! You know much you have left to spend. Also, consider opening another account for any non-essential spending with a digital-first bank like Monzo or Starling. They offer budgeting tools and instant alerts when you use their debit cards so you know where your money is going. How can I save money? Get an NUS card and see if you can get a student discount with every retailer you use. Also check out discount schemes offered by StudentBeans, UniDays, Totum, and Young Scot in Scotland. Go second-hand wherever possible. Cook your own meals using non-perishable goods like beans, lentils, tinned fish and veggies, and passata. Invest in a tupperware box and prep your own lunch before going to campus. Maybe invest in a coffee pot and flask too: Chilly’s offers a 10% discount through UniDays. What if I struggle financially? Firstly, speak to the money advice service within your university: they will point you towards hardship funds and bursaries. You may also qualify for universal credit if you’re on a low income. If you have to borrow extra, your interest-free overdraft is better than expensive credit cards or loans. But you’ll have to pay it back within a few years of graduating to avoid being charged, so don’t go crazy. Try not to exceed the interest-free zone or at the very least, speak to your bank if you fear you might. Finally, don’t be afraid to get help from a debt charity like Stepchange: it’s free, they’re on your side and they’ll help you turn things around.",education
"Teaching unions have told parents to ignore letters circulating on social media that threaten legal action against schools requiring pupils to wear face masks or use hand sanitiser. Lawyers say the threats contained in the letters are baseless, and that the latest government guidance gives schools the power to require masks to be worn when appropriate. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are aware of template letters being circulated on social media for parents to send to schools objecting to any requirement for pupils to wear face coverings. “We do not think the tone of these letters is helpful and we would encourage parents who are concerned about policies on face coverings to discuss the matter with their school.” Laura Berman, a partner at the law firm Stone King, said she and her colleagues were contacted by around 10 state schools in England with copies of letters on Thursday that used very similar wording. “They are quite threatening letters, and they contain statements that who knows whether they are true, so schools are desperately trying to do the right thing and want to know how best to respond,” said Berman, who described some of the claims as “ridiculous”. One of the notices sent by a parent, and seen by Stone King, states: The letter goes on to make a false claim about the effects of wearing a mask. Some of the notices raise fears over the treatment of children displaying coronavirus symptoms, stating: Another section claims the parent did not allow their child to use the school’s hand sanitiser and would supply their own: Berman said it was unlikely that schools would object if pupils supplied their own sanitiser, or used soap and water. McCulloch said: “In areas where local restrictions apply, government guidance is that face coverings should be worn in communal areas in secondary schools. The guidance otherwise gives flexibility to secondary schools over whether to require face coverings in communal areas according to their context, such as the extent to which the layout of the school entails staff and students mixing in close proximity as they move around. “Where face coverings are required this will be because the school has assessed that this will help to mitigate the risk of transmission of coronavirus in communal areas. “We would ask that parents respect and support the policies of their school.” Berman said her advice to schools was that they had “clear discretion” over mask-wearing policies for pupils and staff. “Schools absolutely have that discretion. If they decide to implement it, if they decide that’s right for their community, then they can impose that policy,” Berman said. While the government’s policy states that no child should be excluded for not wearing a mask, Berman said she would advise schools to make face covering rules part of a school’s behaviour and health and safety policies. “Our advice would be to tie that policy into their behaviour policy so that if it is not adhered to then any breach of the policy can be sanctioned in the normal way. Schools will have to make adjustment to the policies for those who might have difficulty wearing a mask,” Berman said. On Friday the JCB Academy, a secondary school in north Staffordshire, became the first school in England to close owing to a confirmed Covid-19 case since the start of the new school year. The Department for Education and the Cabinet Office are said to have been aware of the misinformation circulating on social media, and the government’s rebuttal unit has been challenging posts on Facebook and other outlets.A DfE spokesperson said: “In local lockdown areas, children in year 7 and above should wear face coverings in communal spaces and corridors. Outside of local lockdown areas face coverings won’t be necessary in schools, though schools will have the flexibility to introduce this if they believe it is right in their specific circumstances. Face coverings should not be required in the classroom as they hinder communication and pupils’ education.”",education
"I wake at 4am, two hours before my alarm is due to go off, with sneezing fits and stomach cramps – cramps are one of my symptoms of anxiety.  Today is an inset day, typically an opportunity to get all the teachers together. This year, because of Covid, we are spread out around the building in small, socially distanced groups. Even instructions to discuss are now “with a socially distanced colleague”. However, I have strong doubts about whether the social distancing is going to work. On a holiday trip to Longleat, I learned that 2 metres is the same length as a fully grown zebra. Looking around, there doesn’t appear to be a zebra between us anywhere. Where’s a tape measure (or a zebra) when you need one? There is a noticeable absence of face coverings. We’ve been told staff and students can wear them if they want to. It means we have to buy our own masks. I choose to wear one but feel self-conscious as I’m one of the only ones to do so, so it ends up scrunched in a plastic bag in my trouser pocket. Some multi-academy trusts are providing all students with branded, colour-coded masks and staff with visors and masks. In my school, while we may not reach that gold PPE standard, we are certainly not the worst. I have heard horror stories of teachers coming back from shielding only to be publicly shamed by their heads for wearing a mask. I had expected the inset day to be dominated by talk of Covid, but it remains the elephant in the room. Questions seem to hang in the air unanswered, like a bad smell. The truth is, we just won’t know what things will be like until the students are back tomorrow. And if today is anything to go by, it will seem as if Covid had never happened. Today, I wake up to the sound of a text on my phone. It is the results of the Covid-19 test I had taken on bank holiday Monday. It is negative, which gives me momentary relief from the anxiety knotted in my stomach. At least I won’t be the next “super-spreader”. Today school is open only for the new starters. Staff stand around waiting to funnel the arrivals through reception and into the hall, with no temperature checks. It isn’t long before they are packed in like sardines, ready to hear the headteacher’s welcome address. In my head, I start a game of “Spot the face mask” but give up because there are so few. With all the conflicting messages and government U-turns, it has often felt like playing a board game in which the rules are made up on the spot. The fact that the students are in year “bubbles” offers me little comfort. While the bubbles at a primary school could be up to 60 students, secondary bubbles can be five times as many. Increasingly, I worry that this particular bubble is about to burst. Throughout the day, unmasked adults lead groups of unmasked children around the school grounds without socially distancing from them at all. The scenes shock me in the same way as when I look back at archive footage of music concerts. My alarm clock wakes me at 6am. We all rise as one, as each of us is back at school or work today, for what feels like the first time in forever. Like many working parents across the country, I owe a mountain of gratitude to all the staff running school breakfast clubs. Both my children are going today. The staff there are rightfully vigilant about children sanitising their hands as they come in. My youngest is caught off guard. “Hand sanitiser, please!”. He has his water bottle in one hand and his packed lunch in the other, his face contorting as he puzzles through his dilemma. His bottom lip wobbles, then he sticks his water bottle under his armpit, threads his other hand through the handle of his lunchbox, and sanitises like it’s going out of fashion. This makes me think about my own school. It is easy to bemoan the absence of adequate PPE, but are the schools that enforce strict safety rules in danger of scaring the life out of young people? All schools are walking a tightrope between keeping everyone safe and everyone sane. I don’t understand why we can’t achieve both. I hear one parent, wearing a mask, ask a teacher about the rules and I’m frightened by the response. “I doubt whether many people will be wearing them tomorrow and the ones that do will probably feel a bit silly.” We are supposed to be modelling how to be good citizens in a time of Covid, but I do not see a single student wiping down their desk or washing their hands in the numerous outdoor wash basins that have been installed. The vigilance we were all told to employ seems to have gone awol. And in the absence of vigilance, it won’t be long before the Covidiots have moved into town to hold an illegal rave on our sports field. When I get home, one of my parent WhatsApp groups has almost 100 messages on it, with parents desperately wanting to chat about how the first day went. Most of the posts are about what the children ate (or didn’t eat) in the absence of cooked meals. Malt loaf bars appear to be the healthy snack food of choice. Today is the last day of the first week back, and the day when all our students return to school, or face being fined for unauthorised absence. This strikes me as particularly harsh for any student with a family member undergoing chemo or those living with elderly relatives. As someone who suffers from bouts of anxiety, I’m not convinced that the threat of a hefty fine would be that effective while I’m in the throes of a panic attack. But the threat seems to have worked. The trickle of students over the last couple of days has turned into a torrent arriving eagerly at the school gates. I feel nervous as the sound of the students approaching the building builds to a crescendo: not nervous for me, but for the many friends and colleagues who have come out of shielding to be guinea pigs in the next part of this social experiment. A few more teachers are wearing masks but the students mostly seem blasé. One year 11 student seems more eager to show me a video of himself “stacking it” on his bicycle than to talk about Covid. We haven’t even seen the back of it but young people seem bored with coronavirus. It has become the Brexit of 2020. I broach the subject with one of my classes. One student tells me she hasn’t been able to complete an assignment because she has been working in a hospital over the summer. “What was that like?” I ask her. “Yeah. You know. People died. It was sad. It is what it is.” Some identifying details have been changed.",education
"It has been a summer of painstaking preparations for headteachers charged with drawing up plans covering everything from new behavioural rules to “Covid-secure” measures before millions of pupils in England return to the classroom full-time next week. Many schools will look different, with spray-painted stencils marking out 2-metre distancing outside, duct tape arrows signalling one-way systems in corridors, forward-facing furniture and desks with clip-on screens so teachers can get closer to younger pupils. What else does the new normal involve for schoolchildren? Many schools will stagger arrival and leaving times and lunchtimes to reduce crowding, resulting in shorter days for some and longer days for others. One mother of three said her four-year-old would have 90 minutes less school time a day.  School populations and building sizes are also constraining the use of the bubbles designed to restrict Covid-19 outbreaks. Instead of keeping small groups separate so a limited number of children have to self-isolate in the event of an outbreak, bubbles may be hundreds-strong.  At Exeter Road community primary school in Devon, which has around 200 children in its main building and 30 to 50 on a nursery roll, building work has put a third of space available out of action. “If you were going to have pure bubbles then surely each one would have toilet facilities of its own, so we are going to have four fairly large bubbles as a result and we’ll be trying to keep them separate, with staggered entry times,” said the headteacher, Paul Gosling. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, implied this week that parents should avoid lingering at school gates, saying they should drop their children off and “get on with the tasks of the day”. With some canteens off-limits and plans for some classes to eat lunch in the rooms they will be spending much or all of the day in, some schools will use apps to enable children to order their meals. Among schools trialling the app is Hampton High in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, where the headteacher, Rebecca Poole, says enormous changes have been made. “We’ll be operating a food delivery service from the canteen as we can’t have large numbers of children eating together at the moment, and that’s where the app from our catering company comes in,” she said. Payment would normally be made via fingerprint recognition, but this has been replaced by lanyards. Schools such as Birchwood High in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, have installed outdoor decking under a shelter so that children can eat outside. The principal, Chris Ingate, said: “We have a big indoor cafeteria, but we wanted to make provision for eating outside. It’ll be a bit like going to Costa, you’ll go in and then out, but we’ll have to see how things are in the winter months.” Headteachers pause or take a deep breath when asked the million-dollar question: are you clear on what you’re supposed to do in the event of an outbreak? “It’s not entirely clear what will happen if there is an outbreak, but it’s not for want of trying,” said Ruth Davies, the head of Waunarlwydd primary in Swansea and the national president of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT). Schools have procedures in place for what to do immediately in terms of the isolation of pupils or staff, but whether an entire school or just a bubble would be sent home remains to be seen. Poole said: “Once we’ve isolated the person, made the phone call home and recommended they get tested, it’s somewhat unclear. My view is that test and trace will pick it up and we’ll be advised, but all I can say is that we’ll just have to deploy our professional judgment.” Plans are being made at her school for teachers quarantined at home to stream lessons into the classroom if needs be. With confidence in the government’s track-and-trace scheme at a low ebb, some schools have drawn up rudimentary forms to detail who shared rooms with whom. They include High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool, where the head, Mark Trilling said: “I think in reality if someone does come down then in our case the entire bubble of 30 would go into self-isolation. It is a bit confusing and there is no real guidance, but we would draw on our own professional judgment and take advice from the local authority.” Only 7% of school leaders were confident in the government’s test-and-trace scheme, according to an NAHT poll of nearly 4,000 school leaders. Only 18% were confident in the arrangements for a lockdown in their area. Poole and other school leaders say no one can tell when schools might be able to start thinking about relaxing some measures, but she predicts it won’t be for another nine months. “There’s a bit of concern about timetabling, but we will stick with what we’re doing because what children and parents need is clarity,” she said. “We won’t change anything until at least January, and I think we will have to go until at least March.” Davies voiced concerns about staffing, and said the coming six months could be hardest as winter takes its toll. “As soon as we have any semblance of a symptom then that person will be off, and if one or more members of staff go then there will be pressure. A steady stream of supply teachers just won’t be available.” Gosling said he feared a chaotic autumn term with teachers and pupils being sent home in large numbers and a lack of political leadership. Ingate said his main concerns were students who had fallen behind over the last few months, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as the “whole unpredictability” of Covid-19 and the potential for a second wave. “What happens? We’d take would advice from our local authority and health bodies, but I have an instinct that it would probably play out in terms of an increased incident rate in the area rather than the school being the centre. If rates went up, we’d see it,” he said.",education
"Scenes of overflowing lecture halls, with impassioned professors inspiring students, are a staple of any university-based drama. But for many students choosing the institution where they want to study in September 2021, they may be a thing of the past. Following the coronavirus pandemic, from September lecture theatres are more likely to be used as spaces where socially distanced seminars can be held. Increasingly, lectures – or at least the content contained within them – are being moved online. Some students are worried about the number of contact hours – a loose term referring to the amount of time spent with tutors through lectures, seminars and tutorials – they will get this year, while students looking ahead to September 2021 could be forgiven for feeling apprehensive. “When students go back, teaching and learning will undoubtedly be different,” says Allison Littlejohn, director of University College London’s knowledge lab. “There will definitely be less face-to-face teaching in the next semester, and more blended learning.” A Times Higher Education snapshot survey found this year that most institutions were hoping to offer a mixture of face-to-face and online teaching. Asked if she thinks the class of 2020-21 will experience the same scenario, Littlejohn pauses. “The truth is, I don’t know,” she says. “If universities find that students like a mix of methods, they may switch to having more online learning. I do think there will be more online and blended learning going forward.” But it could mean that the students of 2021-22 can expect – in some ways – a much richer experience. According to Littlejohn, a good blended course will include a clear structure, access to resources such as short videos and – most importantly – activities to help students learn specific concepts and test understanding. According to the Higher Education Policy Institute’s (Hepi) 2020 survey of student experiences, the contact hours students can expect varies significantly from course to course. Veterinary students see the highest number of hours, and communications and media students the fewest. But despite strikes and the pandemic, this year students still reported more timetabled contact hours, in smaller class sizes. Many students have already seen much of their learning move online, but that hasn’t necessarily led to a reduction in contact hours. Katie Adamson, a 19-year-old second-year law student, was among the Cambridge student body that learned all lectures would be online until at least summer 2021. Having the lecture content readily available before supervised group work has proved useful, and it’s not the only bonus, Adamson says. “We get to stay in bed longer and not risk missing our lectures because of it,” she jokes. She has been told to expect the same contact hours when she returns, and while lectures will be online, “supervisions” – or classes – will continue in small, socially distanced groups. “I’m really grateful for that,” she says. “The most important part of our academic experience will continue as much as possible.” Real interaction, as long as it’s safe, is crucial to good learning, says Littlejohn. “There has to be the opportunity to forge connections,” she explains. “Going for coffee with friends after a lecture is often as informative as the lecture. Not only do you learn about the subject, but you learn to be with people who are quite different to those you knew before.” Online learning portals can also use learning analytics to track whether students are keeping up, while predictive modelling can flag if a student is likely to drop out and alert tutors that they may need to provide more support. “Academically, it can be very difficult for students to be noticed in large settings. In a lecture hall with hundreds of others, it’s impossible really to know if they are understanding,” says Littlejohn. Imogen Dear, a second-year criminology and sociology student at the University of Surrey, has been told to expect eight to nine hours of lectures and seminars per week with bite-size videos, key reading and activities. “Our lecturers will be able to see if we’re viewing the videos, reading and activities, and I presume if we’re not taking part in online learning, we’ll have a one-to-one meeting with our personal tutor,” she says. “I’m not worried about the blended learning, or them tracking my work – it actually motivates me.” According to Helen Higson, provost and deputy vice-chancellor at Aston University, students would do better to focus on quality of contact, rather than quantity. “Lots of research shows that it isn’t contact hours but class size that makes the difference,” she says. In 2015 the government lifted a cap on university places in England, allowing institutions to recruit as many students as they wanted, which in some instances led to large class sizes and “a more passive learning experience”. “Universities have had a bad press over the past few years, and in a way justifiably, because we didn’t look at our core purpose,” she says. “Our core purpose is transforming lives, and we’ve been forced to do that.” But will 2020-21 students be at a disadvantage if, as some experts warn, too many students defer their university place this year? Overcrowding is already a problem in some places: earlier this year students at prestigious universities were being turned away from lectures and told to watch classes online or in overflow rooms. Rachel Hewitt, director of policy and advocacy at Hepi, thinks those fears are largely unfounded. A demographic dip means there are fewer 18-year-olds this year fighting for places, with numbers only expected to return to pre-2016 levels after the 2020-21 cohort. The uncertainty of coronavirus may make this September’s students think twice about postponing, she says. “When there are no options for travelling and less part-time work available, it may be we don’t see such high numbers taking a year out.” She advises would-be students to look beyond contact hours and class sizes and find out about support structures, availability of tutors, information about how prospective universities will support students into a job, and employability data. “Students really have to look at the bigger picture,” she says. There could be benefits from the coronavirus pandemic for the 2021 intake, too. The rapid changes have forced universities to be creative, and overhaul their online offerings, says Ian Dunn, provost of Coventry University. “I see it as a huge opportunity to do things differently,” he says. At Coventry, academics work hand-in-hand with learning designers to “create a story and bring a richness of resources” to online courses, almost turning learning into a game, he adds. “It’s not a set of powerpoint slides, or someone doing an hour’s lecture into a video camera. Good online resources might include an introductory two-minute video, then maybe links to resources, maybe a quiz.” Eva Terziyski, a second-year history and Russian student at the University of Bristol, says her key advice to newbies is not to fixate on what the university provides, but to make sure you are mentally prepared to self-motivate. “It’s not like school, where you’re going to get shouted at if you miss a class,” she says. “You’re paying to be there, so really your success is your responsibility.”",education
"It is the latest in a long line of government U-turns in recent months, but how will Downing Street’s policy shift on face masks affect children going back to schools in England next month? After a cabinet minister claimed on Tuesday morning that the policy was not under review, the government revised its guidance on face coverings for staff and children in secondary schools in England. In areas of the country with high levels of Covid-19, defined as “areas of national government intervention”, such as lockdown areas including Greater Manchester, children in year 7 and above and adults are being advised to wear face coverings in schools “when moving around, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing is difficult”. The guidance states “it will not usually be necessary” to wear masks in classrooms, where protective measures mean the risks are lower. The new policy falls under the category of guidance rather than “mandatory activity”, the government says. It adds that “any legal exemptions that apply to the wearing of face coverings in shops and on public transport also apply to this new advice”. Asked what would happen to anyone who does not follow the guidance on masks, a Department for Education spokesman said: “The wellbeing of all children, young people and staff should be the central focus when preparing for the reopening of schools at a local level. No one should be excluded from education on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering. As would be usual, if there are any concerns about a child or young person behaving or acting in a way which doesn’t align with school policy or procedure, their behaviour or actions should be discussed with them to resolve those concerns.” The government is not saying face coverings are necessary in secondary schools outside of local lockdown areas, but says it is giving heads discretion over whether to apply the guidance. “Schools and colleges will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, if they believe that it is right in their particular circumstances,” the guidance states. It gives examples of why school leaders might decide to recommend face coverings for pupils and staff, such as because the layout of the school makes social distancing difficult. On Monday the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said the evidence on whether or not children over 12 should wear masks in schools was “not strong”. However, the new guidance references the World Health Organization’s updated position – also endorsed by Unicef, the UN children’s agency – on 21 August which said: “Children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.” The government had also come under pressure from unions including the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents more than 19,000 senior staff, over the issue. Downing Street’s policy shift was announced hours after Scotland’s education secretary said on Tuesday that all Scottish secondary school pupils over the age of 12 should wear face coverings in communal areas including corridors from Monday. On dedicated school transport, all children aged five and over should cover their faces, the Scottish government also said. Northern Ireland has said it is making a similar move. On Wednesday, following a review, the Welsh government announced it was recommending face masks be worn in schools by those aged over 11 in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained, as well as on school buses. Not quite. The government’s latest policy about-turn has prompted criticism from its own backbenches, with the senior Tory MP Huw Merriman urging Downing Street to “get a grip”. In a stinging attack, he told the BBC on Wednesday: “The worry is that if we’re saying it’s unsafe in the corridors, the next thing it’ll be unsafe in the classroom, and that will really prove an impediment on people’s learning. And, quite frankly, as a Conservative MP that came into politics to try to help people’s life chances through school, I am sick and tired of the way that we are treating our young people. I feel it’s an absolute disgrace and I really feel the government needs to get a grip and just be certain, get on with it and inspire confidence rather than just completely changing its mind.”",education
"More than 300,000 students in England will be required to wear face coverings when schools reopen next week – although thousands of pupils could be told within days that they are no longer mandatory. There was confusion among MPs after Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announced in an 11th-hour U-turn that secondary school pupils in lockdown areas would be required to wear face masks in communal spaces from next week. The government was also accused on Wednesday of providing “completely inadequate” support to schools in England after it emerged that they would receive just 10 Covid testing kits each before the start of term next week. The kits were part of the government’s attempts to reassure anxious parents and staff but were immediately criticised by teaching unions. The rule requiring face masks applies to about 330,000 pupils at more than 300 secondary schools in Greater Manchester, parts of Lancashire, West Yorkshire and Leicester. However, some areas including Stockport are expected to have restrictions eased within days, meaning the mandatory face mask rule would no longer apply. There are nearly 15,000 pupils in the town’s 14 state-funded secondary schools. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, will announce which areas can be removed from the restrictions after his weekly “gold command” meeting with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, and the Joint Biosecurity Centre on Thursday. Decisions taken at this meeting are usually announced on Friday, which would leave only one working day before most schools reopen on Tuesday. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said he would write to Hancock on Wednesday to ask for Stockport and Bolton to be removed from the restrictions after a consistent drop in the infection rate in the towns. The Labour MP Lucy Powell said: “Speaking as the MP for Manchester Central, urgent clarity is needed from the government about which areas the face mask rules cover because headteachers and parents need this clarification.” Stockport has the lowest infection rate in Greater Manchester. Nav Mishra, Labour MP for Stockport, said he was “cautious but not against” the restrictions being lifted but was concerned that the infection rate would rise when schools return next week. On face masks, he added: “The level of ambiguity and lack of information [from central government] is just not acceptable.” The leader of Bolton council has also called for the town to be removed from the restrictions after its infection rate fell to 12.9 cases per 100,000 people, the lowest level for a month. More than 19,000 secondary school pupils will be required to wear a face covering when schools return next week but that could change within days if restrictions are lifted. William Wragg, the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport, said there was cross-party consensus in Stockport that the borough should be freed from lockdown restrictions. He accepted there would be issues with cross-border confusion, with Stockport bordering Manchester and Tameside – where leaders accept that rates remain too high to lift the restrictions. “Obviously the restrictions apply to where you are a resident as opposed to where you are going. There is no perfect system, it is always going to be possible to take issue with any aspect of it,” he said. If Stockport comes out of lockdown, Wragg said it “would be up to the discretion of the headteachers” at the town’s schools how to deal with masks. Some Stockport schools have children from Manchester and Tameside. “It’s very difficult to issue guidance for every individual scenario,” he said. Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, whose constituency straddles Stockport and Tameside, said: “I have a concern that half of my constituency is in one borough, half is in the other. There is a seamless continuation of urbanisation between the two.” One street, Thornley Lane North, is in three boroughs, said Gwynne, and it was “bonkers” that people living in the Stockport section would have more freedom than other residents, he said.

"The educationist Sir Ken Robinson, proponent of the encouragement of creativity among children, who has died aged 70 of cancer, was largely ignored by politicians of both main parties as he insisted that the policy of successive UK governments, that literacy and numeracy should predominate, was a false priority. As he told interviewers: “That’s like saying let’s make the cake and if it’s all right we’ll put the eggs in.” Reputedly one lesson can change the course of a pupil’s career – Robinson became an exemplar of the much rarer idea that one speech can change a teacher’s whole trajectory. It was an off-the-cuff, 19-minute address without notes entitled Do Schools Kill Creativity? at a TED (technology, entertainment and design) educational conference in California in 2006 that propelled him to something approaching worldwide celebrity within and beyond education. His wry and witty extempore style, honed in Liverpool, was characteristically engaging. Subsequently posted on YouTube, the talk has reputedly been viewed by 380 million people in 160 countries and has influenced schools around the world. In that speech, and at other less noticed conferences and less well attended seminars over many years, Robinson argued that children do not grow into artistic creativity but are educated out of it by school systems that prioritise academic achievement and conformity instead of liberating imagination and initiative. He told the audience in 2006: “I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new concept of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way we strip-mined the earth for a particular commodity. We have to rethink the fundamental principles in which we are educating our children.” Understandably, this was much more enticing to the education profession than it was to government ministers, but it was based not on a single speech but Robinson’s whole career in academic education, which culminated in a professorship at Warwick University (1989-2001), before he became a senior adviser to the J Paul Getty Trust in Los Angeles. If the argument was that individual creativity was stifled by the system, it was less easy to discern how that might be recreated within a state education with its emphasis on attainment targets and examination results. The Blair government at least invited him to chair an inquiry in 1997, which produced a report, All Our Futures, but then largely ignored it; while Michael Gove as education secretary and his special adviser Dominic Cummings chose snide derision to dismiss the establishment “blob” of which they felt he was clearly a part. Robinson himself said in an interview with the Independent in 2018: “If I didn’t piss somebody off I’d probably be doing something wrong, but I don’t set out to do it.” He told Kirsty Young on Desert Island Discs in 2013 that schools should have discretion to develop creativity: “Don’t treat children as the same or over-programme them, they find their talents by trying things out.”  But Robinson admitted on the programme that he had benefited from an academic education system and insisted he was not opposed to a national curriculum, but just wanted one with different priorities and parity of esteem between core subjects and artistic ones such as dance. The fifth of seven children of Ethel (nee Allen) and James Robinson, he was born in an impoverished household in Liverpool, close to Everton’s Goodison Park football ground. His father worked at various jobs, including running a pub and as a docker, and was left paraplegic after his back was broken in a dockside accident when Ken was nine. He himself spent eight months in hospital after being diagnosed with polio at the age of four, thereafter walking with a limp, ending any chance of playing for the local club, though his brother Neil did so. Instead, Robinson’s parents encouraged him academically. He was initially educated at a special school for children with disabilities but passed the 11-plus and attended Liverpool Collegiate school, proceeding to study for a Bachelor of Education degree at Bretton Hall College, west Yorkshire, founded by the educationist Alec Clegg, which specialised in the arts. It had a formative effect on his career and he went on to complete a doctorate in drama and theatre in education at London University. His subsequent career focused on the arts in education, working on a schools’ council project which became his first book, Learning Through Drama (1977), and running courses for teachers. In the early 1980s he was lead researcher and author of the Arts in Schools project for the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and after that became the director of the Arts in Schools project, which in turn helped to shape the national curriculum after the 1988 Baker Act. He founded and chaired Artswork, the national youth arts development agency and founded and co-edited Arts Express magazine, before joining the staff at Warwick. The invitation to join the Getty Trust in California came in early January 2001: “It was cold and wet – what would you do? We went as fast as we could.” Robinson was the author of several more books, including Out of Our Minds: Learning to Be Creative (2001), Finding Your Element (2014) and Creative Schools (2015). He was knighted in 2003. Robinson’s success at the TED conference, where he spoke three times over a number of years, propelled him into a different financial and celebrity league. His friend and agent Brendan Barns said: “What really set Ken apart from other speakers and educationists was his ability instantly to create rapport with his audiences. He made everyone feel he was talking to them personally.” Robinson met Marie-Therese Watts, known as Terry, while giving a course in Liverpool in 1977. They married in 1982 and had two children, James and Kate. The couple returned to live in London last year to be near Kate and her baby daughter, Adeline. Terry and their children survive him.",education
"Covid-19 infections and outbreaks were “uncommon” in English schools after they reopened in June, according to a Public Health England report. A study released by the health agency on Sunday found there were 67 individual cases, four “co-primary” cases and 30 outbreaks of Covid-19 in schools during June. Co-primary cases were defined as two or more confirmed cases with a common epidemiological link diagnosed at the same time, while outbreaks were defined as two or more epidemiologically linked cases where subsequent cases were diagnosed within 14 days. The 67 single cases were made up of 30 students and 37 staff. A total of 121 cases were linked to the outbreaks – 30 in children and 91 in staff. More than a million children attended school in the month. No children were admitted to hospital. One teacher was admitted to intensive care for respiratory support. Over the same period, 25,470 cases were recorded in England overall, PHE said. Its report said: “Staff members need to be more vigilant for exposure outside the school setting to protect themselves, their families and the educational settings.” It said there was a strong correlation between the regional incidence of Covid-19 and the number of outbreaks in educational settings, which “emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission”. The potential for spread means school closures may be necessary as part of lockdown in regions with increasing community transmission, but these “should probably be considered only in extremis”, it added. The analysis, conducted by researchers from St George’s University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found children were more likely to acquire the virus at home rather than at school. “What we found essentially was that there was a very low risk [of transmission] among children and staff at the time,” Dr Shamez Ladhani, one of the report’s authors, told Sky News. “But you have to understand that these were circumstances where we had just come out of the lockdown and there were very small school numbers that were open at the time with very small classes.” He said most children who got Covid got it at home, often from parents who were key workers, and “most of the infection and transmission in schools is driven by staff”. The UK’s chief medical officers have said children are more at risk of long-term harm if they do not attend school than if they return to the classroom despite coronavirus. In a joint statement, the advisers said children had an “exceptionally low risk of dying” from Covid-19.",education
"Unions have reacted angrily to claims that coronavirus is more likely to be spread by teachers than pupils, warning that everyone has a responsibility to try to avoid bringing Covid-19 into school and transmitting it to others. It follows a report by Public Health England (PHE) which found that though Covid-19 outbreaks were “uncommon” in English schools after they reopened in June, the virus was more likely to be spread by staff than pupils. While children rarely suffer seriously from the effects of Covid, there has been considerable focus on how much they spread the virus. The majority of cases identified in the report, however, were linked to outbreaks among staff, who were warned to be “more vigilant” regarding exposure outside school. Responding to the report, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “Everyone in school, whether staff member or pupil, has a responsibility and important role to play in ensuring they follow the mitigation measures and do all they can to avoid bringing Covid into the school or to transmitting it to others.” He went on: “It is essential that appropriate measures are in place to minimise the risk of Covid-19 being transmitted between children, young people and between adults in schools. Effective social distancing measures, cleaning, infection control measures and good hygiene practices are essential in reducing the risks. “As with any workplace, school employers must also focus their attention on the controls needed to minimise the virus being spread amongst staff.” Roach also said that some staff were still waiting to be told about safety arrangements for their return to school next week. “Whilst staff should be fully consulted and informed about the risk control measures that should be in place, there are many schools that have not yet confirmed what arrangements will be in place for next week.” The news came as teachers in Northern Ireland registered their discomfort at the prospect of returning to school, with three-quarters of those who responded to a union survey saying that they did not believe it was safe to do so. With schools in Northern Ireland beginning to return on Monday, 77% of NASUWT respondents said that they did not feel their school was ready. A further 61% said they had not been consulted by their school or college. During the pandemic health workers have been hailed as heroes but teachers have attracted criticism from some parts of the media. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, paid tribute to teachers’ professionalism. “We are asking teachers to do something really unique which is to go in to schools where social distancing is very difficult and to spend hours a day with hundreds of children. “The fact that the vast majority of teachers want to go back shows their dedication and professionalism. It’s very easy for government or PHE to undermine the profession either directly or by insinuation, but this is the worst time to do it.” The NEU said schools and colleges were doing all they could to ensure buildings were as Covid secure as possible, but the union was concerned there was still no plan B in the even of further outbreaks and the test and trace system was not sufficiently reliable.",education
"For Christian Jones, who has just finished a master’s in broadcast journalism at City University of London, the rapid shift to online learning due to Covid-19 came as a bit of a shock. “I spent the first week not setting alarms,” he says. “It’s easy to end up going to bed late and waking up really late. Then you don’t get anything done.” Students in the UK have been prevented from entering lecture theatres since late March, and so have had to quickly adjust to studying online. According to the latest government guidance, students in England could be confined to their halls of residence in the new term, so it’s expected that blended learning – a mix of online and face-to-face teaching – will continue.  “Universities will do as much as possible on campus, however the reality is that most large-scale group teaching and learning activities are going to happen online,” Neil Morris, dean of digital education at the University of Leeds, says. “Students need to be prepared for that.” But there’s no need to panic, according to Dr Damon Miller from the Open University. “Generally people are nervous at the beginning, but don’t worry – you won’t be left to it on your own.” Before you get going, you’ll want to consider the equipment you’ll need. It’ll help to have a laptop with a decent screen or stand. Check whether you can get a student discount, and whether your university offers a laptop loan service. Next, set out a study space so you can work without distractions. “Make sure your work area is not your recreation area,” says Matt Huxley, a lecturer at Staffordshire University London. “It might just be going to sit in the kitchen or on the sofa, but it’s about the psychological impact [of having a separate space].” This also helps limit distractions “so you’re not watching TV as well as studying”, adds Huxley. If your university puts on digital skills workshops, Morris recommends that you attend them. “I would strongly advise students to engage really thoughtfully with the IT induction that’s being offered and with the digital skills training,” he says. Once you’ve got the basics down, ensure you have the right online etiquette. “That’s being aware of your surroundings and how you present yourself virtually,” Huxley explains. Make sure your microphone is muted and that you’re not sitting with the window behind you so other people can’t see you. “You should also wear clothes,” Huxley says. “You’d be surprised, I’ve seen people in bed without their T-shirts on before.” The usual study techniques still apply. It’s good to consider what type of learner you are – perhaps you’re a visual learner and should make use of any extra reading materials given out. Or maybe you’re an inquisitive learner and like to ask questions, in which case you can use tutorial time for further discussion. It’s also good to keep a pen and paper with you and note down any questions that come up, Huxley says. Students like Jones say one of the main things they’ve learned is the importance of keeping to a structure. “If you have a scheduled lecture on Zoom, it’s good to do it in that slot,” says Maisie Marston, who has just graduated from a politics degree at Cardiff University. “Then you keep to a structure and can ask questions, which makes it feel more like you’re at uni.” Studying can be tiring, whether it’s online or in person, so don’t try and fit too much in. “The main thing is to plan your time and take breaks,” Miller says. Marston agrees. “It’s worthwhile to grab a coffee or sit outside, to have a change of scenery,” she says. Online learning doesn’t have to be anti-social. For example, you could study alongside people you live with. Marston says studying with her girlfriend helped to keep her motivated. “It’s nice to study with someone else, so you can stay focused and make lots of tea for each other,” she says. You can also meet new people and connect online, Miller says. “Social media is a good way of keeping in touch. Even if you’re sitting alone on your laptop, you are not alone, there’s a massive support network there,” he says. If you’re struggling, ask for help and your university should support you. “Things go wrong, computers crash, people get ill. What [students] shouldn’t do is shy away and hide and not contact the university. That’s the worst thing they can do,” says Miller. “We’ve got a dedicated student support team, so ask for help.”",education
"A-level students who were downgraded by the controversial government algorithm are relieved after universities confirmed their places for this year. “I could not believe what I had read,” said Leah Glenday, of the message she received on Friday confirming her place at Girton College, Cambridge, after the anxiety of a week believing her dreams had been dashed. The first pupil from her school to be offered a place at Cambridge, and said to be the first looked-after child from the London borough of Haringey to receive an Oxbridge offer, Glenday said she was still in a dreamlike state and had not processed the fact she would form part of Girton’s class of 2020. “I ran over to my foster mum and started crying,” she said, remembering the moment she received the email confirming her place. “I couldn’t stop crying or talk, so I just showed her the phone. I had accepted the fact I wasn’t going there. That’s why I just cried because I had nothing else to say.” Glenday said she would not believe what had happened until she was at Cambridge on her first day. She hoped her story could serve as inspiration to other fostered children. “Children who have gone through a challenging upbringing can see themselves as unlucky, but they need to realise it can serve to their advantage,” she said. “It initiates your driving passion to pursue a certain cause and sticks us out from the crowd.” Glenday has plans to become a family law barrister, after her foster parents had to go to court to ensure her younger siblings could join Glenday and her sister in their home. She said: “During my GCSEs, when I found out I had a little brother and sister who were going to be adopted and I couldn’t ever see them, I was traumatised. “My foster parents went to court to bring them into my placement. If it wasn’t for the barrister saying I should write letters for her to read out in court, my family might not have been able to come together. So I just want to give back and help keep other families together.” Despite Gavin Williamson’s U-turn on Monday, thousands of children’s futures remain in the balance as universities – who had already allocated places on the basis of the grades calculated with the algorithm – assess whether they have extra space. Despite the joy of Glenday and others, some have been forced to defer for a year, while the status of some remains unknown. For Nina Bunting-Mitcham, who attended a state college in Peterborough, and received DDD under the now-ditched system despite scoring As and Bs in her mock exams, the past week was traumatising but ended in huge relief after the Royal Veterinary College accepted her to study veterinary medicine after the government’s volte-face. “I tried not to lose hope but it was hard,” she said. “Veterinary medicine was the only thing I wanted to do in life. I love animals more than people, to be honest.” Bunting-Mitcham, 18, told the schools minister, Nick Gibb, on live radio last Friday that he had ruined her life and, despite the change in policy – which came after he had spoken to teachers at her school about the algorithmic disparity – she remains bruised by the affair. “No government should put people through that trauma, it’s affected thousands of students’ confidence and self-belief,” she said. “I don’t think anybody in this age range will be voting for them after this. They’ve shown their incompetence once and for all.” It remains unclear whether she must undertake a foundation year before her five-year course.",education
"My father, Chris Rice, who has died aged 80 of amyloidosis, was an inspiring lecturer in human resource management at Nottingham Trent University for almost 30 years. Born in Bristol, Chris was the only child of Norman Rice, a clerk, and his wife, Doris (nee Maunder), who later worked in the box office at Bristol Hippodrome. After passing the 11-plus, Chris went to Bristol grammar school, then Southampton University, where he studied engineering and enjoyed playing rugby and jazz. There, he met Maureen Bishop, who later became a social worker, and they married in 1963. After finishing his course, Chris changed direction to train in human resources at Glasgow School of Management Studies (1962-63). He then worked as a personnel manager at Salters, West Bromwich, and at the Oxford University Press paper mill. Deciding to apply for a lecturing post at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University) in 1970, without formal teaching qualifications, was a brave move, but it paid off. In teaching, Chris found his vocation. He was a committed, approachable and engaging lecturer, whose smile lit up the room. He enjoyed taking the floor and making students laugh with his genuinely funny stories. He often taught mature, part-time students on release from their day jobs looking to gain the professional qualifications needed to move ahead with their careers. As a teenager, I distinctly remember ex-students recognising Chris when we were out as a family in Nottingham. They would rush up with joy and excitement, shake his hand and embrace him. It was clear what a difference he made to people’s lives. He gained an MPhil from the University of Nottingham in 1980 and wrote a valuable textbook, Consumer Behaviour – Behavioural Aspects of Marketing (1993, republished in 1997 as Understanding Customers) – but students were always at the heart of his work. A great enthusiast, Chris had many passions – he loved music, especially jazz and classical, and was an amazing cook who spent hours in the kitchen. He walked the Pennine Way with my sister, Emma, and I as teenagers, ran the London marathon and enjoyed watching sport. He had fun travelling with Maureen and loved Italy best of all. He was warm, funny and sociable. In 1999, Chris retired from his senior lecturer post and after a few years my parents moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Living near to us gave them more time with their beloved granddaughters. Chris followed my sister, Emma’s career from actor to theatre director with great pride. Chris is survived by Maureen, Emma and me, and by three granddaughters.",education
"My husband, James Dunn, who has died aged 80, was emeritus Lightfoot professor of divinity at Durham University. Internationally known as a New Testament scholar and writer, Jimmy was an active church member and above all a family man. He could teach, supervise and write with authority on almost every aspect of the New Testament, and this range and versatility made him one of the best known and most influential British New Testament scholars of his generation. He was a prolific writer – 50 books in 50 years, many of which remain key texts for theological studies around the world. The youngest of four sons, Jimmy was born in Birmingham to Scottish parents, David Dunn, a salesman for an engineering company, and his wife, Nancy (nee Orr). The death of his father left his mother to return to Scotland alone when Jimmy was 10 months old and raise four boys alone, during the second world war; a struggle with sacrifice and many hardships. He was educated at Hutchesons boys’ grammar school in Glasgow where, through the Scripture Union, Jimmy came to the faith that marked his life. After seven years’ study at Glasgow University, he left with degrees in economics (MA Hons) and divinity (BD), and a wife; he and I had known each other since schooldays, and we married in 1963. Then he undertook PhD studies at Cambridge University in 1965. There his eyes were opened to so many larger worlds, confirmed by two years as chaplain to overseas students in Edinburgh, before he rejoined academia at Nottingham and, in 1982, as professor of divinity, at Durham, where he remained until his retirement in 2003. His writing in New Testament and Pauline studies enhanced his reputation, culminating in three large volumes (2003-15), entitled Christianity in the Making. His work was recognised by his presidency of Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas and with a fellowship of the British Academy. It was always his desire and intention to encourage and educate all members of the Christian church to learn more of their faith. This he did by the clarity and simplicity with which he could impart the findings of his rigorous research. His enthusiasm for his subject, the depth of his faith, the warmth of his personality and the “call me Jimmy” greetingwon the hearts of many. But it was his family that was the bedrock from which all else flowed. Almost every book he wrote acknowledged the immense debt he felt that he owed to me, to our three children, Catrina, David and Fiona, and seven grandchildren. However, that “debt” was amply repaid by the concern for and interest in all our lives, by the fun and games he so enjoyed, in the pride he took in our various achievements and his love demonstrated in so many ways.",education
"Name: Hamlet. Age: 30. Appearance: Ready to take arms. Against what? A sea of troubles. And by opposing end them? That’s the idea. But what trouble, exactly? Orthographic irregularities. Sorry? Spelling trouble. I must say, I don’t remember this part at all. To end once and for all the maddening inconsistencies that make it so hard for our children to write English. I remember the ghost at the beginning and the bit where he holds up a skull. That’s the play. The play’s the thing. This is the campaign run by the English Spelling Society (ESS) to overhaul the written language. They have enlisted Hamlet’s help. They know he’s not real, right? More specifically, they have enlisted the opening lines of Hamlet’s most famous soliloquy to offer a comparison of six competing revised spelling schemes. To be or not to be, that is the question? Yes, or “Too be or not too be, that is the qestshen” in something called Rich-Spel-long. There are plenty of people who spell like that already. There’s the rub: poor spelling can mark someone out as ignorant or ill-informed. I know – it’s very handy and saves time. In the coming months, the ESS will hold an online session of the International English Spelling Congress to vote for the best scheme of the six. How long has this campaign been going on? Since 1908. They haven’t got very far, have they? Not yet. George Bernard Shaw was a supporter, and he used revised spellings in printed versions of his plays, but that’s about the extent of it. Anyway, I’m sure there’s a reason English is spelled the way it is. There are lots of reasons: the mix of French and Anglo-Saxon words; early, non-English printers making it up as they went along. The result is an illogical system, threw and through. Illogical, yes, but is there any harm in it? The ESS reckons it takes English-speaking children twice as long to learn to read and write as those who speak other languages. Oh well, as long as they get there in the end, as Hamlet said. He never said that. Do say: “Too sleep, perchans too dreem, ie, thairz the rub.” Don’t say: “Actually, in this instance it may be nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”",education
"As schools in England and Wales get set to reopen amid continued controversy over safe conditions, attention has focused on potential evidence of coronavirus transmission in the classroom and on the experiences of other countries. Research on the ability of children of different ages to catch and transmit the virus is contradictory, and differences in education systems and social conventions make comparisons difficult. One complicating factor is what epidemiologists call contact matrices: the degree to which different age groups mix, particularly within extended multigenerational families, which can vary from society to society and from group to group within a society. Countries have taken different approaches but some of the questions are broadly familiar. Should all children and staff be required to wear masks, or only some age groups? Should children be tested for the virus? How should social distancing be managed in the classroom and playground? And finally, should schools be reopening at all? With a recent sharp resurgence in virus cases, France has issued some of the most detailed guidelines for when schools reopen. Children in secondary schools will have to wear face coverings at all times when in school and in the playground, the education minister said on Thursday, as France reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases since the easing of restrictions. This is a change from recommendations in July that face coverings for older children would only be necessary where 1-metre social distancing could not be managed, and is a response to concerns from teaching unions about rising infections as the summer has gone on. While there were class size restrictions when French schools first reopened, in the new term there will be no size limits and the 1-metre social rule is advised but is not mandatory. Poland plans to reopen schools next week for the first time since mid-March despite reaching a record high number of daily registered coronavirus infections late last week.  It has said it will not mandate mask wearing for children in the classroom. However, it has said individual principals can decide to impose face coverings in school halls and locker rooms. Unlike in some other countries, no temperature checks at the school gates will be introduced. With one of the world’s highest per capita death rates from Covid-19 during the pandemic, Belgium has looked closely at the issue of masks in the classroom. When schools reopen on 1 September all children aged 12 and above and teachers will be required to wear masks, following an announcement by the prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, last week. “The goal is to avoid a second wave,” she told a news conference. “We see today that the situation is stabilising and improving. It is very important that children go to school.” Germany has drawn attention in recent days because of the experience of Berlin where, after reopening in the last fortnight, several dozen schools have had to close because of infections. Officials say most infections in Berlin involve only one teacher or student, and suggest that the transmission occurred outside the school. Berlin has responded by closing schools for very brief periods to allow contact tracing. “So far, these are isolated cases and not outbreaks,” Valerie Kirchberger, a paediatrician and coordinator of Berlin’s testing strategy, led by Charité hospital, told local media. Unlike in countries where education is organised on a national level, German schools are run regionally. While some German states have made face coverings mandatory at all times in schools, in others they are compulsory only in hallways and playgrounds. More generally, schools across the country have tried to manage the risk of infection by keeping classes separate. Regarded as one of the world’s most intensive education systems, South Korea struggled with reopening, delaying restarting schools multiple times and then phasing in different age groups. While a resurgence of infections in the country forced schools to close again, they have resorted to numerous tactics to keep operating, including attendance on alternate days and temperature checks. One of the first western countries to reopen its schools, in April, Denmark separated younger children into “micro-groups” of 12 known as “protective bubbles”. With school starting times staggered and desks 2 metres apart, masks were not deemed necessary. However, Denmark had relatively low infection numbers in the wider population, the result of quick and effective early suppression of the kind advocated by the British public health expert Devi Sridhar, who has emphasised that suppressing community transmission is ultimately what will make schools safe. As of 18 May, children aged 12-16 had returned to secondary schools following similar rules. Israel has emerged as one of the major cautionary tales. Having managed its initial outbreak relatively successfully, it reopened its schools in May, initially sending a limited number of classes children back in small “capsules” to minimise the risk of transmission. In a surprise move, however, the government then announced that all grades could return and lifted restrictions on class sizes. The reopening contributed to a resurgence of the virus, with tens of thousands of pupils later sent into quarantine as their classmates tested positive. Underlining the differing considerations in different parts of the world, Kenya’s schools will not reopen until at least January. As David Lagakos and Emilie Yam wrote in a piece for the World Economic Forum’s website, “low-income countries face a very different set of circumstances from high-income countries – for example, a higher proportion of households that include both children and elderly people … and the urgency of maintaining the livelihoods of working-age adults to prevent hunger and poverty.” With a school year running from January to November, officials have relied on the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to run school programmes via the radio, TV and internet since students stopped going to classes in March.",education
"Teaching unions have expressed their frustration at the introduction of last-minute guidance on the reopening of secondary schools in England, which says schools in local lockdown areas should introduce a rota system to limit attendance and compulsory face masks in communal areas. The guidance, issued on Friday ahead of English schools reopening for the start of the new academic year next week, is intended to limit the amount of contact between staff and students in schools, and provide enough time at home for symptoms to become apparent. Initially, the new guidance had said that if a single case of coronavirus was confirmed, every pupil in the affected person’s year group or “bubble” might have to quarantine for two weeks. However, this passage was removed by the Department for Education shortly after publication on Friday night. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the changes to school attendance were an “absolute last resort”, and only for a “worst-case scenario”. “We hope that we won’t have to implement the guidance set out today,” he said. However, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the timing of the introduction of the new guidance was “unfair” to headteachers and school leaders. “School leaders have been asking all summer for information about what they should do in the event of local restrictions in their area,” she told Sky News. “And [it’s] really unfair, I think, to heads, that [the guidelines] are sent out late on a Friday night, at the start of a bank holiday, days before the first day of the new school term. “Heads are going to feel under a lot of pressure now, over this weekend, to start looking at these, thinking about how they will implement them in their schools, whether they will have to make any changes to arrangements they’ve already put in place.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, where some boroughs are still under local lockdown restrictions, said the guidance was “fairly clear, but it was very late”. “It came out at 7.30pm on the Friday before a bank holiday,” he told BBC Breakfast. “Why is the government doing this again, putting out guidance so late so that headteachers don’t have time to prepare?” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that school leaders felt a “weary, resigned sense of inevitability” at the timing of the new guidelines. Asked how teachers would feel about the situation, he said: “Here we are again, right at the last minute with something that we have been accused of expressing treachery in asking for – where’s the plan B in case of local lockdown – at last it has arrived.” Echoing this, Paul Whiteman, the leader of the NAHT union, said headteachers had been asking for a contingency plan for what would happen in the case of an outbreak for weeks. He described the timing of the guidance as “reprehensible”. “It was obvious weeks ago that lockdown advice was necessary,” he said. “The government’s decision to publish this at 9pm on the Friday of the bank holiday weekend before most schools are due to return is nothing short of reprehensible and demonstrates a complete lack of regard for the wellbeing of school leaders and their teams. “Keeping schools open has to be the priority, but you don’t need a crystal ball to see that there will almost inevitably be some disruption in some areas in the coming weeks,” he added, saying that “another late-night publication is fairly typical of what we’ve become used to”. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the advice should have been available “months ago”. She said: “It is simply unacceptable that this guidance was altered immediately on what is a key issue for schools – what to do when pupils are found to have Covid. As it stands currently there is still no clarity on what should happen in a school where there is an outbreak. This does not build confidence in government’s competence to keep schools safe when it scores such an own goal.”  Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, the Teachers’ Union, was the latest union official to criticise the last minute announcement. “We have been saying for some time that schools need clarity on these important issues and that it is the responsibility of the government to provide that clarity,” he said. Roach also called on the government to provide extra funding for schools to employ surplus staff in the case that schools were affected by local lockdown measures, saying there needed to be greater recognition of the impact of local restrictions on teachers and staff. “The availability of staff where there is a local lockdown or outbreak may mean that schools have to limit provision if they cannot be staffed safely,” he said. “The government now needs to confirm that schools will have the additional resources they need to deliver an effective remote learning offer to all pupils as well as funding for additional staff that will be necessary to maintain continuity of provision in the event of local disruption.” Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee, acknowledged that the late-hour release of the guidance was “incredibly difficult” for teachers. While Halfon said he did not know why the government decided to release the information so close to the reopening of schools, he said it was “better that it’s there”. Asked about the removal of a paragraph shortly after the guidance was released, Halfon said: “Clearly these things shouldn’t happen and mistakes obviously have been made, and been rectified, but the important thing is that the guidance is right.”",education
"Next year’s GCSE and A-level exams should be sat later in the summer to give pupils valuable time to catch up, according to a proposal by Labour that is likely to be backed by influential Tory MPs and school leaders. Before the new academic year begins for most schools this week, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the two sets of exams should be pushed back by at least a month and begin in June rather than May. “Pupils across the country who have missed out on vital teaching time will have a mountain to climb to prepare for May exams unless the government steps in,” Green said. “Ministers had warning after warning about problems with this year’s exam results, but allowed it to descend into a fiasco. This is too important for Boris Johnson to leave until the last minute. Pupils heading back to school need clarity and certainty about the year ahead.” Labour’s intervention highlights another sore spot between the Department for Education and Ofqual, the exam regulator for England. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has supported the idea of delaying 2021’s A-levels and GCSEs, telling parliament in July that he was consulting with Ofqual “about how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn and really flourish”. But in a consultation document issued several weeks later Ofqual made no commitment to delaying exams, merely saying it would “work with the DfE, exam boards, regulators in Wales and Northern Ireland, and groups representing schools, colleges and higher education to consider the best approach, and we will confirm our decisions as soon as possible”. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education committee, has also come out in favour of delaying exams. Halfon said Ofqual needs to make up its mind by October whether exams will go ahead or even be replaced again by assessments, to avoid a repeat of this year’s turmoil. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said Labour’s proposal was worthy of consideration. “A delay is not without its problems. A consequential delay to the publication of results will put pressure on higher education providers such as universities and colleges as well as employers. All this will need to be dealt with. “It is not just about timing. It is obvious that learning could be severely disrupted throughout the year and no one can say with certainty that we will be able to run exams in the normal way in 2021,” said Whiteman. A DfE spokesperson said: “We recognise that students due to take exams next summer will have experienced disruption to their education, which is why we prioritised bringing year 10 and year 12 pupils back to school last term. “Exams will go ahead next year, and we have been working closely with the sector, Ofqual and exam boards to consider our approach.” The call for delay came as schools hurry to prepare their buildings and timetables for the new year, as well as organising extra tutoring to help pupils catch up. Schools also have only a few days to decide if pupils are to be entered for the special exam series for October and November that has been organised for those unhappy with their assessments this summer. Some pupils taking BTec vocational qualifications reported that they had still not received their grades despite a promise by Pearson, the exam board, that they would all be delivered by the end of last week. Many teachers have been sceptical of efforts to restrict the spread of Covid-19 within their schools. Some 86% who responded to a poll hosted by the TES in July said they thought minimising contact between pupils would not be achievable when schools reopen.",education
"My mother, Wendy Sturgess, who has died aged 87, initially qualified and worked as a librarian but taught English as a foreign language for most of her career. Latterly, she was active in the University of the Third Age (U3A), teaching Italian to students and running a local poetry group in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. She was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to Winifred (nee Clarke) and Ormond Harris, and grew up there with her sister, Joan. Her father had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the first world war; this made it difficult for him to find employment on his release and he worked as a ledger clerk in a travel agency and then as a bookseller. Wendy’s early life was affected by the loss of her mother, a civil servant, who died two weeks after giving birth to her without ever leaving hospital; she and her sister were brought up by female relatives. She attended St Albans high school for girls and then worked in public libraries for a decade after studying librarianship at Brighton Technical College. In 1960 she travelled to Italy, where she met Silvio Ruis. They married in 1961, in Barnet, north London, before returning to live in Udine, north-east Italy, where Wendy taught English at various schools in the locality, before starting her own language school there. Having separated from Silvio, Wendy returned to the UK in 1970 with me and my brother, Peter, and settled in Barnet, where she continued to teach both privately and in colleges, and was a school librarian for a period at the Queens’ school in Bushey. Following my parents’ divorce, my mother married Peter Sturgess, a maths teacher, in 1978, but they separated in 1984 (and he died in 1989). Active in her local community, Wendy founded a thriving social group, “Barnet 30+”, before moving to Kingston, south-west London, in 1980. In 1984, she started her own successful teacher supply agency, providing tutors in all subjects, and worked full-time in the business. She retired from full-time work in 1993 and moved to Somerset, where she was active in her local Humanist group, took up various art projects and began collecting automaton toys, amassing a collection of kinetic art. She also spent more time on creative projects and produced her own decoupage pictures, some which she sold at local art fairs. Wendy left Somerset in 2007 and settled in Knaphill, where she became a stalwart of her local U3A group, holding regular Italian conversation classes and poetry readings at her home, whilst expanding her collection of automatons, to the delight of her grandchildren. In her later years, with reduced mobility, she found it harder to get around but managed to continue to teach regardless and was planning lessons as well as hosting sessions on Zoom. Her long letters (she wrote many) will not be forgotten by friends, while her students remember an innovative, charming and exceptional teacher. Wendy is survived by me and Peter, her grandchildren, Oliver, Zoe, Sam, Luca and Darcey, and her sister Joan.",education
"Starting university is, for most people, equal parts exciting and daunting. There are flatmates to meet, coursemates to bond with, new interests to explore and chaotic nights out to be had. But for students starting university next week, they have another emotion to add to the mix: uncertainty. Hannah Tytko is starting a nutrition and dietetics course at the University of Surrey next week, and is unsure what to expect. “I’m going to be living in a flat with essentially six strangers so they’ll be seven of us in total. Luckily there are Facebook group chats so you can start to get a grasp of who you’re going to be living with. But I suppose under the new guidelines you’re stuck with these people,” she says. Just days before the new term starts at most universities, the government has ushered in new rules aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19. Among these is the “rule of six”, preventing groups of over six from socialising together. While educational institutions are exempt, the rules still apply to “private gatherings” among students. Tytko speculates that the rule could mean her flat of seven will be unable to socialise together. Published on the same day, last minute guidance from the Department for Education warns that university campuses may be subject to local lockdowns that could see students confined to their halls of residence in the event of coronavirus outbreaks, along with restrictions on face-to-face teaching and socialising – though they encourage “Covid-secure” mingling. The contradictory messages from government have left students feeling that there is a gulf between what they were promised in the summer and the reality this autumn, warns Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students. “Students are incredibly worried that the government hasn’t considered their needs during this pandemic,” she says. “[The guidance] has come incredibly late, particularly since lots of students have already started moving. We’ve been asking for months for clear guidance on how students form new households safely. I feel as though students have been lied to for months about what’s possible and what’s safe.” Many students are worried about the toll the restrictions could take on their mental health. “Halls for the most part are quite small, so they’re perfect to cater for a ‘drop in, drop out’ lifestyle,” says Tytko. “If you start to limit this, there’s potential for issues to arise.” Moni Serneabat Ungar, who is entering her third year of a film and TV studies degree at the University of Glasgow, agrees. “If this had happened [in my first year], it could have been quite dangerous because I was really unhappy in my flat, and staying with my grandparents for a weekend was very important to me,” she says.  Jasmin Ly, a third-year chemistry student at Nottingham University, is concerned that Covid-19 could still easily spread on campus, even with the new measures. “If each person attends tutorials in groups of six, or someone plays a sport or leads a society in person, then the network of people involved is huge,” she says. Meanwhile, universities are cancelling or shifting online their induction activities in response to the new guidance. While universities with large, leafy campuses such as Surrey are able to host some events outdoors, others are finding ways to socially distance events, for instance through silent discos and cinema trips. Others, such as the University of Sunderland, are trying to recreate the experience online, including through immersive digital campus replicas – some of which resemble life simulation video games such as The Sims. Freshers was typically an opportunity for new starters to sign up to university societies, but some will struggle because of the new rules. Lauren Shireff, who edits the Oxford Student, says the newspaper will not be printed because opening the building is considered a “low priority” for the university. And Mary Jones, secretary of the squash and racketball club for Leeds University, wonders how she will recruit new paying members without taster sessions this year. The new guidance will also affect how classes are delivered. While students were originally promised “blended” learning – combining online lectures with in-person seminars – some universities moving more in favour of online. An initial survey of 500 students by the Hype Collective marketing agency following the announcement suggested that 60% of students now think their degree will offer worse value than they had expected. This is a concern for Gurpal Sahota, who is about to start a politics course at Cardiff University. “I knew that social distancing and online learning was always going to be a part of university when I arrived in September. However, the recent increase in cases has made me question what I’m going to get for my money if we have to move to full online learning or, if like in the US we get sent home due to rises in cases,” he says. “My university has given us very little information as to any socialising and the restrictions that will be in place.” Universities are conscious of the need to honour their promises to students over the summer. The vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, Philip Plowden, says he will achieve this by halving campus capacity to ensure face-to-face teaching can be socially distanced. “We gave them a pledge that the majority of their teaching this year would be delivered on campus and face-to-face, and the latest guidance from the government does not change this commitment,” he says. But at Surrey, Tytko says she’s seen a change in plans for how courses will be delivered. “Especially over the last few days there’s been a trend to move a lot more activities online, and that might be a worry,” she says. Martin Paul Eve, a professor at Birkbeck University who is leading on its shift to online learning, thinks that universities should have followed his institution’s example and planned for high quality online learning to ensure a consistent message for their students and protect the health of staff. “Most staff had a really uncertain summer, where there’s been pressure from institutional management to offer face to face teaching even while the medical advice has predicted a catastrophic wave of reinfection in the autumn,” he says. Despite the confusion, some students are relieved that their safety is now the priority. “The new government guidance makes me feel safer about going back to university,” says Stephi Bourliakas, who will study physics with astrophysics at Exeter University. “Living with family who are vulnerable and shielding during the holidays, I’m most worried about the spike in cases that will inevitably be caused by students from across the country returning to university. I hope this new rule will limit that.”",education
"Schools in England face an autumn of paralysis due to difficulties in obtaining coronavirus tests, headteachers have warned, with education “grinding to a halt” when staff and students are forced to stay home following a suspected case. Thousands of school leaders have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, warning of “partial rolling closures” of schools and disruption to pupils’ catch-up studies, because of serious staff shortages just days into the new term. Headteachers told the Guardian that staff were in some cases unable to find any test slots available for days or were offered tests at sites more than 100 miles away. When they do get a test, it can take days for results to come through. School leaders’ unions reported receiving calls from at least 400 members who had suspected cases in their schools, after just one week of full school reopenings in England. “Yesterday I had three staff off as someone in their household has symptoms. None of them have been able to get a test,” said one primary school headteacher in Southampton last week. “One did get a test booked in Portsmouth, arrived there to be turned away as they had no tests left. It is a nightmare. “In order to run my school I need to be able to get staff tested quickly and back to work as soon as possible if the test is negative. We will grind to a halt if the availability of tests does not improve rapidly.” The head of a rural primary school in Sussex said the shortage of tests “is the single issue which will derail the reopening and likely our budget too”. “A high proportion of my staff are also parents of school-aged children. As soon as one of them has any likely symptoms I’ll be losing staff,” he said, adding that five of his pupils were off with suspected Covid-19 symptoms and had been unable to obtain tests. “The increased supply costs will be a budgetary Armageddon and any plan to try to achieve stability and continuity for a very keen bunch of returning children will be next to impossible to achieve.” A teacher at a school near Torquay was offered a drive-in test in Cardiff, one in Southampton was offered a test 170 miles away in Telford, and another in Swansea was told to go to Aberdeen airport. Meanwhile two secondary schools in the north of England were each forced to send an entire year group home because of suspected Covid cases. The Worth Less? lobbying group, which represents thousands of headteachers across 75 local authorities in England, wrote to Williamson warning that the threat of partial rolling closures because of serious staff shortages is significant”. The letter went on: “Many pupils, who have lost far too much learning time already and are just months away from crucial A-level, GCSE and Sats exams are missing having specialist teachers in front of them.” Teaching unions urged the government to put more resources into giving school staff priority access to tests. The National Education Union called for mass testing for schools and colleges in areas with high levels of community transmission. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said it had received more than 200 calls from members seeking help dealing with suspected cases, with most of those involving lack of access to tests. The Association of School and College Leaders said it had seen similar numbers before the end of last week and reported “uncomfortable conversations” between schools and parents, frustrated by the testing system. Paul Whiteman, the NAHT’s general secretary, said: “The obvious failure of the Covid-19 testing infrastructure puts the sustainable reopening of schools at serious risk and also means that pupils could be missing out on education unnecessarily.” A government spokesperson said: “Testing capacity is the highest it has ever been, but we are seeing a significant demand for tests. It is vital that children and school staff only get a test if they develop coronavirus symptoms. “If a positive case is confirmed in a school, swift action is being taken to ask those who have been in close contact to self-isolate, and Public Health England’s local health protection teams continue to support and advise schools in this situation. “Children who are self-isolating will receive remote education. We will continue to work with schools to ensure all appropriate steps are taken to keep pupils and staff safe.” But Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government needed to do more. “Heads have told me they find it extremely frustrating that they have made their schools ‘Covid secure’ but then find out it has been undone by the lack of tests.”",education
"Thousands of students, parents and teachers are celebrating after the government made a spectacular U-turn on this year’s A-Level results, reverting to teacher-assessed grades. While the decision to abandon the exams regulator Ofqual’s controversial grades decided by algorithm, which led to 40% of predicted results being downgraded, has been greeted with widespread relief, it also poses major new challenges for students and universities. We want to hear from students who missed out on their first choice university due to the results they received last Thursday. Have you now been able to secure a place at your first choice university because your results have been upgraded due to the U-turn? Has your first offer university offered you a place but for next year because your course is full? Or do you plan to stick with your second choice or another offer made through clearing?  We also want to hear from students who have yet to secure a place. Have you yet to receive your teacher assessed grades, or are you contesting them? How will an enforced gap year pose difficulties for you? If you have got a place have you been offered accommodation by your university, or do you now face a scramble to arrange this yourself? We would also like to hear from you if your university offer has been affected because the teacher-assessed grades are lower than those you received from Ofqual last week.

"With the coronavirus crisis ballooning and schools across England closing, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announces there will be no exams this year and that exam boards will ask teachers to submit their assessments for the grade they believe a student would have received. Controls would ensure that “this year’s students do not face a systematic disadvantage as a consequence of these extraordinary circumstance”, he adds. Pupils taking GCSEs and A-levels will have their grades awarded by a combination of teacher assessment, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, the exam regulator for England announces. Ofqual begins to lay out details of the new system, though experts have already started to caution that relying on teacher assessments is likely to penalise students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Sounding the alarm about the potential for bias in predicted results, MPs on the House of Commons education select committee call on Ofqual to examine whether groups such as black, Asian and minority ethnic pupils or those with special needs “have been systematically disadvantaged” by the way the exam grades will be awarded, with “well-heeled and sharp-elbowed” families most likely to benefit. There is uproar in Scotland as its exams authority rejects nearly 124,000 grade recommendations from teachers – a quarter of the total. Unlike in Scotland, individual English pupils are barred from appealing against their results on academic grounds. Ofqual partially climbs down and allows schools to appeal on a limited number of technical grounds, for example if they switched from single-sex to co-educational or experienced a “monumental event” such as a flood or fire. The Guardian reveals that 39% of teachers’ A-level result recommendations are set to be downgraded in England, according to analysis of the algorithm and data used by Ofqual. Those most at risk appear to be students on the border between B and C or C and D grades, and those from comprehensive schools with significant variations in attainment over the three previous years. Following days of protests by pupils, teachers and opposition parties, the Scottish government reinstates all downgraded exam results and apologises to the 76,000 pupils affected. Later that evening, ministers in London make an 11th-hour bid to stave off a growing revolt over the emerging fiasco, granting pupils in England the right to use mock exam results if they are unhappy with their grades – though this is quickly condemned by critics as further disadvantaging state school pupils or those whose mocks were cancelled in the spring. Teenagers receive their A-level results. Those awarded A or A* increase to an all-time high in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with 27.9% securing the top grades this year – but pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are hit hardest by the standardisation process, with analysis showing they were most likely to have the grades proposed by their teachers overruled. Headteachers react with dismay and anger. As bitterly disappointed students take to the streets and calls are issued for Williamson to quit, researchers tell the Guardian that disadvantaged GSCE students could suffer even more than the A-level group when their results come out a week later, with 2 million teacher assessments downgraded. Hours after Ofqual publishes its criteria for mock exam results to be considered as the basis of an appeal, the body dramatically suspends its guidance. It says in a brief statement on its website that the policy iss “being reviewed” by its board and that further information will be released “in due course”. The government is blindsided. Anger turns to Boris Johnson, who is beginning a holiday in Scotland, while Lord Baker, a former Tory education secretary and the architect of GCSEs, calls for them to be delayed. All A-level and GCSE results in England will be based on teacher-assessed grades, the government confirms in a spectacular U-turn. Earlier in the day, devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland had announced that assessments would apply to students there. Announcing details of the move, Ofqual’s chairman, Roger Taylor, says that the body wanted to say sorry and that the decision has been taken to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible. The about-face comes after Penny Mordaunt becomes the first serving UK minister to publicly express concern about the debacle. Dozens of Tory MPs also voice discontent. ",education
"Up to 25,000 teachers in England may already have been forced out of the classroom and into self-isolation at home amid a national shortage of Covid tests just a fortnight after schools reopened, research suggests. With some schools reporting up to a fifth of their teaching staff off and unable to get a test, unions warned the crisis was spinning out of control and jeopardising plans for a full return to education, bringing the risk of “lockdown by default”. One academy trust leader said that 740 state schools in England were either partially or wholly closed with Covid-related issues, meaning tens of thousands of pupils are stuck at home, with their parents unable to go to work. Some private schools, meanwhile, are paying £120 to test symptomatic students and teachers after many were unable to secure tests locally. “If schools can afford to take the hit, private companies don’t have any problems providing tests,” said one Guildford private school teacher. State schools are fast using up the 10 testing kits supplied by government at the start of term – regardless of the school’s size – as teachers and pupils with suspected Covid struggle to book tests. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson admitted to MPs that the testing system “has huge problems”, as new figures showed nearly 4,000 UK cases in the last 24 hours – the highest daily total since early May. The government responded to the growing schools crisis by setting up a hotline from Thursday for heads to call for advice and report cases after being told that staff were waiting hours or even days to hear back from local public health teams. Headteachers representing more than 16,000 pupils in Gateshead in north-east England, which is on the government’s watchlist due to its high infection rate, said the lack of Covid testing would “break” some schools and that their plan for returning children to classrooms had “collapsed” due to the crisis.A letter to MPs from the Gateshead Association of Primary Head Teachers, which represents 67 schools, cited “significant problems” with staff and children unable to get a test and those that did were taking “far too long” to get a result.Mustafaa Malik, chair of the association and head of Harlow Green primary school in Gateshead, said a fifth of his teaching staff were isolating as well as a “double figures” number of its 400 pupils. He said there were considerable absences across the town, where the infection rate is nearly three times the England average.“It’s just unsustainable,” he said. “The parents can feel the anxiety growing. It’s taken a lot of convincing them that it’s safe but we’re starting to get a buildup of fear in some communities.”  The cost of paying supply teachers to fill staff absences would break some school budgets and whole year groups would have to be sent home because heads could not afford to pay for their teaching, Malik added. A survey of 6,700 teachers in England by the Teacher Tapp app found that 4% were isolating away from school for Covid-related reasons on Tuesday. That would equate to around 25,000 teachers nationally, with primary teachers more likely to be isolating, as were those teaching in the Midlands or the north-west of England. Rebecca Allen, professor of education at the University of Brighton and chief analyst for Teacher Tapp – an app that conducts anonymous daily surveys of teachers and school leaders, said the results suggested the autumn and winter cold season was going to play havoc with staff numbers. “We shouldn’t overlook the fact that more than 7 million children are in school with more learning taking place than during lockdown. But the government needs to add teachers to its priority list for tests, and it needs to find a way to help schools pay for the cost of hiring supply teachers to fill in for those isolating. “Otherwise a lot of schools without surpluses will have no choice but to close after having spent their budgets on supply teachers.” The Guardian understands that more than 30 schools in Oldham, one of England’s worst-hit areas, have had to send at least one year group home due to a Covid case. In wider Greater Manchester, more than 110 schools have reported at least one coronavirus case, with the figure rising daily.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said the lack of testing and schools was “causing real distress” for families and teachers. “It needs to be fixed and fixed urgently,” he said. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Charitable Trust which runs 52 schools across England, many in deprived areas, said 1,200 children in two primaries and six secondary schools within the chain were currently at home self-isolating. A single confirmed case in one Bristol secondary school resulted in 187 pupils in the same protective bubble being sent home. In some cases multiple year groups had been sent into self-isolation following guidance from local public health authorities. “All of it is tragic,” said Chalke, who was among those school leaders pushing for an early return to classes after lockdown. “We were told this morning that 740 schools across England are either partly or wholly shut. We are frustrated. All of it could have been avoided. If Boris [Johnson] said it’s our moral duty to get back to school, it’s a moral duty to come up with a plan to keep schools open.” Heads and school governors wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday imploring him to take personal charge of the crisis in Covid testing. The National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the National Governance Association leapfrogged the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to tell Johnson they felt compelled to express “mounting concern”. The ASCL’s general secretary, Geoff Barton, said: “This will feel I think like lockdown by default – it will be more frustrating for parents because you can’t predict whether it is going to happen.” Announcing the new hotline for schools, Williamson said: “The number of confirmed cases in schools remains low but to protect schools it is important headteachers continue to have access to timely support and advice. This new dedicated advice line will help schools, colleges or early years settings to implement the most appropriate public health measures, once a case is confirmed.”",education
"The number of pupils in England who are studying remotely from home rather than in school has more than doubled in the space of a week, according to data shared exclusively with the Guardian. Last week 12,000 pupils accessed lessons remotely as the new term got under way, but the number rose to 25,000 this week, according to the Oak National Academy, the online school set up by the government to support pupils in lockdown. The sharp increase so early in the new term will ring alarm bells in government, as growing numbers of pupils and teachers are sent home to self-isolate amid a shortage of Covid-19 tests nationwide, and union leaders warn of a “lockdown by default”. In the first few days of the new school year alone, 2,000 schools accessed the Oak website and downloaded 20,000 resources to support pupils’ remote teaching, and isolating children confined to their homes accessed half a million online lessons. Some secondary schools have already had to send multiple year groups home following advice from local public health authorities, while other schools are reporting that up to a fifth of their pupils are self-isolating at home, hindering their education and preventing some parents from working. “We are really pleased with our site, but there is no substitute for being in a classroom with a teacher,” said Matt Hood, principal at the Oak academy and an independent adviser at the Department for Education. With up to 25,000 teachers in England already forced out of the classroom and into self-isolation, Hood warned that some schools could have to close if teachers failed to get swift Covid-19 tests that would enable them to return to the classroom, resulting in even more children dependent on remote learning. “If we can’t get adults back into schools as quickly as possible, it becomes at some point unsafe for the school to open,” said Hood. “The worst-case scenario is that we start to see schools close.” The Oak principal said teachers faced an even greater challenge this term than during lockdown, when almost all children’s learning had to be done from home. This term, teachers are having to teach simultaneously in two different settings to cater for pupils at home and those in the classroom. And he raised concerns about the impact of the “digital divide” between students who have a laptop or tablet to access remote learning and those without, should home schooling continue to play a significant part in the school timetable. “We have to be confident kids at home have a device that works and the necessary data. There’s no point having all these remote lessons if children don’t have the device to access them.” The government’s announcement in April of a £100m scheme to provide free laptops and 4G wireless routers for vulnerable pupils with social workers, care leavers and disadvantaged year 10s was welcomed, but roll-out was slow and critics said the scheme was not nearly ambitious enough. “This term is long and it’s hard,” said Hood. “Schools are doing a remarkable job under the circumstances. We are trying to do everything we can to help, but we’ve still got problems with the digital divide.” Ministers have promised to extend and expand the offer this term. Oak National Academy was set up in April as the pandemic took hold across Europe and schools were closed, to provide free online lessons and resources for pupils aged four to 16. In June it was awarded £4.34m to prepare for the next academic year, as part of the government’s contingency planning should schools remain closed. Stephen Eastman, head teacher of Marine Park first school, in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, is among those school leaders already using Oak material. He said a fifth of his pupils were working at home. “We did not envisage we would be at this position quite as quickly as this,” he said. He said said several classes in his school were at home, as well as a small number of individual pupils from different classes who either have symptoms, or have family members with symptoms and awaiting tests. “It’s just the uncertainty of where we are going next with this,” he said. “It feels a bit fluid in so many ways. We are having to be very flexible and reactive. All your plans have to be rethought. It’s really, really challenging.”",education
"While out on his bike for lockdown exercise in the lanes around his Cambridgeshire home, my friend John Hunter was involved in a collision with a car and died at the scene. He was 87. John was an inspiring art teacher, at secondary schools in Carshalton, south London, then Manchester and, from the 1970s until retirement, as head of art at Great Cornard upper school (now Thomas Gainsborough school) in Sudbury, Suffolk. His teaching combined variety, insight and encouragement, with an enthusiasm for modernism and an emphasis on traditional craft skills. His ever-youthful appearance and brilliant sense of humour made him the most popular and respected of teachers. While teaching full time, he became chief examiner in art for the London exam board. This included marking, visiting and moderating for schools in Italy and the Middle East, and marking for some schools in Africa who still took O-levels. He continued this work for around 15 years after his retirement from teaching in 1989. In his own work, he held firm to the solid grounding he received as a student at Hornsey College of Art in the 1950s. As well as painting landscapes and urban views in a variety of media, he was an outstanding printmaker, cutting in lino and wood. His large-scale, colourful prints, produced in his immaculately tidy studio at home, follow in a tradition including Edward Bawden. Born in Winchmore Hill, north London, John was the only child of Ernest – originally a wood carver, then a tobacconist – and his wife Dorothy (nee Colville). He was a keen boy scout with the 173rd North London Group, remaining in touch with a close group of friends from those times. Until the 1990s, with some of them well into their 70s, they went every year on a weekend camping trip (the “boozeree”). For many years, John and my father, John Liddell, would perform as the Onzellos, a knockabout comedy act in the Group Gang Show, much to the bafflement of younger cubs and scouts. John was a lifelong Spurs fan. As a boy he would take the bus from home to the match at White Hart Lane, sometimes seeing the Spurs players on the same bus, with their kit in a duffel bag. John married a fellow Hornsey student, Wendy Edwards, and they had a son, Joe, in 1967. Wendy died of breast cancer shortly afterwards. Times were difficult, but through his love of New Orleans jazz in 1989 John met Jill Morrison. They moved to Cambridgeshire and lived happily ever after, finally marrying in 2005. Together they danced, travelled widely – finding a particular love of the more remote Greek islands – and returned to their immaculate cottage to grow enormous flowers and vegetables, and try to get letters published in the Guardian. Jill survives him, as do Joe and two grandsons, Otto and Edgar.",education
"Record numbers of young people in the UK are starting a university course this autumn, with many anxious to escape a collapsing employment market. But as students embark on a very different university experience, vice-chancellors are worried that many may not last the year. Universities are reporting unprecedented pressure on their student hardship funds, after the abrupt loss of thousands of part-time student jobs in bars, restaurants and shops as a result of the pandemic. They fear students will be much less able to cope with the demands of their course if they are preoccupied with serious worries about paying for food or rent. Meanwhile, experts are warning that this year’s freshers have “lost the discipline of learning”, having spent months at home with no A-level exams to revise for. They predict many will struggle to adapt to independent university study, especially as many classes will be online. They may be “digital natives”, but they are not used to online learning. The head of one leading research university said that most prestigious universities had been factoring a rise in dropouts into their recruitment numbers. The vice-chancellor of another university, in the elite Russell Group, said some students who had been given a place would not have met their offer requirements in an ordinary year, but had done so with teacher-assessed A-level grades. “We know they will struggle. I’m expecting that we may have a high dropout rate and that worries me. For an individual, the impact of dropping out can be far worse than not getting in in the first place.” Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says university bosses are right to be worried about dropout rates, which will be bad for both students and university finances. “To be frank, the university experience won’t be as good because so much has to be different, from how they are taught to how they socialise,” he says.  Many institutions are already facing an uncertain future. “If you lose a first year you don’t just lose their £9,250 fees for the year – you lose nearly £28,000 over the three years of their degree,” Hillman says. At Kingston University, staff have been contributing out of their own pockets to an emergency campaign to help poorer students. Forty per cent of the university’s students are from households with an income of £25,000 or less a year, and the vast majority work to support themselves through their degrees. For them, the sudden loss of part-time jobs has been a disaster, and during lockdown Kingston paid out £900,000 to help. Jenni Woods, head of access, participation and inclusion at Kingston, says: “It was really important that we alleviated that financial pressure for students, because in the midst of this crisis they also had exams looming. It is hard to focus on studying when you don’t know how you will pay your rent or pay for food.” Woods says that while some students will have been supported by their families during lockdown, “for many of our students that just wasn’t an option as their families were struggling financially too”.  Melissa Hariz, who graduated from her film-making course at Kingston this summer, was given a hardship grant to help pay her rent. Like most students, she had a student loan for her living costs, but this still left her £1,500 short on her rent. Hariz had been relying on a job making fundraising calls for the university, but when much of the campus closed during lockdown, she was left with no way to pay her bills. “I have some anxiety already and not having enough money in my final year heightened that,” she says. “It was such an overwhelming feeling to have so much pressure coming from all different angles.” Hariz’s story is being repeated across the country. At the University of the West of England, in Bristol, bosses are thinking hard about diverting money, earmarked for widening participation, to their student hardship fund after a big increase in requests for help. Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor, says: “We are saying please come and talk to us early. When financial problems escalate, that’s when mental health starts to suffer.” Michelle Morgan, a former academic who advises universities on the student experience, fears many new students will find it difficult to adapt to online learning, and says existing students may be less engaged after months studying in their bedrooms at home. “There is this assumption that young people today are digital natives who won’t struggle with some teaching being online. That might be the case with social media but it’s definitely not with learning,” she says. Morgan is concerned that many freshers won’t cope with the huge transition from lockdown to university. “You’ve got students starting university this year who in the last seven months have lost the discipline of learning and time management. They knew they didn’t have A-level exams so they have been winding down,” she says. Many universities have invested in sophisticated data analytics to track their students online, not only monitoring whether they are watching lectures and using the electronic library, but also how long they spend looking at particular pages. At UWE, for instance, West says if a student’s online study patterns change it will trigger an alert and a coach will contact them to check if they need help. But Prof Jacqueline Stevenson, director of the centre for lifelong learning at Leeds University, says: “It’s obvious if someone doesn’t turn up to a physical tutorial, but it can be much harder to tell if a student is engaging online.” Her centre has a team of “student advocates” for the first term to help check students are managing their course. The centre delivers nursing apprenticeships and Stevenson is conscious that nursing students may need extra support. “Some have been dealing with very difficult work challenges during the pandemic, as well as being parents or carers.” Hillman says the dropout rate will depend on how good universities are at supporting their students. “You can stem it if your students have a sense of belonging and if you catch problems early,” he says. However, Stevenson thinks that for some students, taking a break from their course will be the best thing, rather than a catastrophe. “Dropping out can be a pejorative term and is caught up with the idea of failure. But if someone makes a sensible decision to leave, and may come back later to finish their course, that should be celebrated. A student can carry that feeling of failure with them for a very long time.”",education
"Disadvantaged students in England improved their results at GCSE this summer, narrowing the attainment gap with their peers, according to an analysis. After summer exams were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were fears that disadvantaged students could lose out from results based on teacher assessments because of the risk of bias. Research by FFT Education Datalab found no evidence that the attainment gap had widened. Instead, it identified a slight narrowing of the gap at the crucial grade 4 or above threshold, equivalent to the bottom of an old C grade. The 4 grade at GCSE is considered crucial because it allows pupils to go on to further study or training. Those who do not gain a 4 in English and maths must retake the exams while they remain in post-16 education. Based on analysis of this year’s results at 1,200 secondary schools, researchers found that 56% of disadvantaged pupils achieved a grade 4 or above in English and maths at GCSE, compared with 78% of non-disadvantaged pupils. Although at 22 percentage points, the attainment gap remains vast, it is an improvement on last year, when the comparable figures were 46% and 72%, a gap of 26 percentage points. Philip Nye, a researcher at FFT Education Datalab, said: “After the chaos of this summer’s results season, the news that the disadvantage gap does not seem to have widened comes as a relief. “The gap remains worryingly large – but many of us feared that disadvantaged pupils might have lost out with the cancellation of GCSE exams and the move to an alternative awarding approach. That does not seem to have happened. “All efforts should now be made to support disadvantaged pupils who will take their GCSEs in 2021 to ensure that the attainment gap does not widen next year.” There was an outcry among teachers and pupils after an algorithm designed by the exams regulator Ofqual to standardise results across England caused the widespread downgrading of centre-assessed grades (Cags) at A-level. The government performed a dramatic U-turn, scrapping the algorithm and allowing Cags, set by teachers and schools, to be used instead to award grades for both A-levels and GCSEs. Figures published by Ofqual at the start of summer showed its algorithm would probably have caused a slight widening in the attainment gap in GCSE results between pupils who were on free school meals and those who were not.",education
"As universities struggle to contain student parties, and with coronavirus outbreaks already confirmed at several campuses, many academics are afraid of face-to-face teaching. But some say managers are bullying them to return and, fearing redundancy, they feel unable to refuse. In the past few days the universities of Glasgow and Liverpool have both announced significant Covid outbreaks, and other universities, including St Andrews, Edinburgh Napier, Bath, Oxford Brookes, Aberdeen and Stirling are grappling with confirmed cases. Vicky Blake, president of the University and College Union (UCU), says: “Staff are getting in touch with me at their wits’ end. It’s a horrible thing to be told people are terrified.” Universities insist the safety of staff, students and local residents is their priority. But the union says it is being deluged with pleas for help from staff on precarious contracts who feel unable to refuse to teach face-to-face, but are deeply fearful about the risks. “We are operating in the context of redundancy announcements. It makes it feel very difficult to put your head above the parapet,” Blake says. One academic at a Russell Group university, who asked not to be named, said her university had dismissed her concerns about infecting her partner, who has type 1 diabetes and is therefore at an increased risk from coronavirus. “We live in a shared studio apartment with no room to quarantine,” she says. “I reported this, along with my own concerns about being BAME, but my head of department has told me I don’t understand the science and the classroom is the safest place to be.” The academic says that “under pressure” she has been teaching students in a seminar room with no windows, but wearing a mask and changing and showering immediately afterwards. “I am on a casual teaching-only contract and it’s obvious if I refuse to do this I will risk damaging my career or losing my job,” she says. Like many other academics in the arts and humanities, she believes she can teach her subject just as well online, and says she has attracted exciting external speakers to take part in digital seminars who probably would not participate in person. At Northumbria University, an academic whose partner nearly died after they both contracted coronavirus in March has circulated an angry letter to colleagues, saying the pressure to come back on to campus “to deliver teaching that could be delivered online” was “shameful”. The letter describes the partner’s illness, including a week spent almost totally alone in intensive care, “in the hope that sharing this experience might bring home the gravity of what a second wave might cause”. Dr Adam Hansen, senior lecturer in English at Northumbria and chair of its UCU branch, says universities’ risk assessments should take into account any clinically vulnerable people academics are living with or supporting. “Our view is that any assessment of what happens in a university at the moment should start with two questions: does this activity have to happen on campus, and does this individual have to do it?” A spokesperson for the university says: “The health and safety of our staff and students is always our first priority. Where colleagues are working on campus we have taken mitigating actions in line with government guidance to make the working environment safe.” In many universities, much of the in-person teaching will fall to younger members of staff on casual contracts. A young PhD student at the University of St Andrews, who does not want to be named in case it affects his career, says that in his department PhD students teach 82% of the first- and second-year seminars that will now be face-to-face. “We’ve basically been told, if you want one of these tutor groups the teaching will be in person,” he says. “For me there is a dignity issue here. No one is even asking if we are OK with this.” He makes £81.75 a week (which includes holiday pay) teaching three undergraduate seminars, putting him below the £120 a week necessary to claim statutory sick pay if he contracts the virus. “Many PhD students like me won’t be entitled to sick pay if we get ill,” he says. “Long Covid is what really worries me. I’m at a precarious point in my career. I’m due to submit my PhD dissertation in a few months and I don’t have the time or the money to be ill for a long period.” Moreover, he is not convinced that teaching face-to-face will work with the current safety restrictions. “I am being asked to run small group discussions in a big lecture theatre at a 2 metre distance with masks on and with some students watching simultaneously online. I’m at a loss as to how to lead an effective class like that. Will we even hear each other with masks on?” A spokeswoman for St Andrews says: “We’ve heard and sympathise with [the] concerns and are bringing in an addition to current policy to ensure that flexible workers are covered for pay they might miss if they fall ill. PhD students also have access to our student support funds.” As for concerns about the quality of teaching, the spokeswoman says: “We’ve been running in-person teaching on a limited basis for two weeks already, and the feedback from both staff and students so far has been exceptionally positive.” At Cambridge University, the local UCU branch is concerned that with 45% of undergraduate tutorials or “supervisions” conducted by graduate students, postdoctoral students and freelancers, young casual workers will “be left to bear the costs of face-to-face teaching in a global pandemic”. It says most are far too worried about their careers to risk speaking out about safety. A university spokesperson says: “We accept this is a worrying time. No member of staff will be compelled to attend face-to-face supervisions if they have concerns about their health and wellbeing.” Those at the top of the profession aren’t necessarily finding it easy to refuse to teach either. One well-reputed professor at an elite university says he struggled to prove that he shouldn’t be teaching because of the danger of putting his elderly father at risk. “My university has a policy that if you have medical evidence or you fit one of the high-risk categories you won’t have to teach. I’m knocking 60, but I don’t fit any of these categories. Yet I am in a bubble with my father in his mid-80s and I am the only person he sees.” In the end, the professor went to see his doctor because of his anxieties about being forced to teach students in person and catching public transport to get to university. She wrote a letter saying he needed to be allowed to teach online, which the university accepted. “The university headline is that no one will be compelled. But if you can’t produce hard evidence of your risk, I don’t know what you do,” he says. “This feels like a dishonest approach and I know some heads of school are bullying people into it. It’s only senior people like me who can say sod it and take them on, knowing they can’t promote you any further anyway.”  A spokesperson for the vice-chancellors’ group, Universities UK, said: “Universities should be considering the needs of staff and students on an individual basis. There is a careful balancing of the risk of any potential future national or local lockdowns and ensuring that young people – who have faced incredible disruption during the pandemic – can continue with their education.” UUK has produced guidance for universities in ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of students, staff, visitors and the wider community.",education
"Black working-class young people in England are being unfairly excluded and criminalised by a “two-tier education system”, a thinktank has said. An Institute of Race Relations (IRR) report focusing on London says government responses to inner-city youth rebellions and moral panics over serious youth violence and knife crime have led to black pupils disproportionately being sent to pupil referral units (PRU) and alternative provision (AP). Young black Caribbean boys are nearly four times more likely to receive a permanent school exclusion and twice as likely to receive a fixed-period exclusion than the school population as a whole, making them the most excluded group apart from Gypsy and Traveller children. Warning of a “PRU-to-prison” pipeline, the IRR report notes that 89% of children in detention in 2017-18 reported having been excluded from school, according to the HM chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales. The report’s author, Jessica Perera, an IRR researcher, said: “Amidst the Black Lives Matter protests, we have seen increased demands to decolonise the curriculum. At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed a system which fails working-class students. “This paper reminds us that those who have been continually failed are found in PRUs and AP and that their segregation is a damning indictment of a planned education malaise, which has been designed and deployed on a specific section of society with a history of resistance and rebellion.” Reviewing education policies over the last four decades, Perera says police officers placed in schools and other surveillance methods lead to working-class multiracial youth living on estates in London being framed as “suspects”. She argues that black working-class boys have been let down by the “monocultural” national curriculum, which replaced attempts – particularly in the capital – at progressive multicultural education. Last month the government turned down calls for a review to add more black, Asian and ethnic minority history to the national curriculum. With the expansion of academies, which are more likely to permanently exclude pupils, and alternative provision, Perera questions whether rising exclusions are “about removing a section of the urban multiracial working class which poses a threat to incoming gentrifying students” The result, she says, is a “two-tier state education system: academies for the aspirational and pupil referral units for the defiant and apathetic.” A government spokesperson said: “We know some groups of children are more likely to be excluded than others, and we expect teachers to look at how to address underlying causes of disruptive behaviour in order to avoid excluding where possible, while also keeping schools safe and disciplined for all. “The school curriculum is already broad and ambitious, teaching pupils about different cultures with significant historic figures from black and ethnic minority communities, underpinned by the need for mutual respect and understanding.”",education
"UK universities are on course to recruit record numbers of international students during the global pandemic, defying predictions of financial disaster, the latest admissions figures reveal. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said UK universities enjoyed a 9% increase in the number of undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU starting their studies this autumn, rising to a new record total of 44,300. The increase marks a remarkable turnaround from earlier this year, when vice-chancellors feared there would be a collapse in international student numbers and warned that a sector-wide financial crisis was likely to follow. Universities redoubled their efforts to recruit students from overseas, and may have been helped by negative sentiment towards the US, where the virus remains unchecked in parts of the country, and while potential rivals in New Zealand and Australia remain closed to international students. Ucas’s figures usually include fewer than half of the more than 100,000 international undergraduates coming to the UK, with the remainder and postgraduates applying directly to individual universities rather than through the admissions service. Admissions officers have also been celebrating record numbers of first-year students coming from disadvantaged areas in the UK, with 22.5% of students from areas with the lowest educational attainment now continuing on into higher education. The overall proportion of the UK’s 18-year-olds entering higher education will reach 36%, itself a new record. That will also come as a relief to many in higher education, after the bungled efforts to assess entry grades using statistical models to replace exams. In most cases the grades were replaced with school assessments, meaning more students are likely to have met entry requirements. “Overall demand for higher education has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, and there are currently a record 515,650 students with a confirmed place, up 4% on last year,” Ucas said, noting that the increase followed three years of falling enrolments. But the figures also show a drop in acceptances from new EU undergraduates, down 2% compared with 2019-20, to just under 30,000. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: “The data clearly tell a very positive story. It was always clear that domestic demand would be up, despite the reduction in 18-year olds, because the alternatives to more education are so poor this year. “It was also always likely that EU numbers would be down, given the Brexit uncertainties and shenanigans. No one predicted such a big increase in non-EU international students and we have to wait to see if they will all actually arrive and then stay the course. “But it is a great testament to the underlying strength of our higher education sector, as well as a reflection of the improved migration regime and rising geopolitical tensions between China and the US, that so many people still want to come and study at our fantastic institutions.” Fears that a significant proportion of students would defer entry because of campus restrictions on socialising have not been borne out: the figures showed only a slight uptick in the proportion of deferrals, 5.7% compared with 5.4% in 2019. Separately, the Student Loans Company said it had processed and distributed more than £1bn in maintenance loans to 414,877 students by this week, marking its biggest single payment date.",education
"The founder of a leading education campaign to get black British history embedded in the national curriculum in England has expressed frustration at the government’s inaction, despite the growing clamour for change among young people. Lavinya Stennett, who launched the Black Curriculum in January, said it was taking “way too long” and expressed concern that new government guidance on “extreme” political teachings in the classroom could hamper progress further. She said the global Black Lives Matter protests, which followed the killing of George Floyd, had been a huge catalyst for change. Her campaign has been inundated with requests for training and support from students and teachers, inspired by global events, who want change in their own classroom. However, despite earlier interest from the Department for Education and promises of a meeting, she is yet to see ministers to discuss curriculum reform and there is no date in the diary. This week, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators and Black Educators Alliance threatened the government with legal action over new guidance that tells schools not to use resources from organisations that have expressed a desire to end capitalism. In a pre-action letter, they warned the guidance would prevent teachers from using material from groups including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, limiting anti-racism teaching. “They’re not making it easier,” Stennett said. “I’m very confident there will be real change. There’s a lot more young people who have entered the conversation. There’s a lot more young people who have put it at the top of their agenda. It will happen. But it’s just when?” Her campaign wants it to be mandatory for pupils in England, from key stage 1 in primary through to key stage 4, when students take their GCSEs, to learn about black British history throughout the year, rather than just in Black History Month. “Black British history is not merely a theme for October,” its mission statement says, “but started hundreds of years before Windrush and predates European colonial enslavement. Our work aims to address and overcome these limitations by seeking to provide a contextual, globalised history that roots the Black British experience in histories of movement and migration, 365 days a year.” As Black Lives Matter protests gathered momentum around the world and the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities became apparent, hopes were high that the government would be forced to tackle racism, including racial bias in the curriculum. Though Covid has meant moving the group’s work online as opposed to its usual programme of face-to-face workshops, the Black Curriculum has become significantly more high-profile and now counts Marks & Spencer as a sponsor, as big-name corporations seek to ally themselves with organisations fighting racism. Stennett’s team have worked with more than 1,000 teachers and school leaders across the country this year, as well as UCL’s Institute of Education, and Teach First, which trains teachers to work in schools in disadvantaged areas. On Friday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced a partnership between London schools and the Black Curriculum. In June, Stennett and other campaigners wrote an open letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, demanding change. “Thousands of us, the British voting public, are grief-stricken and concerned about the existing status quo in the UK, which disregards the lives and contributions of Black British people,” the letter stated. “Despite numerous calls over the years to reform the national curriculum to incorporate Black histories, these requests have been denied. Learning Black history should not be a choice but should be mandatory. Our curriculum should not be reinforcing the message that a sizeable part of the British population are not valued.” In July, however, the schools minister Nick Gibb said there were no plans for a review of the curriculum. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said ministers were tone-deaf on the issue. “I’m very frustrated,” said Stennett. “People want to see change. It’s taking way too long.” After a huge surge in interest, Stennett is concerned the momentum of the past few months should not be lost. “People have a sudden interest and it fades away. That’s a worry I have, with sudden things like that. It’s about sustaining it now.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Schools play a crucial role in helping young people understand the world around them and their place within it. “The knowledge-rich curriculum in our schools already offers pupils the opportunity to learn about significant figures from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and the contributions they have made to the country’s history, as well as helping them learn about our shared history with countries from across the world.”",education
"Campaigners have threatened the government with legal action over new guidance that tells schools not to use resources from organisations that have expressed a desire to end capitalism. In a pre-action letter, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators (Care) and Black Educators Alliance (BEA) said the guidance would prevent teachers from using material from groups including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, limiting anti-racism teaching. In guidance issued last week for school leaders and teachers in England, the Department for Education (DfE) categorised anti-capitalism as an “extreme political stance” and equated it with opposition to freedom of speech, antisemitism and endorsement of illegal activity. The guidance also states that schools should not “under any circumstances” work with or use material from groups that do not “condemn illegal activities done in their name or in support of their cause” or promote “victim narratives that are harmful to British society”. Care and BEA said the guidance would prevent young people from engaging with teaching about racism, discouraging the use of material produced by Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion, the charity Inquest “or another campaigning organisation that seeks to draw attention to the disproportionate impact of state violence (including against Black men).” The letter says that as it is unclear what “victim narratives” means, schools could be discouraged from using resources produced by organisations that campaign for rights for minority groups. The groups have began to fundraise to proceed with a judicial review if the department refuses to withdraw the guidance. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Streatham, said: “I support this legal challenge. Freedom of speech and an educated population are two fundamental pillars of democracy. We cannot move forward as a society without respecting them both. “These guidelines are a deeply worrying erosion of these two principles by an authoritarian Conservative government that has lost all credibility among the young.” A spokesperson for Care said: “This guidance will have a chilling effect in the classrooms. Our schools are filled with inquisitive young people and we should be doing everything necessary to ensure they are given all the tools and information to have rich discussions on topics such as inequality. “This guidance prevents that by restricting access to materials and no-platforming organisations that don’t curry favour with the government.” Rachel Harger, a solicitor at Bindmans, said: “The guidance, which was published without consultation or warning, is a clear statement of the secretary of state’s own political preferences and the ban on the use of teaching materials related to leftwing or political groups is clearly unlawful, serious and far-reaching. “The guidance constitutes an assault on the common law right to freedom of speech, freedom of religious belief, and has a disproportionate impact on protected groups such as the black and trans community.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our new relationships, sex and health education (RHSE) guidance is clear that schools should not work with agencies that take extreme positions. Schools should already be aware of their duty to political impartiality, as set out under the Education Act 1996. “We would still expect subjects to be discussed in a balanced way as part of a school’s wider curriculum where relevant.  “More widely, our guidance is designed to give schools the confidence to construct a curriculum that reflects diversity of views and backgrounds, whilst fostering all pupils’ respect for others, understanding of healthy relationships, and ability to look after their own wellbeing.”",education
"A secondary school headteacher has denied that a member of staff was suspended because she was a Christian who raised concerns about teaching young children about LGBTQ+ relationships, an tribunal has heard. Kristie Higgs, 44, was dismissed for gross misconduct by Farmor’s school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, last year after sharing and commenting on social media posts about relationship education. The posts raised concerns about plans to teach the No Outsiders programme at her son’s Church of England school. A tribunal in Bristol has heard that Higgs, a pastoral assistant at Farmor’s, was suspended by headteacher Matthew Evans and, following a disciplinary process, was sacked. The Christian Legal Centre is supporting Higgs, who argues her sacking breached her freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Evans told the employment tribunal his priority after receiving the complaint was to uphold “confidence” in the school. He said: “It was not because of the beliefs. These posts have been shared and apparently endorsed and my concern was that might lead to a loss of confidence in the school.” Earlier, Higgs said: “They had already made up their mind when Mr Evans started his investigation. People have a different belief system than I do. It doesn’t make me wrong.” Barrister Debbie Grennan, representing the school, asked Higgs whether a man who underwent gender reassignment surgery and had obtained a gender recognition certificate was a woman. “They are still male,” Higgs replied. “In this land I accept they have got their certificate. That’s who they say they are but God is who made them. “God’s law says they cannot change their gender, the law says they can. This does not mean you have to accept it. It doesn’t mean I hate them, or they are not my friends.” The tribunal continues.",education
"The number of schools in England badly affected by Covid-19 cases among students and staff has quadrupled in the space of a week, and the number of pupils absent rose by 50%, according to estimates released by the Department for Education. The DfE’s figures revealed that 4% of state schools were classed as “not fully open” last week because of Covid-19, compared with 1% of schools seven days before, including cases where entire year groups had been sent home. Around 20 schools were closed outright for Covid-related reasons. Nine hundred schools were affected, in a week during which many headteachers and parents complained they were unable to access coronavirus tests, forcing those showing symptoms to be kept away from the classroom and self-isolate. Including independent schools at a similar rate would bring the figure for England close to 1,000 schools. The DfE defines schools as “fully open” if they are able to provide face-to-face teaching for all pupils on roll for the whole school day and they have not asked a group of pupils to self-isolate. A further 2% of settings were not fully open but the reasons were not classed as Covid-related. The DfE noted that 99.9% of state schools were open, and that the majority of schools that were closing were doing so only for some pupils, such as classes or year group bubbles in close contact with a suspected case. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “As we would expect, this data shows a small number of pupils are self-isolating in line with public health advice, and schools, colleges and early years settings across the country continue to work tremendously hard to ensure protective measures are in place to reduce the risks of transmission.” The figures, based on a survey of three-quarters of England’s state schools, showed that more than one in eight pupils were absent last Thursday, rising to one in seven in secondary schools, meaning that more than a million children were out of school. Typically fewer than 5% of pupils are absent, according to a different dataset, which suggests 600,000 may have been absent for coronavirus-related issues. The number of pupils in school nationally also fell compared with the previous week, which had been the first full week for almost all schools to be open after the summer holidays. Just 87% of pupils were recorded as attending, compared with 88% the previous week. But even in schools classed as “fully open” by the DfE, the overall attendance rate fell from 90% on 15 September, to 88% on 22 September. Special schools and alternative provision such as pupil referral units appear to have been hit hardest by absences, although both tend to have higher absence rates than mainstream schools. The DfE estimated that independent schools had attendance rates of 91%. State secondary schools recorded attendances of 86%, meaning that more than 500,000 pupils were absent. It highlights the struggle that schools face in preparing their year 11 and year 13 pupils for 2021’s GCSE, BTec and A-level exams, with most having already missed more than a term of their courses last year. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It is clear from the latest statistics that the government is failing in its duty to reduce the infection rate and to provide pupils and teachers with tests in a timely fashion. This is eroding trust among parents, and it will be an uphill struggle for it to be regained.” Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that her son, who is in the middle of GCSEs, had missed months of school and had been sent home this week to isolate, adding: “What the hell is the government going to do for kids like him and his classmates?” Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, is still to announce the dates for next year’s exams, after suggestions by Williamson that they could be delayed by two or three weeks. Ofqual’s leaders have said the organisation is working on contingency plans, including online exams, in the event of Covid-19 outbreaks or lockdowns further disrupting schools and students. The Scottish government is considering scrapping in-person exams for National 5s – a qualification equivalent to GCSEs – and instead awarding results using school assessments.",education
"Sixth former Amy Fielding*, with her dreams of becoming a lawyer and her hard work for her A-levels, has the air of a determined young woman at the pinnacle of a successful school career. Yet only two years ago, her teachers say, Amy was a “challenging tearaway” doing all the things that in many schools would lead to permanent exclusion. But Amy’s school, George Green’s in Tower Hamlets, didn’t exclude her. Its leadership team, determined to bring down exclusions rates, committed themselves to keeping her in school. She has benefited from a radically different approach to managing behaviour, based on understanding pupils’ personal circumstances and helping them to overcome the impact of traumatic experiences in early life, or outside school, that may be affecting their behaviour – such as abuse, neglect, domestic violence and family breakdown. It is the polar opposite from some of the prevailing wisdom of the past decade, by which high-profile schools celebrate the virtues of a “zero tolerance” or no-excuses discipline policy, sometimes linked to a seemingly cruel school culture and high numbers of exclusions. In recent years details have leaked out of very successful schools using approaches that reduced children to tears, with some students, according to England’s children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, spending days in isolation booths. One Norfolk academy advised teachers to provide buckets for ill pupils to vomit in during lessons rather than leave the classroom – although it has since backtracked. George Green’s deputy head, Aidan McQuaid, came to the school knowing exclusions were too high and determined to address the problem through a supportive, rather than punitive, approach. Exclusion rates have since fallen, and pupils such as Amy given a second chance. And the sort of trauma-informed practice used at Amy’s school is a growing in popularity, as exclusion rates across the country remain stubbornly high and the impact of the Covid lockdown on pupils becomes clearer. “Amy is a bright girl with aspirations, but she was putting herself in a vulnerable position because of her home life and significant safeguarding concerns,” says McQuaid. “We helped her understand that we weren’t going to give up on her, and explained what she could do differently by addressing the behaviour in a way she understood. We were in her corner and we refused to be another key support figure in her life to let her down. “We have unwavering high expectations, and behaviour at George Green’s school is excellent. Each young person is different and may have super-challenging circumstances in their lives, so we need to find a balance. Some of these young people haven’t got the skills to manage behaviour because their brains haven’t developed in that way. Why are we punishing them for something they can’t control? Why would you exclude someone to effectively send them back to the place where they are most vulnerable and increase their risk of harm? That does not make sense.” For Amy, switching to a different track was only possible because of her teachers’ confidence that keeping her in school would work. “I had a lot of stuff going on at home and outside of school which meant I found it hard to concentrate and didn’t care about school,” she says. “Support from teachers helped me to understand that, and I am so proud of myself that I didn’t get kicked out. I wouldn’t have been able to do that without my teachers.” The method has attracted cynics, with accusations on social media that it is wishy washy and weak on poorly behaved pupils.  Dave Whitaker, director of learning at the Wellspring academy trust, has got used to the criticism. He is a longstanding practitioner of what he calls a “relational” approach to behaviour – “We batter them with kindness,” as he explains it. He believes the record of the trust’s 25 schools, mostly in areas of high deprivation, speaks for itself. All are good or outstanding and have never had any permanent exclusions. “We are very rigorous, have high standards and this work isn’t easy.” His trust includes mainstream primary, secondary, alternative provision and specialist SEMH schools (for children with social, emotional and mental health needs). “What I call the behaviourist approach [zero tolerance and rewards and sanctions] only looks at behaviour, rather than deeper causes. We chucked it out the window 10 years ago and began to look at underlying emotions, rather than symptoms. Kindness, restorative practice and strong relationships underpin the culture of everything we do.” Wellspring heads are evangelical about the benefits of the trauma-informed approach. One, Jason Thurley, says his school, the Beacon academy in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, is the opposite of a “comply or die school”. “We are giving children a second chance and we are oversubscribed and popular with parents, who have written at length to Ofsted to say how much they appreciate that. In areas of high deprivation, zero tolerance and high exclusions are not going to improve that community, which is what schools should be doing.” A colleague, Ann Marie Oliver, associate principal of a specialist SEMH school, Springwell Leeds, describes the impact of the method on children who have had the sort of adverse childhood experiences trauma-informed practice is designed to tackle. “Young people with physical disabilities are easy to see and understand. When young people have suffered from trauma and inconsistent care at a young age, they have strong emotional needs that are not so obvious to the eye. They don’t trust adults well because their needs have not met by the caregiver. For them, life is like being in shark-infested waters. We can’t see anything, but the smallest trigger could see their bodies go into crisis and automatic fight-or-flight mode. “We had one young man who had been in 10 different foster homes over the last two years and lived in constant crisis, experiencing permanent rejection. Our response was ‘we are here for you, we are not going to reject you, we are going to keep you safe’.” And this work appears to be in more demand than ever. Trauma Informed Schools UK, which offers teacher training in the method, is working with 3500 schools, including every school in Cornwall, and more than 20,000 teachers took part in its online “return to school” training after lockdown. Dr Margot Sunderland, co-director, says many heads are reporting a rise in the number of children whose behaviour has been affected by lockdown, possibly with a violent or depressed parent. “People are hungry for a different vision of how to support these children. There is a growing awareness that this is a social justice issue. The evidence is very clear that without help in schools to address their unmet emotional needs, children who have adverse childhood experiences, including living in poverty, are more likely to develop long-term mental and physical health problems and/or get involved in crime. Until we start to address the emotional needs of traumatised children, little will change in society.” Tackling these types of traumatic childhood experiences is a key strand of NHS Scotland’s work, and an Adverse Childhood Experiences hub has worked with more than 60% of schools in Wales. Some universities are including trauma-informed practice in their teacher training and the Department for Education’s recent guidance on mental health and behaviour for schools in England includes TISUK as a possible resource. But headteachers such as Thurley believe a profound rebalancing of schools’ performance measures to value inclusion as well as results is needed. “Many heads are pressured to prioritise results over pupil wellbeing, which inevitably leads to exclusions to remove challenging pupils. Secondary schools need to put children and relationships first and data second,” he says. Kiran Gill, founder of The Difference, which provides specialist mental health and trauma-informed practice training for senior leaders, such as McQuaid, believes a culture shift away from the no-excuses approach may be on the way. “It’s clear that heads, trusts and local authorities want a systemic and solutions-focused response to pupils’ vulnerability and experience of trauma that goes beyond whack-a-mole policies which lead the students who need school most getting more and more marginalised,” she says. “It’s early days, but increasing numbers of schools are curious about the neuroscience that’s been applied in mental health services. If we see more schools using interventions that improve pupil outcomes, reduce absenteeism and exclusion, I hope we will see that reflected in the narrative and accountability from Ofsted and the Department for Education.” * Not her real name",education
"A ban on residential school trips risks an “economic, social and cultural disaster” and the loss of 15,000 UK jobs unless it is lifted by spring, ministers are being warned. A generation of children risk missing out on often life-changing benefits of visits unless there are changes to Covid-19 restrictions that have left outdoor education centres dormant since March, according to companies, schools and parents. Some of Britain’s poorest pupils – including those from city communities – are among those who stand to lose most. The school travel sector has been closed by since March and wants a change to continued advice preventing overnight educational visits. “It is a bitter pill to swallow keeping our sites closed while we see hotels, boarding schools and hostels delivering the same overnight experiences unabated,” said Jim Whittaker, the chair of the Association of Heads of Outdoors Centres and a member of the trade body UK Outdoors. PGL, a specialist school travel company that is one of the biggest in the sector, has already announced 670 redundancies. In a letter to Johnson on Monday, UK Outdoors said “an existential threat” loomed over the sector, which ranges from the small independents and local authority providers to larger international organisations. It told the prime minister that nearly 3,000 jobs had already been lost and many outdoor education facilities had permanently closed after losing £500m of revenue. Without change before the spring term, half of outdoor education capacity will be lost permanently alongside more than 10,000 jobs, it added. Andy Robinson, the chief executive of Institute for Outdoor Learning, said: “Every child’s first trip away from home is such an important and formative experience. The government has to act to protect the industry and ensure its reopening in time for the spring term or face an economic, social and cultural disaster.” The calls are backed by headteachers and parents, while a petition calling on the Department for Education to immediately allow overnight education trips for schools has attracted more than 10,000 signatures. Residential trips were described as “essential for children’s emotional and educational development” by the deputy head of John Rankin schools in Berkshire, which sends 90 year 5 pupils every autumn term to a centre with sites in Dorset and south Wales, while 90 year 6 pupils go to Rhos in north Wales for a week in January. “I don’t understand why it’s OK for a plane full of 300 people to travel to Zante on holiday, yet the government has told us that our year 5s and 6s, already in a school bubble, can’t go away for five days,” added Matt Percy, the school’s deputy head. Lenka Uhlarova, whose daughter Bea has Down’s syndrome, spoke about how the trips with other John Rankin pupils had helped her, adding: “She was able to take risks and overcome some of her fears. She learned about history in a practical way in a beautiful setting, but most of all Bea developed her independence skills, team building and confidence.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Since the start of term, schools have been able to run non-residential trips. We keep our guidance on both residential and non-residential trips under review, in line with Public Health England advice.”",education
"Dancing, drinking and flirting at wild parties will be firmly off the student timetable this term – even for those tempted to attend an illegal event. Universities are paying for “Covid marshals” to break up mass gatherings and stop undergraduates flouting pandemic rules. In Newcastle, police will carry out “high visibility” patrols in student hubs every night until Christmas, with the city’s two main universities picking up the bill. Newcastle and Northumbria universities said they would provide the additional funding as part of their Operation Oak community initiative, which already costs £125,000 a year. Police will be present in places with high student numbers such as Jesmond, a suburb in the north of Newcastle known for its lively party scene. Officers were called to the area several times during lockdown following reports of student gatherings. As term begins and 28,000 Newcastle university students descend on campus, 2 million people in the north-east have been placed under local lockdown and banned from mixing in private homes and gardens. Joe Molander, a third-year at Newcastle, said that while he thought patrols were important, local authorities were “itching for a fight with students”. “I think they see us as loud, heavy-drinking nuisances. Police patrols might be an excuse for the police to harass students,” he said. “I think the university should make the guidelines clearer. I can support police patrols if they’re there to assist, and not to bully.” Students in Manchester will also see “community night-time support patrols” in busy areas in the south of the city. The patrols, paid for by Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan universities, will be carried out by security contractor Mitie and will report antisocial behaviour and breaches of social distancing to the relevant authorities. Manchester university said the patrols started on 14 September and would take place every night between 10pm and 6am for the first two weeks of term. They would then be active every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday during term time. Tom Simms, a first-year at Manchester university who moved into halls last week, said that he had already been moved on by a security guard who was wearing university uniform. “There were only four of us, we heard some people sitting outside chatting so we went outside and joined them,” he said. “Slowly the group got bigger and marshals came round and said ‘look, guys, you’re going to have to break it up’.” Simms said he was worried students would be forced inside, which would be worse for the spread of the virus: “The rule of six doesn’t really seem fair when you’re outside. Not having loads of people mixing in the same flat makes sense but sitting outside quite far apart seems pretty safe.” The plans for student patrols are similar to those recently floated by Boris Johnson for “Covid marshals” to enforce rules in city centres. Hundreds of thousands of students will return to campus next week, and universities have brought forward several measures to stop the virus from spreading. Most in-person freshers events have been cancelled, and lectures will be held online with minimal face-to-face teaching. Undergraduates have even been warned they could be kicked out if they do not follow the rules. Some universities are also rolling out on-campus testing. Leicester will be among the institutions screening potentially asymptomatic students and staff to try to prevent the spread of the virus. Cambridge has also pledged to test 15,000 students every week. In the latest guidance, universities were urged by the government not to send students back to their family homes in the event of an outbreak, and told that in such cases, students should remain where they are, to “reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through travel”.",education
"More than four out of five schools in England have pupils stuck at home because they cannot get access to Covid-19 tests, according to a survey of headteachers. Meanwhile it emerged that Eton, where the prime minister studied, had used a private provider to test all of its staff and students as they returned to school in September.  The National Association of Head Teachers said the government had “failed schools and children” after receiving reports from more than 700 of its members that 82% had pupils absent because of a lack of testing, and 86% had pupils at home waiting for their results. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT, said: “We are hearing the same thing repeatedly from our members across the country – chaos is being caused by the inability of staff and families to successfully get tested when they display symptoms. “This means schools are struggling with staffing, have children missing school, and ultimately that children’s education is being needlessly disrupted.” Nearly half of the headteachers contacted said they had staff off seeking a test, and 60% had staff waiting for test results to come back. More than one in six school leaders said they had had a confirmed case of Covid-19 infection among their pupils since the start of term this month. Whiteman said: “It is in no way unpredictable or surprising that the demand for Covid-19 tests would spike when schools reopened more widely this term. And yet the system is in chaos. The government has failed schools and children.” Asked about its private tests, Eton said it had acted on the advice of health professionals. In a statement, the Berkshire fee-paying school said: “Eton took the decision to test all pupils and staff for Covid-19 on their return to school, having carefully assessed the risks of transmission within our specific boarding context. In deciding to test, Eton has been determined not to put additional pressure on the NHS. Therefore, a contract has been taken out with a private provider and the school is covering all costs.” To relieve pressure on the testing programme, members of the government’s Sage group of scientific advisers have recommended that a national two-week lockdown could be imposed in October to coincide with schools’ half-term holidays, according to a report in the Financial Times. “As schools will be closed for one week at half-term, adding an extra week to that will have limited impact on education,” one of Sage’s members said. After protests from schools, the Department for Education has set up a response hotline for headteachers to call in the event of outbreaks rather than relying on Public Health England’s local teams. The DfE has also announced it will provide extra home-testing kits for schools after heads complained the initial supply of 10 kits was inadequate. Schools can now order 10 tests for every 1,000 pupils on roll, but only three weeks after their previous order was accepted. On Thursday, Dido Harding, the head of the NHS’s test and trace programme, told MPs: “I don’t think anybody was expecting to see the really sizeable increase” in the demand for testing after pupils returned after the summer holidays. School leaders say they were repeatedly assured by the government that testing would be in place for schools reopening, as a key safety requirement to enable children and teachers to return. A coalition of school leaders – including the NAHT, the Association of School and College Leaders and the national school governors’ association – wrote to Boris Johnson this week, imploring him to take personal responsibility for the lack of testing and slow results hampering schools. A government spokesperson said official statistics showed 99.9% of schools were open with the vast majority of pupils attending. “Where staff or children have symptoms of Covid-19, testing capacity is the highest it has ever been, and we are working to provide further priority access for teachers. “Schools only need to identify close contacts and ask them to self-isolate if and when a case is confirmed from a positive test result,” the spokesperson said.",education
"My friend and colleague Peter Puloy-Wey, who has died aged 82, was a painter of landscapes full of soaring skies in the tradition of Turner, and a lecturer at St Albans School of Art and Craft who pioneered the professional development of arts therapists. We were colleagues at St Albans from 1973 to 1992, together involved in developing the postgraduate master’s degrees in art therapy and dramatherapy. The success of these courses was significant in establishing the arts therapies as registered professions in the NHS (1999). Peter’s role was central to the work, being responsible for the practical studio and media core of the training. His skill lay in facilitating an open and secure environment in which students could take risks to create personal and often emotional work. Many students reported how they rediscovered their creativity in his workshops. It was fundamental to the course philosophy that art therapists in their work with patients should be in touch with their personal creative process. It was at the college that Peter met Monika Puloy, an art historian, whom he married in 1974. Peter’s own painting developed fresh energy from their relationship and summer visits to Monika’s home in the Austrian Alps. Inspired by the vast skies, swirling mist and thermals of the mountains, his spontaneous use of watercolour produced a range of colourful work full of movement and space. Born in Hackney, east London, Peter was the son of Jack Wey, an engraver for gold and silversmiths, and Catherine (nee McIver). His early years were affected by asthma and tuberculosis. The family moved to Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and he attended Norton Road school, one of the first designed around a quadrangle to allow open-air teaching and let light and air in. Peter studied painting at St Albans, his early work being influenced by Norman Adams, who taught there. He returned to the school in the 1960s as a fine art lecturer on the foundation course and was appointed to the arts therapy department as a full-time lecturer in 1974, rising to senior lecturer. When the art school merged with the University of Hertfordshire in 1992, Peter continued lecturing on the fine art course until his retirement in the mid-90s. Peter’s paintings were included in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition as well as other group shows. I shared a joint exhibition with him, titled Landscape and Marks, in the Margaret Harvey gallery at the college in 1981, and the following year in Cambridge. When Monika developed early Alzheimer’s disease in the late 90s, Peter’s care for her over many years was inspiring. Using his skills as a teacher he joined with her in singing and dancing groups, and encouraged her to use an instant camera, responding to moments of recognition in their home. These images became the Christmas cards they sent out. Monika died in 2017. After a period of grieving Peter began painting again. He is survived by his brother, Jack, a niece, Susan, and two nephews, Stephen and Paul.",education
"The world-renowned Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies has been accused of forcing out a bisexual employee whose lifestyle did not comply with the views of its major funders including Saudi Arabia. Dr Kevin Fogg, who is in a same-sex partnership, will give evidence to an employment tribunal on Monday that his career has been wrecked by “continuous and ongoing indirect sexual orientation discrimination” at the institution. The centre said it completely rejects Fogg’s “wild allegations”. Fogg’s claims, it said in a statement, “have no basis in fact.” It added: “Contrary to his current complaints, Dr Fogg has been treated very well by the centre.” In his witness statement, which the Guardian has seen, Fogg will claim that the centre’s director, Dr Farhan Ahmad Nizami, harboured the “long intention”of dismissing him and that he had been discriminated against on the grounds of age and sexual orientation. Fogg will tell the Tribunal on Monday: “The centre has a culture of antagonism and intolerance towards non-heterosexual lifestyles, as I came to understand through interactions over my six years of employment.” Fogg will say that the centre, which largely relies on funding from donors, imposes the conservative values of its trustees and donors on its staff. “The key donors ... include many states in which homosexuality is punishable under law, in some cases including by capital punishment under law,” Fogg will state. “Many of these states are also represented on the centre’s board of trustees, the supreme decision-making body of the centre’s governance, where they direct all decisions including oversight of personnel decisions.” Fogg describes incidents, including Nizami personally ordering books on women’s leadership in Islam, and sexuality studies in Islamic societies, be removed from display in the centre library. The centre denies the charges. In its statement, it said: “In 2018, after an extensive process of review of his work, Dr Fogg’s request for a yet further period at the centre was declined. It was only after, and it would seem as a result of, the centre turning down his request for a second extension that he has made this allegation of indirect sexual orientation discrimination.” Fogg will tell the tribunal: “The centre’s decision to dismiss me damaged my career and earning prospects irreparably [and] has had a significant and adverse impact on my mental health. In the two years since my dismissal, I have had significant trouble sleeping, difficulties with eating and episodes of depression - both because of my treatment at the hands of the centre and because of the subsequent uncertainties of extended unemployment.” Fogg, who now works as an administrator, will say: “I believe it is unlikely that I will ever in the future be employed in the field for which I trained.”",education
"MondayMy colleagues and I set foot on campus for the first time since March. We had to schedule a time to visit as it’s still too dangerous for too many people to be present. This gives us an hour to understand how things work in our “Covid-secure” campus, just days before students start returning. Most of us are pretty nervous about visiting the campus for personal reasons (children at home, ageing parents, partners who work for the NHS). Reports of the role universities are playing in new cases worry us, too. Several colleagues had something that swept through our overcrowded offices in February and early March which many of us now think was coronavirus. Members of staff and students’ families have died from the virus. We have been assured by the university’s management that all is in place for face-to-face teaching: everything deep cleaned, numerous hand sanitiser stations, social distancing in classrooms, masks required in shared areas, one-way systems. But that’s not the reality. The carpets and walls in many classrooms look dirty. Our offices are just as we left them – grotty tea cups and all. It looks like a ghost town. There are only a few hand sanitiser stations scattered throughout the building.  The shields in some classrooms look very DIY; one protective shield in a seminar room might actually be a clear shower curtain. We’re supposed to teach students whose desks are way too close to us behind a makeshift plastic sheet. In another, screens separating desks are made of some kind of painted plywood. Students sitting there wouldn’t be able to see their lecturer. The university is telling students that, although obligatory in hallways and communal areas, masks will not be required in classrooms. We’re in classrooms for hours at a time, often working at close proximity to students. The university has told us to buy our own face shields if we want them. The only thing that has been fully completed is the placement of signs everywhere declaring that the building is Covid-secure, as if saying it makes it true. Trying to figure out the route to my classrooms, I follow the new one-way system arrows only to run into a “do not enter” sign. I stare at the red circle, confused as to my next move. How will hundreds of students manage this?  TuesdayI host a Zoom Q&A for returning students. Many are deciding to stay at home and continue their classes remotely. Quite a few think cities aren’t safe, or that Britain isn’t taking this seriously enough. Some have doubts about the university’s readiness. I agree with them, but am supposed to pretend that all is well.  Most of my students are not party animals, contrary to what you see in media coverage. They are taking this seriously, and have deep concerns. In March, several of them nervously asked me to start teaching online since Covid was spreading through the halls of residence and they needed to go home to their families. As a result, I went online before the government and the university required us to do so. If the UK had locked down that same week, tens of thousands of people might not have died. The current musings from scientists about doing too little, too late this time around fill me with an eerie deja vu. Suddenly, the government has announced new precautions, including the rule of six. All of our timetables will have to change, and smaller groups will mean we have to teach the same class multiple times. No one has spoken to us about workload. Several of my colleagues are starting to have anxiety issues. Again. The semester hasn’t even started and I’m exhausted. Again. Wednesday One of my students asks if we can chat on the phone. Normally students stop seeing me in June, but not this year. We’ve been having to provide a lot more support, which we’re not trained for. All summer, students have asked me an academic question then quickly shifted to talking about their loneliness, financial worries, family dysfunction in close quarters, anxiety, depression and fears about the future. I am not a counsellor, but I do what I can. The student I’m talking to has already lost several family members to the virus. She’s calling because she can’t afford a better internet connection and computer. She’s worried that it’s affecting her studies. I tell her that she can now come to campus to use the computers. She goes silent. I ask her what’s wrong. She’s embarrassed to say that she’s afraid to come to campus, because she doesn’t want to start another Covid cycle in her family. She asks whether people will be wearing masks. I tell her that I require it in my classroom, but the university only expects it in hallways. That brings a derisive: “Hmmph”. She asks if the university will be checking temperatures when students arrive. I tell her no. She laughs and says: “Well I’ll bring my temperature gun and we’ll make a game of it.” ThursdayOur approach to freshers’ week is a mix of online and offline activities. There’s more emphasis on freshers being on campus for induction and teaching so they can have the “university experience”. My colleagues and I have noticed the management team’s obsession with this idea. They think that by offering a lot of face-to-face teaching we were able to be more competitive with universities which were more conservative about opening their campuses. Given the new government guidance, our students’ union’s freshers’ plans are cancelled. We only just averted a hundred-person BBQ with drinking games, a networking event at a popular bar venue, a foam party at a nightclub, and a karaoke night by about 24 hours. Though we all feel bad that young people don’t get to have all the fun we did at uni, my colleagues and I weren’t excited about being face-to-face with people who had attended a string of parties.  FridayOther universities have locked their students down in halls of residence, and the return of students to university areas seems to be causing outbreaks. Is anyone actually surprised? Another worrying headline: scientists think universities should only have a third of their students on campus. We have more than two-thirds of our student body returning, so we may have a lot of work to redo timetables. Today we were all supposed to attend an induction event for freshers on campus, but only half of us are here. A few of my colleagues objected, citing the government’s latest directive about doing everything you can from home. I came to avoid the inevitable hassle of getting penalised for complaining. Many of my colleagues who have raised health and safety issues have been given extra work or had their teaching preparation efforts weirdly scrutinised.  I have to take public transport at rush hour to attend. It is crowded in spite of the government’s new instructions. When I arrive, the students are bored with the endless PowerPoint presentations.At the end, I hear one saying to agreement from some others: “Glad I risked my life for that. They should have done all this online.” I see another group of students who have followed the one-way arrows and made it to the end of the hallway where I had found myself trapped on Monday. “How do we get out of here?” they shout. I am not sure how to answer.",education

"Glasgow University is to refund one month’s rent to students in halls of residence as compensation after hundreds were forced to self-isolate following an outbreak of coronavirus. Students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time, have been told they cannot visit their families, and are banned from going to pubs and restaurants over the weekend, after 124 new infections were reported at the university on Thursday. Following criticism of the lack of support given to those isolating, the university said it would refund rent, make a £50 food payment to students and initiate more drop-ins from student support staff. The number of food parcels for those self-isolating will also increase, along with cleaning materials, bedding and towels. A test centre was established at the Murano Street halls of residence, which houses more than 1,000 students. The return of students to campuses across Scotland – where the academic year starts earlier than in much of the UK – has seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, leading to the Scottish government and Universities Scotland to request students not to socialise in hospitality venues this weekend. Outbreaks have hit 23 universities across the UK, forcing thousands of students into self-isolation. In Manchester, 1,700 students are being placed in quarantine for a fortnight at halls of residence at Birley and All Saints Park, in a joint move by the local authority, the university and Public Health England. Glasgow University principal Prof Anton Muscatelli said: “I hear the concerns of our students in residences and I appreciate how difficult this situation is for them. From today, we are rolling out significant extra support measures so they can more easily access food, health and wellbeing and other supplies. “We are offering everyone in our residences, regardless of whether they are isolating or not, a one-month rent refund to compensate for the disruption they are facing, and any financial hardship they may have encountered.” He thanked those who were in self-isolation for “playing their part”, adding: “Our living support team are also stepping up efforts to proactively contact students, check on their wellbeing and offer support. “To make sure everyone has access to hot and fresh food, we will work with providers to install mobile catering units and give £50 to each student for food and supplies. This isn’t the start of academic life we would wish for anyone.” Earlier this week, some students criticised the university for bringing them back, given that so much learning has already moved online. Lucy Owens, a student living in the Murano complex and who has coronavirus, told BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “What are we paying for? I could do everything I am doing from my house, so why have they sent us here? … “Putting 2,000 students into such a confined area, something like this was bound to happen.” On Friday, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, apologised to students for the start of their academic year, but supported universities to take action against those breaking the rules “as a last resort”. The union representing academics and staff has called for face-to-face teaching at universities to be halted until the government fixes test-and-trace failures and curbs the spread of the virus.",education
"Students at Oxford University specialising in the study of China are being asked to submit some papers anonymously to protect them from the possibility of retribution under the sweeping new security law introduced three months ago in Hong Kong. The anonymity ruling is to be applied in classes, and group tutorials are to be replaced by one-to-ones. Students are also to be warned it will be viewed as a disciplinary offence if they tape classes or share them with outside groups. The Hong Kong security law was imposed on 30 June by Beijing after more than a year of pro-democracy protests, and had an immediately corrosive impact on political freedoms in the territory. Its provisions also give the Chinese government powers to arrest individuals who are not Hong Kong residents, for actions or comments made outside the territory. The powerful extraterritorial powers claimed in the law have led to fears for those studying in the UK, in particular for those with personal and family connections to Hong Kong and mainland China. Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, is to hold talks with Chinese scholars to discuss the national security law early next month. A group of academics are also expected to advance a draft code of conduct this week for how universities should deal students from authoritarian states. The number of Chinese students in UK higher education has grown by more than a third in the past four years and is now above 120,000. In 2018-19, 35% of all non-EU students were from China. Numbers are due to rise again this year, but the full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is not yet known. Overseas students are a valuable source of income for the UK university sector since they often pay two to three times as much in fees as UK students. Patricia Thornton, associate professor of Chinese politics at Oxford University, said: “The entire spirit of the tutorial, which rests on collective critical inquiry, rises or falls on the ability of the institution to guarantee free speech, freedom of expression and academic freedom for all. “But how to do this in the wake of China’s new national security law for Hong Kong, which invites self-censorship with its lack of red lines and generous extraterritorial provision? How does one protect academic freedom when China claims the right to intervene everywhere?” She said: “I have decided not to alter the content of my teaching. However, like my colleagues in the US, I am mindful of my duty of care for my students, many of whom are not UK citizens. My students will be submitting and presenting work anonymously in order to afford some extra protection.” Her students will be asked to read anonymised papers in weekly classes, and small group tutorials will be replaced by one-on-one lessons. “This means my lectures, reading lists and tutorial essay questions will remain largely the same, but the students will be asked to present the anonymised work of one of their peers in classes.” She said advice is being issued that if classes are delivered online, there must be no attempt to record the content or share the material with anyone outside the group. Claiming “we are all Hong Kongers”, she pointed out the extraterritorial provision arguably makes deportation a possibility. The decision in Oxford follows similar moves by elite US colleges. At Princeton University students in a Chinese politics class will use codes instead of names on their work, and Harvard Business School may excuse students from discussing politically sensitive topics if they are worried about the risks, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Lord Patten, the former British governor of Hong Kong and a fierce critic of the Chinese communist party, said: “Students that come from China to work in our universities come from universities where there are cameras in classes and there are paid informants and narks to tell them what is going on. We have to be very very careful that does not leak into our universities. “Hong Kong represents all those values that China is nervous about – whether it is free speech, a recognition of the universality of human rights, the determination to provide an education that is open.” Eva Pils, professor of law at King’s College London, said: “There is a great deal of concern about the new national security legislation in Hong Kong and its impact on freedom of expression. The offences newly introduced by this law are worded vaguely, leading to the fear that any criticism of the government could be treated as a criminal offence. There is also concern about the institutions set up to implement the law. There is also the risk that an individual’s case can be transferred to the mainland where the legal process is deeply flawed. “If you are a student or scholar visiting, for example, the UK from Hong Kong or planning to visit Hong Kong and you work on issues perceived as politically sensitive in Hong Kong then you have some reason to be worried that your work might get you into trouble, and that is what is happening. The effect can be stifling and oppressive, also in the classroom.” The British Association for Chinese Studies has warned universities the response to the security law “cannot be for teachers to err on the side of caution in their teaching content or for certain China-related modules to be dropped from the syllabus because they prove too challenging to deliver safely.”",education
"Teachers should not tell children that they might be a different gender based on their personality or the clothes they want to wear, new guidance from the Department for Education states. The guidance, published on Thursday, notes teachers in England must not “reinforce harmful stereotypes” and resources used to discuss topics involving gender and biological sex should be “age-appropriate and evidence based”. The guidance says: “We are aware that topics involving gender and biological sex can be complex and sensitive matters to navigate.” It follows the government’s decision to drop plans to allow people to officially change gender without a medical diagnosis, a move that was criticised by LGBT charities. The government will instead cut the cost of applying for a gender recognition certificate. Schools have also been discouraged from working with organisations that produce materials suggesting “non-conformity to gender stereotypes should be seen as synonymous with having a different gender identity”. While teachers should not suggest to children who do not comply with gender stereotypes that either their personality or their body is in need of changing, teachers should be supportive of needs of individual students, the guidance added. In a statement the charity Mermaid, which supports transgender children, said: “It isn’t for any adult to tell a child or young person what their gender identity is. In fact, all too often we see the damage done when grown ups try to force children and young people to be something they’re not.” Shereen Benjamin, a senior lecturer in primary education at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This clarification from the DfE is welcome and helpful. It is crucial that gender stereotyping is addressed in schools and discussed in age-appropriate ways with children and young people: it is also crucial that young people questioning their gender identities are supported and listened to without judgment. Suggesting to children that it is possible to be born in the wrong body is misleading, regressive and potentially very harmful, and it is good that the DfE has clarified that this should not be done.” Benjamin also welcomed the DfE’s advice that schools exercise care and caution in working with external lobby groups, and was critical of the some of the resources recommended by groups such as Stonewall. She called for Scotland to follow suit with similar guidance.  The campaign group Transgender Trend, which describes itself as a group of parents, professionals and academics, concerned about the rising number of children being diagnosed as transgender, tweeted the guidelines and said: “This is what we have been calling for. We are very glad to see this guidance issued by the Department for Education.” The organisation Safe Schools Alliance said the guidance was “vindication of years of campaigning from” from groups like theirs. Mo Wiltshire, the director of education and youth at the LGBT charity Stonewall, said: “While the introduction of statutory relationships and sex education in England’s schools is a big step forward, we’re concerned the UK government’s new guidance for the subject falls short in equipping teachers to deliver high-quality and timely LGBT-inclusive education. We’re particularly concerned by some of the confusing wording on teaching about trans identities, which only tells teachers what they shouldn’t teach about, rather than what they should.” She added: “Stonewall has always been clear that teachers shouldn’t make assumptions about whether a child is trans because they don’t conform to gender stereotypes, in the same way that we have always advised that teachers should not make assumptions about a child’s sexual orientation.”",education
"Some schools are planning to increase their class sizes to up to 60 pupils so that they can continue to offer students an education this term, as fears grow of a looming teacher shortage. Headteachers are worried that a significant number of staff will need to self-isolate for long periods this winter as they struggle to gain access to tests for Covid-19, and that schools will soon run out of money to pay for cover from supply teachers. Vic Goddard, co-principal at Passmores Academy in Harlow and star of the Channel 4 series Educating Essex, has already set up his school hall like an exam hall so that a “masterclass” of up to 60 pupils could be taught inside by one teacher plus one or two support staff, if needed. “I can’t see us getting through this half-term without there being some major doubling up or tripling up of classes,” he said. A recent survey by the National Association of Head Teachers found that 45% of schools have teachers who are currently unable to attend because they are awaiting a coronavirus test, and spokesman James Bowen warned it would not be surprising if schools suffered from “a shortage of supply teachers” as winter begins. Yet, despite the “abject failure of the testing system” and corresponding increase in staff absences, he said schools were receiving no financial support from the government to pay for the extra supply teachers they needed, leaving many schools to try to cover absences “internally”. “Many [school] budgets simply won’t stretch to meet these supply costs,” he said. Louise Atkinson, vice-president of the National Education Union, said a few schools had already had to shut because of a shortage of staff, and it was “inevitable” that more would need to close as virus cases continued to rise. “The current situation is unsustainable,” she said. Currently, around 8% of Goddard’s staff are absent from school awaiting test results, and it is taking about five days for each teacher who develops symptoms (or lives with someone else who is symptomatic) to be tested and cleared for a return. He said he “cannot afford” to bring in supply teachers and was therefore planning “contingencies on contingencies on contingencies” to keep children in school. “My worry is that staff absences are only going to accumulate,” he said. “It won’t take much – in certain subjects, it won’t take much at all – for us to have nobody within the school who can teach that subject or even cover and deliver the lessons.” One science teacher at a north London school taught back-to-back triple lessons to a class of 60 children in his school hall last week after a colleague called in sick with a temperature. “I’m fairly confident this will happen again,” he wrote on Twitter, and offered his tips to other teachers facing the same situation, such as speaking loudly from his diaphragm and using a “massive” projector screen. He expects that teaching a class that size “sadly, will have to remain an option” at his school: combining his class with his colleague’s in this way had “saved 60 kids from having to stare at a textbook for three lessons straight”. At another school, Southend High School for Boys, the headteacher, Robin Bevan, is feeling “deeply worried” about the second wave of infections. Last week, two of his teachers stayed off school to isolate. If there is an escalation in the number of positive cases, he fears “10 or more teachers” may have to self-isolate at a time. “Sustaining high-quality education at that point becomes almost impossible. Supply teachers are hard to find, and our annual budget for cover would disappear in weeks.” Last Friday, the Association of School and College Leaders warned the “catch-up funding” – given to schools to provide pupils with extra support after five months off in lockdown – would be “wiped out” by Covid safety measures and the cost of supply cover for teachers in self-isolation. “Many schools will be reliant upon supply teachers to provide cover when permanent staff have to self-isolate in line with Covid safety guidance. The biggest concern we are picking up is the costs involved, which can be very significant. We are pressing the government to reimburse these and other substantial costs incurred in implementing Covid safety measures because school budgets cannot take this hit,” said the general secretary, Geoff Barton. A spokesperson for the DfE did not comment on the prospect of class sizes of up to 60, but said that they “recognise that schools will have had to take measures to become covid-secure, as part of their hugely successful work to get the vast majority of children back to the classroom for the autumn term”.",education
"My father, Phil O’Keefe, who has died aged 71, was an academic geographer whose work over 40 years focused on people’s vulnerability to disasters and their impact on the natural world.  Among other projects, Phil undertook large-scale satellite mapping of sub-Saharan Africa, assisted in the first democratic South African elections, and led an evaluation of humanitarian assistance in Kosovo during the conflict of the late 1990s. He also wrote 30 books and more than 200 academic articles. Phil was born and grew up in North Shields, Northumberland, the oldest of five children. His mother, Joan (nee Hennessey), was a nurse and his father, Jack, a miner who later worked in customs on the Tyne. He attended Ushaw college, a seminary, from the age of 11, with the intention of becoming a priest. However, life got in the way. He studied philosophy at Durham University for a year from 1967, before transferring to Newcastle University to study geography, graduating in 1971. In 1974 he became a research fellow at Bradford University and in 1976 he co-authored an article in Nature magazine, Taking the Naturalness out of Natural Disasters, which set the context for his working life. It advocated taking into account the views and perspectives of ordinary people, especially the most vulnerable, in any discussion on sustainability, resilience and adaptation.  After leaving Bradford University in 1976 he worked as an associate professor for four years at Clark University in Massachusetts, during which time he also got a PhD from Soas University of London. Then for five years from 1980 he was a senior research fellow at the Beijer Institute at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Returning to Britain , he took up a senior lectureship at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University), where he remained until his retirement, as a professor, in 2015. There he was instrumental in creating an MSc in disaster management and sustainable development, which has now seen more than 350 students graduate. Phil lived a full life outside of academia, serving for 12 years as a Labour councillor on North Tyneside council, representing the Chirton and Camperdown wards. He was also a driving force in creating a vibrant community and live music scene around the Low Lights Tavern in North Shields. He bought an old sea captain’s house overlooking the mouth of the Tyne, and as our family home it became a place to stay for friends and family from all over the world – as well as “party central” for a growing family and their many friends. He met Di Jelley, a doctor, in Manchester in the mid-1970s and they married in 1982. Di survives him, as do their four children, Mark, Jack, Jessie and me, his sister and two brothers.",education
"Assistant headteacher, Western primary school, Grimsby At the height of the pandemic, Zane Powles was hailed as a superhero for delivering packed lunches, potatoes and tins of baked beans to all the children at his primary school who qualified for free school meals. But for him, it was simply a matter of “doing the right thing”; visiting his pupils, knowing they were “all safe” and had enough to eat also gave him the solace he often needed during lockdown. Each day, the 48-year-old got up at the crack of dawn to butter baps and pack up paper bags, before setting off on a seven mile circuit to visit 110 families, carrying approximately 50kg (110lbs) of food in rucksacks and a bin bag. In total, despite suffering from a knee injury, he walked more than 500 miles and delivered around 7,500 lunches to the children living in some of Grimsby’s toughest estates. Still, the attention he received took him by surprise – even now, he struggles to talk about it without getting upset. “When the media first got involved, and people started making nice comments, I found it overwhelming,” the former soldier says, his voice trembling with emotion. “I’d get back to school and just cry.” Children began putting up posters in their windows and chalking the walls and roads of his route, thanking him for being “a legend”. At the end of the summer term, hundreds of people lined up outside his school to applaud him as he returned from his day’s deliveries. “I went round the corner and the whole school was there. The kids had made banners and they were singing and their parents were there… and that was just the best thing ever. Oh man,” he breaks off, “I’m getting emotional again.” He was once a free-school-dinners kid himself, he confesses, and knows first hand what it means to grow up in “quite tough circumstances” on a council estate with little money. His father died when he was a baby and, he says, “lots of things happened after that which weren’t great… I think, because I’ve lived through that, I want to make the lives of our kids better than my life was.” In September, he and his pupils returned to Western primary school, where he is responsible for pastoral care and behaviour. “The head calls me ‘Captain Covid’ because I’m the one who’s put the systems in place and is making sure we’re following the guidance as closely as we can,” he says, adding that the new routines and restrictions are “challenging” and limit the educational support the school can offer, particularly to those with special educational needs. But on the plus side, now, he has a closer relationship with the parents he needs to talk to. “They call me by my first name and the connection is so much tighter. I can joke with them. They realise I am there for them, that I’ll do whatever I can to support them and their kids.” Every playtime, now, the children he helped to feed will crowd around him and try to cuddle him en masse. “They’re certainly more affectionate, even though they know they shouldn’t be, because of Covid.” He has also been honoured by his local council for his efforts supporting his community and recently gave a presentation to the taskforce that footballer Marcus Rashford set up to tackle child food poverty. But his primary focus is on the health and wellbeing of his own pupils. “Six more months of restrictions will be extremely tough on the children,” he says. “My biggest worry is their mental health. It’s already taken a battering.” As for his own mental health, he is aware he has his demons and says: “I relax by doing exercise and being active. If I hadn’t done all that walking, if I’d had to sit at home and not go out, I really would not have been able to cope.” If his school’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged pupils – “our kids” he calls them – had not needed his help, “I’d be in a bad place now. I know that.” French and year 6 teacher, Dalmarnock primary school, Glasgow When James Innes, AKA the “Joe Wicks for French”, made the decision to share videos of his French lessons online over lockdown, he had no idea that he would return to his school a YouTube sensation. Innes, formerly a general classroom teacher, has now been given the responsibility of teaching French to every pupil at his school after his entertaining homemade videos – featuring silly voices to make learning new vocabulary fun – went viral. “I knew that with schools shutting down French would be one of the subjects that would potentially be dropped by the wayside, yet French offers a lot of creative possibilities for remote teaching,” he says. “I recognised that actually it would be really easy to learn a little bit of French if there was an engaging format, with humour, which was accessible to learners of all ages.” Now that face-to-face teaching has resumed in Scotland, it mostly feels like things are back to normal at school, he says. However, it is a different situation outside of school: new restrictions preventing the mixing of households have recently been imposed in Scotland. “It’s funny… I can’t go round to anybody’s house, but I can go into many different classes at school and teach them.” He’s now using the videos he made during lockdown in his lessons as a springboard for conversations, games and activities in the classroom. “It’s wonderful to actually be able to see the kids enjoying French; when you’re teaching it online with just a camera to look at, it’s not nearly as rewarding.” He is hopeful that schools will be the last places to close if another lockdown is imposed. “It’s hugely beneficial to children’s health and wellbeing to be back.” Early years teacher, Fishergate primary school, York Sarah Wilson, a 43-year-old primary school teacher in York, is trying to run 100 marathons by the time she is 50 and has already done 34, so deciding to run 18 miles in a single day, in order to visit 66 of her pupils during lockdown, didn’t seem like a big deal to her. “I probably run about 100 miles a month normally, so an 18-mile run wasn’t a huge distance for me.” It took her about seven hours, slower than normal because of all the time she spent chatting with the nursery and reception children she visited. “They were so excited and they’d made loads of posters and banners, which was really unexpected and gave me a massive boost.” As well as supportive messages such as “Go, Mrs Wilson, go!”, a couple of kids even put declarations of love for their teacher on their posters, which, Wilson says, is “always nice”. Other children gave her gifts of little sweets to keep her going. “It brought us, as a school community, together.” Her efforts also raised more than £1,000 for national food bank charity the Trussell Trust. Now that she and her pupils have returned to Fishergate primary school in York, she is organising a run they too can take part in, inside their social bubbles. Each child will run a mile by doing “laps on the school field” and raise money for a local food bank. Despite finding it impossible to socially distance from the young children she teaches – “you do get sneezed on and licked” – she is glad to be back in the classroom and takes comfort from the extra cleaning and hand-washing routines that the school has put in place. But these extra cleaners and extra supplies cost money and another six months of Covid restrictions are going to have a big financial impact on schools. “School funding is tight. The additional costs should be funded [by the government], otherwise schools will need to make additional cuts.”",education
"Rishi Sunak made quite a splash with the suggestion that musicians should retrain. Did the chancellor really say that? It was a little bit more circuitous, but close enough to justify an outpouring of rage. The rumour is that Sunak will be the leader next time the Conservatives present themselves to the country (having first cycled through Michael Gove, after Boris Johnson decides he has had enough). Sunak and his party should reflect on the fact that his moments of modest popularity are only when he is hosing money at people like a broken cash machine. Musicians, meanwhile, were full of new career ideas: they would retrain as someone with rich parents; they would retrain as large outsourcing companies with no expertise in the arena of public health, and 10m quid would surely follow, which, hey, a few of them could share. On Tuesday, 400 of them made a heartrending point about their predicament by playing Holst’s Mars in Parliament Square. It was peerlessly beautiful. I could have cycled to see it live in 10 minutes, but, instead, I watched it on Twitter, and the realisation that I don’t deserve them made me love musicians even more. Anyway, a large number of people – perhaps they were musicians, or maybe they were benighted employees of the hospitality industry, or they could have been mischief-makers – were driven to the government’s own careers advice service. Oh, my. You thought things were bad when you were a teenager, and the careers adviser told you to become a florist or a vet. You haven’t seen anything. After a number of asinine questions, mainly roundabout ways of asking whether you are an extrovert or an introvert, your answers flash up. I have a ton of options; almost all of them involve a rapid response to something, so I definitely missed or failed honestly to answer the question: “What are you like in a rapid response situation?” I have an anti-evolutionary panic reflex that makes me close my eyes. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve been in A&E, explaining why I didn’t see whichever bone it was getting broken, because I chose that moment to block all light getting in to my face, while screaming: “No!” Training to be a paramedic would probably not be the right career choice for me, and besides, judging by the number of other people to whom it was also suggested, I think it will be somewhat oversubscribed. Apparently, I would also be perfect for the armed forces, though you have to wonder what they would want with a middle-aged pacifist. The only suggestion that wasn’t public sector was “field worker for an aid agency”, and of all the hurdles my mind instantly erected (wait, I can’t go to Haiti: I’m the only person in the house who knows which pants are whose), the most compelling was: who is going to take an aid agent from the UK? We’re hopelessly Covid-infected and on the brink of our own societal breakdown; it would be like importing sparklers to a bush fire. It is only funny when you are not looking for a job. When you are, it is insulting. One minute they are suggesting you retrain for an industry that is itself on its knees (hospitality), the next that you might be able to skill yourself up to be an engineer. The underpinning assumptions are all so wild: that you can live without an income for four years, or have enough savings for a second degree, or you can move a limitless number of miles. But underneath all these suggestions, which are so banal at the level of the individual – ah well, you’re in fashion, nobody’s buying anything; have you thought of retraining as a prison officer? – there is this generalised, catastrophic lack of seriousness. Is that the plan, for all those industries made impossible by the virus, that the people working in them just drift away and take their chances? How does that sit with a V-shaped recovery? How does it sit with an any-letter shaped recovery? Whenever a government tells you to “upskill”, it usually feels like the bit at the end of the evening, when you’ve been made redundant and your friend is trying to cheer you up with suggestions, and they are all stupid because she is drunk, but at least she means well, and you’re getting to talk about yourself. Yet right now, with this hectoring, pompous percussion, one is left with the impression of a government that sees its people as so many meat-units, who can be parcelled from one sector to another, and when that doesn’t work for some glaringly obvious reason that never occurred to ministers, oh well, what’s a free market for, if not to make everyone’s job their own responsibility? They never suggest “become an MP”, you’ll notice. It ought to be because they have concluded it is not a real job, having done it so badly. More likely, it is because they don’t want to go head to head at the next election against a musician; we would vote ourselves an orchestra.",education
"There has been a surge in the number of UK children registering for free school meals, with an estimated 1 million pupils recently signing up for the first time, according to food poverty campaigners. Analysis by the Food Foundation thinktank, released as part of footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to end child food poverty, estimates that as many as 900,000 more children have sought free school meals, on top of the 1.4 million who were already claiming, as the Covid-19 crisis plays havoc with family incomes. Campaigners urged ministers to prevent a growing food insecurity crisis for millions of children by widening eligibility for free lunches to all children up to the age of 16 whose families were claiming universal credit or other benefits. The Manchester United and England footballer Rashford, who was this weekend awarded an MBE for services to vulnerable children, said: “The numbers recorded here just reinforce the need for urgency in stabilising households … we must act now to protect the next generation and the most vulnerable across the UK.” Analysis by LGA Labour reveals that more than 450,000 pupils face spending half-term under increased lockdown restrictions but without free school meals. Most of those children are concentrated in the north of England and the Midlands. “All across the country, millions have lost their jobs or been furloughed, businesses are going under and everyone is finding things hard – eight out of 10 families feel worse off thanks to the pandemic. The economy is in dire straits and new restrictions will make it even harder to make ends meet,” LGA Labour’s deputy leader, councillor Michael Payne said. Rashford urged the government to extend its £15 a week holiday food voucher scheme for children on free school meals over half-term. The period coincides with the end of the existing job retention scheme ends, raising the prospect of a fresh wave of unemployment. In June, Rashford forced a government U-turn on the provision of food vouchers to families on low incomes over the summer holidays after he published an open letter calling on Boris Johnson to reverse plans to drop the scheme, a demand initially rejected by No 10. The Food Foundation analysis showed even where they were eligible for free school meals, many children were missing out on a hot lunch – the key meal of the day for children in poverty. This was because Covid-19 measures meant some school canteens had not yet become fully operational. Of more than 1,000 UK school-age children surveyed by the foundation in September, only 45% said their canteens were running as usual and 8% reported their canteens were closed. One in 10 said most pupils had been asked to bring a packed lunch, while 21% said canteens were only serving a small number of pupils. The deepening impact of the economic crisis was illustrated by a big increase in registrations from families that did not normally claim free school meals, typically where the main earners had been in relatively high-paying administrative and supervisory roles, the foundation added. Several local authorities and schools contacted by the Guardian confirmed there had been an increase in free school meal registrations. Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, the headteacher at Anderton Park primary in Birmingham, said the proportion of her pupils claiming free school lunches had risen from 35% to 47% in September. She said some struggling families were unable to claim free school meals because they were ineligible for social security benefits. Others had suffered big cuts in household income but would still not meet the threshold for school lunch support. “School meals are £45 a month for one child. It’s a lot of money,” she added. Eligibility for free school meals is restricted to children in households where parents claim out of work benefits, including some on universal credit. The latest official figures showed 1.4 million children in England were on free school meals in 2018-19. Blackpool council said there had been a 21% increase in free school meal registrations since March. Suffolk county council has reported a 15% rise over the same period. Hammersmith and Fulham council in London, which has been piloting universal free lunches in two of its secondary schools, also reported an increase. The Department for Education said it was anticipating a rise in free school meal registrations. The next set of official figures is not published until December. A government spokesperson said: “We have taken substantial action to make sure children and their families do not go hungry during this pandemic.” This included extending free school meals support to those eligible when schools were partially closed during lockdown, temporarily increasing universal credit by £20 a week, funding councils to provide emergency food assistance to families, and allocating £63m to councils for families in hardship. Widening access for free school meals was a key recommendation of the government-commissioned National Food Plan published in July. It said 1.5 million more seven to 16-year-olds in England in households claiming universal credit should get free school lunches, at a cost of £670m a year.",education
"University students are being recruited to mark some GCSE and A-level papers this summer, the Guardian has learned. AQA, the UK’s largest provider of academic qualifications, is inviting “postgraduates and undergraduates who have completed their first year of studies” in theology, philosophy and economics to undergo assessments in January and February, as part of a new pilot scheme. “Those who are successful will have the opportunity to join our community of examiners,” the job advertisements state. The students are being recruited “with the view to marking ... exams in the summer of 2021”. Two adverts have appeared on the King’s College London careers and vacancy website, under the headings “GCSE religious studies examiner” and “A-level economics examiner”. One says: “We are seeking theology, religion and philosophy experts to mark our GCSE exams ... If successful, you will be able to mark the Christianity paper from our GCSE [religious studies] specification.” The other advert reveals AQA is looking for “economics experts” to mark “either paper 1 or paper 2” of its A-level economics exam. All of these papers include long-form essay questions. The GCSE Christianity paper can determine half of a candidate’s religious studies GCSE grade while each A-level economics paper is usually worth a third of an A-level. “I would be concerned about the lack of experience of these young people in this marking experiment at any time,” said Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. “But this year, when our students are going to need fairness in their exams more than any other, because of the difficulties of the pandemic, I don’t think this is the right year to carry out this experiment.” He added: “We’re talking about religious studies and economics, where there could be more questions of judgment than on some other papers. It really doesn’t seem sensible.” Helen Webb, AQA’s resourcing and talent manager, said the board was doing a “very small and very controlled pilot as we look to expand our pool of expert examiners in certain subjects”. There are some subjects and topics, she said, where it is “always a challenge to recruit enough good examiners. So we have to be open-minded if we want students to get their results on time and all our marking to be high quality.” She said the pilot would “probably involve around 50 people” out of its 30,000-plus examiners. “They’ll receive training and have to pass two different tests before they’re allowed to do any real marking – and anyone allowed to mark real student answers will be constantly monitored in real time, to make sure they’re doing it well. If not, they’ll be stopped.” It is not yet clear what proportion of AQA’s 10m exam scripts the examiners in the pilot will be asked to mark. An experienced AQA economics examiner, who has been teaching economics A-level for 15 years, told the Guardian that AQA usually started off new economics markers with 100 scripts each. AQA said the focus of its pilot would be on graduates and postgraduates, but it is also “interested in assessing some undergraduates as well to see how they perform”. The exam board has used PhD and PGCE students (postgraduates who are training to be teachers) in the past and claims their marking has been “as good as that of new examiners who are qualified teachers”. Research carried out by AQA and the University of Bristol in 2010 found that overall, undergraduates could mark part-scripts as accurately – but not as consistently – as existing GCSE English examiners, although there were some undergraduates who marked as well as the best examiners. AQA revealed that “for some time now” it has been using newly qualified teachers and PGCE students as markers in some subjects. It also said university students would only be approved to mark the types of questions that they have shown they can mark well. “While the vast majority of our examiners will always be experienced teachers, that doesn’t mean that no one else can ever be suitable for the job,” said Webb. “For some types of questions in some qualifications, being good at following a mark scheme – combined with some knowledge of the subject – is enough.” Ben Wood, chair of the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE), said he thought pupils sitting the AQA religious studies GCSE in the summer may feel “concerned” and “worried” about the idea of an undergraduate marking their Christianity papers. “You do need to know what you’re talking about to mark this. You need to know some of the intricacies of Christian theology, particularly.” He teaches the course himself and said experienced teachers who mark the paper understand how the course fits together, and how GCSE students might pull information from one area of the syllabus and use it appropriately in another area. “Being a humanity subject, it’s also not as simple as providing mark schemes and checking exam scripts against that,” he said.  Wood said the current cohort of GCSE and A-level state school students had been enormously disadvantaged by the pandemic and some had missed a huge amount of teaching time. “The thought of them potentially having somebody marking their paper who’s not well qualified to do that – it feels to me like we’re adding potentially more disadvantage on to more disadvantage. And they deserve better.” An economics A-level teacher who works as a “team lead” examiner for AQA and wished to remain anonymous, said he was worried it might be possible for wrongly marked scripts to slip through AQA’s “strict” quality control system: “There are checks in place and they are good – but you don’t check every single bit of marking.” An AQA spokesperson said this marker did not have knowledge of the pilot’s tests or monitoring processes and was jumping to the wrong conclusions. Joe Kinnaird, a religious studies GCSE teacher and AQA examiner, said even if university students passed all of AQA’s standardisation and quality control tests, he does not think they will be capable of marking exams well. “Ultimately, I think you have to be a classroom teacher. It actually undermines the teaching profession to assume that people who are not qualified teachers are able to mark exam papers.” Sarah Hannafin, a policy adviser at the National Association of Head Teachers, said when young people took an exam, their expectation was that markers were “experienced, serious teachers”.  With confidence already “quite rocky”, due to what happened with the exams last summer, she thinks it is vital young people and their parents feel they can rely on the exam-marking process. “I’d go so far as to say I think it would be a mistake for them [AQA] to go ahead with it.” Ofqual, the exams regulator, said exam boards must ensure markers were competent. “What matters most is that markers are conscientious and follow the exam board’s mark schemes,” a spokesperson said. “Students can ask for the marking of their paper to be reviewed if they believe an error has been made.” In response to the criticisms, a spokesperson for AQA said the pilot would in no way disadvantage this year’s students or affect the accuracy of their results.",education
"Headteachers are calling for the government to allow secondary schools to move all teaching online for pupils undergoing mass coronavirus testing in London, Kent and Essex. The National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) and the Association of College Leaders have written a joint letter to education minister Gavin Williamson, urging him to shut the doors of secondary schools and colleges whose pupils are being tested this week and to roll out the mass testing of students to other high infection areas in England. The unions say the move would reduce the danger of infection transmission by these pupils in classrooms and on public transport, while avoiding a logistical nightmare for teachers and further disruption to children’s education. “We can’t simply ask already overburdened school staff to administer these tests, because it will just stop the education effort in schools,” said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman. The Observer also understands that the government is considering mass testing of primary school children. The Department for Education said it would not be commenting on this matter: “It hasn’t been confirmed and therefore is speculation.” Last week, the government began using its emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act to threaten legal action against headteachers in England who wanted to switch to remote learning this week. Any schools that were planning to move most of their teaching online during the last week of term, to ensure none of their pupils would have to self-isolate on Christmas Day, are being ordered to remain open. One headteacher in Hertfordshire was sent an official letter from the schools minister, Nick Gibb, warning him that the government was prepared to deploy its new powers under the act to ensure his secondary school remained open for all pupils until Friday. The school, Presdales in Ware, was planning to teach the majority of its pupils remotely for the last week of term, while continuing to provide socially distanced, face-to-face lessons for vulnerable pupils and any other students who wished to come into school. Only about 25 pupils were expected to come in, so they could all sit two metres apart in class. “We’ve had nearly 50 [positive] cases since September and a significant outbreak in one year group,” said the headteacher, Matthew Warren. “There is no chance, in the last week of term, that we’re not going to have any cases.” On Tuesday last week, 170 staff and children – including half the English department – were off school, self isolating. Warren said teachers are now “dreading” having to call parents, particularly of younger pupils, to tell them their child would have to avoid all contact with anybody else on Christmas Day. Warren had been keen to ensure his pupils did not have to endure this separation during the festive season. “For mental health, hearts and minds, we felt it wasn’t fair – and parents supported us overwhelmingly.” Last Wednesday, the day before the school planned to close, Gibb wrote a letter to Warren, stating he was “minded to direct” the board of trustees to keep the school gates open and had the power to do this under schedule 17 of the Coronavirus Act. Refusal to comply would have allowed the Department for Education to first direct the board of trustees and then seek an injunction requiring the school to provide face-to-face lessons, according to Warren’s legal advice. “We can’t defend that – it’s not a good use of public funds, which we’re desperate for,” he said. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full time and it was vital children remained in school until the end of term.",education
"As the Christmas holidays approach, many schools are grappling with low attendance rates and staff shortages as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

"Mass Covid-19 testing should be implemented in schools across England, teachers’ leaders have said, amid fury in the north at the speed at which testing has been rolled out in new hotspots in London and the south-east. Testing should also be extended to primaries, according to the largest education union, which along with others is calling for the closure of schools and a switch to remote learning before the Christmas break. “We predict that when this testing happens many children will have to be sent home on public health advice. This will lead in practice to a chaotic closure in the last week of term,” said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union. He said new Office for National Statistics figures showing coronavirus cases were rising again in secondary and primary schools “should be very worrying to the government – especially in the run-up to Christmas”. Secondary school children in years 7 to 11 have the highest rate of any of the demographic groups, with more than 2% having the virus. Questions are also being asked about the selection criteria for hotspots where mobile testing is being carried out in secondary schools and among college students in parts of north-east London, Essex and Kent after a list of the areas was published on Friday by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Schools hardest hit by infections included the Norton Knatchbull School in Ashford, where all its pupils began studying at home from Friday until the end of term on 18 December because of absences among staff. Only the children of key workers and vulnerable children were to come in. Eight out of nine secondary schools in Basildon were also expected to close on Friday night, a week earlier than due, Essex county council’s cabinet member for health told the BBC. But some boroughs with higher numbers of cases are not listed in the rollout and there was particular anger in the north of England, which has been left to cope without similar mass testing despite rates that got so high that as many as a quarter of all children in Hull were off school last month. The Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Jonathan Reynolds, said schools in his area were “livid” and he expected a bid for testing to be successful. Kate Hollern, the Labour MP for Blackburn, said it was “utter rubbish” for the government to suggest that testing was available to schools outside London and the south-west. In response to the DHSC claim that tier 3 local authorities can apply for tests, Hollern tweeted: Jo Platt, the former MP for Leigh in Greater Manchester, also in tier 3 tweeted: Henri Murison, the director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank, said “northern schools have faced the brunt of Covid-19 infections in recent months” but noted only Liverpool has benefited from an extensive programme of mass testing for secondary schools. He expected mass testing to be offered in the north in areas of high infection. Asked by the Guardian why schools in the north of England were not offered mass testing last month, the DHSC appeared to confirm that while schools in London – currently in tier 2 – and the south-east were being offered tests automatically, tier 3 schools in the north and elsewhere had to apply. A spokesperson said: “The evidence shows us there is a clear rise in cases in secondary school age children in these areas and we must act to target these rates – about one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and will be spreading it without realising it.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), also questioned why the government had not chosen to end in-person teaching on the last week of term. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said on Friday the plans to mass test secondary school and college students had the objective of keeping them in education and ensuring schools were safe. “As a government we are doing everything we can first of all to prioritise kids remaining in schools, and the vast majority of children remain in schools,” he told BBC Breakfast. In Wales, secondary schools and colleges will move to online learning from Monday following advice from the Welsh chief medical officer that the public health situation in the country was “deteriorating”.",education
"The disruption caused by the coronavirus allows for a “radical” rethink of England’s school system, according to a group of Conservative MPs who advocate scrapping GCSEs, delaying the start of formal education and introducing longer school days. A paper from the One Nation caucus of centrist Conservative MPs is the latest assault on GCSEs, arguing that England is unusual in making teenagers sit two sets of high-stakes exams within the space of three years, and that this is partly responsible for high levels of stress and unhappiness among pupils. Flick Drummond, the MP for Meon Valley and one of the authors of the report, said: “It seemed to us that the Covid outbreak was a good opportunity to take another look at the education system and see what we could do differently, and do something radical.” Drummond said that sitting GCSEs at the age of 16 no longer made sense. “Now that children stay at school until the age of 18, why on earth should they take these exams at 16?” The paper argues that preparation for GCSE exams means that pupils miss a large chunk of valuable learning because of the time taken up with mock exams and revision, followed by the exams themselves. “That’s almost six months out of a whole year spent preparing for exams,” said Drummond. She said she was particularly concerned by the impact of exams on mental health, citing a report backed by the Children’s Society in August that ranked England 36th out of 45 countries in Europe and North America for wellbeing. Instead, the new report says, the exams should be replaced by a baccalaureate, which would cover several years’ study and would allow children more time from the age of 15 to settle on the subjects they wanted to study in the sixth form for A-levels or vocational qualifications such as T-levels and apprenticeships, and to explore potential careers in a structured way. GCSEs have also come under attack from a coalition of state and independent school leaders, who are launching a group called Rethinking Assessments to campaign for alternatives. The One Nation group is said to be supported by about 100 Conservative MPs, more than a third of the parliamentary party, and is chaired by the former Cabinet Office minister Damien Green. Drummond said she wanted to bring the issues in the paper to the attention of her colleagues in government. “I’m hoping that it will be taken seriously and discussed. Particularly in the light of Covid, we’ve got an opportunity to look at other countries and ask if what we are doing is working for us and for young people.” Drummond also says that the school timetable should be revisited to bring it into line with modern life, including a change to the way holidays are distributed, and lengthening the school day to 5pm to allow children to do more extracurricular activities or receive further support. “It could mean that disadvantaged children could get more of the same enrichment opportunities as those from better-off homes. Often now schools finish at 3pm or 3.30pm and then what can they do?” Drummond said. The report’s other recommendations include a delay in the age for compulsory schooling, to age six, which is more in line with other European countries. In the paper’s section on early years education, Cherilyn Mackrory, the MP for Truro and Falmouth, says there should be targeted help for families with young children. The paper also says that because many children are not “school-ready” at age four, when reception classes open, delaying the start of formal schooling would be appropriate.",education
"Parents are suffering “sleepless nights” trying to choose secondary schools for their children without setting foot in buildings or meeting teachers face to face. Following new government guidance that now recommends schools consider alternatives to face-to-face open events, many schools are only offering online talks and virtual school tours to parents, who must get their school place applications in by the end of this month. In a bid to woo parents and simultaneously outshine other local schools, some state schools have spent more than £5,000 on professionally made promotional videos this term. These often include drone footage of their grounds and story-boarded, scripted interactions between pupils. Others, with smaller budgets, are relying on films made by students and a pre-recorded presentation from the headteacher. But some heads are still allowing parents to tour the school building – usually when it is empty – in small, socially distanced groups, gaining an edge over the local competition. The new government guidance, issued to the National Association of Head Teachers after heads begged for clarity, does allow this, subject to “risk assessments” and “control measures” being put in place. “Schools are not on an even playing field any more – they’re all doing something different,” said Rachael Dines, whose 11-year-old son Kaden will start secondary school next year. He is trying to decide between four state schools near their home town of Worthing, West Sussex. So far they have only been allowed to visit one school in person, on a 45-minute “express”, masked tour. “We were in very small groups of six and there were no students present.” She struggles to compare this experience with the online tours and promotional videos put forward by other schools on her shortlist. “Videos can be edited: if there was something they didn’t want to show us, they wouldn’t put that in the video.” Ideally, she wants her son, who loves art, to be able to see the artwork produced by students at each school and imagine himself as a new starter inside the school building. Having been on one tour, she says, “I think all schools could have managed a tour of some kind, with careful restrictions in place.”  In Bexley, south-east London, Michelle Jackson is having sleepless nights trying to weigh up the pros and cons of nine state secondary schools for her 10-year-old daughter Annalie solely using online films and web talks. “Schools are doing their best – and it’s a really difficult time for them,” she says. “But as lovely as the videos are, it’s not the same as walking around a school. You can’t get a feel for it. You can’t get a sense of what the children and the building are like.” While some videos are “snazzy”, “professional” and have “very nicely edited footage”, others look as if they were shot on a mobile phone. “I’m more interested in what they’re saying. But if it does look more polished, I suppose it does give a better impression of the school.” At MCN Productions, which makes promotional videos for state schools, “demand has gone through the roof” since the end of last term. “We must have done 15 schools since then,” said director Mike Carter, adding that schools typically spend up to £5,000 or “even more” to get a high-quality “open day” video. “Schools [are] quite prepared to spend that amount if they feel they’re getting what they need.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Schools should consider how best to run events, such as parents’ evenings and open days, based on their own risk assessment and the system of controls they have in place. Schools have the flexibility to offer alternative options to face-to-face meetings, such as virtual events.”",education
"The Department for Education broke the law in its mishandling of the national database containing details of every school pupil in England, the Information Commissioner’s Office has concluded in a highly critical report. The report marks the second time in less than a year that the DfE has been publicly rebuked by the privacy watchdog for failing to adhere to data protection laws. After an investigation triggered by complaints from groups including Liberty, the ICO found that the DfE had failed to comply with sections of the general data protection regulation (GDPR). It said there was “no clear picture of what data is held by the DfE” and that its handling of millions of pupil records “could result in multiple data breaches”. “The audit found that data protection was not being prioritised and this had severely impacted the DfE’s ability to comply with the UK’s data protection laws,” the ICO said. The audit lists more than 130 recommendations for the DfE to improve its data safeguarding, with 32 classed as urgent and 57 as high priority by the watchdog. Sam Grant, the policy and campaigns manager of Liberty, said: “This report displays a shocking failure of privacy protections, which is dangerous for our rights. “The type of data collected by the DfE can reveal a huge amount of sensitive personal information about us, and often about children and young people. The government has routinely misused this data to enforce cruel and oppressive policies like the hostile environment. This cavalier attitude to our personal information puts people, including the most marginalised, at risk.” According to the ICO, the DfE had “no formal proactive oversight of any function of information governance, including data protection, records management, risk management, data sharing and information security” at the time of the audit in February. Access to the national pupil database (NPD) has become highly controversial after it was revealed that in 2015 the department agreed to share details with the Home Office to “create a hostile environment for those who seek to benefit from the abuse of immigration control”. In November 2019 the ICO also criticised the DfE for sharing children’s personal data with the Home Office and for failing to properly comply with data protection laws. In its latest report the ICO found that only 12 out of 400 applications for access to the NPD had been turned down, “due to an approach which is designed to find a legal gateway to ‘fit’ the application rather than an assessment of the application against a set of robust measures”, it stated. The report also criticises the DfE for blurred lines of responsibility and poor internal decisionmaking, noting that there was “some confusion” over roles within the DfE and its agencies. In response, the DfE said it accepted the ICO’s recommendations in full. “Since the ICO completed its audit, we’ve taken a number of steps to address the findings and recommendations, including a review of all processes for the use of personal data and significantly increasing the number of staff dedicated to the effective management of it,” a DfE spokesperson said. “As well as welcoming these moves, the ICO has recognised the stringent processes we have in place to make sure children and young people’s personal data is secure.” The ICO noted that the DfE “showed a willingness to learn from and address the issues identified”. But it warned that it would take further action if the DfE failed to make changes.",education

"Oxford University student Ellie Cassidy will never forget how unprepared and ill at ease she felt before her interview to study geography at Oxford two years ago. “I was terrified. I remember walking in, my heart racing, thinking in my head: turn it off, turn it off. I thought that I had to turn off my scouse accent, or they wouldn’t be able to understand me.” She was conscious that no one from her Liverpool state school had managed to get into Oxbridge for years. “My school really wanted to help me. They tried their best, but they had no clue about how I should write my personal statement or how the interview worked.” As a result, she was left to face the intimidating selection process alone, struggling with impostor syndrome. “There was nothing out there that supported me. I couldn’t find any information about the sort of questions I’d be asked or the structure of the interview, or even help around the personal statement.” Now, Cassidy is on a mission to demystify the Oxbridge application process for other students who, like her, have little or no support from their state schools. Like more than 2,000 other Oxford and Cambridge undergraduates, she is freely sharing her “insider” knowledge about how to get into Oxbridge online, via a new student-led project called InsideUni. “There’s so much mythology that surrounds the interview process. Unless you’ve someone on the inside tell you what it’s really like, you’ve got all these ideas that are very off-putting and can make you very nervous,” says the project’s founder Tommy Gale, who recently graduated from Cambridge. He started InsideUni two years ago after realising many of the private school students he met at Cambridge were “not even that clever”, but had received help with the application process from teachers, family contacts and peers. Meanwhile, more capable state school students he knew either failed to get in or were put off applying. “When I saw the massively different levels of preparation people had, it just felt really unfair.” With help from nearly 2,000 Oxbridge student contributors, InsideUni has created free, detailed online guides offering insider tips about each Oxbridge course and how to successfully apply. It also hosts Q&A virtual events which shed light on life at Oxbridge and the application process, with applicants who have a disability, or are from a BAME or low-income background, offered extra support. Most importantly, the website has published students’ real-life accounts of their admissions interviews at the different colleges and for each subject. This includes not only the kinds of questions they were asked by interviewers and the students’ good and bad responses, but also how they prepared and what they wish they had known beforehand. All the content published meets editorial guidelines developed with Oxbridge admissions tutors. Along with students who went to state schools, many former private school pupils have contributed to the project, Gale says. “It’s nice because we want to know what they’re being told – and they are sharing their knowledge with people who can’t afford to pay for it.” He and Cassidy think the need for digital outreach programmes like Inside Uni has grown during the pandemic, as the advantages of attending a private school became more stark, with pupils benefiting from more online schooling compared to their peers at state schools. Their views are shared by the founder of another free, student-led access programme, Team Upside, which also moved online during the pandemic. Sulaiman Iqbal, a Cambridge University student who grew up on a west London council estate, set up Team Upside just over a year ago to help get people from disadvantaged backgrounds into Oxbridge and other Russell Group universities. “Growing up, I saw so many young people with enormous amounts of potential and talent – but a lot of them were unable to realise that, because they lacked opportunities and guidance.” Currently, any young person who contacts the organisation’s helpdesk with an education or career-related question will receive free, one-to-one advice from members of the team, who are all from BAME backgrounds and attend top Russell Group universities. They also receive a weekly newsletter with useful educational resources and a video interview series that reveals how students from BAME or disadvantaged backgrounds at top universities wrote their personal statements. “We want to provide nuance to what an Oxbridge student looks like, and where they come from. I think honest, transparent representation is key to demystifying people’s perceptions of Oxbridge and other spaces that are quite privileged and seem somewhat exclusive to a lot of people,” Iqbal says. With the help of Int2_Law, a social initiative run by law students at Cambridge and the London School of Economics, Team Upside is running an Oxbridge mock interview day later this month for state school pupils with interviews coming up.  Like Gale and Cassidy, Iqbal does not think there is anything inherently wrong with the Oxbridge admissions process, including the interview. “Although it can be nerve-racking and involve a lot of stress, the benefit of the interview is that it provides the university with the opportunity to have a conversation with the candidate and contextualise their grades. It’s important for fellows to realise when a student has to overcome a lot of challenges and barriers to get where they are today,.” However, he thinks Oxbridge should offer its own mock interviews to state students, particularly from less privileged backgrounds, rather than relying on organisations like Team Upside. “We think it’s unfair that some students who go to really top schools are provided with so much more support and guidance than other students, when every student deserves an equal opportunity to succeed. It’s really just about levelling the playing field.” UniRiseOffers a free online course on how to write the “perfect” personal statement, based on advice from 20 Russell Group admissions stutors.

"Concerns have been raised about government plans for mass Covid-19 testing of students before Christmas, with agreement yet to be reached with universities and one warning it would be impossible to test every student. With the clock ticking down to a designated six-day “travel window” which students will be asked to use, ongoing talks between civil servants and vice-chancellors are trying to hammer out issues such as whether independent testing already in place at universities can be aligned with the plan. The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, also sought to downplay concerns raised by experts about the reliability of the plan’s self-administered lateral flow tests (LFT), and the short period of time in which testing will take place. Her department is still unable to provide the number of tests that will be available but said it is expected that they will be available for those who want one. Details also emerged of how Wales and Scotland might fit into plans announced in London on Tuesday by the Department for Education for a mass exodus to take place, on staggered departure dates set by universities, from 3 December to 9 December after England’s four-week lockdown. The Scottish government’s higher education minister, Richard Lochhead, told the Holyrood parliament on Wednesday that students would be offered two rapid tests, five days apart, with those testing negative on both occasions able to travel home. Those who test positive will have a more sensitive ‘PCR’ test, used in the main coronavirus testing programme, to confirm the result. Student infection rates were declining, said Lochhead, and in the last week students contributed to only 2% of the national total. The Welsh education minister emphasised that university students would not be forced to take new rapid coronavirus tests before returning home for Christmas but would be offered the chance to “make a positive choice” in taking up the offer of a test 24 hours before they plan to leave towns and cities. Swansea University, which will end in-person teaching on 4 December, said it hoped to take part and had been told tests would be ready to use as early as 30 November. But Andrew Rhodes, chief operating officer, warned it would be “impossible” to test every student. He said students would have to be tested twice with a three-day gap between the first and second test and “in practice, it would be impossible to test all students before they travel home given the very tight timescales”. Among others seeking clarity from the government were the National Union of Students, which sought assurances on support for students remaining on campus, and Unison, which called for details of how staff would be trained to carry out the tests. “The whole testing process must be risk-assessed and properly supervised if it’s to be effective,” said Unison senior national education officer, Ruth Levin. “Many students will need repeat testing if their results are inconclusive. Sufficient funding must be in place for universities so this programme can be carried out safely.” Caution was also advised by experts about the potential reach of LFTs. The self-administered tests, which can deliver a result in as little as 30 minutes, are rapid but do not necessarily detect as many infected people as the PCR testing used at NHS sites, warned Dr Ellen Brooks Pollock, a lecturer in infectious disease modelling at the University of Bristol, who has led research into Covid-19 among students. “We saw high rates of infection in university students at the beginning of term and that number has fallen but we can’t really disentangle testing behaviour with true infection rate,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It’s because the majority of students don’t have the typical Covid symptoms so there could potentially be high rates of undisclosed infections, which obviously poses a risk to their parents and grandparents but also to seeding infections in new areas.” Prof Jacqui Ramagge, an executive dean for science at Durham University who has been overseeing a pilot project there for rapid Covid-19 testing, added that the danger of failing to pick up students who could become infectious later could be mitigated by taking a number of tests over a few days. However, Donelan said the lateral flow rapid test was “highly reliable”.  The plan envisages a week of testing between 30 November and 6 December, ending a few days after the lockdown in England is due to finish. Donelan confirmed that students would be going back to campus after Christmas. Talks around each part of the UK are continuing between government officials and universities, which have been seeking assurances on funding and protections from being sued before committing to the plans. Donelan added: “Our target will be for those universities that have had higher infection rates or areas that have higher R rates, also areas that have higher percentages of more vulnerable [people] such as BAME, but fundamental to this plan is that the four weeks of national restrictions mean that the risk these students pose is now much reduced, so that unlocks the opportunity to then go home and feel a lot safer in doing so.”",education
"For Jen Smith, the autumn term started, as always, with the prospect of managing the delicate process of her children’s school attendance. Both autistic, they were in mainstream classes until two years ago; now in specialist provision, they still faced deep-seated anxiety about school. “My son’s anxiety began when he needed a disabled toilet key at school, but in the time it took to get one he felt he couldn’t go to the toilet and that is when the anxiety started building,” she says. There were screaming and meltdowns on the way to school, she says, then more on the way home after he felt ashamed that he had been unable go in. “I was trying every which way to help, then realised I had to stop coercing because it was damaging him,” she says. “But you are left in an empty place. I felt I could drop dead of stress at one point just because I couldn’t resolve the situation.” Smith is one of thousands of parents of “school refusers”, children with mental health barriers about attending school. Their difficulties are compounded by Ofsted rules requiring schools to meet certain attendance levels to be rated “good” or “outstanding”, with parents threatened with fines and prosecutions if their children don’t attend. The most recent government figures suggest that there are about 770,000 persistent absentees in England. In 2018-19, 60,000 of these young people were missing more than half their schooling, up from 39,000 three years earlier. Typically, this type of anxiety starts around transition to secondary school, but for some children it is in primary school. One parent, Anna Allen, from Essex, said her 10-year-old son’s problems began when he was moved into a different class from his friends, and he started talking about the pressure of schoolwork and not feeling safe in class. With the school, she is now helping him manage a more flexible day, with the option to stay at home if his anxiety is too great. “When his anxiety is really bad, he will wake up in the morning, go into a panic attack and start retching and hyperventilating. Since we have changed our approach, allowing him to not even think about going into school when he feels like that, things have improved,” she says. “But it teeters on a knife-edge. It only needs one adult to make him feel pressured and it will tip back other way. Initially, the school deflected responsibility and implied poor parenting, but they are now listening and understand this anxiety is real.”  Allen is taking a year’s leave from her job as a speech and language therapist to support her son’s education at home if necessary, but says loss of learning takes second place to his wellbeing. “He will not learn unless his mind is happy and relaxed. I am speaking out because I want to represent more than our family, and to make the education system more understanding rather than a machine that treats children as numbers instead of human beings.” Smith and Allen are involved with two lobbying and support groups, Square Peg, which advocates for children who don’t fit in to the conventional schooling model, and Not Fine in School, which has a closed Facebook group of 13,000 parents. Campaigners believe their numbers are growing because of increased pressure on school performance and cuts to support services. Ellie Costello is one of those finding it difficult to access these services for her child. “My son’s reports always said he was a good, polite boy. He was compliant in school and struggling with underlying undiagnosed chronic illness,” she says. “In the end, because he was challenged and pushed so much to attend, his mental health crashed. “If he were an adult, it would be categorised as a nervous breakdown. The pressure on all of us has been unbelievable. Between concern for my son’s wellbeing, the pressure on our marriage, the school sending threatening letters and apologising for doing it, I would go home and fall on my knees through the stress and the shame I was failing him as a parent. “We were clinging on the cliff edge for so long. At the point I let go and said I won’t force him into school, the systems finally got going and we started to access some help. When your child is in a state of emotional collapse, is so traumatised due to their needs being unrecognised, you are so far away from that child being able to learn, nothing else matters. You don’t give an iota about missing learning.” And the Covid pandemic may have raised the stakes even further. Since most schools reopened fully in September, attendance has become a proxy for the success of what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, calls the nation’s moral duty to get children back into the classroom, with government guidance urging prosecution of parents whose children don’t attend. A new report from Ofsted last week showed that, in half the schools inspectors visited, some children had been removed altogether because of fears about the virus. Not Fine in School has had nearly 1,000 new members join since the start of term, 687 in September alone. The campaigners believe that urging the prosecution of parents whose children are persistently absent could be counterproductive. They say the first lockdown provided respite for children such as theirs, giving them the opportunity to work from home without fear of their parents being prosecuted. Polly Sweeney, who has been working with parents on a legal challenge to the existing categorisation of absent children, said: “At the moment our attendance code is either authorised or unauthorised. If unauthorised, my experience is that parents are punished with no proper analysis of the underlying reasons, and children may spend significant periods out of school without alternative education provision being arranged.” One possible solution, she says, could be a special attendance code, which would bring support rather than punishment, for children with recognised mental or emotional barriers to school attendance. “It is a concern that parents may be off-rolling children right now because they don’t want to face punishments, but are not receiving the support needed. That is a very vulnerable group of children. Home schooling works well for many children, but there may be other families who need the ongoing support of statutory services. Covid is really shining a light on these issues and offering an opportunity to question whether the system is working.” Friday, 20 November, is Unicef World Children’s Day, and Square Peg will be launching a new collaboration with School Differently, another campaigning organisation. According to Fran Morgan, founder of Square Peg, one objective will be to find examples of good practice that may help school leaders manage attendance policy more compassionately. But might recent Covid-related advances in digital education point to a new way forward? Ofsted noted last week that Covid absences were obliging schools to continue developing remote learning. Karine George is a former headteacher, supporter of Square Peg, and consultant at Educate, based at University College London, which is looking at new ways of using technology in schools. She says: “Headteachers are under huge pressure from competing demands. Time needed to build relationships with parents and children has been eroded. Even if you know there is a problem and a child can’t come into school, you have your attendance target to meet. “Covid has taught us that education can happen in a multitude of ways. For some people, going to school is really useful. But others can learn better without the school environment. We should not waste this crisis, but instead think more about all the educational mechanisms through which we can meet all children’s needs for their learning and their socialising.”",education
"The Guardian spoke to four university students about the impact the pandemic has had on their mental health. Bella Brown, 20, a first year history of art student at UCL, has struggled with mental health problems including anxiety and depression for many years, but said the pandemic had exacerbated these. “When I moved to London, it was really hard to meet new people,” she said. “My housemates have been going into university three days a week, but I only have an hour-and-a-half in person, so I was just so lonely.” This was made worse when she was forced to self-isolate after testing positive for coronavirus last week. However, after reaching out to university support services, she is now due to begin wellbeing workshops. Brown said she found the shift to remote learning “overwhelming”. “I enrolled late, and got missed off the Microsoft Teams group for one of my classes,” she said. “When I asked about it, my department told me I’d missed eight weeks of classes and threatened to make me drop the module, but it was totally a miscommunication.” Nirmal Sunny, 20, an international student from India, is in his second year of a computer science degree at the University of Bedfordshire and feeling stressed after he was erroneously sanctioned for not paying his fees, a month before they were due. “The sanction came out of the blue, but at the time one of my units disappeared. I have lost access to classes and lectures and am supposed to submit an assignment in two days. I can no longer access the online portal. I’ve been emailing everyone I know at the university for two weeks, but nobody is responding – I just get out of office emails.” Sunny fears that he will have to repeat the year. He was going to see his family in southern India in August, but called the trip off because of the pandemic and will spend the Christmas holiday in his flat. “I don’t know who to contact. All my friends are taking different units this year, and I haven’t been on campus in eight months or so. If people are ill with coronavirus and on leave, surely somebody needs to cover for them? I’m confused and worried. I feel the university is being very irresponsible. I’m going to pay my fees, but I don’t feel valued here.” Regan, a 22-year-old student at a university in the Midlands, said she had found it difficult to cope with stress and anxiety during the pandemic. “Having no social interaction because of lockdown has made me more scared to go out and has worsened my anxiety,” she said. “I had become a more confident person at uni, but this year I’ve gone straight back to how I was before.” Regan also said that while many of her teachers had been “lovely”, others didn’t seem to understand the strain on students’ mental health. “I think sometimes they forget we’re human and also struggling,” she said. When she tried to access university counselling services online, the slots were booked up until October 2021. After sending a series of emails, she managed to get an appointment, but worries others wouldn’t be so proactive and would lose out. “The workload is extremely stressful, and moving to a new place is intimidating,” she said. “To have university all online makes it even harder.” Lakshya Jain, 21, is a final year maths student at the University of Edinburgh and concerned that she might infect family when she returns home. “I was tested on 7 December and it came back negative, but I still may get Covid in the next 14 days before I go home, where I live with my 76-year-old grandma and my dad who has been shielding since March. There is no point in the university offering a test so far away from people’s departure date. I don’t know anybody leaving before 18 December – a lot can change in two weeks.” Jain is also worried about the reliability of the tests. “These are lateral flow rapid tests where you get the results in 30 mins, and the university has said that anyone who tests positive needs to go get a proper test in an NHS test centre, so you wonder whether these are any good.” Despite her concerns, she feels she has no other option but to take the risk of travelling home. “For my mental health and wellbeing I think staying in Edinburgh is not a good idea either. I love my university, but they underestimated how isolated students would be. I just need a break from Edinburgh and from being an adult.”",education
"Some teachers are being told to disable the government’s Covid test-and-trace system while in school and to disregard notifications in order to reduce the number of staff required to self-isolate, a union has claimed. The NASUWT said it had received numerous reports from concerned teachers across England, including one case where the instruction was based on advice provided by the local public health team. There continues to be widespread disruption in classrooms, with staff shortages forcing some schools forced to close as pupils and teachers test positive for Covid and many others have to self-isolate after coming into contact with them. The NASUWT’s general secretary, Dr Patrick Roach, has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, expressing his concern about any instructions to teachers to pause the app, warning that it could lead to increased transmission of the virus. He has called on the government to issue immediate clarification to all schools and public health teams. Under current government guidance, staff are told they can pause the app when their phone is in a locker, when they are fully protected behind Perspex or are wearing medical-grade PPE. The NASUWT claims heads are asking staff to disable the app the whole time they are in school. One email from a public health official at Wirral council said: “Given that we now have a well-established local system for contact-tracing of school-notified cases, we are recommending that you advise any staff/pupils that have downloaded the NHS Covid-19 app to pause the contact-tracing function of that app while they are on the school premises.” It has previously been reported that teachers in Aberdeen were told to switch off the contact-tracing function while in schools. A letter seen by BBC Scotland asked staff to switch off the software, saying the app did not take into account mitigations that were in place. Roach said: “The government rightly states that the NHS test-and-trace app is a key part of the UK’s Covid-19 response. Instructions for the use of the app clearly state it should switched on at all times in schools unless the phone is in a locker. “It beggars belief that some schools are disregarding such clear instructions and it is deeply worrying that local public health teams appear to be giving similar advice. Even more concerning is that some teachers are being told to disregard app notifications to self-isolate, apparently in order to reduce the numbers of staff and pupils self-isolating. “Schools and authorities overriding advice are putting at risk the safety and the lives of teachers and pupils and risking much larger outbreaks. Ministers must act swiftly and with clarity to ensure that schools are following the correct guidance at all times and teachers have the app switched on in schools.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment. A Wirral council spokesperson said: “The advice given was based on a well-established national approach to minimising the potential for false notifications of close contact with a case. Wirral schools have a very effective local process for contact-tracing when cases are notified on their premises and the advice issued to headteachers clearly states that the contact-tracing toggle on the app should be turned back on as soon as they leave the school setting.” Meanwhile, local authorities are concerned that the pandemic is fuelling a rise in the number of parents choosing to take their child out of school to home-educate. According to the Local Government Association (LGA), there have been increases of up to 200% in the number of home-education registrations in some areas this term, compared with last year. The increase is thought to be linked to health fears and increasing numbers of pupils having to stay out of school and self-isolate. The LGA has called on the government to introduce its proposed new duty on councils to maintain a register of children not in school, and a new duty on parents to provide information if their child is not attending a mainstream school. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The NHS Covid-19 app is a key tool in our pandemic response, working to break the chain of transmission as quickly as possible to stop the spread of the virus and protect our loved ones. It’s crucial that people self-isolate when instructed to do so by the app.   “The more people who download it, the better it works and we encourage people to keep the contact tracing functionality switched on for as much of the time as possible.”",education
"When Shabaaz arrived in the UK from Afghanistan he was 13; a child in a strange country. “I was alone and I had no one to help me,” he says. Despite that, he had high hopes: he dreamed of going to university to study business. But there was a problem: social workers who assessed Shabaaz – not his real name – decided he was 16. And that, they said, meant he was too old to go to school and to study for GCSEs. “I was asking them to put me in a college or something like that, but they were saying they needed to sort out my age first,” he says. “They didn’t give me any education.” Five years on, the local authority has accepted he was much younger than it thought, and has granted him financial support as a care-leaver. He has had some tuition at college, but at 19 is too old to go to school, making university a distant dream. He takes part in sport – he enjoys boxing – but he needs to improve his maths and English, and his options are limited. “I talked to my tutor. He said, you have to have GCSEs and you are already 19, so who’s going to pay for you?’ I’m really stuck now,” he says. Charities and lawyers say the situation is not uncommon. Government guidance published last year says young people should be treated as the age they claim they are until any age assessment is completed. Despite that, observers say, too many still miss out on school, college and university. Young people in England must legally be in education or training until they are 18, and asylum seekers under 18 are cared for by local authorities as looked-after children. Those thought to be over 16 usually go to college, rather than school, and the courses on offer are often based around language learning followed by vocational courses, rather than on a broader curriculum. Shabaaz is now watching his contemporaries moving on: “There was a guy who was with me, he’s now in university. He was my best friend, he’s my age. I’m thinking that if I’d been there in school with him, I would be in university now too.” The problem affects older arrivals as well. The new Home Office guidance says those who say they are under 18 should be treated as children unless there is compelling documentary evidence to the contrary, or their physical appearance and demeanour strongly suggest they are over 25. But in some cases, the judgments made are wildly different from what young people are saying. When Bwar – also not his real name – arrived from Iran 18 months ago, he did not know anything about the UK: “I didn’t know even the name of the country that I was in,” he says. He was taken to a police station, where he was asked a lot of questions – including his age. Bwar, who is Kurdish, said he was 17. Initially he was placed in foster care and in a language course at college. But then he was told he had to face a three-day age assessment in which he answered questions about every aspect of his life, his culture, his family. The outcome was a shock. “On the last day they said: ‘This is the result: you are 28.’ I didn’t know what to say. I laughed. I said, ‘Really? I am 28? This is a joke, isn’t it?’ They weren’t laughing.” The assessment in effect put an end to Bwar’s education. “My social worker went to see the head of my college, and they agreed that I was not good to be in the same class. I had to be moved to an adult class.” Because Bwar would not accept a move into adult education classes, he stopped attending. “I still have so many friends in that class, and they still ask me why I stopped going.” In Iran, Bwar had attended school until age nine, but was discriminated against because he was Kurdish. He still had high hopes for the future, though: his sister, who still lives in Iran, is an engineer. “In my city so many people were entrepreneurs,” he says. “I felt inspired by that, and so I wanted to study business and finance.” There are signs he is giving up: “The Home Office said I had to move to a different town, and since then I haven’t even tried to enrol in college. I’m so tired,” he says. The British Red Cross is helping both Bwar and Shabaaz, writing letters of support for their cases. Kalyani McCarthy, the national project manager for Surviving to Thriving, a Red Cross programme that has helped 160 unaccompanied young asylum seekers and refugees this year, says the programme often comes across this. “What’s particularly disruptive is an age assessment takes a significant time, and in the interim the local authority won’t try and support that young person to access education,” she says. The situation, while complicated, could be handled better, she says: “There are concerns around safeguarding, not wanting to put older people in classes with children, but that can be really detrimental for young people who are going through these stressful experiences. It affects their mental health, they get so upset and don’t understand why someone would not believe them: ‘Why would I lie?’” Simple measures could help, she adds: ensuring young people understand the age assessment processes they are going through, for instance, and letting them choose an “appropriate adult” to support them at meetings. “From our experience the majority of young people are genuine and don’t have any knowledge of what it means if they are younger,” she says. “I think awareness has increased, but local authorities should only be completing these assessments when there’s a genuine and significant reason to doubt, and not just because a young person doesn’t have documents, which is very common.” Edward Taylor, a solicitor at Osbornes Law, has represented many young asylum seekers in age disputes. “The definition of a child is that they are under 18, and local authorities by law need to treat children in accordance with their claimed age until the age assessment is complete,” he says. “We deal with a lot of clients who are 16 or 17, and it’s easier for them to start college than to go to school. But if they are 14 or 15, they will often be put into college and not into school; there’s no drive to get them into school and to treat them in accordance with their claimed age.” Taylor has come across cases where age assessments have been found to be wildly inaccurate: in one case a boy assessed as age 23 by the local authority, was later accepted as having been 17. The process took a year and by then he was over 18. “He would have been able to go to college if his age had been assessed correctly. Instead, he was moved from pillar to post between the local authority and Home Office, which really took its toll on him and prevented the education provision he so desperately needed.” Taylor has witnessed another serious problem, too: children being held at a reception centre in Kent are receiving no formal education, he says. He recently received a freedom of information response from the county, where young people can spend six months or more in the Millbank reception centre before being dispersed. It confirms that the only education available there is informal language support supplied by a local charity. “Millbank reception centre takes many of the new arrivals who are going to be age disputed,” says Taylor. “They shouldn’t be placed at Millbank, because it clearly isn’t adequate to meet their needs, and deprives the right to appropriate education provision.”  Kent county council said in a statement that the Millbank centre had been overwhelmed by unprecedented numbers of arrivals this year, along with the collapse of a national dispersal scheme, and so unaccompanied youngsters were spending far longer there than normal while their ages were being assessed – in some cases more than six months. A spokesperson said: “If entered into Kent county council’s care, these young people will be moved into appropriate housing and will then begin to learn English to enable them to move forward into education and eventually be equipped to sit exams in the UK.” The Home Office said it was exploring with local authorities how to improve the handling of age assessments and disputes. “We are fixing our broken asylum system to make it firm and fair,” its statement said. “Our age assessment process seeks to balance the need to ensure that children are given the support they need, while preventing adults passing themselves off as children.” Meanwhile, the future for Shabaaz and Bwar remains uncertain. Both are still waiting to hear whether they can stay in the UK. Bwar has found a solicitor who is helping him to challenge his local authority’s age assessment through legal action. But the process has taken a deeper toll: “It isn’t just about going to university and stuff, it’s so personal,” Bwar says. “If I am 28, then who am I really? Did I sleep for 10 years? I’m not 28, I’m 18 and I really want to prove it.” Fran Abrams is the co-author, with Joanna McIntyre, of Refugee Education, which will be published by Routledge on 27 November.",education
"Universities fined students more than £170,000 for breaching coronavirus safety rules in the first weeks of the new academic year, a Guardian analysis has found, as students told of struggling to make friends without flouting restrictions. Twenty-eight institutions fined students for breaking university, local and national Covid rules, including on household mixing, mandatory face coverings and social distancing, according to responses from 105 universities to freedom of information (FoI) requests. University of Nottingham students paid more than one-third of the total amount, with 91 fined a total of £58,865 up to 12 November – more than the amount levied on its student population by police. The university said the individual fines it issued were up to £1,500. The fines handed down to 1,898 students amounted to £170,915. Most universities only disclosed fines levied in the first two to three weeks of term. Some said the money would be paid into their student hardship fund. The findings reveal wide variations in the penalties imposed on students by different universities as well as in the support provided to those self-isolating or seeking psychological help during the pandemic. Fifty-three universities said they disciplined and cautioned a total of 5,122 students. Nottingham came top, with 672 students sanctioned and a further 21 cases pending, followed by Leeds Beckett (403), Oxford Brookes (340), Manchester University (334) and Aberdeen (215). Aberdeen University disclosed the second highest value of fines – £32,250 by 24 November. The university did not disclose how many students this figure covered but said it had imposed fines of £17,750 on 140 students by 15 October. Most fines were £125 but a small number of repeat offenders were told to pay £250, it added. Oxford Brookes imposed the highest number of Covid-related fines – 326, totalling £18,950. Leeds University imposed 343 fines but said it could not extrapolate how many were for breaches of Covid regulations, and did not disclose their value. St Andrews University imposed fines totalling £13,240 on 193 students. The figures do not include fines separately imposed by police. Nottingham said police had issued 91 fines to its students, totalling £28,000. In October, four Nottingham Trent students were fined £10,000 each by the police after more than 30 people were found in their house. A university spokesman said it was working with officers to investigate another student house party earlier this week, and had begun disciplinary proceedings. Emily, 20, a first-year student at St Andrews University, which warned students they must “follow all safety guidelines to the letter”, said she had broken the Covid restrictions because “otherwise it would have been physically impossible to make friends”. She added: “I have received two £60 fines from the university and two strikes on my non-academic register, meaning I can no longer do things such as apply for a year abroad. I think it’s outrageous that these strikes will stay on my record for my entire university life. “The halls and town are crawling with wardens and security ready to shut down anything immediately. It’s like a police state. A friend was fined for not wearing a mask properly. This whole experience is incredibly isolating.” Liz, 18, a first-year student at Newcastle University, was fined £100 by the police for having drinks with friends from her home town in their student house. She said: “I’d been feeling really down and thought this would make me feel better. It wasn’t a party but the music was fairly loud. I didn’t appeal because I thought feeling lonely wouldn’t stand up very well as a defence. I’ve not made any new friends. I’m stuck in my tiny bedroom all day. I would have deferred if I knew it was going to be like this.” Some of the universities that levied the largest fines also had the longest waiting times for students to see a counsellor. St Andrews University said the average waiting time to see a counsellor was five weeks. Manchester Metropolitan University, which issued 156 fines totalling £7,800, disclosed the largest number of students waiting for counselling (280), followed by Northumbria University (81). Most universities said they were providing online and telephone counselling, with some also laying on buddy services. Many are providing deliveries of food and toiletries – some for free. Larissa Kennedy, the president of the National Union of Students, said: “It is absolutely unacceptable that universities have felt it necessary to issue obscene fines and harsh punishments. [They] should be providing care packages with food, household products, wellbeing materials and general necessities at no extra cost.” Newcastle University said it was “acutely aware” that the pandemic had limited students’ ability to make friends. A spokeswoman added that students had access to a helpline and 24/7 mental health support and could pair up with a student or staff buddy. A St Andrews University spokesman said: “It’s grossly false and disingenuous to claim the only way to make friends is to break the rules. Support for our students remains our paramount concern.” The University of Nottingham said it supported police fines against the minority of students who broke the rules, which were reinforced by its own disciplinary action, fines and other sanctions. A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education institutions, said universities had encouraged responsible student behaviour through agreements or pledges. But he added: “Universities are taking Covid safety measures and government guidance very seriously and students will have been informed of the consequences of breaking these rules.”",education
"Students have been left reeling after the UK’s biggest funder of PhDs announced that thousands of researchers will not be given extra time or funding to complete their degrees. UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) supports around 22,000 students at any one time – up to a quarter of all doctoral students in the UK – with an annual budget of around £400m. Thousands have now been told they must find a way to finish their research on time, causing distress among students who spoke to the Guardian. “This is a new layer of uncertainty on top of the uncertainty we have all been living with during the pandemic,” said Aline Cerqueira, a marine biologist. “I am concerned that if I do not get an extension, I might not be able to conclude my research analysis and thesis writing. “With two children depending on me and a mortgage to pay, unfunded extensions would also represent a real challenge to my family, with possible detrimental effects to our financial stability and mental health.” Alex Kirby-Reynolds, 30, who has been doing a PhD on the impact of Brexit on people’s lives, alongside some teaching to keep out of debt, said he would be unable to work without a funding extension. “I already had a lot of anxiety around this as it is difficult to complete a PhD in the time we are usually funded,” he said. “Obviously the announcement of likely not receiving additional funding has only increased this stress. This anxiety makes working on challenging reading, writing, and other kind of work more difficult. “My only possible solution would be that I could move to a part-time PhD and find some other kind of employment that would allow me to complete my project.” Doctoral students also raised concerns about being unable to collect data within a shorter timeframe, and how missing out on opportunities to publish papers and attend conferences could make them less competitive in the academic jobs market. UKRI, which brings together seven research councils including the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said it knew that many research projects had been disrupted by lockdown and social distancing, and it might take time for access to resources and labs and for field work to return to normal. It said: “We are therefore advising all students funded by UKRI, including those on grants from any of the seven research councils, to speak to their supervisors about how to adjust their project to complete a doctoral-level qualification within their funded period.” It says it provided an extra £44m for extensions in April and £19m more in the past week, meaning extra financial support had been made available for up to 12,000 students most affected by the pandemic, such as those in their final year, disabled students and those with caring responsibilities. But thousands will receive no extra support, instead being told to readjust their work to meet their original deadline. In a 30-page report on the issue, UKRI concluded: “New and early-stage UKRI doctoral students must modify projects with the support of their supervisors and grant holders to ensure they can be completed within their funded period.” Dr Marc Reichow, a lecturer in geochemistry at the University of Leicester, tweeted his dismay at the news. “How to adjust? Are you asking to cut down to make it fit into the new time frame? Students had no access to research facilities! I am not impressed by this news. This adds another level of stress to all! Thanks for that,” he wrote. Alexander Joseph Currie, a PhD student investigating Aspergillus fumigatus immune responses in cystic fibrosis, has begun a petition urging UKRI to extend an extra six months of support to all PhD students.  Prof Rory Duncan, the UKRI’s director of talent and skills, said the new guidance was based on consultations with students, university leaders, grant holders and others. “We know that students and supervisors have made huge efforts already to adapt. We are advising doctoral students who have not yet done so, to speak to their supervisor to adjust their projects and ensure they can complete them within their funding period. We know how hard this will be for students who are dedicated and passionate about their work,” he said.",education
"The market for student rentals is as active as ever, regardless of Covid restrictions on campuses. “It may be more difficult for students this year but it’s busier than we would have thought,” says Martin Blakey, chief executive at the student housing charity Unipol. “Students are really determined to have as close as possible to a traditional uni experience, and are planning their future as they normally would.” But finding a flatmate in a pandemic isn’t easy. Drama student Daisy Widdess*, who found a flat last week, says she is one of the lucky ones. “A lot of people have absolutely no idea who they’re going to live with. We haven’t had the chance to meet many people and the friends we have made don’t know each other. It’s a whole palaver.” If you are feeling worried about who to live with or how to find a house, here’s what to do next. There may be pressure to find student accommodation early, but don’t be rushed by letting agents. “It’s a myth that if you don’t do it in the first few months you won’t get a place,” says third-year University of Warwick student, Darcey Edkins. “There will always be landlords and apartments that will take you.” This year, there is more reason to be cautious. Many students have fallen behind on their rent, been trapped in tenancies they no longer need when teaching has moved online, and often had to spend increasing amounts of time in poor-quality housing. As a result, the National Union of Students (NUS) says students should be especially careful when signing up to new tenancies, ensuring they are not trapped into paying rent for a property they may not use for the whole duration of the contract. In previous years, you could have met future housemates on nights out or through societies. This year, however, many are leaning towards living with people from their accommodation. If this doesn’t work for you, don’t be afraid to branch out and find others. “Don’t rush into it if the people are not right for you,” says Edkins. Blakey says they are seeing a rise in students getting a room in a house full of strangers. “It is not uncommon for houses to look for extra people to fill the rooms,” he says. Consider partnering up with one person and joining others in a search. Social media can be a good tool for finding housemates. You can reach out to students from your course and look into connecting with like-minded people in student groups on Facebook.  Students’ unions often run speed dating type socials for flatmates and many of these have moved online. At Bristol University, for instance, there are virtual “find a flatmate” events that cover topics such as size, location and budget. At Royal Holloway, University of London, there is an advice centre that specialises in matching people with other households. If you haven’t seen anything advertised, contact your students’ union. Most viewings are taking place online, but try to visit the property if you can. If you do an online viewing, make sure you are shown every aspect of the property, especially the ceiling of the bathroom to check for any damp or mould. Take a walk to the area and see if you like the feel of it. Bristol University’s student living officer, Ruth Day, says her top tip is to ask the current tenants what they think of the house and the landlord. Widdess says this worked for her: “The first house we saw looked so nice online, but I managed to speak to one of the girls, and she said the wifi was awful and the plumbing was like something from the 18th century.” Be wary, though – some landlords are struggling to fill rooms, so they are now incentivising their tenants to find people for them. “We’ve been offered £20 each from our landlord,” says Edkins. Social media is another common way for people to vent about the problems they’ve had with particular landlords and agents. If you’re feeling too rushed, consider purpose-built student accommodation or returning to halls where possible. Rooms tend to be filled much later in the academic year and if you’re struggling to find flatmates this may be a good option, as you will all be thrown in together and you will meet more people. *name has been changed",education
"One day at school, Jack* was accosted by his teacher while he was putting his coat on and getting ready to leave the classroom. “Leave it there,” she insisted in front of his classmates. “We donated you that. Your mum didn’t have enough money to buy you a coat.” When he argued back – his mum, a successful public sector employee, had bought the coat for him before term – he was given detention for a week. The same teacher referred him for an ADHD diagnosis without telling his parents. Sarah*, his mother, has worked in educational special needs, and questioned the teacher’s decision. She learned the diagnosis stemmed from a high score on a maths test, which had been deemed suspicious “considering his background”. Throughout his school career, 12-year-old Jack has had to get used to micro-aggressions such as these. “That behaviour is quite constant,” says Sarah. “Would she have done that with another child, or is it because he’s a Traveller?” Jack’s experience is not unique. In a recent report from the Traveller Movement, two-thirds of Irish Travellers said they been bullied by teachers, with one in five saying this made them leave school. This is one of the many reasons why just 3-4% of pupils from Traveller, Gypsy or Roma (GRT) backgrounds attend university compared with 43% of their peers, according to Kings College London research. The numbers are thought to be getting worse rather than better, although this is difficult to measure given so many GRT students conceal their identities for fear of racism. Another barrier is cultural. Some GRT pupils’ parents experienced patchy schooling themselves, and don’t always value education or struggle to support their children with schoolwork. Jack is lucky because although Sarah didn’t attend school growing up, she had the opportunity to go to college, where she received distinctions across the board. “The issue now is that he’s starting secondary school, and most Traveller boys don’t go. They normally go out to work with their dad,” she says. “He feels a bit torn. They’re saying ‘we’re old enough, we don’t have to’, and I’m saying ‘actually, you’re really bright, you do really well, you enjoy it’.” So when Sarah spotted an Instagram post offering free online tutoring for pupils from GRT backgrounds during coronavirus, she leapt at the chance. Within weeks, she noticed a transformation. “It’s the attitude towards education that’s changed.” The project is part of Rom Belong, a pioneering programme run by King’s College London and the Traveller Movement. It aims to help more bright GRT pupils like Jack get into university, and support them when they arrive. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, most of its work had to be suspended, leading the team to worry that these hard to reach communities could drift even further away from education. But they rapidly rolled out online tutoring and discovered it to be even more effective than face-to-face. The project funds free Amazon Fire tablets and dongles for families since they are twice as likely to face digital poverty as their peers. Some tutors even started teaching their students over WhatsApp. “It’s working amazingly – the kids are less embarrassed when it’s online,” says Chrissie Browne, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller lead at King’s College London’s department for widening participation. “And their families don’t have to change their lives. If you’ve got a living situation in poverty, parents don’t want people to come in.” Many GRT pupils experience low expectations and racist bullying from teachers and fellow students, so receiving personalised attention from a tutor is invaluable. “The most important thing is to have an experience where someone in education sees them as an individual with their own interests and skills, and to focus on what makes them special, not just as part of a group,” says Meredith Moore, one of the tutors. She thinks her pupil’s experience of travelling has made her adaptable, open-minded and equipped with good social skills.Outreach work with the GRT community has to start young, as many disengage with education early. That’s why although most university access work focuses on teenagers, the tutoring project is open to children of all ages. “If you look at the evidence, GRT kids are already behind by primary school, by secondary they’re in pupil referral units. They’re behind their peers by two to three years, so to just work with 16 and 17 year-olds is shutting the gate after the horse has bolted,” says Browne. Browne is a Traveller, and experienced a difficult journey through the education system. She didn’t enjoy school, then returned to education in her late 20s, ending up with a BSc in nutrition and dietetics from King’s. “As a Traveller, going to uni is a scary thing. I didn’t feel like I fitted in. Even though on the outside I look like any other white girl, inside I felt different to everyone else,” she says. Her views are echoed by Chelsea McDonagh, an Irish Traveller working on the project, who is also a campaigner and researcher for the Traveller Movement. “When you don’t see people from your background at uni it can make it feel as though it isn’t a place for someone like you,” she says, but adds that “especially more recently, universities are doing a lot more outreach work and that’s a really positive step.” She thinks one of the main benefits of the tutoring project is the way it tackles the root cause of underrepresentation at university: lower attainment at school. “Not all parents are able to support with home learning, so if schools aren’t bridging some of that gap that can contribute to young people falling behind,” she says. But while grassroots projects can make a difference to a handful of pupils, ultimately meaningful change is the government’s responsibility, McDonagh says. She thinks policy isn’t “going anywhere near as far as it should”, highlighting how few GRT students have benefited from the free laptops drive during the pandemic. She thinks there is an urgent need for more targeted initiatives focused on the GRT community. “There are schools which are trying but if young people are behind their peers, the schools need access to additional funding to get them up to speed,” she says. “Honestly even if [the government] did the bare minimum we’d probably clap, because there’s been so little.”",education
"The head of a prestigious Oxford college has stepped aside in the latest twist in a long-running battle over his position. The Very Rev Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church, voluntarily withdrew from all his duties after a new, unspecified complaint was made against him. It is understood not to be related to earlier complaints. His allies said Percy, who is head of both the college and the cathedral, had stepped aside because of “intolerable pressure” over more than two years. One said: “Martyn and the college have agreed not to comment on the present situation. Martyn has not resigned and is confident that he will return to his duties in the new year.” Percy was suspended as dean in 2018 after he was accused of behaviour of an “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature” – the wording of the college’s statutes under which a dean can be removed. The dean’s supporters claimed that a small group within the governing body was determined to remove him from his post because of his efforts to modernise the way the 474-year-old college was run. Percy’s detractors insisted the acrimonious dispute originated in the dean’s attempts to secure a pay rise. The college hired Sir Andrew Smith, a retired high court judge, to chair an internal tribunal on the dispute. Smith dismissed the complaints against Percy and ordered his reinstatement. The dispute has cost the college, a charitable body, at least £2m in legal fees. The college is also thought to have lost millions in cancelled bequests and donations. In June the Charity Commission said: “The very protracted and public dispute between the college’s governing body and its dean is damaging to the reputation of the charity, and affecting its ability to govern itself.” Two months later the Church of England exonerated Percy after investigating claims that he had failed to deal properly with sexual abuse allegations. Percy is taking the college to an employment tribunal. The case is due to be heard next year. A statement from Christ Church sent this week to staff and students at the college and cathedral school, and to the cathedral congregation, said: “The dean of Christ Church, the Very Rev Martyn Percy, has voluntarily withdrawn with immediate effect from all duties and pastoral responsibilities in his role as dean of the college and cathedral. “Christ Church will not be commenting further whilst necessary inquiries are under way. The Charity Commission and relevant Church of England authorities are being kept fully informed.” The C of E said the bishop of Oxford had agreed that Percy would step back from office while a complaint was properly considered. The dean’s allies have said Percy is the victim of a witch-hunt by a governing body that acts like a “medieval fiefdom”. Christ Church was founded by Henry VIII in 1546. It is the alma mater of 13 prime ministers, 10 chancellors of the exchequer and 17 archbishops. Among its former students are King Edward VII, Lewis Carroll and WH Auden. It is one of Oxford’s richest colleges, with funds of more than £500m.",education
"Angel Gabriel calling Mary on Zoom to tell her that she’s expecting the baby Jesus. A trip to the countryside and some furloughed shepherds. As the unfamiliar becomes familiar amid the pandemic, the nativity is no different – with schools across the country getting creative in their depictions of the traditional play. “We didn’t want it to look like a filmed stage show, or a bit ‘naff’. We wanted it to be as realistic as possible,” said Jo Goode, headteacher of Grasmere Primary School in Cumbria. Unable to hold the traditional play in church due to Covid-19 restrictions, the school took 70 schoolchildren to the Lake District countryside, in their local area, to shoot the 20-minute film. In a revamped script, the play follows Mary and Joseph living in an inner city urban area. Fearing the repercussions of the pandemic they decide to run away to the countryside, rather than the usual trek across the desert. It also features cameo appearances from the local community, including Wordsworth Trust, and the Langdale Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team. “It has been really quite cathartic for [the pupils], because it’s given them an opportunity to talk through how everybody’s behaved during lockdown,” Goode said. The film will be broadcast to local hospitals within the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay on Christmas Eve. “It was lovely because it sort of became the Christmas story itself. Our plan was to make a little thing for our community, and the community ended up thoroughly involving themselves in it.” Other schools have taken a different approach to their nativity. Pupils at Glascote Academy, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, have learned sign language to Christmas songs to accompany their Christmas play. The government guidance says that kids can sing in classrooms, but only if they’re very well ventilated and if the kids are a metre apart, says Charlotte Anderson, a music teacher at the school. “I can’t think of a school in the country where they can sit like that. Classrooms are tiny, aren’t they?” Anderson appointed every class their own sign language song to learn, and the classes recorded the songs together with others in their respective year bubble in the school hall. “They’ve enjoyed learning the sign language for the songs,” Anderson said. “It’s something that will stick with them for a long time because they’ve had to practise it so much. But they would definitely much prefer a normal Christmas play. “It is a shame, especially for my year six group. It’s their last Christmas in the school. They’re gutted because they would perform the big parts in the Christmas productions, but this is the best we can do.” Like many schools across the UK, Bramley Park academy, in Leeds, has had to adapt to using virtual technology to help record its nativity. Carrie Green, executive principal of the school, said they used Google classrooms for “a different twist on the virtual nativity, just to make sure they’re all still involved.” The script has been adapted, too. “Angel Gabriel has a Zoom call with Mary to tell her that she’s expecting the baby Jesus. The shepherds have been furloughed. Mary and Joseph have to scan a QR code when they arrive at the inn, and the kings take hand sanitiser and a golden face mask to the baby Jesus.” Green reflected that she found singing into her laptop while the children joined in around the school to be “one of the weirdest thing I’ve ever done in my life”. But, she added, “the kids have absolutely loved it. This is a really special time of year, and it’s so important that we’re still doing this”.  This article was amended on 11 December 2020 to clarify that Bramley Park academy is in Leeds, not Bradford. ",education
"A far-reaching overhaul of the university admissions system, which would mean places being offered on the basis of grades rather than predictions, could open up a “devolution divide” without an agreement with the devolved nations, Ucas has said. Pressure has been growing for a shift from the current system under which sixth formers in England apply to university in January using grades predicted by their teachers, before sitting A-levels in late spring and accepting university offers in June. Following a review, Ucas, the universities admissions service, has now drawn up two proposals, both of which advocate post-qualifications admissions. The first keeps applications ahead of results day in August, with offers based on actual results. The second proposes moving the whole applications process beyond results day and pushing back university start dates until January. It is likely to be less popular with the sector and government because it would put the UK system out of synch with the rest of the world. John Cope, the director of strategy, policy and public affairs at Ucas, said the aim was to make the system fairer for disadvantaged students. However, he said: “In the case of both options, working with the devolved nations will be essential or else a devolution divide will open up, with nothing stopping Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish universities walking away from Ucas and all the benefits that a UK admissions shared service brings.” “This would be terrible for students, creating four fragmented and out-of-sync systems. We also need to recognise the pressure placed on universities and colleges by both options, with less time for interviews and other assessments, which is especially relevant to the arts, medicine or nursing,” he added, writing in the Times. The Ucas proposals are the latest in a long line of attempts to move England to a post-qualification admissions system dating back to 2006, but on each occasion the status quo has remained after opposition from universities and school leaders. Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, and the higher education watchdog in England, the Office for Students, have also been conducting their own reviews into admissions, which will be published soon. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said reform was long overdue. “Teachers work diligently to predict grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. And in recent years universities have overused unconditional offers as a way of getting bums on seats, which demotivates students in their A-levels, and can lead to them choosing a course which doesn’t suit them.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We remain committed to delivering on our manifesto pledge to improve the admissions system. We are exploring options that will ensure it is as fair and transparent as possible, and works for every student.”",education
"When in 1970 my friend Tony Knight, who has died aged 93, became headteacher of the Church of England middle school in Newport on the Isle of Wight, the school had not even been built. But once he got there he nursed it into being, constantly seeking ways to improve its systems and to create a happy and buzzing community on the island. He was also keen to bring into the staffroom people whose experience went beyond the usual routes into teaching. Tony was born in Wantage in Oxfordshire (but then in Berkshire) to Norah (nee Carpenter) and her husband, Joseph, who both worked at King Alfred’s school in the town – Norah running the boarding house of which Joseph was housemaster. Naturally Tony attended the school, and after leaving aged 17 in 1944 he was accepted into the army and sent to Burma with the Royal Corps of Signals. On demob in 1949 he read English at Oxford, where he met a young nurse, Hilary Scott, in 1950, and two years later they married. After a first job as a store management trainee with Anglo Iranian Oil, Tony turned to teaching English at schools in Boston, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Exeter. Then, in 1963, with their young family, he and Hilary left for Switzerland to become houseparents at the Pestalozzi Children’s Village in Trogen, set up in 1946 to provide a home for children from various nations who had found themselves in difficult circumstances, and to nurture ambassadors of peace for the future. I worked there as a volunteer, and I saw how they threw themselves into their roles as teachers, substitute parents, internationalist community-makers and UK representatives. When it was their turn to lead the weekly assembly with a contribution from their native culture, Tony (self-effacing and donnish in appearance) entertained and startled the village as a pantomime dame. He also carried out his regular snow-shovelling duties with scientific precision. He and Hilary left Switzerland after six years in 1969, and Tony spent the next year studying education at Oxford University. This led, in 1970, to his headteacher appointment on the Isle of Wight. While working in Newport, Tony was a lay canon of Portsmouth Cathedral. Once he retired from the school in 1984 he taught English as a foreign language and, while Hilary continued to work, also cared for his mother-in-law, Evelyn Siarey. After a lifetime of paperwork he was happy to cultivate his garden, to swing a scythe in the local churchyard or pound the island’s clifftop walks in the company of a recalcitrant mongrel.

"We’d like to hear from first year students in the UK who have decided to leave university. The coronavirus pandemic has caused increased disruption and hardship for many students around the UK as studies went online and students were forced to self-isolate. But for first year students, starting out at university can be daunting at the best of times, and having to cope with the measures brought about by the pandemic has made the experience that much more challenging. If you’re in your first year and have decided to leave university, we’d like to hear from you and find out your reasons why. We’re also interested in those who have deferred until next year or have decided to go to another university, perhaps one closer to your home.

"Parents are being forced to deregister their children from school and home-educate or else face fines and prosecution for non-attendance after keeping them out of class because of concerns about Covid-19. Some cases involve clinically vulnerable or extremely vulnerable family members who are worried about a child bringing Covid home. One father in North Yorkshire who suffers from severe asthma told the Guardian: “We are devastated. We’ve not chosen to home-school. We’ve been forced to home-school.” This week the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 335 councils in England, reported a sharp rise in the number of children being taken out of school and registered for home education since the start of the autumn term, with some councils seeing increases of up to 200%. Ofsted said that of 380 schools it visited between 29 September and 23 October, almost half had had pupils taken off roll to be electively home educated.. Some parents who contacted the Guardian said they enjoyed teaching their children during the first lockdown and had made a positive choice to home-educate on a permanent basis. A number had children with special educational needs who had struggled without the right support in school. “Lockdown gave us the opportunity to try home education, and we found it was the right thing for us,” said one mother from Yorkshire who has chosen to home-educate her youngest daughter, who has an autism diagnosis. Others feel forced into a corner. They would like their children to remain on roll and continue remote learning until Covid cases have gone down and they feel safe to return to class, but they have been told they have to attend school full-time or leave. One mother in Greater Manchester, where infection rates have been high, said: “While I have been threatened with fines, prosecution and unlawful off-rolling by the headteacher at my children’s school, in other schools parents have been supported fully in their temporary remote learning.” Dr Ambily Banerjee, a scientist from Slough, Berkshire, who works for a vaccine manufacturer, has been educating her 15-year-old daughter at home since March, to protect her clinically vulnerable mother who lives with them. She has not yet deregistered her daughter, but the school has now referred her case to the local authority. “We are BAME and at increased risk, but this is being ignored,” she said. “We should have a choice and not be mandated by the government to send our children to school in a pandemic. We are forced into a corner. It’s an absolutely cruel situation.” Jason Neilson, from Croydon, has educated his 13-year-old son at home since he developed a cough at the start of term and had to self-isolate. He is worried about poor ventilation and lack of masks in classrooms. “The school accused me of being paranoid and referred me to the local authority,” he said. “I have not been fined yet. But it has been made very clear that I could be.” Matt Dunkley, the corporate director for education and young people’s services in Kent, said elective home education was becoming more popular across England prior to the pandemic. “However, nothing could have prepared local authorities for the surge of notifications [of children being taken off roll] that came through in September 2020,” he said. Kent received 596 notifications of children being deregistered from school in September, compared with 235 the year before. In October there were 210 notifications, compared with 131 in October 2019. “It is difficult to pinpoint a specific reason,” said Dunkley. “There will be parents who found the experience of home-educating their children through lockdown extremely fulfilling and beneficial to their child. There will be those who have concerns for their health and members of extended families and intend to home educate as a temporary measure until they are assured that they are no longer at risk from the pandemic. There will also be those who having spent time at home away from routine and structure, are unable or unwilling to return to school.” Without any legislation in place to allow local authorities access to a child in their home environment to ensure they are in receipt of an education, Dunkley said many children could be left with no education at all. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The government made school attendance mandatory from the beginning of the autumn term and specifically told schools to record attendance and follow-up absence. So they do not have a great deal of latitude in being able to grant extended periods of absence.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We understand that some parents may be nervous about sending their children to school.  “However, we have already strengthened the protective measures in place in schools during the national measures to make them as safe as possible for children and staff.  “This approach balances the clear evidence of harm caused to children by not attending school, with the need to protect those at greatest risk from the virus. Any parents who are still concerned are encouraged to engage with their school.” ",education
"The University of Birmingham has become the first higher education institution to lower entry requirements for next year in recognition of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on A-level students. The bar for the majority of undergraduate degree programmes at the prestigious Russell Group university is being reduced by one grade. In a move likely to place pressure on other universities to follow suit, it linked the move directly to supporting sixth-form students due to sit their exams next summer. Degree programmes that are not included are medicine, dentistry and dental hygiene, nursing, physiotherapy, and social work, where there is external regulation, as well as the university’s foundation year and degree apprenticeship programmes. “We recognise the need to adapt our admissions approach for this year given the extraordinary disruption affecting these students and their schools and the fact that many are likely to experience more than a year of interrupted learning by the time they sit their exams next summer,” said the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Sir David Eastwood. “We have considered what we can do as a university to recognise and reward potential, mitigate some of the educational challenges as result of Covid, and reduce some of the pressure on students and teachers at this challenging time. Providing greater flexibility in our admissions for 2021 entry is one such area.” He said he hoped reducing the entry requirements would “alleviate anxieties”. The move was welcomed by Dr Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, but he said third level institutions also needed to work to lower grades for disadvantaged students, who had felt the brunt of a disproportionate impact from the pandemic. “Even though the pandemic will have a higher impact on school pupils up and down the country, it appears that grades will actually be similar, if not better than previous years,” he said. While universities were trying to improve social mobility, he said they were competing for the same students, and moves such as Birmingham’s had to be seen in that context. “There is a marketplace here and I suspect that most institutions will have similar strategies. So you can see there is a competitive advantage of lowering grades.” The University of Birmingham has said the initiative also applies to its “contextual offer-making” – where institutions take into account factors that can restrict a student’s achievement at school.",education
"Children in the poorest areas of England are missing the most schooling, research suggests, and attendance levels are at their lowest in regions with high Covid-19 infection rates. Attendance levels at secondary schools in Knowsley, Merseyside, were as low as 61%, and rates were also less than 70% in other local authority areas in the north-west and in Yorkshire and the Humber. The signs of strain on school rolls came as Unison warned that Covid-19 could be spreading via lower-paid non-teaching staff such as caterers and cleaners who cannot afford to self-isolate at home. The union is compiling a list of contractors who will not grant full sick pay if employees get Covid or need to go into isolation. “We already know of several large contractors denying staff full sick pay, and they each have contracts with hundreds of schools,” said Jon Richards, the head of education at Unison. The Scottish government on Friday issued advice that older school pupils should wear face coverings in classrooms in areas that are in level 3 or 4 of Scotland’s lockdown system. The strongest official advice on masks yet to be issued in any part of the UK will apply to young people across central Scotland including Glasgow and Edinburgh, where tier 3 comes into force on Monday. Scotland’s education secretary, John Swinney, said pupils had already complied “magnificently” with masks guidance, and individual schools would take steps to support any pupils who were unable to afford the items or had medical conditions that prevented their use. “We do not want to see young people excluded from school because of issues they have wearing face coverings,” he added. A co-author of the English schools research said high infection rates and the inadequacy of the coronavirus testing regime meant that “a lot of schooling” was being missed despite Boris Johnson’s pledge to make the return to class a national priority. Government figures report that 86% of children attended school on 22 October, but the research by the University of Bristol and FFT Education Datalab suggests the national statistics hide strong regional and local variation. Since their analysis was based on local authority averages, the researchers said attendance in some schools could have been below 50%. “As we see again and again, the pandemic is exacerbating inequalities and reducing still further the chances of levelling up,” said Simon Burgess, a professor of economics at the University of Bristol. The researchers drew on statistics released in answer to a parliamentary question, and outlined their findings in a blog in which they warned that the biggest hit to future life chances was being felt by those in the most challenging circumstances. However, they also found there was not necessarily a correlation between attendance and poverty in some areas such as London and the West Midlands. “It definitely shows that somehow, either because of what local government is doing, or perhaps something to do with the place or how the virus is acting, it does not have to be the case that really high poverty rates mean you should end up with low attendance,” Burgess said. A Department for Education spokesperson said more than 99% of schools have been open every week since term began. “Schools are putting remote education in place for pupils self-isolating and our £1bn Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time including the £350m national tutoring programme for disadvantaged students.”",education
"Protesting students at the University of Manchester have pulled down fences that were erected around their halls of residence as part of measures aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus during the new lockdown.  Students living on the university’s Fallowfield campus said fences had been erected early on Thursday morning without warning from the university, and they were only able to leave through a single exit guarded by security. As well as fencing off most entrance points, the university disabled swipe cards that grant entry to buildings other than their accommodation. The university initially said the measures were to prevent access by non-residents, and students could continue to access and leave their own accommodation subject to ID checks. However, on Thursday night the university apologised for the fences and announced they would be removed on Friday morning. “I sincerely apologise for the concern and distress caused by the erecting of a fence around our Fallowfield halls of residence today,” Prof Nancy Rothwell, the vice-chancellor. “This was not our intention – in fact quite the reverse.” In a protest on Thursday evening, hundreds of angry students gathered in what they described as “HMP Fallowfield” to protest against the university’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, including mental health support. At the end of the rally, students tore down all of the fences that had been erected in the morning.  The government has urged students across the country to stay on campus during lockdown rather than rush back to their family homes and for their universities to continue face-to-face teaching. The University and College Union and National Union of Students are warning that this poses a serious risk to the health of staff and students. George Rogers, a first-year planning and real estate student residing in Oak House halls, said the increased security measures were contributing to a stressful atmosphere on campus. “A lot of people have gone home, you feel the campus getting slightly emptier,” he said. “I don’t understand why they need to put up fences to keep us safe from the virus. It makes us feel like they don’t trust us, it feels like they’re locking us in our rooms.” One student on Twitter asked how the university thought it was acceptable to put up fences without prior notification. The university sent an email at 3.30pm on 5 November stating that “security staff will ensure that only students who live in that accommodation can access safely and help avoid the mixing of households”. Students may be subject to ID checks to access their rooms, the email added. Isabella Mearns, a first-year architecture student, said the university was restricting access to green spaces. “We just feel like prisoners at the moment. Recently we had this boy who committed suicide and this is their response, to lock us in. This is ridiculous,” she said. The NUS is campaigning for the government and universities to ensure that students are treated equally by coronavirus restrictions. The union’s president, Larissa Kennedy, said students had been “policed, threatened and blamed to appalling levels” throughout the pandemic. The government is also urging universities to continue providing face-to-face teaching, although some institutions, including Manchester, have already shifted their courses entirely online. Along with the UCU, the NUS is warning that continuing face-to-face teaching puts the health of students and staff at risk. Dozens of students left messages on the Facebook page of the University of Lincoln after it used the site to announce a continuation of face-to-face teaching, with many expressing concerns that they were being asked to commute through high-risk areas. On its website, the University of Lincoln posted a letter to students from the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, in which she said: “By keeping universities open, we are prioritising education so that there is no gap in your academic journeys and lives.” The pressure on universities also came as Independent Sage, a group of experts set up as an independent alternative to the government’s own scientific advisory panel, criticised government guidance that students based on campus should remain there. It warned that the government’s policy was likely to exacerbate Covid-19 spread in the community between areas of high and low infection by concentrating journeys in December as students return home. A University of Manchester spokesperson said staff and students had raised concerns about non-residents accessing accommodation. They stated: “We are therefore introducing new security measures out of hours at key entrance points to our campus, accommodation and main pedestrian routes to help keep our students, our staff and our community safe. As now, residents can continue to enter and leave as they please. “Regrettably the fencing began to be installed ahead of the message being seen by halls students. We apologise for any worry that this has caused and would like to reiterate that all students who live on site can continue to come and go freely.”",education
"The government has accused universities in England of ignoring antisemitism and ordered them to adopt an international definition before the end of the year or risk having funding cut off. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said in a letter to vice-chancellors that it was “frankly disturbing” that so many universities had failed to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism. “The repugnant belief that antisemitism is somehow a less serious or more acceptable form of racism has taken insidious hold in some parts of British society, and I am quite clear that universities must play their part in rooting out this attitude and demonstrating that antisemitism is abhorrent,” Williamson said. He noted that some universities had made progress. “However, there remain too many disturbing incidents of antisemitism on campus, from both students and staff, and a lack of willingness by too many universities to confront this.” A freedom of information request by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) found that only 29 out of 133 universities had adopted the IHRA definition, and 80 said they had no current plans to do so.  Universities have objected to adopting the definition on the principle of academic autonomy, and in other cases because of conflicts with freedom of speech requirements, which are also strongly backed by Williamson’s government. A spokesperson for the UJS said Williamson’s letter was “a strong stand by the UK government against antisemitism and discrimination faced by Jewish students”. Williamson said the Office for Students, the higher education regulator for England, could be asked to take regulatory action including suspending “funding streams” if universities failed to adopt the IHRA definition by the end of December. “If I have not seen the overwhelming majority of institutions adopting the definition by Christmas then I will act,” Williamson wrote. A spokesperson for Universities UK, which represents the sector, said: “We recommend universities do all they can to tackle antisemitism, including considering the IHRA definition, whilst also recognising their duty to promote freedom of speech within the law. “UUK has set up a taskforce to consider what can be done to address all forms of harassment, violence and hate crime on campus, including on the basis of religion. We are in regular contact with Jewish community leaders and student groups to ensure that universities are supported to do all they can to tackle antisemitism.” Williamson’s intervention comes at a difficult time for many universities struggling to cope with hundreds of students and staff infected with Covid-19, as well as preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU and its impact on recruitment and funding. “When future historians look at the Covid-19 period, there will be complete mystification at what the Department for Education took to be a priority in the middle of the crisis,” said one university official.",education
"In August, A-level students joined forces to voice their anger on social media at the algorithm that failed to give them fair grades, helping force a government U-turn in favour of teacher-estimated results. Now, some of those same students are stuck in lockdowns at halls of residences at universities across the country, studying online and restricted to socialising with their households – and they’re angry again. “Students were mobilised by the A-level U-turn. Now they’ve come on to campus, they’re thinking: ‘I’m sitting in my room watching a screen, which I could have done at home, why am I paying this money?’. There’s growing political awareness that enough is enough,” says Sabrina Shah, co-president of the School of Oriental and African Studies students’ union. Shah says the students she speaks to are angry about the way some campus lockdowns are being policed by private security, the paltry food parcels they’ve been receiving from ill-prepared institutions, and a widespread feeling that they were enticed on to campus to shore up university finances despite the risks posed to their physical and mental health. There’s also a growing suspicion among students that they’re being kept in halls to discourage them from dropping out before December, when universities secure their tuition fee payments from the government, she says. As a result, grassroots activist groups are springing up online at campuses across the UK to coordinate actions. Students at several universities, including Warwick, Bristol and Glasgow, are running rent strikes involving hundreds of students. Others at universities including Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool have organised groups under the name Students Before Profit to campaign for better conditions for students locked down in halls. “People think the university’s abandoned them,” says Laura Verdasco, a third-year psychology and neuroscience student at the University of Glasgow who’s been speaking to students to inform Students Before Profit’s work. “It’s their first year and the situation doesn’t seem to be getting much better, and it’s proven hard to talk to the university.” This grassroots activism complements a nationwide campaign launched by the National Union of Students (NUS) last month, called Students Deserve Better. The campaign aims to uphold students’ legal rights, including challenging rules that treat them differently to the wider population, safeguarding their finances and ensuring universities prioritise their safety. The NUS is also partnering with rent strike groups to provide activism training. “The only exciting thing about this moment that otherwise feels really bleak is that we’ve seen an upsurge in the number of localised, grassroots student movements,” says NUS president Larissa Kennedy. “We’re finding ways to support that work.” Despite some students and staff testifying to tension on campuses, they are increasingly joining forces to share their worries about the health risks of face to face teaching and to hold university leaders and the government to account. Shah has been speaking alongside staff members in rallies run by trade unions and grassroots activist networks. “Academics are on the side of the students,” she says. “I think the cross-union work is scaring the government and institutions. It means we’re more powerful.” Demands from the groups vary, but typically they ask for more testing; for all teaching be moved online until it is safe to meet face to face; for proper investment in quality remote teaching, including pausing redundancy plans and supplying disadvantaged students with equipment; for students to be released from their accommodation contracts, so they can go home; and – crucially – for the government to bail out any universities which struggle financially as a result. There is tension in the movement over whether students should receive refunds: while various petitions and student groups such as Refund Us Now are asking for discounts on their education, some believe that this consumer behaviour plays into the marketised higher education system, and see it as a distraction from the broader call to abolish tuition fees. The challenge staff and students are facing is how to make their voices heard when they can’t meet in person or organise protests. Instead, they’re turning to online networks to galvanise their movement. One staff-led group, UCU Solidarity, sprang up in response to the wave of redundancy announcements at the beginning of the pandemic as a way to support official action by the University and College Union (UCU). “When we’re working from home we’re atomised from our usual communities, so you have to build solidarity and organise and be seen and heard,” says Bee Hughes, one of UCU Solidarity’s informal organisers and a lecturer and UCU branch officer. “We’re trying to raise awareness, create community and form a grassroots movement.” UCU Solidarity recently organised a day of action in which staff and students came together to express their concerns. Events included socially distanced protests from students in Manchester, Glasgow, Soas and Brighton; online rallies; talks from MPs including Liverpool Riverside’s Kim Johnson; Twitter storms voicing complaints from angry staff and students at Ulster; and workshops on issues such as intellectual property for online learning. This activism has dovetailed with union branches across the country confronting their leaders after learning that the government’s scientific advisers had called for teaching to move online at the start of the academic year. “It’s quite a drop in the stomach feeling how bad things actually are,” says Vicky Blake, UCU president. “It’s a real moment of reckoning across the sector. There needs to be some leadership that goes beyond offering a few Pot Noodles to some students to make things better.” Blake thinks the union’s work has been given added power by staff and students’ grassroots activism and the networks they’ve developed to share experiences and offer support. She sees this as a distinctive feature of social organising online. “We’re learning from each other, across trade union and activist movements, how to do something positive that helps bring people together,” she says. “It’s quite an organic thing, and I think it shows how bad the situation is that people have been moved to organise in this way. But it also shows that there’s some hope.”",education
"Student leaders and experts have questioned the government’s plans for a pre-Christmas university lockdown, arguing it would breach students’ legal rights and come too late to prevent further outbreaks. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, will meet university leaders to discuss how the government aims to meet Boris Johnson’s pledge that all students who wished to could go home at Christmas to be with their families. The meeting comes as the University of Durham became the sixth university in England with more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases since the start of term. Durham revealed it had recorded more than 960 confirmed cases in the last seven days. The government’s Christmas proposals, as revealed in the Guardian, would require universities in England to end in-person teaching on 8 December and switch to online tuition, with students expected to stay on campus until 22 December. The proposals were called “unworkable” by the University and College Union, while the National Union of Students (NUS) president, Larissa Kennedy, doubted that the government’s legal powers allowed it to confine students to campus. “We are questioning whether there’s legal precedents to do this and treat students differently than the rest of the population,” Kennedy said in an interview with LBC. “Students just aren’t the homogenous group that the government seems to think they are. There are students of all ages, students with parents and carers, and what would this mean for students with jobs that they can’t do remotely? It just doesn’t feel like this has been thought through.” Kennedy said the government’s decision to ignore advice from its Sage committee of experts – which advised that universities should teach online where possible, to reduce transmission – meant it needed to come up with a workable exit plan. Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, an epidemic modeller at the University of Bristol who is on the government’s scientific pandemic influenza group, said a two-week lockdown with online-only teaching before Christmas may be too late. “Our analysis suggests that reducing face-to-face teaching to essential teaching only does have the impact of slowing down the rate of spread and preventing more disseminated outbreaks,” Brooks-Pollock told the BBC. “However, it needs to happen early on in the outbreak, because if infection is already widespread then having this quiet period at the end of term is unlikely to prevent outbreaks within halls of residence. “Two weeks might be enough for students living in smaller households, living with two or three other people, but in these halls of residence where there’s really a lot of people living together, it could just lead to an outbreak in those halls of residence. “And if there’s already disseminated infections, many of which are unobserved, two weeks wouldn’t be long enough at the end of term – it’s too late, essentially.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “If students are travelling home, we must ensure they do so in a way which minimises the risks of spreading the virus, and the date when universities must stop in-person teaching will be an important part of this. We will set out details on this shortly.” As case numbers continue to rise on campus, including more than 900 confirmed infections at the University of Leeds, staff are looking at industrial action to make their case for online-only teaching.",education
"Downing Street is under mounting pressure to perform a U-turn on providing free school meals over the holidays in England, with Conservative MPs growing angry at the damaging impact of the government’s refusal to back down in the face of the campaign led by the footballer Marcus Rashford. The Guardian understands that discontent is brewing behind the scenes among Conservatives, as Labour attempted to seize the initiative on Sunday when its leader, Keir Starmer, pledged to force a fresh Commons vote on the issue before Christmas unless there was a rethink. The move came after his party’s motion to extend the policy until Easter 2021, in a bid to stop children going hungry during the coronavirus crisis, was defeated last week in parliament. As dozens of councils, including some Tory-led, and businesses across the country have stepped in over recent days to offer to feed children during the October half-term, the sense of unease within Conservative circles is hardening. One Tory MP told the Guardian the issue had been a “political handling disaster” and that they had “never known so many Conservative MPs and council leaders so angry”. Separately, the senior Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin became the latest to break ranks to warn that the government had “misunderstood the mood of the country” on the issue and would have to rethink. The former children’s minister Tim Loughton also said it was a mistake by the government not to extend free school meals during the holidays. Loughton, who abstained in last week’s Commons vote, said he would vote to keep school meals during the Christmas holidays and until the pandemic is over in the event of a motion being put to MPs again. It came as a government U-turn was predicted by Laura Sandys, a former Conservative MP and founder of the Food Foundation thinktank, which has backed calls by Rashford’s taskforce for the implementation of key recommendations from the national food strategy in a bid to end child food poverty. On Sunday, the 22-year-old England and Manchester United forward continued to use his social media platform to highlight firms offering support, tweeting a map apparently showing dozens across England, adding: “Ever been more proud of being British?! And we’re still going, wow wow wow.” Meanwhile, the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, intervened on Sunday to liken the debate over the issue to something out of the pages of Charles Dickens’ 19th-century novel Oliver Twist. Downing Street has already been forced into a U-turn once on the issue, deciding to provide £15-a-week meal vouchers to eligible children over the summer after pressure from Rashford, but it has refused to do so for the holidays ahead. In an apparent softening of tone after a No 10 spokesman last week refused to praise councils and firms offering help, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said Rashford deserved “huge credit” for his work on the issue although he stood by Downing Street’s line. Defending the government’s stance, Lewis told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country was in a different position compared with the summer, adding: “We’ve put the uplift into universal credit, around just over £1,000 a year, but also very specifically we’ve put £63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship … and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that.” But one Conservative MP said – referring to the Ministry of Housing, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Education – “It’s been a political handling disaster. No 10, MHCLG/DWP/DfE handling has been woeful. I’ve never known so many Conservative MPs and council leaders so angry. “There was an argument to be had that FSM [free school meals] isn’t the best route to get support to vulnerable families and that targeted benefits via our £9bn UC [universal credit] top-up is a better route to help vulnerable families: not least because FSM excludes pre-school children. But this week’s handling means that moment has passed.” The chair of the Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, who penned a piece for the Spectator on Saturday setting out the Conservative case for extending free school meals and was among five Tory MPs who voted against the government last week, said: “No one has a benevolence or monopoly on compassion on this issue and the Labour party should stop pretending that it does and actually what we should do is come together and work out a proper solution, all parties, and it would be worth the government sitting down properly and genuinely with Marcus Rashford, Henry Dimbleby [co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain] and others to sort this out once and for all.” “I very much hope they [the government] consider my recommendations,” said Dimbleby, whose report had concluded that without urgent state intervention the Covid-19 crisis would lead to a “sharp rise in food insecurity and outright hunger”. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is defence select committee chair and voted with the government last week, is now calling on Downing Street to change course on the issue and extend free school meals in the holidays. “The free school meals provision clearly is very simple, people are aware of it, it’s worked before, it makes sense then to employ it into the future,” he told the Guardian, adding: “This generation of children have had their lives impacted in a way we’ve not seen since the second world war, we must do everything we can do to provide support. If that means utilising a system which is well appreciated then our government should recognise that’s the direction of travel we should go.” The founder of Food Foundation, Sandys, said: “Everybody needs to do the right thing, which is adopt the politics that have been put forward by the Rashford taskforce. “Those people who are closest to this understand that, including those who represent wards with lower incomes. Many Conservative-run councils are understanding the real and deep need and I would expect that the government will come on board over the next couple of weeks. I am just disappointed that they have not done so in time for this mid-term break.” The head of the Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest charity food bank network, Emma Revie, called on the government to offer struggling families more generous support. Revie told the Guardian: “Marcus Rashford’s campaign has been incredible, shining a light on the unbelievable compassion and generosity in our communities. But it is not right that anyone is having to rely on charity to put food on the table for their family. “I hope that we can channel some of that compassion into longer-term solutions that go beyond the school holidays.” The Trussell Trust network operates more than 1,200 charity food bank outlets across the UK. Last month it warned that it was expecting a 61% increase in food bank referrals as furlough ends at the end of October and more families fall on hard times. The pressure on the government came as Tory-controlled councils added their names to a growing list of local authorities around England announcing that they would provide food support at half term. They included Medway council – a unitary authority in one of the poorest parts of Kent – which went in the opposite direction to Conservative-controlled Kent county council by saying it would provide free school meals during half-term to 6,000 eligible children. Amid the backlash over its position on free school meals, the government has announced that it is extending its lockdown policy of allowing families to access 30 hours of free childcare even if their income drops below the minimum income threshold. The policy of allowing access to support from the 30 free hours and/or tax-free childcare had been introduced by the DfE for those who were previously eligible but whose income had temporarily dropped during the pandemic. Parents are returning to their formal childcare settings, according to the DfE, which said attendance for early years settings was now at 86% of pre-coronavirus daily levels. ",education
"The volunteers at Hillingdon Crisis Support Service in north-west London did not get much sleep over the weekend. The team of 10 have been working around the clock to get a week’s worth of lunches ready for children over half-term. The widespread anger at the government’s decision to refuse to provide 1.4 million disadvantaged children in England with £15 a week in food vouchers during holidays is particularly acute here: many of the families being supported by the centre live in Boris Johnson’s constituency. “Where is Boris?” asks the food bank manager, Kim Brigdale, 55. “Have you seen any of them in a food bank? Can you see any of them trying to sort out free school meals for the kids?” She points to receipts posted on the fridge for goods that the team of volunteers have bought with their own money. “Where’s the government?” Though Labour’s attempt to get the government to provide meals for the poorest children – prompted by a campaign by the England footballer Marcus Rashford – was defeated in the Commons last week, local charities and businesses have rallied together and offered to help. Several local councils, including Hillingdon council, announced they would be stepping in to ensure children do not go hungry. But there is widespread frustration that it has come to this. Over the weekend, Hillingdon Crisis Support Service received a record number of donations following a call for help posted on Facebook and a GoFundMe page by one volunteer, Chloe Cole, who is studying early years education. The food bank, based in Harefield ex-servicemen’s club since March, responded to a growing number of families who desperately needed help to feed their children during lockdown. At one stage the centre was supporting about 25 families and a 50-room care home. While demand had decreased since then, it has started to creep up again. One brown bag contains enough food for five days of lunches for a single child, according to government recommendations: half a loaf of bread; the option of jam, chocolate spread or ham; cheese; 100g pasta with sauce; two packets of biscuits; one jelly spread; two packets of crisps; three types of fruit; and two yoghurts. There is a vegan and gluten-free option. Each bag costs about £4, which one volunteer points out is a fraction of what MPs’ can expense on food a day. For the centre’s co-founder Joanna Murphy, food poverty is an issue she personally understands. When her partner was unable to work after being involved in an accident, she was forced to go to a food bank to feed her children. She says the experience was so horrible that she left in tears, and vowed to create a welcoming, non-judgmental space for the families that slip through the cracks. “If we don’t look after each other, these children are not going to be fed, there are going to be parents that feel like they’re failures,” says Murphy. She describes Johnson as the opposite of Robin Hood. “He takes away from the people when he is supposed to work for the people. He is supposed to better this nation.” In the early afternoon, community champions from Morrisons supermarket respond to the Facebook callout with 30 lunches, which they will deliver every day this week. The team are delighted. “He’s [Johnson] not doing his job for the people. We are doing his job as communities, businesses, and volunteers,” says Murphy. Throughout the day, families turn up to pick up the free school meal bags, including a 16-year-old who collects lunches for himself and his sibling. Gemma Pugh, a 26-year-old mother of three, says Murphy and the centre provide an essential service, giving families food as well as blankets, and pillows. She is deeply frustrated by the vote against providing free school meals. “How much does it cost to give a child a school meal?” she says. “It’s a couple of pound a child and he [Johnson] can’t provide it, but he can provide this high pay for other people, but forget about the children that will be the next generation that is coming up in society. If we don’t provide for them, then what is going to be left in this world?” In Breightmet, an area of Bolton in Greater Manchester, volunteers at a community outreach group are loading up cars with bags full of ingredients for disadvantaged families to make packed lunches with during half-term. Set up by Dorothy Foster and Jean Barrass seven years ago, Reach Family Project would usually be helping families in the area with things such as money management skills, after a referral from schools or social services. But the team of five head out to deliver 50 free school meals packs – including bread, cheese, crisps, bananas, pasta and beans – which will help 250 people, off the back of Rashford’s campaign. “We only made the decision on Friday as a result of the government’s decision [to vote down the extension of free school meals],” says Barrass, 52, a former safeguarding lead at a primary school. “It’s been non-stop this weekend.” The effort is being run from the home of a volunteer, Angela Barry, which is situated in the former “red wall” seat of Bolton North East, where Mark Logan is the Conservative MP. Logan voted against Labour’s motion to extend the provision of free school meals. Barry, 33, says they are trying to stay “unpolitical” about the subject, and that it is “too early to judge if [the government] is right or wrong”.  But Barrass, who struggled financially after being widowed at 37 with two young children, says the decision had made her blood boil. “These are children, these are the future of our generation. [MPs] get everything they want on expenses. Their expenses cover the cost of hundreds and hundreds of meals.” The government grants that usually fund the group’s work did not cover the cost of the demand received since posting about the free school meals, so Reach has set up a GoFundMe page instead. But Phil Hart, 59, who became one of the group’s trustees after a 40-year career in banking, says the generosity of the public and local businesses alone “is probably not enough” to feed children throughout school holidays. “It shouldn’t be political. I’ve never gone to bed hungry so why should anybody else. We’re the fourth-richest nation in the world, this shouldn’t be happening.” Back in Hillingdon, volunteers who voted for Johnson before say they will not do so again. “When it comes to the next election, he’ll be out there asking everybody to put the little cross on the page. Do you think I will? I tell you what, I would vote anything but them.”",education
"Demand at food banks and child poverty charities in Ben Bradley’s constituency has doubled despite falling donations, with organisers describing the MP’s comments on free school meals as “disgusting”. Bradley wrote a series of tweets on Friday explaining why he had voted against extending free school meals for deprived children in England during the holidays until Easter 2021. He wrote: “At one school in Mansfield 75% of kids have a social worker, 25% of parents are illiterate. Their estate is the centre of the area’s crime. “One kid lives in a crack den, another in a brothel. These are the kids that most need our help, extending FSM doesn’t reach these kids.” Bradley then replied to a tweet in which another user said “£20 cash direct to a crack den and brothel really sounds like way forward with this one”, writing: “That’s what FSM vouchers in the summer effectively did …” Labour MPs have called on Bradley, who later said the tweet had been “totally taken out of context”, to apologise. At Sherwood Forest Foodbank, in Mansfield Woodhouse, demand for food parcels is “up to double” what it had been before the national lockdown in March, according to its client coordinator Jo Hays. She worries that when the government’s furlough scheme ends on 1 November, it could triple. “We see people on the frontline who are coming to us and they’re not from a crack den or any of that. The majority of people we see is as a result of the government lockdown,” she said. Hays, who said the pressure the food bank was under was “the worst we’ve seen” with families making up most new claimants, criticised Bradley’s stance as “misinformed”. “It’s: ‘if you want to do better you’ve got to look after yourself’, but there’s no jobs and people are losing the ones they had,” she said. The MP’s apparent “vilifying of people in Mansfield on benefits” was “disgusting”. On Wednesday, a satellite branch of the food bank will open at St Peter and St Paul’s church in Mansfield. The Sherwood Forest branch will have to stock both sites at a time when supplies are diminishing as the general public begins to feel the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis. “We have got money in the bank, but that’s not going to last long if we don’t get any donations. The stock we’ve got would last about a month and a half or two months,” said Hays. On Friday, Bradley invited Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, who has spearheaded the campaign for the extension of free schools meals during holidays, to visit a school in the Nottinghamshire district to discuss “why FSM is not the right approach”. But Clare Harding, headteacher at Asquith Primary School in Mansfield, pointed out that it was “ironic” that the MP had not shown up to a meeting with pupils from the school in Westminster in March, when her school was presented with a Kellogg’s award for its funded breakfast club. While she agreed that a “long-term solution” needed to be found to address the root cases of poverty, she said “that won’t help the children who need feeding now”. She added: “I have had children steal food out of lunchboxes because they are hungry.” During the national lockdown, the school ran a food bank for up to 25 families a week, and Harding said that this school year it had bought more school uniforms for deprived children than in previous years while the numbers of children receiving free school meals was rising.  Amanda Fisher, 50, who helps to run School’s Out for Summer Mansfield, which works with schools in the area to provide food vouchers to families with donations from the public, said demand there had doubled in the past four months. The community organisation was providing for 200 children who had been flagged by their school for extra support in July, but the number has risen to 400. “Over Christmas we could be looking at 600-plus,” Fisher said. She said delays to universal credit claims, job losses and zero-hours contracts were fuelling the demand. “We’ve worked so hard as a group to not make these people feel ashamed that they have to come to us,” she said. “But [Bradley] has basically said these families that have got children on free school meals are not worthy.” Fisher, who has been on benefits and has claimed free school meals for her own children in the past, said that when she first saw her MP’s Twitter tirade she had thought it was spam. “I just cannot believe the actual mindset of this chap. He’s almost demonising children because of the circumstances that they might be in,” she said. “I’m absolutely appalled that he is my MP. He’s not a Mansfield lad, so that says it all. “He’s been quite well-off through his childhood. He can’t even begin to imagine what these families are going through, I can, because I’ve been there.” Among the schools the organisation is working with is St Edmund’s C of E primary school in Mansfield Woodhouse. The school also clashed with Bradley on Friday. In a Facebook post, the school stated that his comments amounted to a “stigmatisation of working-class families” and that staff “know the truth about families who qualify for free school meals and it is nothing like what he suggests”. In a response from his personal Facebook account, Bradley asked the school to “remove” the “partisan nonsense”, arguing that his comments had been taken out of context.",education
"Universities must act to eradicate discrimination against working-class students, including the mockery of regional accents, equality campaigners have said. A Guardian investigation has found widespread evidence of students at some of the country’s leading universities being ridiculed over their accents and backgrounds, in some cases prompting them to leave education. The analysis found discrimination against working-class students was particularly prevalent among Russell Group universities. The group, which is made up of 24 institutions, has a reputation for academic excellence. In a series of Guardian interviews, students past and present reported bullying and harassment over their accents and working-class backgrounds. Some said their academic ability was questioned because of the way they spoke. The Social Mobility Commission (SMC), which monitors progress in improving social mobility in the UK, described the situation as unacceptable and said accents had become a “tangible barrier” for some students. This week the Guardian reported complaints of a “toxic attitude” towards some northern students at Durham University. Last month the university launched an inquiry after wealthy prospective freshers reportedly planned a competition to have sex with the poorest student they could find.  But experiences of classism and accent prejudice are not confined to Durham, said Sammy Wright, the lead commissioner on schools and higher education for the SMC. He said the government body had spent 18 months examining the differing chances for young people based on where they come from. “We found an entrenched pattern in certain areas where social mobility is very low, and often the only way to grasp opportunities involved moving away from where they were brought up – to go to university or find jobs,” said Wright, who is also vice-principal of Southmoor Academy in Sunderland. “But we also found that social and economic disadvantage often hampered any chance to move out. Accent is a part of this, alongside cultural capital and social networks. In my own work in schools in the north-east, accent can become a marker of everything else, a tangible barrier – most of all to the young people themselves, who internalise a sense of social inferiority.” Wright said well-meaning university outreach teams were consistently failing in their efforts to reassure working-class students. “They promise their institutions are friendly and welcoming, but when that message comes in a home counties accent from bored middle-class students who have been sent into the north to deliver the message, my students are rightly sceptical.” The Sutton Trust, a charity that helps young people from disadvantaged backgrounds access higher education, called on top universities to do more to ensure an inclusive and supportive environment for all undergraduates.  Sir Peter Lampl, the trust’s founder and chair, described the experiences of some students as “scandalous”. “It’s really tough for young people from low-income backgrounds to get into top universities. For this and for other reasons, it’s completely unacceptable that they are discriminated against while they’re there,” he said. Analysis by the Office for Students (OfS), the government’s higher education regulator, shows that virtually all communities with the lowest levels of access to higher education are in industrial towns and cities of the north of England and the Midlands, and in coastal towns. For example, the most recent data shows that 55% of young people in London go into higher education but only 40% in the north-east. The OfS director for fair access and participation, Chris Millward, said the issue of accent prejudice spoke to deeper inequalities in the education system. “It is crucial that universities strive to create an open and inclusive culture for all. There is no such thing as a ‘right’ accent or background for higher education – all students deserve the opportunity to thrive, no matter where they come from,” he said. Sara Khan, a vice-president of the National Union of Students, said working-class students were sold a “myth of meritocracy”, but in some cases the reality was starkly different. “As long as working-class students have to pay for education, work alongside their studies to cover basic necessities, and are saddled with debt for the rest of their lives, higher education will never be a welcoming environment for them,” she said. “It is unfortunately inevitable that in a system like this, such students would face prejudice and harassment, which is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the classism in our education system.” The Russell Group has been contacted for comment.",education
"England and Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has locked horns with Tory MPs in a Twitter row over the footballer’s campaign to extend free school meals (FSM) to cover holidays. Fresh from scoring Manchester United’s winning goal against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday evening, Rashford told his followers he would be paying close attention to the FSM vote in the Commons on Wednesday and “to those who are willing to turn a blind eye to the needs of our most vulnerable children”. His message was repudiated by former Brexit minister Steve Baker, while Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted “extending freebies are a sticking plaster not a solution”. Rashford, who recently became an MBE in the Queen’s birthday honours list, has been widely praised for his intervention on tackling food poverty among children. However, Baker rejected the footballer’s suggestion that anyone would be turning a blind eye and flagged up the risks to the economy. Labour will use an opposition day debate in the Commons to call a vote on the issue, with a motion: “That this house calls on the government to continue directly funding provision of free school meals over the school holidays until Easter 2021 to prevent over a million children going hungry during this crisis.” In a post on Twitter, Rashford said: To which Baker responded: “No one will be turning a blind eye and it is wrong to suggest anyone would. Not destroying the currency with excessive QE [quantitative easing] is also one of our duties.” Then when Rashford asked Baker to turn on his comments and let him respond, Baker countered: “You have 3.4M followers Marcus, to my 96K. The power is yours here. Everyone knows feeding hungry children is a top priority. I’d like to see UC [universal credit] boosted. But if the economy and currency collapse, the poor will be devastated. Alleging a blind eye is just wrong.” Undeterred, Rashford also took issue with Bradley, who tweeted: “Gov has lots of responsibilities: supporting the vulnerable, helping people to help themselves, balancing the books. Not as simple as you to make out Marcus. Extending FSM to sch hols passes responsibility for feeding kids away from parents, to the State. It increases dependency.” Rashford responded: “Ben, the economy already pays a high price for child hunger. If children were fed properly you would increase educational attainment and boost life chances. @KelloggsUKI calculated we would spend at least £5.2M a year on lost teaching hours as teachers are caring for hungry kids.” According to research by Labour, almost a million children living in areas in England that are subject to tier 2 and tier 3 enhanced coronavirus restrictions will lose access to free school meals over the holidays. Asked about Bradley’s comments, a Downing Street source said: “The prime minister thinks the free schools meals programme is very valuable, and that is why it was extended by the Conservative government. We’ve got a whole range of additional support to make sure that children and their families don’t go hungry during the pandemic.”",education
"An estimated 1 million pupils have signed up for free school meals in the UK for the first time during the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced many families to cope with a significant drop in their income. Around 1.4 million children were already enrolled on the scheme. We want to understand more about how the scheme is working for families who receive free school meals, and speak to those who have signed up for the first time during the pandemic.

"Students from northern England are being ridiculed over their accents and backgrounds at Durham university, and even forced out, according to a report compiled by student. Lauren White, who is in her third year at the university, said “At first when they mocked and mimicked my accent, I sort of went along with it, even laughed, but then when I persistently became the butt of jokes about coalmining and started to get called feral because I was local it started to feel malicious,”  We’d like to hear from students at other UK universities about whether they have had similar experiences.

"Among the many miseries inflicted by Covid-19, the cancellation of the school Christmas fair – that annual event that compels parents to pay £5 to buy back the toy they donated a week earlier – may not rank highly. But alarm is growing over the loss of this and other fundraising events hosted by parent teacher associations (PTAs) to plug the gap in schools’ finances. Research by the charity Parentkind shows its 13,500 PTA members have lost as much as £42m in fundraising in 2020 because of the pandemic. The figures are especially bleak given that over the past decade state schools in England have faced their worst decline in funding since the 1980s, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Meanwhile, coronavirus has heaped higher bills at headteachers’ doors, such as setting up online learning, hiring more supply staff to cover isolating teachers, and heftier cleaning costs. Some schools are also stepping in to feed disadvantaged children in the holidays. If PTA funds were buying “extras” before the pandemic, now they may have to cover teachers’ salaries and basic supplies. At Brookland infant and nursery school in Barnet, north London, the parent association used to raise an average £14,000 a year, says its headteacher, Brenda McCafferty. “We have always used it for projects such as a new toilet block, interactive TVs and a games’ area outside, as parents like to know what they are spending their money on.” This year, because of Covid, the PTA’s summer fair, Bonfire Night and cake sales have been cancelled, and the school did not benefit from its usual summer site lettings, leaving a £30,000 hole in its budget. “The government has told us that we can’t claim back loss of income, so we’re now forced to look at staffing costs. It is extremely difficult to balance the books. We will have to rely more on parental contributions and PA funding,” McCafferty says. Not all schools can ask parents for money. Carol Rogerson, of the support group PTA+, says the impact of coronavirus on PTAs “will definitely widen the gap between rich and poor”. She says: “I’m seeing quite a few PTAs in deprived areas say they can’t fundraise at all this year because they simply can’t ask.” Projects on Rocket Fund, a crowdfunding platform for schools, include an appeal to buy food for vulnerable pupils’ families and a £7500 request for the hire of 30 computers. In other schools, it is business as usual. “At some west London schools, fundraising is almost a competition as to who can put in the most money,” says Rogerson. “I know of a PTA [in an affluent area] that’s raised £6,500 from selling face masks, more than a lot of PTAs make all year. We always advise asking the local community and speaking to local businesses, but many of those are hard hit too.” PTAs are not, however, all unused bunting and empty collecting tins, and some have run socially distanced events. In Weybridge, Surrey, the Friends of St James’ primary school set up a relay race over the summer. “Any families that wanted to take part sent me their address and I plotted them all on a map,” says the co-chair, Daisy Huntington. “Each child had to run to the house of their nearest classmate, who would then continue the relay. People cheered from their doorsteps and the relay ended at the school gates. “It was emotional for everyone – the first time in two months that any of the kids had seen each other, or their teachers. And it raised over £12,000.” But most PTA fundraisers during Covid have been virtual. “Normally we do discos, movie afternoons, arts and crafts events, and three big fairs with as many as 700 people attending, raising £30,000 a year,” says Deborah Azagury-Slattery, chair of the PTA at Sinai Jewish primary school in Brent. “This year, it’s been a struggle, but we’re trying to be imaginative and ran a virtual family fun day, with online entertainers, arts and craft, raffle prizes, and bingo, which raised £4000.” At small schools, PTA cash can be even more essential. “We have even more things that school needs to buy this year,” says Louise Stiff, a PTA member at Plaxtol primary, a Kent village school with only 97 pupils. “We’re looking to fund things like technology to enable teachers to run online learning, new handwashing facilities in the playground and marquees to help keep the bubbles safe outdoors.” Her PTA, which usually raises £23,000 a year, brought in £3,500 from a virtual summer fair where children took part in sponsored at-home egg and spoon races, while animals, including a hedgehog, stick insect, tortoise and spider were entered into a money-raising virtual pet show (a dog called Dottie won). PTAs are increasingly asking parents to sign up to lottery schemes such as Your School Lottery to raise money, as well as requesting sign-ups to shopping affiliate schemes such Amazon Smile, and Give As You Live, where a proportion of sales are passed back to the school.  Kate Atkins, head at Rosendale school in Lambeth, says increasingly, PTAs are being asked to focus on children’s wellbeing. “Schools are being called upon to do more and more, for example on mental health and wellbeing, while funding has not increased,” she says. “So we rely increasingly on PTA funds to support children and their families to cope with the additional stresses they face. “These funds should be provided equitably to all schools via the government; however at the moment schools are having to use PTA funds.” Of course, the sweet spot is a PTA event that raises funds and boosts children’s spirits. At Harold Wood primary, in Romford, east London, the PTA is working on “a community Christmas Fayre – totally different from anything we have ever done”, says its secretary, Lindsey Philpot. “We will have pop-up stalls on people’s driveways instead of all crammed into a school hall. The children cannot wait.” 1 Distanced trails or a treasure hunt Organise for families to put a poster of a certain letter or image in their window, plot a map with all sites marked, and charge a few pounds for the map and a treat for the end. 2 Spare change challenge Give each class an empty bottle (the same size, such as a 2 litre drink bottle) and set up a competition to see which class can fill it with change the fastest. 3 Sell pre-packed crafts (such as jewellery making, make a soft toy with stuffing etc) where the PTA can buy in bulk and children can make something at them home over the holidays, or any lockdown. 4 Selling treats prepared according to anti-Covid hygiene rules in individually wrapped bags for children to enjoy at home, instead of the usual cake sales. 5 Non-uniform or crazy hair day. 6 Movie afternoon A Christmas treat for classes run in bubbles, either after school or during the last day of term. The PTA provides snacks and a film and parents are asked to donate in return. 7 Virtual Zoom party The PTA sets up an entertainer on Zoom and families are charged to join in. 8 Online raffle, auction or lottery Be careful, though, about licensing for selling virtual tickets to a non-physical event – see advice here. For help running a lottery there are operators such as yourschoollottery.co.uk. 9 Clothes drop-off scheme for families to dispose of unwanted goods, with proceeds going to the school.

"More than 200 children’s authors and illustrators, including Shirley Hughes, Philip Pullman, Malorie Blackman and Matt Haig, have put their names to a letter decrying the government’s vote against providing free school meals for children in England during half-term. This week, Conservative MPs rejected a Labour motion, inspired by the footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign on child hunger, by 322 votes to 261. Rashford has urged MPs to unite and stop being influenced by “political affiliation”. Published on Friday, the letter, which was put together by the children’s author Anne Booth, says: “Regardless of our individual personal backgrounds, political and religious positions, we all recognise the unique position children and their families have been placed in because of this pandemic, and believe that no child in this nation should go hungry this winter. “We believe children should not have to depend on pot luck charity, and there should be official, organised, government support across the nation to ensure no child experiences the insecurity of hunger as well as the stress of the pandemic.” Booth told the Guardian: “Caring about children is the job of authors. We want them to be happy, we visit them at school. We know hungry children can’t read or learn. I was so depressed by that vote, I can’t bear that children are going hungry. We’ve got billionaires and shell companies making money from this pandemic, and we can’t afford to feed children?” Booth said her husband, a former teacher, used to provide breakfast to his students, and that she frequently spoke to teachers about the issue of hungry children in their classes. “Hungry children can’t concentrate – and so immediately you are setting them on a path for the rest of their lives,” she said. “If this government are going to talk about feeding children economically, it is an investment to feed every child.” Booth said she had to close the letter after being inundated with messages of support. “I didn’t expect so many people were feeling so desperate about it. So many authors have told me they had free school meals. And writers are struggling right now, so there could be some who have hungry children themselves. There is not a small subsection of undeserving families who don’t feed their children. People are suffering in England in this pandemic. All children should be looked after.” Other signatories include the children’s laureate Cressida Cowell, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, David Almond, Joanne Harris and David Baddiel. “If more of those MPs read Shirley Hughes as children, they’d be much kinder people now,” said Booth. Several local authorities and restaurants have decided to take independent action, with Rashford sharing offers from restaurants across England. The London councils Redbridge, Hammersmith & Fulham and Southwark, and Liverpool council are offering to pay for daily lunches from Monday. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, is also offering 1,000 Co-op vouchers for children across the region.",education
"My father, David Cassar, who has died aged 71, was a dedicated educator and advocate for special needs schools. For 20 years he was the principal and chief executive of St Mary’s Wrestwood in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, which he turned around to achieve “outstanding” gradings from Ofsted, earning personal praise from inspectors. The children who attended had complex needs, including physical, social and educational. Most of them thrived during their time at the school, often against the odds. Many learned to walk, or speak, or read, with the help of the specialist staff. David believed their needs could not be met in mainstream education and advised the government throughout the 1990s. When policy changed to bring more children into the mainstream, he warned of the limitations and dangers. He was born in Paulsgrove, Portsmouth, one of eight children, two of whom died in infancy, of Maltese parents, John Cassar, a cabinetmaker, and his wife, Josephine (nee Sultana), who worked in a factory. They had come to the UK after the second world war and met in Portsmouth. David always considered himself Maltese. His parents’ English being limited, young David filled in all the family forms, and read letters and bills for his parents.  He attended St John’s RC secondary modern school in the city, leaving at the age of 16 to work in construction. Aged 17 he had a motorbike accident, which left him with one leg shorter than the other. He spent a year learning to walk again. His mother died suddenly when he was in his early 20s – he decided to change his career direction and went to Leicester University to study for a degree in youth and community work. He spent a year in the Bronx, New York, and came back to the UK to become youth and community worker at Impington Village college, Cambridgeshire. He then became the first youth and community worker for Waveney Valley in Suffolk. Deciding to train as a teacher, he attended Avery Hill College, Greenwich, in London, and in 1981 went to teach woodwork and design technology at Peckham girls’ school. In 1983 he moved to Burlington Danes secondary school in White City for three years and in 1986 he became principal of South Lodge in Hertfordshire, a boarding school for girls with emotional difficulties. There he was able to combine his experience of community work and teaching, and he thrived in the role. In 1991 he moved to St Mary’s Wrestwood, which at the time was struggling. He made it into a glowing success. After retiring in 2010, he sat on the bench at Hastings magistrates court, where he continued to influence people’s lives. David was a committed socialist, who gave me the Marxist manifesto as a 16th birthday present. He was a long-time union member and rep of the NUT (now NEU). When at the age of three I declared myself vegetarian, he soon joined me and became a vocal advocate for the cause. He married and divorced three times and is survived by his three children, Joseph, Jessie and me.",education
"The independent regulator of qualifications in Wales has recommended that all timetabled exams should be scrapped next summer, apart from a single paper for each A-level subject, as schools continue to grapple with disruption due to Covid. Qualifications Wales (QW) told the Welsh government there should be no timetabled exams for GCSEs and AS-levels, and that grades should be awarded based on coursework and a set of external assessments taken during the year. Schools and colleges in Wales should be given flexibility over when assessments take place with a number of “windows of opportunity”. The assessments should be set and marked by the WJEC exam board to retain the rigour of external assessment. QW said that dropping timetabled exams, under secure conditions, posed “some risk to public confidence” but it was a reasonable compromise, allowing schools greater flexibility and external assessments would be fairer than school-assessed grades. On A-levels, the regulator proposed that students should sit one timetabled exam per subject, along with coursework and other set tasks, with an additional “backup” opportunity to take the exam if a pupil is ill or self-isolating. In a letter to the Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, QW said: “The current public health crisis means that we cannot be confident that timetabled examinations will be able to take place as usual next year. We are, therefore, proposing different assessment arrangements that provide greater flexibility, without the need for significant additional contingency measures. “For the most part, our proposals move away from reliance upon timetabled exams and all of them include the ‘banking’ of some assessment evidence prior to the summer that could be used to generate results if schools were closed.” The single A-level exam would enable students in Wales to apply for higher education places next summer, alongside their peers in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where A-levels are being retained. Education minister Kirsty Williams will consider the proposals and make an announcement on Tuesday, 10 November, when pupils are back in school after the Welsh “firebreak” to reduce Covid transmission. The Scottish government has cancelled National 5 exams, which are roughly equivalent to GCSEs, and replaced them with teacher assessments and coursework. Northern Ireland is keeping exams, but has asked schools to keep evidence of pupil progress as a contingency measure. The UK government, meanwhile, has announced that GCSEs and A-levels will go ahead in England, but three weeks later than usual to allow for more teaching time and with some reduced content. Head teachers are calling for a rethink, warning that pupils have lost too much learning time and may be unable to sit exams due to illness or self-isolation. All exams were cancelled in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland this summer after schools were closed to all but vulnerable pupils and children of key workers because of the pandemic.",education
"One weekend in May, when Vicky Blake, the new president of the University and College Union, was supposed to be helping her father with some decorating, she realised she could not lift her arms. “I felt I’d dissolved from the inside out and there was just no power left in my body,” she says. It was the start of months of what her doctor thinks is long Covid, with symptoms including “brain fog” and total exhaustion. But with so many of her members terrified or angry about being expected to teach face to face on campuses where Covid is spreading, and her union fighting to force institutions to move courses online, this has not been a time to slacken off. Blake talks articulately and at great pace, stopping only to apologise that she may be rambling because she could not sleep again last night. She is spilling over with the personal stories she hears all the time – accounts from anxious lecturers, some supporting an elderly relative or with a partner who is immuno-suppressed, told to teach face to face. Stories about academics self-medicating for stress, or support staff bursting into tears on campus because there have been job cuts, and they can’t cope with the huge load on their shoulders. While the UCU’s general secretary, Jo Grady, is often seen as the “front woman” for the union, Blake feels her own job is to listen to the personal stories and spot the trends across the sector. “There is so much job insecurity that they are really frightened to speak out,” she says.  Staff at what Blake calls the frontline, who are teaching face-to-face seminars in rooms she says are sometimes not properly cleaned or ventilated, are frequently paid by the hour, or on casual contracts. She notes that many counselling staff, who are currently under crippling pressure, are now on short-term contracts. Blake knows first-hand how it feels to be insecure in academia. In 2013, at the age of 30, she was struggling to finish her PhD at Durham University while juggling eight different hourly paid academic contracts at Durham and Leeds. In the end she had to abandon her PhD and academic dream because of the lack of stability. When she took on the union job in June, she was working in a full-time support role as a widening participation officer at Leeds. “I never have finished my PhD and it’s a massive regret. But when I look at what I was trying to juggle it was just stupid. I’m not surprised I couldn’t do it in the time I didn’t have.” But it is not only university staff who are on her mind at 3am. It is the students, too, some of whom are joining the rallies she is hosting online from a quiet corner of her parents’ dining room. She tells me about an academic friend distressed by the faces of his online students. “He sees these faces that were so full of hope and now it’s abundantly clear how stressed they are. As the weeks go by the mood is shifting, and he says he can see the worry, the disappointment.” Another academic she knows is feeling wretched because, after hearing about students struggling to feed themselves, all she wants is to make home-cooked food for everyone self-isolating on her campus. Blake says she “vividly” remembers “the nervous feeling in my stomach” when, aged 18, she arrived at Durham from Somerset to start a degree in natural sciences. She was “nerdy” and had an eating disorder. “I was so scared that no one would like me and so relieved when I found my friends.” Like many students, she made some of her strongest friendships beyond her corridor in halls, and suspects she would have found today’s experience of living in a “bubble” with immediate neighbours very lonely. There are now reports of students killing themselves, Blake notes. While, sadly, mental health problems on campus had reached a serious level long before Covid-19, she is convinced some deaths are linked to the pandemic, with students, isolating in tiny residence bedrooms that were never designed to spend whole days in, let alone weeks, struggling with anxiety and depression. “Students should never have been placed in the situation they are,” Blake says. She argues that vice-chancellors have “sidelined the scientifically informed, serious concerns of unions”, in favour of “peddling the fiction of a Covid-secure campus where an only slightly modified experience was waiting for students”. She feels this misrepresentation is a missed opportunity – universities should have campaigned together, alongside unions, to force the government to give them a proper support package. Such support would have enabled them to tell students to stay at home, without the fear of a financial black hole if students deferred or dropped out, she says. Despite the UCU’s Covid dashboard this week logging nearly 34,000 positive cases in UK universities since the beginning of term, most vice-chancellors say the union’s position on shutting down most activities on campuses indefinitely is unrealistic. As one said: “Education matters. Covid-19 will be with us for at least another year – maybe longer. The question is: do we shut down now and watch lives ruined, or do we step up and find a way through it?” Blake becomes angry when she hears this. “That’s so patrician. To pretend you’re forcing people on to campus in a deadly pandemic for their own good, because they need to be learning to be independent and doing their own washing,” she says. “I can’t articulate how furious that makes me.” Her fury is, in part, because she feels universities are trying to portray her union as “a bit hysterical – and it is not lost on me that we are a union led by women at the moment”. The union’s campaign is based on far more than emotion, she says. New documents released by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, revealed that it advised weeks ago that all university and college teaching should be online “unless face to face teaching is absolutely essential”. “Vice-chancellors say they are being realistic,” she says, “but what is more realistic than looking at the scientific evidence, or learning from the more than 200,000 Covid cases in US universities and colleges this term?” She says the only debate the government seems to have any appetite for is how to get students home for Christmas. “They are deflecting from the current huge problems in universities by focusing on the holidays. It’s just crazy. Many students want to go home now.” With union branches balloting members on how the Covid crisis is being handled, the fight is only just beginning. “Staff in universities are exhausted. They are frightened about their safety and that of their students, they are angry and, overwhelmingly, they are disappointed,” Blake says. “But we believe in following the science. We are fighting for that and our students and our jobs.”",education
"England’s exam regulator Ofqual was riven by uncertainty and in-fighting with the Department for Education before this year’s A-level and GCSE results, with the government publishing new policies in the middle of an Ofqual board meeting that had been called to discuss them. Minutes of Ofqual’s board meetings reveal the regulator was aware that its process for assessing A-level and GCSE grades was unreliable before results were published, even as Ofqual was publicly portraying its methods as reliable and fair. The minutes also show repeated interventions by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the DfE, with the two bodies clashing over Williamson’s demand that Ofqual allow pupils to use the results of mock exams as grounds for appeal against their official grades. Ofqual’s board held 23 emergency meetings from April onwards. As the publication of A-level results on 13 August drew near the board met in marathon sessions, some running until late at night, as controversy erupted over the grades awarded by its statistical model being used to replace exams. Williamson wanted the regulator to allow much wider grounds for appeal, and on 11 August Ofqual’s board heard that the education secretary had suggested pupils should instead be awarded their school-assessed grades or be allowed to use mock exam results if they were higher. Ofqual offered to replace its grades with “unregulated” unofficial result certificates based on school or exam centre assessments, but that was rejected by Williamson. Negotiations over the use of mock exams continued into the evening of 11 August. In the middle of the day’s second emergency meeting the board discovered that the DfE had gone over its head with an announcement that “was widely reported in the media while this meeting was still in session”. The meeting ended close to midnight. During the controversy, Ofqual published and then abruptly retracted policies on the use of mock exam grades the weekend after A-level results were published, with three separate emergency meetings held that Sunday. Shortly after, Ofqual backed down and scrapped its grades in favour of those assessed by schools for both A-levels and GCSEs. The minutes show that Ofqual had serious doubts about the statistical process it used to award grades, with a meeting on 4 August hearing that the board was “very concerned about the prospect of some students, in particular so-called outliers, being awarded unreliable results”. The board’s members “accepted reluctantly that there was no valid and defensible way to deal with this pre-results”. But despite the board’s doubts, Ofqual officials continued to insist in public that its results would be reliable. Roger Taylor, the Ofqual chair, wrote in a newspaper article on 9 August that “students will get the best estimate that can be made of the grade they would have achieved if exams had gone ahead.” Ofqual also issued a statement on 10 August saying it wanted to “reassure students that the arrangements in place this summer are the fairest possible”. Separate details of meetings held between the DfE and Ofqual – obtained under a freedom of information request by Schools Week – show that Williamson met Ofqual twice in the two days before A-level results came out. Williamson held 10 meetings with Ofqual to discuss the 2020 results from March until A-levels were published on 13 August, while the schools minister, Nick Gibb, attended 16 meetings. The records also show that DfE officials held 55 meetings with Ofqual specifically to discuss the summer’s exam results.",education
"Thousands of Britain’s child-health specialists have joined forces to condemn the government for its refusal to fund free meals for disadvantaged children in England over the school holidays, amid a spreading grassroots campaign on the issue led by England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford. With a growing number of councils and businesses this weekend offering to provide free meals, more than 2,000 paediatricians across the UK have signed a letter expressing their shock at the decision. They state that ensuring children have enough to eat is one of the “most basic human responsibilities”. The letter, co-ordinated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and seen by the Observer, says: “Every day, we see the impact of hunger and malnutrition in our work as paediatricians. It is not unusual for us to care for children who don’t have enough to eat or who don’t have access to a substantial meal outside of what is provided in school. “We call on the UK government to match the pledges of the Welsh and Scottish governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, to continue to provide children from low-income backgrounds with free meals over the coming weeks and to then extend this at least until the Easter school holiday.” The letter praises Rashford as a “source of inspiration” for his campaign, which continued to attract a groundswell of support last night. Hundreds more businesses have signed up to help provide meals this weekend and scores of councils, including prominent Tory-led authorities, have agreed to fund local programmes. An online petition set up by Rashford now has more than 700,000 signatures, while Labour is planning to embarrass the government by holding another Commons vote on the issue. Russell Viner, president of the Royal College, told the Observer that he had “rarely seen such anger among our members”. He added: “We care for children who don’t have enough to eat. We see far too many of them. It is heartbreaking that it has become a normal part of our jobs and hunger is all too common for millions of families in the UK. There is an opportunity to put this right. It is pointless to talk about levelling up the country, an ambition which we support, while refusing to offer temporary relief to children and families.” The intervention comes amid frustration among many Conservative MPs, who want the decision to be reversed before the Christmas holidays. One senior figure said ministers were making a “massive mistake” by refusing to back Rashford’s campaign. Rashford’s successful campaign to provide food vouchers during the summer holidays is estimated to have cost £126m. However, other Tory MPs caused anger by criticising the free meals drive. Ben Bradley, the Mansfield MP, was accused of linking free meals with “crack dens” and “brothels” in social media comments. He said his remarks had been taken out of context. North Devon MP Selaine Saxby apologised after appearing to criticise businesses giving away free food. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, also faced a backlash for a withering response to a 16-year-old constituent who had questioned his opposition to extending free school meals. Ministers are also facing criticism after it emerged that schools in some of the most deprived areas of the country were told they will not now receive the laptops to help pupils learn remotely. Allocations of laptops for disadvantaged pupils have been slashed by around 80%. A Department for Education spokesperson said allocations of laptops were being “more effectively” targeted to the children, schools and areas of the country that have “greatest need”. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already extended free meals during school holidays until next Easter. In Northern Ireland, children will be given meals over this month’s half-term break. Official figures from earlier this year suggested 1.4 million disadvantaged children were eligible for free school meals in England, but that is thought to have increased during the pandemic. The concern among child health experts heaps further pressure on ministers. Dr Max Davie, officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “We’re a rich country. We shouldn’t have to fight for food vouchers when we’re in the middle of a pandemic.” Dr Liz Whittaker, consultant paediatrician at St Mary’s Hospital, London said: “Missing meals isn’t just about going hungry on an individual day, it has a lasting impact on a young person’s life. It is impossible to justify any argument that this saves the state money.” Meanwhile, Covid cases continue to mount. A further 23,012 positive tests were announced on Saturday, along with 174 more deaths. A further 1,139 were admitted to hospital. Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, called on the government to rethink and overhaul food provision for poor children. “The government has got to sort this,” he said. “They need to sit down with people like Marcus Rashford and his taskforce, which has got some of the biggest food companies involved. They need to set out a long-term plan to combat child food hunger, not only looking at rolling out free school meal vouchers at Christmas temporarily during the coronavirus pandemic, but also rolling out breakfast clubs, introducing a holiday activities programme, and examining [the level of support in] universal credit.” Late on Saturday, former children’s minister Tim Loughton became the latest Tory to call on the government to change course. “I will now lobby ministers to reverse this decision for the Christmas break,” he said. However, ministers insisted that there was a “better way” to deal with the issue of child hunger. Baroness Barran, the civil society minister, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “The government has made over £200bn available to protect people’s incomes and people’s livelihoods. We have worked very closely with charities who operate food banks across the country. There are different approaches to how we do this but we have used all the levers possible to try to make sure that people are safe and well as we go forward. “We have provided more money through universal credit, we have provided more money to local authorities and we believe that is a better way of approaching this problem.”",education
"A quarter of nurseries and childminders in deprived areas of England say they will not get by beyond Christmas without additional income, according to a survey. The poll by the Early Years Alliance (EYA) found that low demand for places and inadequate government support during the Covid pandemic could result in mass closures of childcare facilities. Overall about one in six providers said they could close by Christmas, and just over half said they would require emergency funding to stay open over the next six months. Nearly two-thirds said the government had not provided adequate support during the coronavirus crisis, and only a quarter expected to make any profit between now and March. Mumsnet’s CEO and founder, Justine Roberts, said that without affordable childcare some parents would be unable to work, and she called on the government to intervene as a matter of urgency. “This has been a disastrous nine months for maternal employment and women have also borne the brunt of school and nursery closures during lockdown,” she said. “Many families just will not be able to cope without nurseries and early years settings.” The poll of 2,000 childcare providers found an average fall of 21% in occupancy levels compared with last year. The government says it is supporting the sector by “bulk-buying” early years places, but the EYA says in many cases the money is not reaching the frontline.  Neil Leitch, the EYA chief executive, said many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders were reaching the point of no return. “There is absolutely no excuse for the government’s continued indifference towards the early years sector,” he said. “It claims that children’s access to education during the pandemic is a top priority, and yet it is apparently perfectly happy to see thousands of early education providers fall by the wayside.” Michelle Angus of CheekieChops Childminding, based in Sunderland, said: “I childmind children from six months old to 12 years old. In March, I had 45 children on my books, but today I have 18. I have just done my accounts and have lost three-quarters of income compared with this time last year. I have had to end the employment of one assistant and reduce the hours of other assistants already.” Sharon Brayer, the manager of Busy Bees pre-school in New Milton, Hampshire, said: “Busy Bees has been running for 28 years and we do not know how much longer we will be open. New children have not taken up their places. We lost money during lockdown and still are. Staff are suffering with mental health issues. If we had more financial support to sustain us, it would be one less thing to worry about.” The EYA is calling for an emergency early years sufficiency fund for childcare providers at risk of closure, which the research analysts Ceeda estimate would cost £240m over the next six months. A Department for Education spokesperson said nurseries, pre-schools and childminders had already received significant financial support over the past months and would further benefit from the government’s 2020/1 funding package of £3.6bn for free early education and childcare places. Judith Blake, the chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said: “It is essential that we have enough childcare places to support families to ensure the country can recover from Covid-19, both economically and socially.” Tulip Siddiq, the shadow minister for children and early years, said Labour had been saying for months that the childcare sector was on the brink of collapse. “Today we learn that this collapse is now imminent and set to begin just as families enter the toughest winter for a generation. As ever, this will hit the most deprived communities hardest,” she said. “Urgent action is needed by the government to save the nurseries and childminders that working parents and children rely on. It is now or never to save the childcare sector, and it has to be now for the sake of our economy.”",education
"Warnings by the equalities minister against teaching key concepts of racism – such as white privilege – “as fact” risk having a silencing effect in UK classrooms, a teaching body has said. Penny Rabiger, a co-founder of BAMEd, a network representing black and minority ethnic school staff, says the government’s direction could be damaging. Educators say they are finding it frustrating that teaching about racism could be treated as controversial. Pran Patel, a former assistant headteacher who provides anti-racism and unconscious bias training to UK schools, says: “White privilege is straightforward: white people don’t deal with racialised systemic discrimination. That’s the reality of the society we live in. “The consequences of white privilege are there to see: the pay gap for black and minority ethnic people, the fact black people are 40 times more likely to be stopped and searched and more likely to be sectioned. Saying we need to be really balanced about that, I find problematic.” This year, following the death of George Floyd in America and Black Lives Matter protests across the globe, many UK headteachers, who had slumbered on the issue of racism, have been sharply awoken, while their students confidence to speak out has been boosted by high-profile support and petitions for more representative curriculums. However, just as schools were implementing new anti-bullying policies and curriculums to include black perspectives, in October the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, warned that teaching about white privilege “as fact” without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views would be breaking the law. Invoking the 1996 Education Act, which forbids the promotion of partisan political views, Badenoch, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, said schools that “openly support the anti-capitalist Black Lives Matter group” were in contravention of their “statutory duty to be politically impartial”. What does this mean for teachers? If a GCSE student comes across the work of Richard Delgado or Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, scholars in critical race theory, should a teacher steer clear of their questions? After all, Badenoch said, “this government stands unequivocally against critical race theory”. Or if a year 6 student finds something about white privilege on Instagram, should teachers be explaining it as a reality – or as a “contested political idea”, in Badenoch’s words? Rabiger says: “The minister’s remarks could have a silencing effect. The risk of what she has said is a bit like section 28 and gay rights, where you’re not allowed to be seen to be ‘promoting’ a particular view. This is scaring people away from the trickier questions. I would have no problem teaching about white privilege. As long as you’re teaching about the social factors and being balanced, that’s not against the law.” Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, brought in by Margaret Thatcher’s government, banned the “promotion” of homosexuality and “acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. This had a chilling effect on teachers. Critics said the legislation “cast a cloud of confusion and ambiguity” and many schools opted simply never to discuss homosexuality. It was repealed in 2003. Teachers do need to be equipped for the toughest questions, says Rob Carpenter, chief executive at the Inspire Partnership, an academy trust with nine primary schools across south London and Kent. He and his team decided to “frame our leadership meetings around different books, like Hashi Mohamed’s People Like Us, or Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge. “We take a chapter and that then turns into a discussion about ‘what does that mean for us?’” he says. The idea is for staff to engage in some of the trickiest conversations among themselves first, so they feel more prepared heading into the classroom. These texts tackle issues such as white privilege. But what about teaching it to kids? “We wouldn’t explicitly teach about white privilege in a non-contextual way, but we would approach the theme of social justice and equity within the context of a historical period,” Carpenter says. In June, 12 days after the death of George Floyd, Omie Elizabeth Dale published an open letter to Stanground academy, in the largely white city of Peterborough, about her schooldays there.  It detailed shocking instances of racism, including students saying “n***** lips” and “gorilla fingers”, while some teachers laughed at jokes about catching Ebola in Africa or appeared to endorse xenophobic and Islamophobic sentiment. The real issue, says Dale’s letter, was the school’s passivity. “I remember when a large number of students were planning to go on an EDL [English Defence League] march. While they were not allowed to in the end, there was no attempt to understand why they wanted to go.” Dale, who left the school in 2013 and now works in public relations, says: “My letter mainly came from a place of thinking there will be students who may be experiencing the same stuff I had. I had a largely positive experience. It wasn’t really until I left that I was struck by my experience and what was tolerated there.” Wayne Norrie, chief executive, since 2016, of Greenwood academies trust, which runs Stanground academy among its 37 schools, invited her to speak to him and she is now the trust’s adviser on racism and has been asked to join the board. Dale said she was persuaded to get involved because Norrie “does have a real wish to improve the lives of his pupils in every possible way”. Norrie says Dale “explained to me what it was like to be black, walking into a white environment, and how that made her feel”. But he is cautious about quick-fix solutions. “What I fear is tokenism,” he says, “people rushing in and getting it wrong”. The trust is putting together a three-year plan, beginning with surveys to families this term. Some people in education back the equalities minister’s view that white privilege is a contested idea. Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, an English teacher and member of campaign group Don’t Divide Us, says: “I’m very much in favour of schools being places of intellectual inquiry, but what I am not in favour of is telling children they personally are racists or at risk of being racists or are personally oppressed.” She says her group has been contacted by teachers concerned by their school’s approach to Black History Month, or parents whose children have been asked to list the ways in which they are privileged. Cuthbert suggests a compromise for teaching the topics. “You could have a Black Lives Matter speaker in and a Don’t Divide Us speaker in. As an educator, you want to complicate things, not close them off.” Michael Brotherton, a lawyer in the education team at law firm Stone King, says: “Legally, context is everything and delivery is everything. You could have two lessons on white privilege, and one could be balanced and thought-provoking, and the other could be a monologue.” Where schools may run into trouble is proving the lesson was balanced. “Written evidence is always the best evidence. But the lesson plan would only get you so far, because obviously you could have said anything.” He concedes: “There is a risk teachers might run scared.” In her letter about her old school, Dale reserved her strongest warnings for teachers who failed to respond to her questions or proactively tackle racist behaviour. Her little brother is now at Stanground academy. She will be trying to make sure that his questions will be answered clearly by staff.",education
"Four out of five schools with the poorest pupils in England do not have enough devices and internet access to ensure all self-isolating pupils can keep learning, according to a leading education charity. The lack of equipment means schools were having to dip into alternative budgets and that it was the the poorest pupils’ education that suffered during self-isolation, Teach First warned. A socio-economic divide was also underlined by the finding that schools with the most affluent intakes were nearly three times (29%) more likely to use donations to pay for digital devices compared with schools with the poorest pupils (10%). The scale of the need for devices to facilitate online learning during the pandemic was “enormous”, said one headteacher, commenting on the survey carried out for Teach First. “At our school we soon learned pupils were using smartphones to complete homework rather than accessing the school’s online work platform on a suitable device,” added Kathryn Hobbs, the headteacher of David Nieper Academy in Derbyshire. “When it comes to schoolwork, a smartphone just isn’t sufficient – but the hard truth is that some families simply can’t afford the most appropriate IT equipment. For schools to continue to support all of their pupils throughout this pandemic, we need more access to IT devices, but looking into our budget, there’s not enough money to meet the need.” The survey – which also found that nearly three in four (73%) school leaders said they do not have enough digital devices and internet access to ensure all self-isolating pupils can keep learning – was based on data collected by Teacher Tapp, a daily survey app that questioned more than 8,000 teachers each day. Teach First’s chief executive, Russell Hobby, said: “It’s not right that some children will fall further behind at school simply because their families can’t afford laptops and internet access.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said it had purchased more than 340,000 laptops this term to support disadvantaged children. “By Christmas, this will be an injection of over half a million since the pandemic hit,” she added. This was part of more than £195m invested to support remote education and access to online social care, she said. “We are entirely committed to ensuring as many disadvantaged children as possible benefit from receiving a device this term, and ensuring no pupil, no matter their background, loses out on an outstanding education.” Separately, the DfE has asked schools that are not using 4G wireless routers that have been distributed to sign up for a scheme in which they can be handed back and “reallocated” to other pupils. Schools are being urged to sign up to an online portal to see how much data is being used by each router they’re responsible for. The details were included on Friday in an update to government guidance, which notes that remote learning equipment given to schools during the summer term was owned by local authorities and academy trusts. It added that those bodies could choose to transfer ownership of the laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers to individual schools or give devices to care leavers, or children and families with social workers.",education
"Sue Owen, my mother, who has died aged 70, was for many years a teacher in adult education, helping people gain a second chance to achieve qualifications or enter university. She went on to lead a teacher training unit for Manchester’s adult education service, and her final job after retirement was teaching English at the Wai Yin Society, a Chinese cultural centre in central Manchester. She was fascinated by foreign cultures and languages, and mastered German, Spanish, Russian and French. Throughout her life, she would always attempt to learn at least some of the language before going abroad, often to the surprise of waiters or tour guides.Sue was born in a British army hospital in Wuppertal, West Germany, the daughter of Eric Ismay, a British soldier, and Gerda Freitag, a German woman who worked at the British barracks. The family moved to the UK in 1952, but within a year Eric was posted to Korea as a UN peacekeeper, so Sue and her mother spent the next three years in the company of other German wives of British soldiers in a row of tin huts at the army barracks in Hampshire.The family moved house frequently as her father pursued his career. Sue went to seven different primary schools and quickly learned to change her accent as soon as she encountered her new classmates.In 1968, she went to the University of Essex, where she studied politics and Russian, subjects that helped feed her lifelong interest in leftwing, internationalist politics. After university, she moved to Manchester, where she started her teaching career, and married Tudor Owen in 1978. I was born later that year, followed by my two sisters, Rachel in 1980 and Siân in 1989. She gave the three of us a firm moral sense and a clear feminist outlook.She and Tudor were always hugely encouraging and supportive of their children’s ambitions, and, later, the source of irreplaceable help, advice, childcare and love when we had children of our own.After their retirement a decade ago, my parents threw themselves enthusiastically into language, history and art classes, volunteering for a refugee charity, travelling, spending time with their close-knit group of friends, and singing in local choirs. Sue loved to sing – especially Joni Mitchell songs, always adding her own improvisations to the melody.From 2015 to 2019 Sue and Tudor also cared for Sue’s elderly mother, and, after Gerda’s death, Sue organised a trip with other family members to find the site of the Freitag family farmhouse, once in Germany but now part of Poland. It was a powerful moment for Sue to locate its overgrown remains, along with the wooden church where her grandparents had got married and the town hall where her mother had worked at the start of the war.She loved the idea of living as far as possible in harmony with nature – as her mother’s family had done on their farm – and in recent years rewilded part of her garden for this reason. A voracious reader of books and the news, for over 50 years Sue would settle down at the dining table each evening to read the Guardian from cover to cover. She died unexpectedly as a result of an operation – a devastating shock to her family and friends. She is survived by Tudor, her children, and her grandchildren, Ben, Amy and Dylan, who adored her.",education
"The University of Manchester’s vice-chancellor has apologised for falsely claiming to have contacted the alleged victim of a racial profiling incident on campus. Nancy Rothwell told BBC Newsnight on Thursday she had written to first-year student Zac Adan, 19, to apologise after he was pinned to a wall by security guards who demanded to see his student ID. During the interview, she said she had been “very, very concerned” by the incident and had “apologised to the student for the distress that he felt”. However, she has since written to Adan to “sincerely apologise” over the claim. In a YouTube video posted by the university’s media team, Rothwell said the last few weeks had been “extremely difficult” for the university. “Last night, I appeared on BBC Newsnight. It was a difficult interview. This morning, I realised that one of the things I said in that interview, with good intent, was, in fact, incorrect,” she said. “I said that I had written to the student that was involved in a serious incident on 13 November. I found out today that, in fact, that was not included in correspondence to him. I am devastated that I made the wrong remark on national television.” She added: “I can’t tell you how sorry I am about it. I can only commit to the fact that I am passionate about this university, about our staff, our students, and our values, which, of course, include zero tolerance of any discrimination, and support for everybody within it, and I will do the very best I can to uphold those values, and to support our university.” Adan, a student of French and linguistics, said he was accused of “looking like a drug dealer” by the security officers after returning to the university’s Fallowfield campus from a visit to a local shop on 13 November. He told the BBC he had been left “traumatised” by the events. The University of Manchester, which is part of the prestigious Russell Group of universities, has suspended the officers involved and launched an investigation into the incident. Rothwell’s renewed apology over the handling of the incident comes after anti-racism campaigners called for her to resign last week. On Monday night, dozens of students took part in a protest on campus amid growing anger at the university’s handling of the coronavirus lockdown. The university has been at the centre of a series of controversies this term, including the installation of temporary fencing around the Fallowfield campus without prior warning, prompting demonstrations from students. The fencing, which was erected on the first day of the lockdown, cost £11,000 and was torn down by students. A small group of students have also occupied a university building to demand a 40% cut in rent at residential halls after most tuition moved online. A counter-offer of a 20% reduction from the university was this week described as “a slap in the face” by the University and College Union.",education
"As parents and teachers worry about school safety, Ofsted, the schools watchdog, will start a “phased return” to inspections in September, starting with all schools graded “inadequate”, plus a sample of others. Headteachers will get one day’s notice of the visit, which will result in a letter on how the return to lessons is going and what needs to be done, rather than a grading. NO, absolutely not. I accept that Ofsted must continue with their regulatory role, so if they get wind of issues in a school around child protection and safeguarding, they should certainly go in and deal with that. But a fact-finding visit in September would be ridiculous and pointless. The clue is in the name, Ofsted, which stands for the Office for Standards in Education. There are no standards at the moment for what education in a post-pandemic world looks like. There’s no need to spend millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on visits that add to the huge pressure on teachers coping with issues around integration and closing the academic gap. I also think we should be cautious about inspectors going into lots of schools and “bubbles” in September, talking to children in different classrooms and potentially spreading the virus. It costs a lot of money to keep inspectors on the payroll. I think they have had nothing to do during lockdown and want to be seen to be contributing to the debate somehow. And even though Ofsted have given assurances that they won’t judge schools, they will be making some kind of comparative judgment because Ofsted loves creating benchmarks and standards. I think they will put schools into some kind of database, and are being disingenuous about their motives. An Ofsted visit in September could cause way too much stress. Schools have the challenge of preparing to welcome back all students with a second wave of the pandemic on the horizon. We don’t know what the autumn term is going to look like, we don’t know whether schools are going to go into local lockdowns, and we don’t know how much trauma our students have suffered. Headteachers’ focus should be on how they can keep students safe and encourage health and wellbeing, while delivering a programme of learning that won’t be impacted too much by any further disruption. They shouldn’t be thinking about whether they are prepared for an Ofsted visit.  If the purpose of the visit is to do safeguarding checks and to assess the welfare and the wellbeing of the students, I would be in favour – as long as the inspectors come up with helpful suggestions and offer support. Schools have tried their hardest to rise up to the challenge. I would like to see Ofsted bringing solutions, not judging and criticising. YES. Ofsted will look at how schools are getting pupils back up to speed and help school leaders through collaborative conversations, without passing judgments. The visits will not be graded and Ofsted will publish the outcome of discussions with leaders so parents can understand what steps have been taken to help their children back into full-time education. Schools should not be frightened of these visits. Personally, I would embrace the idea and say: come and look at the good stuff that we’ve been doing and let’s share that across the country. If there have been schools that haven’t been able to provide the standard of education they would like, then maybe they can get advice and guidance. Ofsted can share information with leaders about what they have learned from visits to other schools. We need to focus on academic performance as well as pupils’ social and mental health. You can’t separate the two. If you have children who are supported with their mental health but not supported academically, it stores up problems for later on. A lot has been made of the amount of online learning provided by private schools compared with some state schools. If this is because a state school does not have sufficient resources, Ofsted could help support the case for increased funding. If schools aren’t funded enough to have been able to provide materials and laptops in lockdown, then the public and parents need to know that was not the fault of the school. So I would urge school leaders to actually volunteer to have one of these visits. Having Ofsted write about the provision in place will help to show a positive picture of the situation in the vast majority of schools in England. It should also help to raise provision for all children in all schools. YES. We could be going in and out of lockdown for a while and I think there should still be accountability for schools during that period. There’s a potential for education to be really disrupted. I think there’s a place for Ofsted to see what schools are up to and check they are delivering the curriculum, both online and face-to-face. It’s also important that standards are maintained during the September restart. There is a role for Ofsted to check that all schools are doing what is expected of them. But I think it should just be a light-touch visit, checking how things are going and the curriculum schools are teaching, and getting parents’ feedback. Constructive guidance about where a school is falling down and explaining what needs to be done to address that could be very helpful. NO. In principle, I would support Ofsted going in to check that schools have got the support they need. But I don’t want headteachers and governors getting prepared for the box-ticking exercise that I think an Ofsted inspection often is. I think pupils and staff need some time in September to see where the land lies. Going in to check on failing schools won’t be helpful. If Ofsted had concerns about a school before Covid hit, what opportunity do they think those schools have had to put things right? They haven’t had the chance to do anything. Instead of thinking about Ofsted, I want schools to be able to concentrate on making sure everyone is feeling emotionally and physically safe, including the staff.",education
"My father, Robert Cundall, who has died aged 92, took up the chair of chemistry at the University of Salford in 1975, and he formed a new Department of Biochemistry there in 1980. In 1985 he moved to the MRC Radiobiology Unit at Harwell, Oxfordshire, where he collaborated in work on energy migration in DNA until his retirement in 1992. Over the course of his career, Bob worked with research students, postdocs and collaborators in the UK and overseas on a wide range of topics, including photo- and radiation chemistry, free radicals, explosives, the kinetics of polymerisation and pyrolysis and fluorescence spectroscopy. He published 164 scientific papers. Born at Barmby Moor, east Yorkshire, Bob was the only child of Edward Cundall, a seed merchant, and his wife, Clara (nee Deighton). He was educated at Pocklington school, winning the sixth form prize for science and an open bursary in science at St Andrews University, where he obtained his first degree (1950) and then a PhD in chemistry (1954). There he met Margaret Strachan, whom he married in 1952; they had two sons, John and me. He began his working life with ICI’s Nobel division in Ayrshire, which manufactured explosives, before taking up a research fellowship at the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa in 1953, then returning to the UK for a brief period as a Brotherton research fellow at the University of Leeds. In 1956 Bob was appointed lecturer, subsequently reader, in physical chemistry at the University of Nottingham, where, except for a six-month sabbatical as visiting professor at the University of Kansas, he stayed until 1975. He lectured in thermodynamics and researched into photochemistry and radiation chemistry with a group of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. He collaborated with Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds universities, Christie hospital in Manchester and the Cancer Research Campaign laboratory at Mt Vernon Hospital in Middlesex (where he studied the degrading effects of ionising radiation on biochemical systems including amino acids and proteins). From 1972 until 1985 he was co-editor of the journal Progress in Reaction Kinetics. In the mid-1960s he also took over Colonel Brian Shaw’s famous lectures on explosives, which he gave at the Royal Institution in London in 1972. Margaret died in 2004. In 2006 Bob married Betty Rouse (nee Scarborough) and they lived happily in retirement in Oxfordshire. He continued to follow the cricket, especially the fortunes of his beloved Yorkshire, and could recall seeing Donald Bradman bat at Headingley. In retirement he took up woodwork, and made toys for his grandchildren. He liked nothing better than sitting down with old colleagues and friends over a tot or two of fine Scotch whisky to reminisce. Betty died in 2019. Bob is survived by John and me, his grandchildren, Lucy and William, and a great-grandson, Lamayan.",education
"Boris Johnson needs an urgent national plan to get all pupils back to school in England from September, with an army of support staff, the requisitioning of public buildings and extra help for disadvantaged students, unions and cross-party MPs have said. As the government admitted that most primary pupils in England would not get back to the classroom before summer, ministers were urged to set out a comprehensive strategy or risk an “epidemic of educational poverty”. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had hoped all primary schools in the country would reopen four weeks before the summer holidays but was forced to admit on Tuesday that this would be missed because of the difficulty of keeping children apart and in bubbles of 15. Government sources said scientists were reluctant to advise the watering-down of physical distancing rules at this point in the pandemic. Another 286 coronavirus deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with the number of excess deaths since lockdown hitting 63,000 – a toll believed to be greater than anywhere else except the US. Announcing the U-turn in the Commons, Williamson said he hoped all schools could return by September but could not guarantee that would be achieved. New statistics showed that just one in four eligible children in reception, year 1 and year 6 returned last week, undermining Johnson’s plan to allow parents back to work to boost the economy. Teaching unions warned that a September start for all pupils should not be taken for granted, and called for a national recovery plan for education. “The consequences of Covid-19 are going to be felt in our education system for months to come,” said Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU). With fears of a second spike in infections, the NEU is advising the government to develop a national approach to “blended learning” combining education at home and school, with increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access. There have been growing concerns about the disparity in quality and quantity of online learning available to pupils since lockdown.  The union also suggested the requisitioning of local public spaces, including libraries and community centres, to reduce pressure on school space. “The scale of the challenge is immense,” said Bousted. “We need a national recovery plan for education along the lines of the job recovery plan.” A string of Conservative MPs – including the former education ministers Robert Halfon and Tim Loughton – called on the government to consider radical measures to help pupils lagging behind after missing up to six months of education. Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, warned there would be an “epidemic of educational poverty” without more assistance for those most at risk of falling behind. Loughton suggested catch-up schemes and mentoring over the summer using “National Citizen Service youth workers … or mobilising the many students who are now delaying going to university and will find it hard to travel or get a job”. Labour also called for ministers to consult unions, headteachers and parents on a new timetable for reopening, saying the government “need[s] to face up to the scale of damage this is doing to children and scale up their response”.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said: “The starting point for this needs to be rapid action to support summer schemes for this summer.” The SNP suggested England could follow Scotland with a plan for blended learning and use of libraries and council offices to relieve pressure on classroom space. Scotland has also suggested retired teachers could consider returning to the classroom. Williamson admitted helping children catch up could take “a full year and more”, but resisted the idea of summer schools. He said schools that were not able to reopen would be given “basic minimum curriculum requirements we expect them to deliver for all children”. If the need for physical distancing persists in schools, more staff will have to be recruited to teach smaller classes, potentially from the thousands of disillusioned teachers who have left the profession in recent years over workload and pay. About one in five teachers (22%) quit within the first two years, rising to two in five after 10 years. According to official statistics, just over half of primary schools in England reopened to more pupils from 1 June. Williamson said that figure had now risen to more than 70% of primary schools. Schools will be permitted to open to more age groups if they have space, but not all have the facilities to keep children 2 metres apart, particularly those in smaller urban buildings. Defending the government’s approach, Williamson said: “We believe this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer, we continue to work with the sector on the next steps where we would like to see schools that have the capacity bring back more children to do so before the summer holidays … We will be working to bring all children back to school in September … Exams will take place next year.” While Labour and the unions said the delay was right, the decision was met with dismay in some quarters, as the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, warned that children’s education was being forgotten while theme parks, pubs and shops were being allowed to reopen. She called on the government to come up with a coherent plan to make up for children’s lost education and show the same level of determination that led to the opening of emergency Nightingale hospitals and the introduction of the furlough scheme to save millions of jobs. Schools may have to build additional portable buildings or find temporary accommodation in sports halls or empty offices to accommodate more children safely, she said. “Some worry that the economy is clearly being prioritised and education is not being prioritised at the same level. From everything that’s been said, [children] could be going to theme parks and sitting in pub gardens with their parents, or they could be shopping, but they will not be in school. That seems to be the wrong way round. The risk is that children will get left behind in this lockdown. “Time has a different meaning for children – two months, six months is a lifetime when you are 11 years old. Like us, children are worried. They are worried about whether life will ever be the same again. Will normality ever return?”",education
"At this time of year, it’s the custom for final year students at the University of Birmingham to have their picture taken holding their dissertation in front of Old Joe, the red brick clock tower in the centre of campus. But Nathan Clarke, who recently finished his history degree, missed the photo opportunity when the coronavirus lockdown began. “Campus was shut before I was able to hand in,” he says. “I had to hand in my thesis online and was robbed of an Instagram post.” Like many of the class of 2020, Clarke’s graduation ceremony has been cancelled and replaced by a virtual event. “The end of university has been anticlimactic,” he says. “Not being able to celebrate is a great shame – particularly for my mum, who had already picked out her dress.” As term draws to a close, graduation ceremonies across the UK have been cancelled or postponed to the disappointment of students’ families. “I was the first person in my family to attend university and it was a big deal for my grandma, in particular, to see me in my gown,” says Kelly Williamson, who studies at Edinburgh Napier University. “We’d already paid for a hotel, so that added stress to the situation. My family members have some long-term health conditions so I don’t know if they will be well enough to attend the next ceremonies that go ahead.” Ruth, who studies Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, regrets losing the chance to say goodbye to her friends. “My ceremony has been postponed, but there will be a virtual ceremony this year. The gown hire company offered to post a cap and gown to my address to ‘celebrate your achievement at home’ – but my mum wants to attend an actual ceremony, so I’ll wait. I wouldn’t have minded missing it because it’s expensive, but it would be amazing to see all my classmates one last time – especially the international students who had to fly home.” Some students are still isolating on campus. Ruby Forrester, an English literature and religious studies student at Cardiff University, has stayed in the city with her housemates because she suffers from asthma and her parents work for the NHS. “Two of my housemates also stayed in Cardiff with me, which was a saving grace. We celebrated my housemate’s 21st by turning our bedrooms into fake bars and going on a bar crawl through the house,” she says. The lockdown has also disrupted assessments, with students forced to write dissertations away from libraries and to sit exams online. Bill Bowkett, who studies politics at the University of Kent, says his exams have been rearranged into 48-hour open-book essays to ensure students graduate on time. But Bowkett says the system is flawed. “I see why they have done them, but when exams are open-book, they are no longer exams. The level playing field has been lost. I am never guaranteed a quiet space at home, with seven people in total. My siblings are out of school and my parents are working from home. Not everyone has access to a reliable internet connection or technology that will enable them to access online resources. It will be those who are the most economically disadvantaged who will suffer the most.”For students like Ashling Sugrue, whose film and television degree at the London College of Communication includes practical work, the transition has been more complicated. “The crowning achievement of our course’s graduates is a short film. The lockdown hit on the exact week we were supposed to fly out to Spain for the shoot. Now nobody in the year has that calling card that the short film was supposed to be, so we’re all anxious about how we’re going to find work once the lockdown has ended. I’ve pictured my graduation so often and strove to get the best grades so I could really relish the feeling. Now I guess I’m getting my diploma in the mail instead.” Among the biggest concerns for this year’s cohort are their future job prospects; the Bank of England’s chief economist has warned of a significant increase in unemployment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Conor O’Brien, a history and American studies student at the University of Manchester, is worried by the impact of the pandemic on his ability to find work after graduating.  “I feel the inequalities of the job market will only be exacerbated,” O’Brien says. “The pandemic has shown the cracks within British society and only a radical overhaul will prevent millions of young people like me from becoming victims of a different type.”",education
"A leading teaching union has warned the prime minister that plans to reopen schools more widely next month fail to address that coronavirus poses a greater risk to black and minority ethnic pupils and staff. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, called on Boris Johnson to ensure that the government’s approach to reopening state education will address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME people. In his letter, the union leader requested urgent clarification from ministers that they would fulfil their legal duties under the Equality Act “to prevent further discriminatory impacts related to the transmission of the coronavirus”. Early figures on the incidence of Covid-19 showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were black or from another minority ethnic background, despite BAME people making up only 14% of the population, according to the last census. Roach said the higher transmission and mortality rates have provoked “a real sense of anxiety and fear among many BAME teachers”. He also criticised the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for its failure to address ethnicity in their recently published analysis of the risks posed by reopening schools. “We can’t have a colourblind approach to the relaxation of the current rules to protect against this major public health crisis,” said Roach. The leaders of Birmingham city council wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, last week calling for “further guidance … for schools with large BAME communities on the implications of reopening”. The council leader, Ian Ward, and the cabinet member for education, skills and culture, Jayne Francis, wrote: “The vast majority [of BAME parents] have stated that they will not be returning their children to school on 1 June [due to] their concerns on the disproportional impact on them as black parents if their child were to contract the virus and bring it home.” Jackie, a black British teacher at a school in south-east London which is due to reopen next month, said she felt like she was in limbo due to the lack of government advice on the specific risks the virus posed to BAME pupils and staff. “They have not addressed it properly,” she added. “We’re not being told what the risk is. Am I more vulnerable because of my age and ethnicity? I would like to have the evidence.” Carol, a black British agency teacher in north London, has switched from primary to secondary school teaching partly due to concerns that she would be more at risk of contracting the virus in early years education where children need more hands-on assistance. She said she had experienced symptoms of Covid-19, which she had been told were likely contracted from someone at school who was asymptomatic. She was also concerned that her son, who is teaching vulnerable children during lockdown, was at risk. “Sometimes the children were spitting and the school didn’t even want him to wear a mask.” The NASUWT said it was not satisfied that the government’s plans to test, track and trace the spread of Covid-19 were sufficiently robust to reopen schools. “It’s premature to be moving down that route when that infrastructure isn’t in place,” said Roach. Sue Harte, the headteacher of John Stainer community primary school in Brockley, south-east London, who has decided not to reopen next month, said she had received no information about test, track and trace. “I honestly have got no sense of where the government are with that,” she said. A Department for Education spokesman said schools should be “especially sensitive to the needs and worries of BAME staff, parents and pupils”, and consider if measures need to be put in place to address them.",education
"Monty Losowsky, who has died aged 88, played a crucial role in the establishment of the largest teaching hospital in Europe, St James’s in Leeds, a task he performed with the quiet authority, modesty and calm that were his hallmarks. A distinguished consultant, he was the opposite of the domineering caricature, slight in build with a gentle voice that lowered the temperature at tricky committee meetings and held lecture theatres silent so that everyone could hear. Never a bow-tie or pinstripe man, he was described by the author Alan Bennett, who became a friend when Losowsky was treating the TV presenter Russell Harty in 1988, as looking like someone who had come to mend the ward’s radiators. Harty’s hepatitis B proved fatal, but Losowsky’s persistent transparency with the media, in spite of initial gross intrusion, established trust and became a model for handling similar high-profile cases. My admiration for him, as a journalist, then became friendship.  He was born in the East End of London, where his parents, Solomon and Dora (nee Gottlieb), whose families had fled pogroms in Poland in the 1900s, worked in tailoring. The second world war played havoc with Monty’s education as successive evacuee billets saw him shuttle between 14 different schools. But the challenges brought out the best in him, and in later life he recalled the kindness he experienced in the temporary homes he stayed in. Once he found a bit of continuity at the Coopers’ Company school in London he became a star pupil there. Monty’s early medical career, after qualifying at Leeds University in 1955, included stints in Paris and at Harvard University in the US, where work in the celebrated liver unit at Boston City hospital set him on the specialist path in which he would make his name.  On his return to Britain from Boston in 1962, Monty became a consultant at Leeds General Infirmary and set up a clinical research unit into liver disease. He was then asked to look at the possibilities of extending teaching to what became St James’s university hospital, and in 1969 became professor of medicine there, charged with starting academic departments in the muddle of redbrick buildings around the city’s former workhouse. The project flourished and he helped to guide it until his retirement in 1996, in the process transforming the hospital from being an also-ran into its current eminence. He was dean of the university’s medical school between 1989 and 1994 and appeared in Jimmy’s, ITV’s “real life soap opera”, which ran from 1987 to 1997 and added to the hospital’s fame. He wrote more than 350 research papers, served as president of the British Society for Gastroenterology, and helped to found the Coeliac Society, now Coeliac UK. Retirement did not end his devotion to Jimmy’s: he played a crucial role in the creation of the Thackray Medical Museum there, which was based on the hospital campus. Monty’s other interests included bold DIY projects and conducting history tours around St James’s.  He is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Malkin), a teacher of deaf children whom he married in 1971, daughter Kate and son Andrew.",education
"Melz Owusu has addressed research seminars, given a TED Talk and performed raps at academic conferences to try to decolonise higher education. But eventually the Phd student and former sabbatical officer at the Leeds University union came to a realisation: “I was like, hmm, this idea of transforming the university from the inside and having a decolonised curriculum isn’t going to happen with the way the structures of the university are.”  After listening to the experiences of black students, Owusu began to see the problem was that universities are “built on colonisation – the money, buildings, architecture – everything is colonial”. This sparked the idea of a Free Black University to “redistribute knowledge” and place black students and a decolonised curriculum at its heart, rather than as an add-on. A GoFundMe campaign launched to finance the project has raised more than £60,000 since being set up this month, and won backing from both the University and College Union and National Union of Students. Owusu, who studied politics and philosophy at Leeds and will start a PhD in epistemic justice at the University of Cambridge in October, is “super-excited” at the success of the fundraising campaign, which aims to raise £250,000 to get the project up and running by the autumn. Most of the money so far has come from large numbers of individual donations, ranging from £5 up to a few hundred pounds, with larger sums gathered through fundraising events. A key aim, however, is to persuade universities to “redistribute” money to the initiative by making an annual donation. The Free Black University will benefit their students and the community as a whole, says Owusu. Campaigns along these lines by student activists have already started at Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan, Leeds, Exeter and UCL. Owusu sees this as a way not only for institutions to fulfil their promises to current black students, but as payback for the role they have played in the progress of racism, from benefiting from donations by slave owners to developing the study of eugenics. “A lot of universities we have seen with Black Lives Matter have been putting out statements about ‘we’re in support of black lives’ but we hear from black students all the time that they leave university traumatised,” says Owusu. “They fail. They experience racism all the time and the university doesn’t necessarily deal with that in the best way, or deal with it at all.” The idea for the free university had been brewing for a while but the recent surge of interest in Black Lives Matter, following the death of George Floyd, has brought it to a head, says Owusu. “It feels like there is a growth of collective understanding of how deeply racism is entrenched in our society and realising how little has been done to challenge that at the core. “We decided to launch it at this moment because, one, it was ready to be launched and, two, the world’s eyes are on how do we actually make black lives matter, and one of the ways I think that will happen is through transformative education.” A small team of PhD students, recent graduates and student activists is putting together the project with the aim of having a legal structure in place before October. The plan is to deliver open-access online lectures exploring radical and transformational topics, build an online library of radical readings, develop a journal and podcast, provide a members’ space for black academics who need support, and hold an annual conference bringing together black radical thinkers. The curriculum will be centred around sociological, historical and philosophical approaches to black liberation but could move into more scientific and creative areas. Eventually, applying for degree-awarding powers may be an option, so long as those involved feel it is possible to do without becoming institutionalised. An important element of the project will be a space of community and care for black students, connecting them with black therapists, counsellors and community healers to offer a range of support. Members of black and minority-ethnic communities are at greater risk of developing mental health conditions, with some research suggesting that experiencing racism can increase the chances of developing depression. In the longer term, with enough money, the aim is to have a physical hub including teaching rooms, a bookshop, restaurant and healing areas in one of London’s most diverse neighbourhoods, such as Brixton or Lewisham. While other races will be able to benefit from the open-access resources provided, the main focus of the project will be the black community, to make up for the fact, Owusu says, that “black students and the black community in general have not been able to access the current spaces that are within academia in a fair and consistent and safe way”. There is plenty of evidence to back this up. Figures published last year by the Office for Students showed white students were much more likely to be awarded first class or upper second class degrees than black students, with the gap between the two groups 20 percentage points or more in nearly half the universities in England. Earlier this month, freedom of information requests revealed that only a fifth of UK universities had committed to decolonising their curriculum and only 1% of professors at UK universities are black. Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, says: “The reason this campaign is really important and has received so much support, particularly from black scholars and students in academia, is they know how difficult it is and how damaging it is for your own sense of self worth to navigate through a university system that is at best ambivalent towards you, and at worst openly hostile.” Fope Olaleye, NUS black students officer, says: “We welcome the Free Black University as it will fill a gap for black students within a sector in urgent need of change. “We would invite higher and further education providers to put their money where their mouth is and financially support it.” But Deborah Gabriel, founder of Black British Academics, a network of scholars committed to enhancing racial equity in higher education, is not convinced it is the answer. “While there is certainly merit in finding solutions to the prevalence of white privilege and systemic racism outside the present system, I think that the notion of a ‘free’ university is perhaps overly optimistic,” she says. “Sadly, nothing is free and therefore such a model would be unsustainable.” A more realistic response, she says, would be to establish partnerships between UK higher education institutions and the historically black colleges and universities in the US, which, although founded as a result of segregation, now tend to produce black graduates who do better than those from mainstream institutions “because of the sense of worth, value and belonging”. A spokesman for Universities UK says many institutions are already developing a more inclusive programme of learning, which includes reviewing their curriculums and reassessing reading lists, as well as conducting liberation or decolonisation activities. But Owusu argues a more radical approach is needed – a “reprieve” and a space where the black community can find “access to a curriculum and teaching staff where everyone looks like them”.",education
"Ivy league Princeton University has announced it will remove President Woodrow Wilson’s name from the institution’s School of Public and International Affairs due to his history of racism. In a statement released Saturday, the university president, Christopher Eisgruber, said the decision came after a “thorough, deliberative process”, five years after a group of student activists occupied his office in protest against the faculty’s dedication to the controversial 28th president. The removal of Wilson’s name from the faculty – which will now be known as the School of Public and International Affairs – comes as many institutions across the US are facing protests and campaigns over controversial dedications and monuments. The movement, which has seen statues of Confederate figures targeted as well as those of figures like Christopher Columbus and Spanish conquistadors, is part of a wide-ranging national debate over racism, sparked by the killing of George Floyd, who was African American, by a white police officer in Minneapolis. In a statement, Princeton’s trustees said they had considered “whether it is acceptable for this University’s school of public affairs to bear the name of a racist who segregated the nation’s civil service after it had been integrated for decades”. It was, they added, “a question … made more urgent by the recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Rayshard Brooks, which have served as tragic reminders of the ongoing need for all of us to stand against racism and for equality and justice”. Wilson is credited with improving educational standards at Princeton and he was honored with the creation of a faculty dedicated to public and international affairs studies, as well as a residential complex. While he is remembered as a progressive, internationalist statesman, Wilson’s reputation is clouded by his racist policies in other areas of government when he was president from 1913 to 1921. Wilson segregated federal workers in Washington DC, blocked a proposal to include racial equality as a founding principle in the League of Nations, and hosted White House screenings of the racist 1915 film Birth of a Nation, which celebrated the founding of the Ku Klux Klan. He was seen as accepting of brutal racial segregation in the south as a way of keeping the peace. In the New York Times in 2015, the lawyer Gordon Davis, whose grandfather was demoted in his civil service career as part of a systematic purge of the federal government, wrote that Wilson “was not just a racist”. “He believed in white supremacy as government policy, so much so that he reversed decades of racial progress. But we would be wrong to see this as a mere policy change; in doing so, he ruined the lives of countless talented African Americans and their families,” Davis wrote. In his announcement, Eisgruber said the steps – Wilson’s name will also be removed from halls of residence – were a necessary reckoning, but only part of the picture of dealing with racism, both past and present. “These are not the only steps our University is taking to combat the realities and legacy of racism, but they are important ones,”’ Eisgruber said, adding that he hoped the changes would provide “a firm foundation to pursue the mission of teaching, research, and service that has defined our highest aspirations and generated our greatest achievements throughout our history and today”.",education
"Class sizes in England’s state secondary schools have ballooned to their largest size for nearly 20 years as a result of last decade’s baby boom, which teaching unions say underlines the difficulty of containing potential Covid-19 outbreaks. Official data from the Department for Education (DfE) shows that secondary school rolls increased by 81,000 pupils at the start of the academic year, pushing the average class size to 22 and the average size of a secondary school up 2% to 986 pupils. Overall, the number of state school pupils in England rose to nearly 8.9 million, with the numbers set to increase again in September.  The government is preparing to ditch a string of physical distancing restrictions to meet Boris Johnson’s pledge that all pupils will be able to return to the classroom. The government is to announce next week that the use of smaller “bubbles” in primary schools – comprised of 15 pupils kept together with one teacher – will be dropped in favour of larger bubbles comprising an entire class. In secondary schools, the advice is likely to see entire year groups treated as one bubble, as suggestions that older pupils be kept apart within schools are dropped, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph. But teaching unions said the new data from the school census underlined the difficulties for schools with crowded classrooms. The National Education Union (NEU) said that nearly a million schoolchildren were being taught in crowded classes with 31 or more pupils, which it described as “shocking”. “The prime minister knew this when he stated last week, and again in the Commons on Tuesday, that schools must open fully to all pupils every day from September,” said Mary Bousted, the NEU’s joint general secretary. Headteachers are adamant that any forms of physical distancing for pupils and staff can create logistical issues. One noted that while secondary school year groups of pupils could be contained, in many cases teachers regularly taught across different year groups, exposing them to greater risk. James Bowen, director of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “These figures should be ringing serious alarm bells for the government. They point to a system that was already under huge strain before the coronavirus pandemic put schools and colleges under enormous extra pressure. “Parents too will be concerned by the number of pupils being educated in class sizes of 31-plus. The government needs to address this problem urgently and make sure that all schools have the resources they need to keep class sizes at a manageable level.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said questions remained about how sixth-form and further education colleges would operate. “We will want to understand the public health guidance which underpins the approach to full reopening,” Barton said. “This is important for the confidence of parents, pupils, and staff. And, as none of us know what the coronavirus situation will look like in September, we think it would be sensible to have a plan B if the conditions do not allow for a full reopening. “We would also caution that a full return in September will not be school or college as normal. There will be a raft of safety measures in place, and we all need to prepare ourselves for the likelihood that there may be localised full or partial closures if there are outbreaks of the coronavirus, and this may be the reality for some time to come.” The DfE’s school census also showed that 35% of primary schools were now academies, and 77% of secondary schools. The department announced that it was postponing the introduction of the new reception baseline assessment planned for primary schools in England in September. The assessment, which aims to gauge the abilities of children at their entry into formal schooling, has been delayed until 2021 “due to the challenging circumstances faced by schools in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic”, the DfE said.",education
"The eminent trade unionist Fred Jarvis, who has died aged 95, was distinguished by his lifelong passion and commitment to education. A president of the National Union of Students in the 1950s, he was the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers from 1975 until 1989, when it was the biggest teacher union in Europe. He was a member of the TUC general council from 1974 until 1989 and its president in 1986-87. It was his fate, having had the opinion formers and a large public on his side during the 60s, to have reached the top of the NUT during the Margaret Thatcher years, and to find that he had enemies. The years 1985 and 1986 were marked by highly unpopular teachers’ strikes in London. Within three years, with Jarvis still at the helm, the NUT had lost two of its main privileges: the ability to negotiate teachers’ pay directly with their employers, the local education authorities; and teachers’ de facto control of the curriculum, which was ended by the Education Reform Act 1988. But in a sparkling account of his life and times, You Never Know Your Luck, Reflections of a Cockney Campaigner for Education (2014), Jarvis portrayed himself as a fortunate man. He was born, and had a happy childhood, in a working-class family, in West Ham, east London, where his father, Alfred, was a screener in Spillers’ flour mills. His mother, Emmie (Emily, nee Jones), took the education of young Fred and his brother, Dennis, seriously, and an uncle who had married into the middle class stirred a precocious interest in politics. Fred escaped unscathed from the bombing of the East End during second world war and, a few years later, the fate of many of his army comrades who died while serving with him on the Normandy beaches. He himself was able to write newspaper articles from the dugouts. On being demobbed, Jarvis took up a cause he had been investing in since his early teens: rights in education. At Plaistow secondary school he had written an underground student news-sheet and when caught, changed its name from the Martyrs’ Own to Invicta, which got the headteacher on his side. In 1941, Spillers moved north to Wallasey, Merseyside. Fred’s ability to get himself noticed was quickly on show at Oldershaw grammar school and in the local communist fronted youth movements. He chose the one that did not have adults in charge. This was to lead to a local youth parliament and after the war getting himself adopted as the Labour candidate for Wallasey in the 1951 election, though he did not win. By then he was, however, already deep into student politics. He had become chair of the National Association of Labour Student Organisations (Nalso), with a seat on the NUS executive. This was while studying at Liverpool University for a social sciences diploma, from which he emerged with distinction. Accepted at St Catherine’s College, Oxford, he studied philosophy, politics and economics. It was there that he met Anne Colegrove, a future teacher and chair of education on Barnet council, whom he would marry in 1954. He decided to put politics before trying to get a first at Oxford. Shirley Williams, a contemporary, remembered a sophistication that made him a “man among boys”. Also by then he was openly fighting the harder left Socialist Society. Except in regard to Anne, a member of the Socialist Society, and thereafter always known as “Fred’s Red”, this was the cold war by proxy. A taste of the real cold war came soon afterwards, through the executive of the NUS. Jarvis’s initial interests focused on its role in the International Union of Students. He was a delegate at the 1950 IUS conference in Prague, Czechoslovakia. With the Stalinists in charge, and money rolling in from the KGB, the line was to support North Korea (“Korea”) and to expel the “Titoists”, the Yugoslav student union. Opposing these policies on both counts, the British delegation was treated as Public Enemy No 1, even physically taunted. While this gave Jarvis lasting friendships with leading Europeans on the same side, Olof Palme and Guy Penne (a future African emissary for François Mitterrand) among them, it was a struggle to get support from the NUS executive, not just to disaffiliate from the IUS but to help found the ISC (the International Student Conference). His presidency of the NUS, 1952-54, was marked by successful campaigns for student grants modelled on the grants ex-serviceman had received and from which Jarvis himself had benefited. He also ran an anti-discrimination case which was taken up by MPs. This, in turn, got him noticed by the NUT, to which he was recruited in 1955 as an assistant secretary. Four years later the NUT created for him, and pioneered for unions as a whole, the job of head of publicity and public relations. Jarvis fizzed with ideas. In 1959 he gained backing for a massive education and careers exhibition at Olympia, in London, under the patronage of the young Queen. He got her not only to be the patron, but to come in person. In 1961 the NUT supported him in putting together an independent commission on the need to invest in education “for national survival”. Its members were big names and the issues taken up in several later government commissions of inquiry. Then, two years later, dozens of organisations supported a non-party campaign to make education an issue in the forthcoming election. The case for comprehensive schools and raising the leaving age figured. When Labour won in 1964, Harold Wilson, the new prime minister, gave an NUT-supported lecture within weeks on education as embodying the hopes of society as a whole. And Jarvis continued to get significant support for the public interest campaign, the Council for Educational Advance. In the 70s the climate changed. The political debate on the vastly expanding education service turned to issues of economic effectiveness and accountability. The expansion of the teaching profession, which went with comprehensive education and the raising of the school leaving age – policies that fitted the NUT’s core strategy of boosting its membership and its bargaining muscle – were showing up some shortcomings in schools. The NUT was slow to notice that teachers were no longer the solution: they were part of the problem. The first signs of a public backlash came in 1969 with the Black Papers, launched by two academics, Brian Cox and AE Dyson, attacking low standards in the comprehensives. They were dismissed by an education establishment as the ravings of the New Right, and apparently not taken seriously by Thatcher in her time as minister of education or the new leader of the Conservative party. However, in 1976, the Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, reacted to the horror stories of out-of-control teachers by setting a new policy line. In a speech at Ruskin College, Oxford, he attacked the “educationists’ consensus that the curriculum was a ‘secret garden’”. This heralded the policy swing of the Thatcher years. Jarvis had just become general secretary of the NUT, the first non-teacher to hold the post. His famous luck appeared to be running out. While some of the Jarvis skills helped ensure a pay commission that awarded the teachers a big rise, his executive was split between warring factions of the left. Neither his bonhomie nor his persistence in finding the reasonable political solution could keep him off the defensive. It was also unfortunate that he was knocked down by a car and spent time in hospital when crucial decisions were being taken on the London teachers’ strikes. The Education Reform Act, which Thatcher’s government brought in, was a measure of how far the political pendulum, and public opinion, had swung. The act not only instituted a national curriculum. It diminished the professional status of teachers in removing much of their discretion. When he stepped down from the NUT, Jarvis seemed to be liberated to fight anew for what he saw as public interest issues in education. This included drawing John Major, then prime minister, into a relatively supportive correspondence on secondary schooling. He also believed he could sow some seeds for a future Labour government. From the early 90s he convened a group of educationists – professors, headteachers and local education authority officers – as “critical friends” of the Labour party, to develop its line on education. But in the runup to the 1997 election, Tony Blair followed the Thatcher model of distrusting the teachers’ biggest union and all who had been associated with it. The “Fred group” got nowhere near Blair or his advisers. But Jarvis continued to build on the opportunities his life provided. He pursued his keen interest in politics, education, Europe and, his great hobby, photography in pursuit of his political interests. This led to some great reportorial exhibitions. His unique access to Millbank during the 1997 Labour campaign encouraged him to unearth images of his 50s student politics encounters; and to continue with a series on British schools including his old “Plaistow Sec”, and his lifelong passion, the Hammers, the West Ham football team in whose shadow he had grown up. Jarvis was active in numerous public bodies, including the Franco-British Council and the council of the National Youth theatre. He and his wife were made honorary citizens of Sainte Cécile les Vignes, a wine-growing village in the Rhône Valley, where they had acquired a small house and were neighbours of Penne, their friend from student days. In 2015, Jarvis was appointed CBE, but on the day of the investiture, 14 July, preferred to be in France to celebrate the greatest day in the republican calendar – the start of the French revolution. Anne died in 2007. Jarvis is survived by his son, Robin, and daughter, Jacky.",education
"“It’s great news, to be fair,” said Chris Dyson, headteacher of Parklands primary school in Leeds, welcoming the government U-turn on free school meals (FSM). It’s an issue close to his heart – out of 360 pupils, 213 depend on FSM and holiday hunger is nothing new to his community. What was new, however, was that earlier in the day he found himself on BBC Radio 4 discussing FSM with none other than Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford whose intervention prompted the government’s change of heart. The government U-turn that followed has been warmly and widely welcomed across the sector. As a direct result, the families of about 1.3 million children in England will be entitled to a voucher worth £15 per week per child throughout the summer holiday, which will help alleviate the pressure on household budgets. The reality is, however, that the FSM scheme only covers a minority of children in poverty. Many whose parents are working in low paid, insecure jobs are not eligible and will continue to go hungry over the holidays. Campaigners say many families are already turning to food banks and with the additional pressure of Covid, the food crisis is only going to get worse. Holiday hunger may have hit the headlines in the middle of a modern pandemic, but the problem has been around for as long as school meals – creating the problem of how to feed the poorest children when schools were closed. Back in 1909, two years after schools were able to start feeding pupils, school authorities in West Ham in London’s East End fed eligible children throughout the Christmas holidays. It was morally right to do so, they argued, even though it was unclear whether they had a legal obligation to do so. “The weather was so severe and the distress so acute … that we felt bound on the last day of the ordinary school to announce that the feeding centres would remain open to supply those children who were already in receipt of meals under the Act,” TW Watts, the chair of the education committee, told the London Daily News. The issue arose again following the introduction of the Education Act in 1944. This made school meals a requirement – but was hazy on what should be done for children during the holidays. According to End Hunger UK, some authorities provided holiday meals in the 1960s and 1970s – but most did not. Holiday hunger periodically surfaced as an issue in parliament – if not a cause celebre championed by famous footballers. In 1967 the Conservative MP Dame Joan Vickers argued that holiday hunger “affects the children of the lower paid worker in particular” and that those on free school meals “should also receive them during the school holidays”. More recently, austerity – in particular rising living costs and shrinking real incomes levels for the worst off – has brought holiday hunger to the fore again, with food banks able to plot rising demand from the poorest families over each holiday period, and voluntary initiatives springing up to launch holiday meal schemes. About 3 million children potentially go hungry during the holiday, according to the charity Feeding Britain – one million of them on free school meals and a further 2 million who do not qualify for free meals but whose parents cannot afford to always buy meals, the children who have been labelled “food insecure”. Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Extending the voucher scheme into the summer will help ensure that we don’t see the hardship children are facing get worse in the summer holidays, but it only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals. “We are already hearing of soaring numbers of families being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.” Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, added: “It shows that the government is listening to the needs of vulnerable children. Of course this is really just the beginning. We think children’s food needs to become much more of a national priority.” Access to food during lockdown has been a particular problem for some families. Data collected by the Food Foundation on food insecurity levels during the pandemic has shown that among households with children, the prevalence of food insecurity increased from 5.7% to 11%. A month into lockdown, the parents of 2 million children said they had experienced one or more forms of food insecurity and more than 200,000 children missed meals because of insufficient food. After seven weeks of lockdown, 30% of adults with children eligible for FSM reported food insecurity, compared with 9% of adults with non-FSM children. While summer holidays have always had a negative impact on the educational levels of low income children, the fear is the additional effect of school closures will put vulnerable children at even greater disadvantage. New research has already shown there has been a nutritional impact on low-income children. A small-scale study from Northumbria University showed that children eligible for FSMs are consuming less fruit and vegetables and more sugary drinks during the lockdown than before. Extending FSM over the summer holidays will be a huge relief for many families, but others will continue to go without and campaigners would like to see a children’s right to food commission to help tackle systemic childhood food insecurity for the long-term. In the meantime headteacher Chris Dyson will carry on putting together food hampers for his vulnerable families and the wider community, distributing 1,000 tins of baked beans, 2,000 bagels and 1,000 boxes of porridge to try to stem holiday hunger, but he too is hoping for lasting change . “Holiday hunger has been around for the last few years, but it’s getting worse and worse every year as the gap between rich and poor gets wider. I know this is a one-off, but I think this could be the start of something special.”",education
"Campaigners have threatened to take the government to court over its decision not to extend its free school meals voucher system for low-income families over the summer holiday period. The national voucher scheme, which is worth £15 a week to recipients, was introduced in March to help poorer families feed their children when schools were closed under lockdown measures. But ministers announced on Thursday that it would not run during the summer holidays, adding that the government had “always been clear” that the voucher scheme would come to an end when schools close in July. Sustain, a food charity and the Good Law Project, a not-for-profit membership organisation, said that if an adequate alternative plan was not put forward in the next few days they would take legal action to reverse the decision in order to protect more than 1 million children at risk of holiday hunger Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, said hunger had no respect for term dates, adding: “Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, we have heard more and more stories of families with children struggling to put food on the table due to having too little money. The situation has got worse as parents lose jobs and income.” Jolyon Maugham QC, director of Good Law Project said: “Millions of families across the country still face financial hardship because of the pandemic. Yet the government still has not come up with a decent plan to ensure kids don’t go hungry. If they don’t, we will take formal legal action.” Responding to the government announcement, Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the General Education Union, tweeted:  The families of about 1.3 million children in England who are on free school meals qualify for the voucher scheme, which was criticised after some parents waited weeks for them to arrive and others were unable to use them in supermarkets. The Department for Education (DfE) said £129m has been spent on the scheme so far. About 5 million people in households with children have struggled to put food on the table each day during the coronavirus crisis, while a third of children on free school meals did not have adequate alternative options, according to estimates by the Food Foundation thinktank. The DfE hinted it may expand an existing programme of summer holiday activities and food for children from low-income families run by charities, though it could provide no further details. The programme covers just 50,000 young people in 17 local authorities in England. The Welsh government has announced it will continue to provide £19.50 per child per week funding to enable councils to provide free school meal equivalents throughout the summer. The UK government has changed tack on vouchers before, originally saying the scheme would not run during the Easter holidays. It changed its mind after an outcry by schools and parents. Vouchers were also available during the summer half-term. Andrew Forsey, the chief executive of Feeding Britain, a charity which operates holiday hunger schemes, said with the summer holidays just weeks away ministers would need to explain quickly how they would fund and organise an expansion of the current arrangements given the scale of demand. He said: “Ideally we’d wish for every family to have adequate funds for food but as that is not going to happen anytime soon we’ll have to formulate as effective response as we can. We are confident we could make a good fist of it.”",education
"The future of the early years and childcare sector is at risk in England, the Early Years Alliance (EYA) has said, as fewer than half of parents with young children plan to take up their childcare places on 1 June. Just over 40% of parents of under-fives say they will send their children back to nursery, preschool or childminders this week, according to a poll by the EYA of more than 6,300 care providers. A further 13% of parents say they are still “completely undecided”.  Three in 10 parents gave the government the lowest possible rating on a scale of one to 10, when asked how clear the government has been on the rationale behind reopening childcare settings. The average rating from parents was 3.9 – where one is “very unclear” and 10 is “very clear”. The results are so stark that the alliance said the early sector in England could collapse. “It is no exaggeration to say that the very future of the childcare sector is at risk if the government doesn’t get its act together and provide the support that providers need,” said Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the EYA, a membership organisation representing nurseries and childminders. “The government’s attitude towards early years settings has been frankly appalling,” he added. “It has refused to reverse its last-minute decision to restrict providers’ ability to access furlough funding; it has refused to offer any financial support to help early years providers meet the additional costs of operating safely during this outbreak, while providing thousands of pounds to schools for the very same purpose; and it has refused to commit to any kind of transitional funding to help the sector get through this period of significantly reduced demand.” The most commonly cited reason for not taking up childcare places from the 4,490 parents who responded to the poll was fear over their children’s safety. This was followed by concern over the safety of their wider family, and anxiety over the safety for staff and childminders. When asked what would need to happen to take up their place, parents cited a sustained fall in the number of coronavirus cases both locally and across the country, and more information from the government on the science underpinning the decision to reopen childcare settings. Some children in England are set to return to school on 1 June 2020 as part of new guidance set out by the government. Initially, this is limited to early years, reception, year 1 and year 6 children.  The Office for National Statistics estimates there are approximately 2.1 million children in the year groups, making up about 43% of all primary school children. The EYA also asked childcare providers in England if they planned to reopen on 1 June. Two thirds of the 6,300 responses said they were planning to reopen, with just over one in five saying they would not and 15% saying they were undecided. The online survey comes after more than 30 early years experts, parent groups and organisations issued a highly critical response to the government’s guidances. The detailed response by experts including Cathy Nutbrown, a professor of education at the University of Sheffield, and organisations including the Association of Educational Psychologists and the Association for Professional Development in Early Years, said the Department for Education’s guidance on reopening early years settings and schools did not provide a safe return for children and threatened their wellbeing and education. The advice, it added, had been “confusing, contradictory or unworkable”.  The government’s guidance, it went on, is “inadequate in addressing the health aspects of safeguarding children and staff, while wholly failing to consider the value or otherwise to the children of rushing them into a new and uncharted scenario with major implications for their education and wellbeing.” Samantha Bailey, from Cheshire East, will be keeping her daughter at home. “We feel that it is too early to be reopening due to the current lack of thorough scientific understanding of Covid-19. The advice given to government from Sage on Friday 22 May also failed to reassure us that the risks are minimal, rather that the risks are not fully known. The increasing number of children with pulmonary inflammatory syndrome in Europe is also a factor in our decision.  “Additionally, my daughter is a suspected asthmatic. We therefore feel it best for her to remain at home due to her personal circumstances. Until the scientific understanding is greater and the level of risk better ascertained with reliable track-and-trace in place (for the safety of staff), we will endeavour to keep our daughter at home.” Cristina Lopez-Bueno, from London, is planning to send her son back to nursery this week.  “I have concerns but as a working single parent feel little option but to send my child back. I am reassured that the nursery will do the best they can to minimise risk although there are still some unknowns. “On balance, I believe the long-term impact on my child of staying home for a longer period of time will not be positive and the attempting to work full-time at full capacity is extremely difficult to manage alongside his care, and in my view not sustainable. The pressure on both of us from this and the fact that we do not have a garden and it is just the two of us in the household is considerable.”",education
"An Oxford college has ordered staff and students to undergo training to combat racial bias after an undergraduate made a “joke” drawing a comparison between protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and flour shortages. The comments, described as racist and trivialising by witnesses, were made during a virtual hustings event by a candidate for the position of “cake rep” – a welfare position on the junior common room committee at Christ Church college. The student, who has since withdrawn her candidacy, was reported to have said: “The US is facing two very important crises at the moment – the curious incident of George Floyd, and the event of flour shortage. “I would like to put forward the motion that these incidents are not two, but rather one. Flour shortage leads to rioting, which leads to death, which leads to racism. And racism leads to death, leads to rioting, and that leads to flour shortage.” A statement issued by the college condemned the remarks as “deeply offensive” and promised concrete steps to combat prejudice, but students have criticised college leaders for their handling of the incident and failing to support those calling out racism. Melanie Nneka Onovo, a second-year student of history and politics, said the hustings followed an emergency meeting she had called to propose a motion to send a donation to Black freedom charities in the US, where there have been outrage and widespread protests following Floyd’s death after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. “The motion passed unanimously, but just 20 minutes later, a Christ Church student – husting for a committee position – made a distressingly unpleasant and distasteful joke about George Floyd,” she said. Onovo was horrified that no one challenged the comments, and said that when she then tried to intervene she was muted and had since been attacked for making the incident public. “I was disheartened that none of my fellow students spoke out at this language … I decided to call the actions out; but I was muted by the moderator. Since then, I have attempted to bring attention to the racism that is rampant in Christ Church, but have been consistently inundated with racially insensitive comments that became increasingly hostile. I have been made to feel isolated and guilty I spoke out.” The incident coincides with a report in HuffPost UK that the University of Oxford has delayed publishing admissions data on the diversity of its students in light of “world events”. Oxford has been criticised for its lack of diversity and has been making strenuous efforts to widen student participation. Christ Church already has a compulsory anti-bias session as part of its induction programme, but the college’s disciplinary officers Prof Geraldine Johnson and Prof Dirk Aarts – known as censors – acknowledged in their statement that it was not enough. “We will therefore work with students to ensure that not only freshers, but the entire community, continues to confront the very real impact of racial bias and all forms of discrimination. “To that end, we will be taking concrete steps to introduce new and ongoing initiatives to combat prejudice and to give everyone –students and staff – the tools to stand up for the values of tolerance and equality that Christ Church embraces today.” The dean of Christ Church, Martyn Percy, was among the signatories to a letter published in the Guardian on Friday from the heads of Oxford colleges pledging to fight systemic racism and discrimination, in response to events in the US. The letter said: “We recognise and regret that, for black members of our community, the unfolding crisis, together with the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on their communities, has caused them particular anxiety, anger and pain.”",education
"Ministers must avoid a “last-minute” approach to reopening England’s schools, the head of the umbrella organisation of unions has said, as the government’s scientific experts prepare to publish evidence about the safety of the move. With just 10 days to go until 1 June, the date named by Boris Johnson for more children to return to classrooms, the TUC secretary general, Frances O’Grady, is pressing the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to establish a taskforce, which would include people from unions representing teachers and non-teaching staff, to work out the details. O’Grady said that without proper planning and communication there was a risk of a repeat of “the chaos and confusion the prime minister’s back-to-work announcement caused”. England’s primary schools have been told to prepare to welcome more pupils from 1 June – but that date has not yet been confirmed, and a growing number of councils have said they will not comply. Welsh and Scottish schools will not reopen on 1 June. “Getting kids back into the classroom must be done in a safe and planned way. As it has done in other sectors, the government urgently needs to a set up a Covid-19 education taskforce with unions and other key stakeholders. We have been pressing Gavin Williamson for this,” O’Grady said. She added: “This will help give confidence to staff and parents, many of whom currently feel in limbo.” The government’s roadmap document said the 1 June date could be delayed if the pandemic was not sufficiently under control. “Changes will be announced at least 48 hours before coming into effect,” it said. In his widely watched Sunday night statement on 10 May, Johnson appeared to suggest more workers in England should be “actively encouraged” to return to the workplace the next day. But the government later clarified that the changes came into effect on the Wednesday. The devolved governments also rejected his “stay alert” slogan and continued to advise people to stay at home. The government’s panel of scientific experts, Sage, is expected to publish a series of papers on Friday covering the evidence behind reopening schools to more pupils. The Department for Education and Williamson have already held several joint meetings with the teaching unions – the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders, the National Education Union (NEU) and the NASUWT – the most recent being on Tuesday, where school reopenings were discussed.The teaching unions say there has been “no shortage” of meetings with officials and ministers, from Williamson down, but that unions representing non-teaching staff have been excluded. A meeting involving all school unions has now been pencilled in for next week.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “It’s good, but belated, recognition by Gavin Williamson and ministers that they need to talk to all school staff unions. “The problem all along is that this government doesn’t understand how schools work. They are highly complex institutions, and if ministers had listened to staff then they wouldn’t have gotten into the mess they now find themselves in, with a widespread revolt among councils.” The government in recent days softened its language around Johnson’s 1 June start date. Headteachers noted that the DfE’s updated guidance issued to schools on Thursday said they should prepare for reopening “from 1 June, at the earliest”. Children in reception, year 1 and year 6 are to return first. Johnson said in his statement that he wanted all primary school students to spend a month in the classroom before the summer holidays. But with stringent distancing measures required, including splitting children into “bubbles” of no more than 15, ministers accept that may not be feasible. Councils and headteachers have said schools do not have the extra space needed. The Scottish government announced on Thursday that its schools would not reopen until 11 August – after the summer break, which begins earlier in Scotland. Even then, schools will operate a “blended model” involving a mix of classroom- and home-based learning.The Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, Layla Moran, said: “Liberal Democrats have demanded from the outset that the government publish the scientific evidence behind their decision to reopen schools. Yet, with just 10 days before schools are due to open, parents and teachers are still being kept in the dark.“This announcement is so long overdue. We all want to get children back in school but the public need answers, particularly [about] the likely impact on the infection rate of these measures.”",education
"When Kelly Rivers left school at 15 she never dreamt she would one day be thrown into the role of teacher to three of her six children, and with no access to a computer, tablet or printer. But that is the challenge she has been facing under lockdown – and she has been finding it tough. “I have to message a friend whose child goes to the same school and ask what their children have been asked to do,” she says. “And I don’t want to keep asking because they have their own problems.” The family, from Dagenham, converted their three-bed house into a five-bedroom home by splitting rooms and turning living space into bedrooms. There is no space for a table in the kitchen. Kelly’s husband, Lee, a cleaner and the sole earner, brought back £750 a month before lockdown. His 80% furlough pay has recently come through: “It’s already nearly all gone as we have to pay rent, council tax and other bills,” Kelly Rivers says. Along with the couple’s three-year-old and three school-age children, the two eldest siblings, Martin, 19, and Jessica, 23, are also at home – plus a two-year-old grandson. “I’m trying to give my children what they need: clothing and food,” says Rivers. She has limited data on her smartphone and can’t let them use it. “I don’t want to allow one child to use it and then not the other, because it causes arguments, so the best thing to say is ‘no’.” Before lockdown the children could use computers at the library or their grandparents’ house, or after-school clubs. Bethany and Ruby, both 14, are in year 9 at different secondary schools, while Scarlett, five, is in year 1 at a local primary. Martin is studying for a BTec in engineering, and is accessing emails from college on his phone and doing his coursework on paper. None of the children’s schools has any spare laptops or tablets they can lend the family, but Bethany’s headteacher has visited her at home, and Ruby’s teachers have phoned to offer reassurance and support. Last month, legal activists from The Good Law Project argued that every school-age child being taught remotely had the right to a laptop or tablet and internet connectivity in their home. After the group announced it would sue local authorities to push the government into action, the government said that in England it would start supplying equipment to care leavers, children with social worker support, and “disadvantaged” pupils in year 10 to 12 preparing for exams. Jolyon Maugham, founder and director of The Good Law Project, says he suspects the government initially failed to anticipate the need to provide laptops and tablets for poorer families. “Education is being delivered online. For more prosperous families that’s not a problem. But poorer families are missing out. My suspicion is that the government has been trying to cover up the slowness of its response. By the time they came to recognise that there were around 1 million children who wouldn’t be able to access education, there was no longer much supply of laptops and tablets.” Headteachers have been expressing frustration at the lack of progress in getting the help on offer. One of them is Vic Goddard, principal at Passmores academy, Harlow, and star of the 2011 BBC programme Educating Essex. He has been promised just 29 laptops and only 13 routers to share between the 200 families at his school who say they do not have enough technology for their children to learn online. “My reaction has been verging on the hysterical,” he says. “It’s so frustrating.” Even the 29 laptops he expects to get from the government have not arrived. “I’ve become increasingly cynical about it all.” As far as he’s concerned, it’s a case of “great headlines, small impact”. In the meantime, to ensure all children have equal access to education at his school, he has stopped offering online learning and is now sending out packs of workbooks for all pupils to complete. Another headteacher says 107 children at her school were eligible for a laptop but she has been offered just 25, none of which has arrived. “I have been getting messages from families daily who need them. How am I going to choose who gets one?” Many schools have been trying hard to reach poorer children. At Parklands primary, in Leeds, one of the most deprived schools in the country, fewer than 20% of children have access to a dedicated tablet, computer or smartphone. The headteacher, Chris Dyson, has been loaning textbooks and ensuring the worst-off families collect food parcels along with their books. “The best home schooling work these children can do is to read. When you read a book, you can get away from all this crisis and go to a new world. “We’re hoping children will keep their love of learning going by doing bits and bobs, but our priority is their mental wellbeing so when they return to school, they come back safe and happy. Then we can start to pick up on the learning they’ve missed.” Maugham is sceptical about whether the government will be able to deliver on its promises and is concerned that, even when schools return, many children from poorer families may not. In a recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, higher-income parents were more willing for their child to go back to school than lower-income parents, despite the fact that children from better-off families were spending up to 75 more minutes a day – 30% more time – on home learning than poorer children. Rivers fears her daughters will not qualify for any government devices because they are not yet in year 10, and she is worried about them falling behind. “The most important thing I can do is to make sure they are happy and they’re not stressed. But at the same time, I want them to do well in their work when they go back to school. I don’t want them to need to do a big catch-up, because that will be more stressful for them” She listens to five-year-old Scarlett read every day, and does her best to encourage her other children to talk about what they were taught in school. A typical day involves TV, board games, books, writing stories or comics, and arts and crafts activities. “We try and spend as much time as we can in the garden – it releases all the steam.”  But the pressure to teach them is taking its toll: “Some days, I just don’t know how I deal with it. I take my hat off to teachers. They need to be paid double.” Rivers is also full of praise for School Home Support, a charity that works with schools to help families on low incomes and vulnerable children. Jaime McDonald from the charity, who is attached to Bethany’s school, has been trying for weeks to get the family a laptop. “She’s been absolutely brilliant, phoning up every day, asking how I am, even popping round to chat to me and the kids from a safe distance, bless her.” School Home Support is rolling out a pilot that will give more than 120 families – including the Rivers family – access to technology and data over the next few weeks, thanks to donations from other charities and tech companies. “We knew that access to technology would be a real issue for the families we work with when the learning went online,” said Jaine Stannard, the charity’s chief executive.  She says some families are facing financial ruin and so have more pressing problems to focus on than their children’s schoolwork. Realistically, she thinks a lot of the children will not return to school until at least September: “That’s a long gap to be missing school.”The children who most need support from their teachers and the government are now further at risk, she says. “They will fall behind. The gap is going to widen.”",education
"A group of senior scientists has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely in England and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The Independent Sage committee, which is separate from the government’s official advisers and is chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says new modelling of coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September would further reduce the risk. The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so new cases are found and isolated fast. “It is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,” Prof King said. In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a vital part of the decision-making process. The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children, with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes. King said the decision of when to reopen schools was a “careful balance” but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. “The current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.” King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Support for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their local area.” The Independent Sage committee will host an online discussion at midday on Friday for teachers, parents, children and union representatives in association with the British Medical Journal and Mumsnet. It will be broadcast on the Independent Sage YouTube channel, the committee’s Facebook page, on Twitter via @independentSAGE and @Sir_David_King, and on the BMJ’s home page.",education
"My friend Peter Rushton, who has died aged 68 of a heart attack, joined Sunderland Polytechnic (now Sunderland University) in 1979 after working for a short while at Wrexham Glyndŵr University (formerly North East Wales Institute of Higher Education). He remained at Sunderland for the rest of his life, becoming professor of historical sociology in 2009. Peter was born and brought up in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the son of Stanley Rushton, a lecturer in statistics, who died when Peter was five years old, and Marjorie (nee Champion), a hospital social worker. His mother had a passion for historical buildings, churches, and historical sites and most holidays included visits to these. Peter inherited her enthusiasm. His interests were wide ranging and his knowledge extensive. Having gained a first-class degree in archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge, Peter completed an MA in sociology at Manchester University, followed by a PhD on early modern witchcraft. His first teaching subjects – criminology and sociology – remained within a repertoire that expanded to include advanced social theories, gender and family studies, punishment and society and, at postgraduate level, law and early modern society. He supervised numerous PhD candidates, and generations of students valued his erudition. During the 1980s Peter initiated a pioneering part-time MA in historical studies that led to a lasting research partnership with Gwenda Morgan. They had great enthusiasm for uncovering secrets hidden in archives and together became authorities on early modern criminal transportation. Only a week before his death Peter completed proofreading their final book, Treason and Rebellion in the British Atlantic, 1685-1800. His other publications and conference papers represented his diverse research interests, including mental health, gender, sexuality, law, the history of Sunderland, and contemporary politics. In 2018, he co-edited, with Catherine Donovan, Austerity Politics: Bad Ideas in Practice. A committed trade unionist, Peter never aspired to managerial positions. He had a strong sense of justice, arguing consistently against unfairness and willingly gave his time to act as a critical friend to colleagues across the university sector. Peter influenced many people, many of whom benefited from his kindness. He enjoyed spending time with a small circle of close friends, who appreciated his conversation. He was keen on travelling and walking and was an excellent photographer. He is survived by his sister, Lesley, and two nephews.",education
"Parents are divided over the prospect of sending their children back to school, a new poll has revealed, as parent groups warned that mixed messages and poor communication had caused widespread anxiety about returning. With school leaders still grappling with the practicalities of reopening primary schools for some year groups in just a week’s time in England, an Opinium poll for the Observer found that 43 per cent of primary school parents and 54 per cent of secondary school parents feel anxious about the prospects of returning. Primary schools have been instructed to prepare to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as their early years provision. However, councils of all political colours have suggested they will not follow the advice, while Welsh and Scottish schools will wait to reopen. There are now also concerns that the return of pupils has become such a chaotic issue that it could worsen the attainment gap between affluent and poor areas and families. Some teaching unions have suggested the families of vulnerable children have been more reluctant to see them return to school. David Laws, the former education minister who now oversees the Education Policy Institute, said that a widening divide was a “significant risk”. John Jolly, chief executive of the parent group Parentkind, said there was confusion about the reopening of schools. “Parents are looking for certainty,” he said. “Some want the certainty of saying schools are safe and we’re going back. Some want the certainty of keeping children out of school until there is a vaccine, which may reflect families with underlying conditions. Then you have other parents that want a clear timeline. “Parents are not convinced about messages around schools being safe. They are not sure about that message from the government, or that the evidence for that is being communicated. There is a lot of uncertainty about the message being communicated by schools locally.” Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned the situation on the ground was now “chaotic and increasingly untenable”. “Not only are school leaders having to think about how to reopen schools, but how they convince parents that their children should go back, and organise the school site. Then they don’t know how many staff they will have. Schools are vital for society. But they have to be safe.” However, professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said schools should be allowed to reopen. “Covid-19 generally barely affects children and young people and actually we’ve shown that they are about half as susceptible,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There is no doubt in my mind for children themselves, the balances are clearly in favour of going back to school.” He said the risks to family and the community could be managed with an effective track and trace system and a phased return. While a working track and trace system is seen as necessary for rules around schools and other parts of the lockdown to be loosened, several local government sources warned that councils were now facing a race against time. There have been complaints that local public health officials have been sidelined during the pandemic, despite their expertise. They are now being drafted in as part of several pilots of the track and trace system, but insiders warn they now face huge time pressures. Professor Donna Hall, chair of the New Local Government Network, said: “At the beginning of March, public health directors were quite rapidly cut out of the national pandemic response. They are there for all aspects of public health, working on things like HIV, hepatitis, pandemic flu. Disease control is their job. They are highly skilled … but they’ve been cut out in quite a strange way. “Other countries have deployed local resilience forums for testing and tracing. A national contact centre is never going to get to the granular detail you need for contact tracing. I’ve been out with the people who do it – they are forensic. You won’t get that through an app. It is people on the ground, observing how a disease spreads. It could be from a petrol pump or a salt shaker. That’s the kind of detail needed. “They may be piloting things, but we’ve left it really late for that. Not giving local government a big role is foolish and dangerous.”",education
"Dr Paul Phillips is in what he calls “a very difficult situation”. Weston College, the further education college he runs in Weston-super-Mare, is facing a big coronavirus-shaped hole in its budget. He needs to spend at least an extra £750,000 on Covid-19 safety adjustments and catch-up courses, but expects his revenue from apprenticeships in industries like tourism, hospitality and construction to drop by up to £2m. “I’ve got a massive redundancy issue. I’m already restructuring.” The government this month announced a £1bn education catch-up fund to help English pupils get up to speed with what they have missed in school during lockdown, but it decided that no extra money should go to the 16-plus sector. Now, further education colleges are facing severe financial difficulty and some will not survive the Covid-19 crisis, teachers and college leaders have warned. “Unless the government provides a financial lifeline to colleges next academic year, it is highly likely that some will eventually end up becoming insolvent, and others will have to make significant cutbacks,” said Anne Murdoch, college leadership adviser at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL). The government’s own commissioner for further education, Richard Atkins, admitted last week that around 30 to 40 colleges are currently “at risk of running out of cash”. Speaking to the education select committee, he also warned that colleges’ income would be badly damaged by “a potential 50% plus drop in apprenticeships” from the economic slump. The coronavirus outbreak has decimated the commercial income of further education colleges, which often let out their facilities for conferences and run services such as restaurants and hair salons, staffed by students. Colleges must also meet all the costs of the extra cleaning and social-distancing measures that will be required in classrooms next year as a result of the pandemic, while also facing a reduction in demand for some vocational courses. “So many further education courses are attached to industry and jobs. So if there’s a collapse in the jobs market, you might see colleges reducing the courses that are on offer to young people,” said Niamh Sweeney, spokesperson for the National Education Union. “There’s a very weak relationship between the government’s industrial strategy and colleges. The government doesn’t see that there is a link between good, industrial-related training in colleges and onward employment. This is the biggest industrial slump that the country might ever have and further education is the perfect place to overcome that.” The ASCL said the sector was already desperately short of funding thanks to a decade of austerity and neglect. “There was a funding crisis before the pandemic. The pandemic has just further exaggerated it,” said Philips. “I’m worried that we can’t survive and deliver high quality provision without extra funding coming into the college and the further education sector.” Last week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that “for decades, we have failed to give further education the investment it deserves”. He ditched the “absurd mantra” of wanting half of all young people to go on to higher education and promised to create an employer-led, “German-style” further education system instead, saying: “From now on, our mantra must be further education, further education, further education”. He did not announce any new money for the sector. The national funding rate for 16- and 17-year-olds has been frozen at £4,000 per student since 2013. By contrast, the government provides £5,371 in average annual funding per pupil aged 11 to 16 and £9,124 per student in higher education, according to campaigners Raise the Rate. Further education students have not been entitled to the free school meals voucher scheme or the free devices scheme during the lockdown, and further education colleges cannot access the extra funding being provided this term to schools suffering exceptional Covid-19-related costs. “It’s ridiculously unfair. It’s time there was an equity of approach between the school academy sector, further education and higher education – I’m sick and tired of further education being the poor relation,” says Philips. A Department for Education spokesperson said the government has provided unprecedented support and claimed they are “providing an additional £400m for college and sixth forms this year and £1.5bn to upgrade college buildings and facilities”, as well as additional funding for traineeships.",education
"Michael Gove has reopened old wounds from the coalition government by claiming one of his proudest achievements is introducing the pupil premium – a policy the Liberal Democrats insist was their signature education reform, which has since been underfunded by the Tories. In a speech last Saturday on restructuring government entitled “The privilege of public service”, Gove cited the pupil premium as “one of the reforms of which I am proudest”. The education secretary during the coalition years added: “I believe it has been transformative”, adding that proper data was now needed to judge just how effective it had been. But his comments angered leading Liberal Democrats who insist that although the Tories had also mentioned a premium for poor pupils in their 2010 election manifesto, the drive to introduce it under David Cameron’s government came from them. They say they had to fight constantly to fund it properly during the coalition years from 2010 to 2015, as the government ordered huge cross-departmental austerity cuts. The premium is additional funding provided to publicly funded schools in England with the aim of raising the attainment of disadvantaged children, including those eligible for free school meals. Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey, who was energy and climate change secretary in the coalition government, said last night: “While it’s not surprising Michael Gove wants to try to claim credit for one of the most radical and progressive education policies of the last 40 years, he gets a C- for history and less for honesty, because the policy was a Liberal Democrat innovation and a huge achievement by Lib Dem ministers. “Conservative ministers know very well that whether it’s the trebling of renewable power, the raising of the income tax threshold or the pupil premium for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, these were Liberal Democrat policies, which we had to fight the Tories every day in government to achieve.” His fellow leadership contender, Layla Moran, accused Gove of “shamelessly rewriting history”. She said: “The pupil premium was fought for and delivered by the Liberal Democrats in government to give children from disadvantaged backgrounds the best possible start in life. If the Tories were truly proud of this policy, they would not have slashed funding for the pupil premium by millions of pounds in real terms since 2015.” The Lib Dems and Labour have complained that funding was frozen after 2015, although for the year 2020-21 it has been raised in line with inflation. James McGrory, who was a special adviser to deputy prime minister Nick Clegg during the coalition said: “With the pupil premium, Michael Gove is yet again polishing his brass neck. “It was a Liberal Democrat policy, which Gove and the Tories had to be fought tooth and nail to deliver in government, especially when it came to early years education. “It also speaks volumes that Gove is prouder of something Nick Clegg and David Laws did than he is of his own much-vaunted and misguided Free Schools crusade.”  The Conservatives say the pupil premium was included in their manifestos not only in 2010, but also in 2015 and 2017, and that they remain fully committed to it.",education
"In Britain, one focus of the Black Lives Matter movement has been how we tell the history of the country. Beyond the protests about statues, young people have been campaigning against changes to the national curriculum in England made in 2014. When the then education secretary, Michael Gove, announced he wanted to refocus the teaching of history in schools to “celebrate the distinguished role of these islands in the history of the world”, he removed the curriculum’s explicit focus on racial and ethnic diversity, particularly within Britain. Though some of his more extreme ideas were dropped after opposition from teachers and academics, his changes meant the teaching of black history became optional. This has led to black people being almost entirely written out of the version of British history taught in schools, says Lavinya Stennett, the founder of the Black Curriculum, an education social enterprise that delivers black British history in schools. GCSE exam data collated by the Guardian shows that although schools are permitted to teach black history, as well as the history of people outside Europe and the US, few of them do. Up to 11% of GCSE students are studying modules that refer to black people’s contribution to Britain. And less than one in 10 are studying a module with a focus on empire, despite this being a significant feature of the last 400 years of British history. This finding is backed by a survey of 50,000 people that explores the history participants learned at school. Of the 59 GCSE history modules available from the three biggest exam boards, Edexcel, AQA and OCR, 12 explicitly mention black history. Only five mention the history of black people in Britain, the rest are about black people in the US, other countries or the transatlantic slave trade. Of the five that cover black history in Britain, three include migration, one deals with empire in the 17th and 18th century, and one mentions race relations in postwar Britain in a thematic study of power over an 850-year period. This means up to 11% (approx 28,412) of GCSE students in 2019 were studying modules that made any reference to the contribution of black people in British history. No modules in the GCSE syllabus for the most popular exam board, Edexcel, mention black people in Britain. Yet there have been black people in Britain since at least the Romans arrived as well as black communities of sorts since the 1500s, as David Olusoga chronicles in his book Black and British. They include a trumpeter in Henry VIII’s court who wrote to the king asking for a pay rise, seamen at the battle of Trafalgar and soldiers fighting for Britain in both world wars. And of course white British people have been in Africa: running the transatlantic slave trade to the Caribbean and the US and occupying the likes of modern-day Nigeria and Kenya to Egypt and South Africa. A spokesperson for Edexcel’s parent company Pearson said they are planning to introduce a module about migration in Britain that will cover black British history, and that work on this will be accelerated in light of recent events. They said that diversity and inclusiveness “is an absolute priority for us and we’ve worked hard to ensure that our history GCSE qualification covers a range of cultures and countries … We always encourage feedback and take action on it where possible”. The consequences of this missing history, in Stennett’s words, is that many people do not know why Britain is the way it is today. “People are not aware of the contributions that were made [by black people] to Britain. Also, they don’t understand their classmates or the people around them,” she says. This omission harms black Britons, Stennett says. “The whole basis of the Windrush scandal was that ‘these people don’t belong here’, that their citizenship could be revoked. It makes me feel like we don’t belong, like we’ve never made any contribution,” she says. “That is not the truth.” Everyday life for black Britons is permeated by this history, according to Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, the 19-year-old co-creator of the Impact of Omission, including how microaggressions play out. “When black people say, ‘Please can you not touch my hair,’ people think it’s about invading personal space. And it is to an extent, but you also have this history in this country about how black people were put into zoos and petted like animals,” she says. Human zoos including Somali people among others continued in Britain until the 20th century. “People think you are overreacting when you’re like, ‘Can you please not do that.’ People think it’s PC culture. But when you do something like that it recalls a deeply painful and traumatic history that black people have to reckon with every single day. “You can walk through the world, touching people’s hair because you think it looks fluffy but it’s a completely dehumanising thing that has its roots in human zoos. That’s the impact of omission, that people can walk around not thinking about the history of their actions.” Nell Bevan, an 18-year-old who co-created the Impact of Omission with Jikiemi-Pearson, says: “I remember hearing adults say that you learn history so you can learn the mistakes that we used to make. But how can you avoid mistakes that you are not taught about?” When black people feature in GCSE history lessons it is often in the context of the slave trade. Without the inclusion of other aspects of black history and a broader understanding of empire, the focus on slavery, though crucial, can reinforce narratives of black people as victims. So it is also important, according to Clare Broomfield, the head of history at Villiers high school in Southall, Middlesex, for pupils to learn about different cultures before colonisation. “Studying the Mughal empire or the Benin kingdom moves away from the narrative that people of colour and black people are seen only as slaves or victims,” she says. The data shows that a third of GCSE students studied the modules centred on non-European or American cultures. Of that third, 95% were studying one of two modules on China under Mao. Three other modules focus on non-European/American culture outside the context of an invasion: the Mughal Empire 1526-1707; South Africa 1960-94: the People and the State; and Conflict in the Middle East 1945-95. Less than 2% (4,228) of all students studied these topics at GCSE. For the purposes of this comparison we have classified Russian history as European history. It’s not just black history that is missing. Despite the Conservative party’s enthusiasm for “imperial heroes”, there is very little coverage of the empire in GCSE history lessons. Although British historymakes up the vast majority of what pupils study at GCSE history, modules focusing on empire make up a small proportion of that. Allowing that students study four modules, we calculated that only 9% (about 23,676 pupils) have studied modules that make significant reference to the British empire over the course of their two-year GCSE. That is fewer than one in 10 learning about one of the most significant periods in British history over the past four centuries. Of the eight modules that cover the British empire: only one tackles the subject directly, OCR’s the Impact of Empire on Britain 1688-c.1730. Three reference empire in relation to migration in Britain; one covers it in a general 1,200-year overview of warfare; and two reference empire in short period studies of the UK: Britain in Peace and War 1900-18, and Restoration England 1660-85. In the syllabus for the most popular exam board, Edexcel, only one module, British America 1713–83: Empire and Revolution, makes a significant reference to the British empire. However, it is entirely focused on British colonisation of the US. A passing reference is made to Sir Walter Raleigh’s failed colonisation of Virginia in the module Early Elizabethan England 1558-88. In contrast, there are 21 modules on British history that make little to no reference to the empire. Peter Mandler, a leading historian based at Cambridge University, characterised the traditional focus of British history as “Hitler and Henrys”, making reference to the focus on the Nazis and the Tudors. Yet even within these “traditional” topics, Broomfield says a wide range of perspectives can be drawn out. “The Tudors and 1066 can be taught in a way that includes the non-white or immigrant people who participated in them, eg the black Tudors, the Jewish immigrants who came with William the Conqueror Indian Lascar sailors,” she says, citing a few examples from the OCR migration course that she teaches.  However, schools face two significant obstacles to reform: a shortage of money and a lack of time among teachers. Broomfield says it is difficult to buy textbooks on a small departmental budget: “Textbooks are expensive. My budget is not huge – even for the OCR GCSE migration course you need four textbooks at £12-£13 each. And if you are teaching more than 100 pupils, that soon adds up.” Another problem is teachers’ lack of knowledge, she says. “It’s maybe something that you have never studied before yourself, so, particularly if you’ve taught about life in Nazi Germany for the last 25 years, you’re not going to want to change that.” But Broomfield urges teachers to instead see it as a way for pupils to connect history to the world around them, and to learn about new topics themselves. “From a teacher perspective, I have found it endlessly fascinating to discover all these new and exciting stories,” she says. “If we don’t teach this history, we lose that knowledge and understanding of how rich and culturally diverse our society has been since the Romans.” Additionally, a series of changes to the education system means the national curriculum is taught fully only in local authority-run state schools – but not in academies, free schools or private institutions. Stennett says when history is taught well, it has a positive influence on BAME pupils. “People feel seen where they were not seen before,” she adds. “It gives them a sense of identity and belonging in the classroom.” According to Olusoga, the erasure of black history in Britain is an intentional feature of racism that he traces to Enoch Powell, whose search for a pre-colonial white England discards 400 years of British history and skips back to before the Elizabethans. Whatever the intention – the combination of curriculum setting by politicians, modules offered by exam boards and schools’ take-up of those modules means that for today’s students the erasure of black people’s centuries-long contribution to Britain remains.When asked whether the Department for Education was concerned about the low numbers studying either black history or the British empire, a spokesperson said: “The curriculum in our schools is already incredibly diverse and offers pupils access to different black history topics across all key stages, teaching children about significant figures from black and ethnic minority backgrounds to help them learn about our shared history with countries from across the world.” A letter to Stennett from Nick Gibb, the minister for school standards, seen by the Guardian, reiterates areas where it is possible to study black history in the current history curriculum but rejects a request by the Black Curriculum to make it mandatory. Free black history wallchart Starting on Saturday 11 July, the Guardian is publishing a free wallchart series giving a timeline of black history - from the first African Roman emperor in AD193, to the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. In a total of six parts, it will show how the history of black people has impacted the world, and will help all of us understand how we got where we are today. Notes on the data Specific data about what history students learn at key stage 3 (aged 11-14) or in primary schools is not available. Within the curriculum laid out here for England’s key stage 3, schools are allowed to teach what they want. Fewer than half of students doing GCSEs in England, 45%, take history. But it is only at this stage that we can get information on the topics studied. Scottish and Northern Irish exam boards were unable to provide details about the modules taken at GCSE/national 5 level. GCSE specifications: AQA, Edexcel, OCR history A and OCR history B",education
"As many as 13 British universities could face financial disaster from the after-effects of the coronavirus outbreak, affecting one in 20 students in the UK and causing steep job cuts, according to research. Estimates by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the UK higher education sector will endure losses ranging between £3bn to £19bn in 2020-21, with the exact size of the losses dependent on how many students decide not to enrol. The IFS calculates that pension obligations and investment losses caused by the economic downturn will also have a major impact on university balance sheets over the next four years. Universities will be unable to recoup their losses through cost-cutting unless they also make “significant” numbers of staff redundant, the research found. Although the IFS did not name the 13 institutions most at risk, the authors suggest that those with the lowest reserves and smallest investments will need a government bailout or debt restructuring to survive. “It is not the institutions with the largest Covid-related losses that are at the greatest risk of insolvency. Rather it is those, generally less prestigious, institutions that entered the crisis in a weak financial position and with little in the way of net assets, which are at greatest risk,” the IFS stated. Universities with the largest predicted losses under the IFS’s analysis were “highly profitable” before the crisis and have substantial financial reserves, allowing them to sustain significant drops in income. “If the government wanted to avoid university insolvencies, by far the cheapest option would be a targeted bailout, which may cost just £140m,” said the IFS’s Elaine Drayton, one of the report’s authors. “Rescuing failing institutions may weaken incentives for others to manage their finances prudently in the future. General increases in research funding avoid this problem but are unlikely to help the institutions that are most at risk, as few of them are research-active.” Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said the IFS report was further bad news for students and staff in higher education. “Universities are already seeking to sack staff, with casual staff and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds suffering the most. We need a comprehensive support package that protects jobs, preserves our academic capacity and guarantees all universities’ survival,” Grady said. The IFS’s central projection calculates an £11bn loss in income for the sector, with a 50% fall in new international students. It also assumes that enrolments from the EU will halve in 2020-21 “due to travel restrictions and disruption to administrative services … as well as health concerns,” despite it being the final year that students within the EU are treated the same as UK applicants. The institute expects enrolments from the UK to be 10% lower as “some students may choose not to attend what is likely to be a significantly different university experience or may stay away for health concerns”. The downturn in financial markets will also likely hurt finances. The IFS estimates that universities will need to increase their pension provisions by 25%, while investment income is expected to fall by 10%. The IFS also offers two more scenarios, including a “pessimistic” scenario with £19bn in lost income, thanks to much larger falls in student enrolments and a more severe market downturn widening pension fund deficits and reduced investment income. The “optimistic” scenario of a £3bn loss includes a 25% fall in international and EU enrolments and no additional pension provisions required.",education
"New graduates facing the toughest labour market for 75 years can increasingly turn to innovative schemes set up to redirect them into areas of need. At least 30% of university students have lost a job or an offer of a job after the sharpest monthly increase in unemployment on record. At the same time, competition for graduate jobs is at an all-time high: with graduate job openings falling by 77% since the beginning of the year, there are on average 100 graduates vying for each role. Last month the charity upReach set up Assessed Virtual Internship, a programme to help graduates whose career opportunities have disappeared. Two graduates have set up a volunteering initiative, Generation Help, to link new graduates with SMEs, with the hope that once connected a job might arise. There is also a push to build a national youth corps that would guarantee jobs for all young people. In an open letter to the government, a coalition of British youth charities backing the plan said: “Generation covid … face having their lives altered as no other generation since the war, with scars that will last their entire lives.” John Craven, the chief executive of upReach, said: “We created our programme at record speed to tackle the dearth of opportunities brought about by covid. We have offered the chance to apply to over 1,000 young people and had hundreds of applications already.” UpReach’s four-week programmes are delivered by volunteers from employers including Allen & Overy, the civil service fast stream, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Slaughter and May, as well as team members from upReach itself. At least 20% of Britain’s biggest employers have suspended their graduate recruitment selection processes and stopped making graduate job offers, and experts say the true scale of the damage inflicted on new graduates will be realised next year. “Employers are aware that if they are seen to be cutting jobs they have offered for this autumn then the reputational damage could be quite significant, but it doesn’t mean they have to carry on recruiting at those same levels in the future,” said Martin Birchall, the founder of High Fliers Research. Gwenan Jones, 23, is about to graduate from the University of Durham with a degree in modern languages. “I’m so worried about the future that I can’t even think about it. There’s just no point is there? Each day I read about the damage to the UK economy that this pandemic is causing, how more and more people are being made redundant,” she said. “Added to which, our generation will be paying back [the cost of the furlough scheme] for as long as we can earn. Where will we be as we leave university? Supposedly newly qualified, ‘highly skilled’ and over £27,000 in debt, we are now back with our parents, in our childhood bedrooms and rejected from job after job.” Rachel Deakin, 22, is about to finish her PGCE at the University of Bristol. “I have been explicitly rejected from three jobs during lockdown because I’m too much of a risk, having had my placement cut short by lockdown, by fve weeks. Having specifically trained for this role and accrued another year’s worth of debt, this was heartbreaking to hear.” Dylan Jones, 21, is about to graduate from a degree in politics and international relations. “There are no jobs to apply for,” he said. “The council scheme for graduates has been cancelled, many graduate schemes are either closed, scrapped or postponed. Jobs on the university careers website have gone down by 80%. Unfortunately I can only see years of unemployment ahead and long-term economic scarring to a generation’s prospects.” Zoe, 22, is about to graduate from a PGCE. She had planned to become an art teacher. “My future and the future of university students becomes more dark each passing day,” she said. “I am terrified to finish university even though I know what I want to do. “I am not hopeful that there will be enough job opportunities out there for us. Overall I have great fear and anxiety over my dream profession. I also have anxiety and fear of being made redundant from my part-time job at a supermarket because a job that was meant to keep me going through university is now the only way I have to make money for the foreseeable future.” Matthew Thomson, 24, is studying architecture at the University of Dundee. “The uncertainty appears to have dried up almost every prospect of finding employment. To get to the end of an unbelievably stressful year and see very few options is very disheartening.” Mia Stubbings, 25, is in her third year at Lamda, studying stage management. “I don’t currently have an industry to graduate into,” she said. “All my plans for my future have been taken away from me and now I’m left with a gaping hole. “It’s unlikely I’ll get a job in theatre until next year at least and even then the competition will be fierce. I’ve spent three years working immensely hard and and now I need to change my dreams and plans so I can pay my rent.” Charys Newton, 23, will graduate in September from a master’s in music industries from the University of Glasgow. “The live music industry has been completely shuttered by the pandemic and is not expected to open up again until summer next year at the earliest,” she said. “This means that by the time the live music industries are hiring again, my degree will be nearly a year out of date, and many promoters and venues will have gone out of business. My prospects of getting a job in this area are super slim.”",education
"Pressure is mounting on the government to review the national curriculum and make the teaching of black history mandatory for all pupils in schools in England. Campaigners are collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent this week to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, calling on him to make the teaching of black history compulsory in primary and secondary school and across a range of different subject areas. The campaign, led by a group called the Black Curriculum, has attracted widespread support in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd in the US, and in light of the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic people. Organisers have requested a face-to-face meeting with Williamson and want a response by Windrush Day on 22 June. The letter states: “Thousands of us, the British voting public, are grief-stricken and concerned about the existing status quo in the UK, which disregards the lives and contributions of black British people.” It says young people studying the national curriculum in schools in England are not given a full or accurate version of British history. “Despite numerous calls over the years to reform the national curriculum to incorporate black histories, these requests have been denied,” it says. “Learning black history should not be a choice but should be mandatory. Our curriculum should not be reinforcing the message that a sizeable part of the British population are not valued.” Campaigners want black history to be included in the national curriculum from key stage 1 in primary through to key stage 4 when students take their GCSEs, and across subjects including history, citizenship, English and PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education). Lavinya Stennett, who founded the Black Curriculum, said: “There’s an appetite for change. People want to see the events of the past weeks lead to lasting change. It’s something we’ve known is important for a long time. Finally people are listening.” Black history, including topics such as migration, belonging and empire, can be taught as part of the history and English curriculum in secondary schools, but whether pupils get to study it depends on the exam board and modules chosen by schools. Another challenge is that academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater freedoms and are not required to follow the national curriculum, meaning many children may miss out on opportunities to study black history. Labour has promised that pupils will be taught about injustice and the role of the British empire as part of the national curriculum if it wins power. Black history is also studied and celebrated in Black History Month every October. Rosamund McNeil, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Government needs to be more proactive. It’s time to show leadership on making the curriculum more diverse and more representative. It’s really helpful we have Black History Month in October, but it’s not enough to just do it in one month. We have to ask ourselves why we are not eliminating racism quickly enough.” Catherine West, the Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, has also written to Williamson calling for a review on the issue. She said she had been contacted by hundreds of her constituents complaining about the “complete lack of BAME history” in the curriculum and the ineffectiveness of the education system in tackling systemic racism. “Whilst changing our education system will not necessarily bring an end to racism in the UK, I firmly believe this is an important step in beginning the process of ensuring racial equity in the UK and will go some way to tackling the issues which have been so widely discussed in the past few days,” West said. Pran Patel, an education consultant who runs a campaign to decolonise the school curriculum, said that in the last few days views of his website had risen from 500 a day to 6,000. He said: “Through no fault of their own, our curriculum leaves one group of children feeling inferior and another group with a sense of superiority. Black children don’t see themselves reflected back, and end up feeling they can’t be the person they see in the inspiring story.” Shaminder Takhar, an associate professor of sociology at London South Bank University, said: “Decolonising the curriculum gives voice to those who have previously been marginalised. Viewed in the context of anti-racist struggles such as BLM in the time of Covid-19, it highlights hierarchy and inequality. It is a move towards a more inclusive society.” It comes as a new art education project, backed by Turner-prize nominated artist Yinka Shonibare, is aiming to transform how Britain understands its role in the transatlantic slave trade by placing sculptures that explore its legacy in UK cities. The World Reimagined project will see 100 globe-shaped sculptures erected in cities across the UK in the summer of 2022, which will be accessible to local schools, and created by well-known and community-based artists. Founding board member, singer and former EastEnders star, Michelle Gayle, told the Guardian she wanted to create a project that would start conversations about Britain and slavery, and provide an educational element for school and community groups. “It’s a cog in the wheel of what we need to learn about the truth of British history. Everyone can get involved, meaningfully,” she said. Gayle said the removal of the statue of the Bristolian slave trader Edward Colston on Sunday made her realise now was the right time to launch the project. “A lot of people were telling us that Britons are not ready to have this conversation,” she said. “Then the statue went down yesterday, and we heard people saying they were not taught enough about slavery. To see hear people talk about it like that made us realise that the difficult conversations are being had now.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Racism in all its forms is abhorrent and has no place in our society. Schools already play a significant role in teaching children about the importance of having respect and tolerance for all cultures. “Black history is an important topic which schools can teach to children of all ages as part of the history curriculum. Schools can utilise resources from a range of organisations and sources to support teaching black history, including the Black Curriculum.”",education
"Primary schools in England will not have to take any more pupils before the end of the summer term but the government will work to get children of all ages back to class by September, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has said. The government had hoped to ask all primary schools to reopen four weeks before the summer holidays but this target set out in its coronavirus roadmap will not now be hit. With just half of all schools open to reception, year one and year six pupils last week, Williamson acknowledged that full opening of primaries this term would not be possible, as the requirements of social distancing are too difficult. Schools will be permitted to open to more age groups if they have space but not all have the facilities to keep children to classes of 15 pupils and maintain social distancing. “We believe this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer we continue to work with the sector on the next steps where we would like to see schools that have the capacity bring back more children to do so before the summer holidays,” Williamson said. “We will be working to bring all children back to school in September … Exams will take place next year.” He said by the end of last week, more than half of primary schools were taking pupils from reception, year one and year six, but as of Monday that had risen to more than 70% of primaries. Labour said it was right the government had listened to warnings from parents, teachers and unions that it was “premature” and “impractical” to bring back schools too soon. The GMB union also said it was “pleased that their safety, and that of pupils, has started to lead government policy and decisions”.  However, the decision has been met with dismay in some quarters, as the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, warned that children’s education is being forgotten while theme parks, pubs and shops are being allowed to reopen. Longfield suggested the government should be putting as much effort into getting children back to class as it is towards making sure the economy is up and running as the coronavirus pandemic passes its peak. “I am worried that education has not had the priority that the economy has, business and jobs, or indeed the NHS. I also think children are in danger of being forgotten in this lifting of lockdown. We’re seeing a situation where theme parks are going to be opened in a month, shops, pubs, restaurants, but still children not back in school,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. She said it was a “disruption we’ve not seen since the second world war” and warned that “the education divide is broadening” and “almost a decade of catching up on that education gap may well be lost”. “We have to avoid … that a generation of children leaves school in five years’ time where the disadvantaged children have much poorer prospects because they weren’t given the support they need to learn during this period.” Longfield said the development was “a huge disappointment for those children who’d expected to go back into school before the summer and now may not”. “It does mean that the vast majority, probably about 8 million children, very likely won’t return to the classroom until September, which means that, again, there will be a huge variation in their learning over that period.”  She said children would remain isolated, with many living in “fragile” family environments.  She told BBC Breakfast: “We know that there’s a real variation in learning. We’ve got some children, more affluent children, especially those going to private schools, who are literally attending Zoom schools from nine till three in the afternoon with lessons as normal.  “And we know that 90% of disadvantaged children aren’t going online for more than two hours, if that. We also know there’s about a million children who just don’t have the tech or the broadband to be able to learn in this way.”  She added: “Children are isolated, missing their friends, real mental health concerns, and also concerns about safeguarding when they’re at home.” Robert Halfon, the Tory MP and chair of the Commons education select committee, also expressed surprise that England was prioritising reopening pubs over ensuring children could continue their learning in school.  Speaking to Today, Halfon said: “I think we’re a strange country in which we turn a blind eye to mass demonstrations all over in every city, we campaign for pubs and cafes to open and yet we say to open schools before September is too risky when all the evidence – from the World Health Organization, from many other European countries, from the chief medical officer in the UK – suggests otherwise,” he said. “We are potentially damaging children’s life chances.” Helen Whately, the care minister, told BBC Breakfast the government did not “want to take risks that might increase the infection rates”, but recognised that being out of school is a particular problem for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and that the education gap “can widen”. Whately struggled on Sky News as she was pressed on whether the government had done enough to protect care homes from Covid-19, insisting that “at all points in this we have followed the scientific guidance”.  The interviewer, Kay Burley, replied: “You take [scientists’] advice and then you make the policy - you can’t stick this on the scientists.” The MP responded: “But I can, because …” before correcting herself to insist that was not what she had meant to say. “What I mean to say is that we have taken the scientific advice at every stage of this process – we have taken the scientific advice and then judgment is made about what is the right decision to take.”",education
"The story of how 53 Welsh Italians lost their lives when the ship Arandora Star sank 80 years ago as it transported them to second world war internment camps is to be told via a back-to-basics, coronavirus-friendly medium. Rather than staging its usual conventional theatre production for thousands of Welsh schoolchildren, the renowned south Wales valleys company Theatr na nÓg has decided instead to produce a radio play. Entitled simply Arandora Star, the play will be streamed – in Welsh and English – into classrooms in the autumn. The move has been praised by arts industry leaders as an example of innovation in challenging times. The theatre company’s artistic director and co-writer of the play, Geinor Styles, said: “We are hugely disappointed that for the first time in three decades we will not be able to provide our usual production, but the safety of the children, our actors and creative teams is paramount. “We believe that producing a radio version of the play is a great solution in these uncertain times. It will ensure that the arts and theatre continue to thrive and the children of Wales are not losing out on the creative industries playing an important role in their schooling.” The company’s productions are seen every year by about 5,000 children between the ages of eight and 11. “I’m very happy that the tradition will continue and they will not lose out because of Covid-19,” said Styles. The Arandora Star, a converted cruise ship, was sunk en route to Canada in the Atlantic by a German torpedo on 2 July 1940, with the loss of more than 800 lives. Among those on board were Welsh Italians, many from the valleys of south Wales who had been declared “enemy aliens” by the British government. The play tells the story of a fictional character called Lina as she struggles to cope with the loss of her father, Guido, on the vessel and how she and her mother, Carmela, survive in a time of war and prejudice. “It’s a relevant story for now about how we deal with immigration,” said Styles. She also said teachers were pleased that as well as reminding the UK of a tragic, sometimes forgotten episode, the style of the piece may help bring back listening skills. The director, Dan Lloyd, said telling stories about episodes like the internment of Welsh Italians was vital. He said: “Although Arandora Star is a story set eight decades ago, there is much to be learned from history. Telling such stories ignites empathy, which is the key to helping things improve.” It is appropriate that one of the most famous examples of the radio play is a Welsh one – Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood, which was revived during lockdown by a cast of household names and key workers. Fiona Allan, president of UK Theatre, praised the move by Theatr na nÓg. She said: “I’m encouraged to see companies finding innovative ways of getting culture into the classroom whilst theatres around the nation remain closed. It’s vitally important that our young future audience experience theatre and the arts at a young age. “We’re all acutely aware of the risk Covid-19 poses to our industry, with theatres and arts companies throughout the UK at risk of collapse, and desperately in need of more than the government’s roadmap. We need dates to work towards in order to plan properly towards reopening the sector. “In the meantime, Theatr na nÓg are demonstrating great resilience and forward thinking in bring this production to schools throughout Wales.”",education
"From the outside, Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School, known locally as QEGS, looks like your archetypal private school, with ancient buildings, an impressive wood-panelled dining hall and its guiding motto in Latin, Disce Prodesse (loosely translated as Learn to be of service). Founded in 1509, the first year of the reign of Henry VIII, it has largely operated as an independent school for 500-plus years – apart from a spell as a direct grant (state) school in the 50s and 60s – with annual fees of up to £10,000 in the mid-noughties, well beyond the reach of most parents in Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire. But since QEGS converted into a free school in September 2014, parents have not had to pay fees at all. The move followed a period of falling school rolls after the 2008 economic crisis. Today QEGS is oversubscribed and graded “good” by Ofsted, with its personal development and early years provision graded “outstanding”. Claire Gammon joined QEGS back in 2002 as a maths teacher, and became head in 2017 when the school had recently been inspected by Ofsted and rated as “requires improvement”. She puts its newfound success down to strong academic results, an emphasis on producing “fully rounded human beings”, and the retention of an “independent ethos”. “We have Saturday sport, teach Latin, have three cathedral services a year, where staff walk through the town in gowns, and an extraordinary range of different trip and enrichment activities. Or we did, until this recent crisis.” This package clearly appeals to many parents. Vicki Hamilton, who had a son at QEGS when it was a private school and now has a daughter there, agrees. “Yes, there are bigger classes now, but it feels like all the opportunities of the old school have continued – science, language, maths competitions, school trips, sporting fixtures. Behavioural standards and uniform have remained the same.” And there are other bonuses: “I am glad that my daughter is in a more diverse school, mixing with people from different backgrounds. It is not good to be educated in a bubble,” she says. As one of 32 private schools that have moved into the state sector since 2010, the school is also part of a broader experiment that has fresh relevance for a private sector facing a severe economic battering because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the past few months, at least nine private schools have closed, including Boris Johnson’s old prep school, Ashdown House, in Forest Row, East Sussex. Hundreds more face potential collapse, with dire forecasts of one in 10 independent schools going to the wall. Displaced private school pupils could add to the alarming predicted shortfall of 380,000 state school places in England in the academic year 2021-2022. It seems certain that more private schools will seek to give up their independence and welcome state pupils. David James, until recently deputy headteacher at Bryanston school, in Blandford, Dorset, says: “Some schools will inevitably be forced into the maintained sector. If it helps save jobs, only a zealot would oppose.”  The government quietly dropped the free school route for conversion a few years ago, and has not replaced it with any other established process. Labour, meanwhile, has indicated it might support conversion of failed private schools, but under local scrutiny. With the private sector arguably at its weakest since the late 1930s, many see this as a moment of potential transformation, with conversion a key element in a broader, long-term strategy to close the gap between private and state provision. Hans Broekman, head of Liverpool College, which became a state school in 2013, wants the government to make conversion easier. He says his school “had to beg to be nationalised”. But the free school route was, he says, “for all sorts of economic, technical and government reasons, terrible”. Broekman is calling on the government to set up a special unit “empowered to transfer independent schools to the state sector”. He is one of a number of experts in a group set up by the Private School Policy Reform (PSPR) forum, which hopes to present concrete proposals to the Department for Education in the early autumn. Government insiders privately suggest that the DfE has yet to address seriously the urgent problem of failing private schools and that the conversion process needs to be “smoother and less bureaucratised”. According to Gammon, “There has to be mentoring system between schools that have already converted and those that want to make the change. There are massive fears in independent schools. You have been in a bubble, running your own domain. And you are going into a very different system, it can feel like a loss of power.” Schools also need specific advice with financial planning, how to apply for grants and how to use pupil premium money, she says. Polham Hall school, a former Quaker boarding school in Darlington, converted in 2015 and was deemed to “require improvement” by Ofsted in 2018 before being successfully turned around by its new principal, Kate Reid. It became a state boarding school but will cease boarding from September. Reid, who came from Liverpool College, had seen what an effective conversion looked like close up. “Schools need advice and guidance that they can trust,” she says. “When I got to Polham Hall I looked at their files and saw the conflicting advice that the school had been given, including from those representing the DfE. Staff members told me that they were led to believe that funding would enable the school to have just 20 children in a class. But anyone who knows about state school funding would know that was never going to work.” But sceptics question the wisdom of using public money to bail out a failing private sector. Wouldn’t it simply heap more problems on local state schools, already struggling with underfunding and the multiple impacts of the virus? Sol Gamsu, of Durham University, says: “Private school integration must mean more than the state subsidising middle-class schools.” His research suggests that secondary schools that have converted almost all have lower proportions of disadvantaged students than other local state schools. He cites the case of Colston’s Girls’ school in Bristol, one of the first to come over to the public sector, claiming that it would offer the “same standard of education to the community”. Thirteen years on, says Gamsu, “this is materially not the case. Colston Girls has the fourth lowest percentage of free school meals (FSM) students in the city.” Gamsu compared Colston’s FSM figures of just under 10% with the average for the local authority, which stands at just over 20%.  Both Gammon and Reid emphasise how painstaking and fair their admissions processes are. However, Gamsu’s calculations, which will be fully unveiled in a report for PSPR due to be published in the autumn, hint at similar, worrying discrepancies in these converter schools: QEGS has 10% of children on free school meals, compared with a local authority average of 16.7 %, while Polham Hall has just 7.6% compared with nearly 20% in the local authority. Heads such as Gammon and Reid are, however, enthusiastic converts to the virtues of state education. Gammon says: “I have learned so much from joining the state sector, and collaborating with local leaders of education, national leaders, subject leaders. The local authority has been fantastic. As a result, the teaching and pastoral care at this school have never been better.” ",education
"My father, Peter Naylor, who has died aged 87 from complications arising from dementia, was well known throughout physics further education circles in south-west England during the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Born in Leigh, then part of Lancashire, Peter was the son of Ernest, an engineer, and Eunice (nee Nicholson), a primary school teacher. From 1941 to 1945, the family lived in Karachi, where Peter attended the local grammar school, while his father trained engineers at munitions factories throughout pre-partition India.  Returning to Leigh, Peter completed A-levels, then studied physics at Liverpool University (1951-54), developing lifelong interests in cricket (he was a club leg-spinner into his 40s and also umpired and coached), astronomy and photography. After employment at Leigh Cableworks and marriage in 1957 to my mother, May (nee Farrimond), whom he met at the local youth club, Peter joined Wigan Technical College in 1958 as a physics lecturer. In 1963, the family moved south for Peter to take up a post at Swindon College, Wiltshire, where he remained until retirement in 1997. Despite his diminutive stature, Peter’s energy and wit ensured near-legendary status across decades of A-level, HNC and HND physics students. In 1969 Peter was among the Open University’s first cohort of science access lecturers and summer school tutors, later teaching relativity for the OU. He earned a reputation for enabling students to realise their full potential. Peter keenly observed and incorporated others’ teaching styles, but the theatrical aspects of his lessons, delivered in a Lancashire accent, were his own. There were meticulous coloured chalk diagrams and patient explanations – he always gave time to people who showed a desire to learn. In 1976, Peter was Swindon College’s founding Easter public lecturer, delivering a talk to an audience of 500 on gyroscopes, featuring models commissioned from the engineering department. Following May’s death in 1999, Peter maintained family contact through “cousins’ weekends”; he was also well known among Wiltshire and Gloucestershire model railway enthusiasts.  Peter is survived by his sons, Howard and me, and his grandchildren, Will and Lois. ",education
"As the son of immigrant workers new to the UK, and growing up in the West Midlands, Patrick Roach never imagined he would one day be a trade union leader on first-name terms with government ministers. His parents, however, who arrived from Jamaica in the 1960s, believed in the power of education to change lives and were ambitious for him. So the new general secretary of the NASUWT, the 300,000-member teachers’ union, who took up his post in April, went on to university, gained a doctorate in education, and lectured in politics and sociology. Twenty years ago he left teaching for a job at the union. For the past 10 years he has helped to lead it as the deputy general secretary, before being elected unopposed to the top job. Coming from a working-class home - his father first worked as a bus conductor and his mother on the railways – Roach, 56, is deeply concerned about the effect of the Covid-19 school closures on the education of children whose families cannot afford to fill the gaps. But he is also alarmed at the threat to the health of teachers and children as schools return, and has pressed vigorously for the government to ensure schools are protected by the same stringent health and safety rules that companies have to follow. “I came from a home of relative disadvantage and I know how important it is to have access to books and libraries and, nowadays, online material as well,” he says. He remembers his father scraping together the money to build up a set of Encyclopedia Britannica, and the family’s weekly trips to the local library. “My parents came to the UK because they were invited to work here, in the mother country, and they had been schooled in Jamaica to respect their teachers and focus on education. That is a lesson they taught my brother and me from our very earliest days. Education was extremely important to them and important to me,” he says from his temporary home office, where every moment of the day is consumed by online meetings, the next one jointly with fellow union leaders and Gavin Williamson, the education secretary. But, he adds, for a black boy in Walsall and Birmingham in the 1970s school wasn’t a walk in the park and, sadly, he is not sure the low expectations of black children and their disproportionate exclusions have changed much. Was it character forming? “You could say that,” he says wryly, with a characteristic hearty laugh. “People often talk about teachers they remember, who helped them. There are a few who are seared into my memory – but not for that reason, let’s put it that way,” he says. “I stayed on for A-level study but didn’t get the grades I wanted for university so I went on to Matthew Boulton FE college, then in a tower block in the centre of Birmingham. That’s when the real joy and love of learning took off. “It was an important message – getting a second chance with great teachers looking out for you. That’s what I and many others like me got from FE.” With that behind him, he went on to do a degree in sociology at Leicester University and a doctorate in education from Warwick. There are too few black and ethnic minority teachers, he says. Those we do have are finding that they tend to be not only lower paid but, according to surveys, more likely to be subject to disciplinary or capability procedures and forced out of the job. “If we want to have the best teaching profession, then it has to be inclusive, and it is not. This is another one of these national scandals that has to sit squarely with the government. Clear statutory duties in respect of equality apply to schools as employers but how, since the 2010 Equalities Act, has the government sought to reinforce it in schools? It hasn’t. Successive secretaries of state have removed equality from the accountability systems, and that includes race equality.”  Roach does not think enough has changed since the shock report in 1971 by Bernard Coard, “How the West Indian child is made educationally sub-normal in the British school system”, published by the Caribbean Education and Community Workers’ Association. It said African-Caribbean children were far more likely to be put in schools for what was then called “educationally sub-normal children”, or to be victims of low expectations at mainstream schools because of culturally and class-biased IQ tests and exams designed to keep immigrants down and preserve the social hierarchy. Over the years Roach has promoted action to build a more inclusive profession, launching a series of conferences for under-represented groups such, women, black and ethnic minority, disabled and LGBT+ members. “It has been very instructive to hear from BAME members the extent to which they felt that their schools are just paying lip service to race equality. I know it is not a popular thing to say and that it is often misunderstood, but institutional racism does exist and is an issue that has clearly got to be addressed, especially in the light of the handling of the coronavirus emergency,” he says. “My driving priority is to stand up for all our members against injustice at work and to secure real improvements in pay and working conditions.”  He is angry, for example, that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, employers are continuing to initiate disciplinary procedures and even docking the salaries of vulnerable staff who cannot attend work for fear of infection. The government needs to take control and be clear about what employers should be doing, not leave it to individual headteachers and academy trusts to decide, he says. He says society as a whole could be doing much more to support children outside the classroom. “We have been pressing ministers, for example, to ask media and tech companies to step up to the plate to support children who do not have educational opportunities outside school,” he says. “The health of teachers must not be sacrificed to address the searing inequality between children’s lives that has been exposed by the coronavirus crisis.”  How did we get to a point that the only educational opportunities available to thousands of children and young people in the UK are those in school, rather than outside? he asks. “We have to take a long, hard look at the gap that has widened because so much now depends on ability to pay.  “As a society we have make sure that every child has learning opportunities that extend beyond the physical space in the classroom,” he says. “We have to come out of this crisis in a way that doesn’t do further damage to the lives of children from the poorest households. “If the government decides to under-invest in schools and the children’s services that used to offer support for pupils, then the government has to take responsibility for the consequences,” he warns. And that is a message he is just about to convey to the education secretary in his next video-conference meeting.",education
"University leaders have reacted angrily to the UK government’s plan to control the number of students from England who can study in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying that it was punishing them for problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak in England. The Department for Education in England is expected to confirm a cap on the number of undergraduates each university can recruit this autumn – limiting institutions to an increase of no more than 6.5% in the number of new students – in a bid to stop institutions poaching students from their rivals. But universities and ministers in the devolved administrations said they have been shocked to learn that the DfE wants to impose the same limits on Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, despite higher education policy being devolved to individual governments. Sally Mapstone, the vice-chancellor of the University of St Andrews, said: “There’s been no consultation about this with Scottish universities at all. When we first heard about it, it was a real shock to the sector, it was a surprise to government and to the funding councils. We feel we’ve been completely blindsided by this.” Mapstone said the decision by the UK government had come at “an incredibly difficult time for student recruitment”, with uncertainty over the number of students attending higher education next year. Some universities are forecasting that the number of international students enrolling in September could drop by 50% in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving holes that some have aggressively tried to fill with UK students. “What’s really galling is that the student number controls were in part brought in because of unacceptable and unscrupulous behaviour by a number of English universities,” Mapstone said. “But there is no evidence whatsoever that Scottish universities have behaved badly. We were not in that group, so to effectively penalise us for something that stems in part from behaviour south of the border seems inappropriate.” Close to 18,000 students from England travel to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland each year to start undergraduate degrees. Welsh universities are particularly popular with English students, with Cardiff University admitting nearly 60% of its undergraduates from across the border. Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said: “If there is any intention to limit the numbers of English students that can study in Wales, that would be a real problem and it just does not make any sense.” Riordan said Cardiff and other universities have already sent out offers to their applicants and many would have already accepted university places. “That puts us in a contractual position with them, so I don’t know how that would pan out. What I’m hoping is that this is some sort of mix-up that hasn’t been thought through, or it’s some sort of mistake that can be resolved,” Riordan said. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, is to hold a further meeting with her counterparts on Monday, with further details to be announced next week, according to the DfE. Anton Muscatell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: “If an agreement is reached between the governments, it is important that Scottish institutions are treated fairly, on similar terms to English institutions.” Last academic year around 5,000 English students started their first degrees in Scotland, with close to 2,000 going to the University of Edinburgh alone. Edinburgh declined to comment on the student numbers cap extension. Alastair Sim, the director of the Universities Scotland group, described the new policy as “a late and low blow” and said: “The UK government’s package of measures for UK universities in early May was England-only in the financial support it offered but it now seems to be UK-wide when it comes to the controls. This is unacceptable.” Emma Hardy, Labour’s shadow minister for universities, said the UK government needed to ensure the health of the sector in the coronavirus aftermath. “There is a need for stability in the system and temporary number controls. However, any decision on how this is implemented must be done in conjunction with both the Welsh and Scottish governments,” Hardy said.",education
"The UK government is going ahead with controversial plans to limit the number of students from England who can enrol at universities in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, rejecting opposition from the devolved administrations. Education ministers from Scotland and Wales angrily denounced the move, which they said was designed to stop damaging competition for students among English universities but could instead destabilise their own institutions. Michelle Donelan, the higher education minister for England, held meetings throughout the day with her counterparts from the devolved governments, but refused to back down on the policy. Kirsty Williams, the Welsh education minister, said after meeting Donelan: “I disagree strongly with England’s approach on this matter. “I respect decision-making in and for England, just as I do for the other governments in the UK. Quite simply, I expect the same respect from the minister. I will continue to consider my options.” Richard Lochhead, Scotland’s higher education minister, said the plan was “deeply disappointing”. “It is completely unnecessary and could add further damage to the sector, given that around 10% of current enrolments are from England,” he said, and called on the UK government to work with the devolved administrations to find a solution. Last year 26,700 students from England enrolled at a Scottish higher education institution, accounting for 10% of total enrolments. But just 9,205 Scottish students enrolled at English universities. Scottish students studying in Scotland can apply to have their tuition fees paid for, but are charged in full if they study in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, whereas students from the rest of the UK must pay tuition fees if they study in Scotland. The cap is intended to stop what the Department for Education regards as damaging competition for students between universities in England, who were seeking to recruit more UK students to replace the international students staying away because of the coronavirus outbreak. The cap applied in England would be each institution’s previous forecast intake, plus 5%. Donelan did not address the complaints, but said after the meetings: “The measures seek to ensure students have the widest possible variety and most suitable places to study in the coming academic year, while avoiding harmful over-recruitment among providers, which could go against the interests of students and the sector. “The controls will make adjustments to take account of offers already accepted before 1 June, and will make best use of taxpayer funding to support students.” The details show that the UK government intends to enforce the cap – which would limit devolved universities to growth of 6.5% in students from England – by passing new legislation allowing it to deduct the amount of tuition paid to an offending university the following year. The government in England is also to steer more student places towards high-performing universities, such as those in the Russell Group of leading research institutions, in an effort to restrict so-called “low quality” courses. The DfE revealed that only a select group with the strongest graduate outcomes will be able to bid for bonus places from a pot of 5,000, including institutions with low drop-out rates and those with at least three-quarters of their graduates working in “high-skilled employment”. An additional pot of 5,000 places for nursing, midwifery and other healthcare courses such as physiotherapy would also be open to bids, without restriction.",education
"Thousands of children returned to schools across England for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown began in March, but many others remained at home because of parental concerns and warnings from some councils that it is still too early to reopen more widely. This week marks the start of the government’s phased reopening of schools in England, with pupils in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 returning to classes from 1 June, but a survey of school leaders suggested about half of the 2 million pupils entitled to return this week would not turn up. Many school leaders were planning to hold training days to prepare for wider opening to more pupils this week and next, but among those headteachers who opened to more pupils on Monday was Matt Alcock, of Caldecote primary school in Braunstone, Leicester, who welcomed back about a third of his reception and year 1 pupils, and half of year 6. Alcock’s school remained open throughout the lockdown, catering for up to 70 children of key workers and vulnerable pupils. Normally the three-form entry primary would be buzzing with more than 600 pupils, but on Monday about 140 attended. “I’ve got mixed emotions. It’s a shame we could not get more in,” Alcock said. “I’m hoping that will remedy itself over time. “But there’s a sense of joy today, because the school is up and running in a more traditional capacity. It was great to see so many parents this morning. It’s been really nice to see them back. We know everything looks and feels very different. “But it’s just nice to see kids outside playing, doing what they do well. It’s been interesting to see. They are naturally self-distancing.” Also open for children from the three specified year groups was Moorgate primary academy in Tamworth, Staffordshire, where about 70% of pupils turned up for classes. “It’s gone really smoothly,” said the headteacher, Jonathan Williams. “Obviously, it’s very different. Some children are no longer with their normal class teacher. Some of them have found that a bit tricky. There’s been a few tears this morning – not too many. Most children were very excited and happy about being back.” He said some parents had chosen to keep their children at home: “We’ve some parents who are not bringing children back for shielding reasons and health reasons – either the child or a member of the family has asthma or other conditions. “We’ve also got parents who feel the daily death rate is too high at the moment to send their children back.” The most challenging thing, Williams said, was ensuring physical distancing among the youngest pupils. He also said he thought it would be impossible to welcome back all year groups before the summer holiday, as the government had hoped, warning the building was at capacity. Christopher King, the chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools, says almost all of the 550 prep schools in England belonging to IAPS have opened to year six pupils on Monday morning. Those with nurseries or pre-prep are also opening to reception and year one age groups, with what King calls a mixture of enthusiasm and apprehension. “The vast majority of prep schools in England are open today, apart from a few that are opening tomorrow. They are enthusiastic about reopening, but for staff and parents there is a degree of apprehension particularly because of the younger year groups and the difficulty in social distancing,” King said. Like state schools, prep schools remained open for the children of key workers and to provide remote learning for the rest of their pupils. Initial reports of unhappy parents led to many private schools cutting their fees by 10-20% for this term. A number of councils remain opposed to the government’s 1 June reopening, including the Conservative-controlled Lancashire county council, which advised its schools not to reopen. It said the government’s test-and-trace programme “is not at a state of readiness to respond to Covid-19 community setting outbreaks in a timely manner. “Furthermore, we are not confident that adjustments to the current measures of the lockdown policy will not risk a second peak of infections locally.”",education
"The government may be forced to drop plans for all primary school pupils in England to spend at least a month in class before the start of the summer holidays, as headteachers welcoming back the first groups of pupils following lockdown warned that the idea was “ridiculous”. The initial phase of the government’s controversial reopening plans got off to a patchy start with many primary schools remaining closed to further pupils. For those that opened, attendance was as low as 40% in some, rising to 70% elsewhere. In some regions, as few as one in four state primary schools were reported to be open to more pupils on Monday than before, and just one in 10 in some local authorities. Most schools have remained open during the crisis for children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, but from Monday primary schools across England were asked by the government to open more widely and admit pupils in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6, despite opposition from teaching unions and some scientific advisers. While media coverage showed returning children queueing 2 metres apart outside their primary schools for the first time since the gates closed on 20 March, it was clear that many parents were not ready to send their children back and some councils advised against premature reopening to more pupils. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said reports from members suggested the picture on the ground was “very mixed”, depending on differing local authority approaches, space constraints and staff availability. “This means some schools will not open this week, and there will be schools which are simply unable to bring in all the eligible year groups, that is reception, Year 1 and Year 6,” he said. “The expected level of pupil attendance is also highly variable, and we are hearing that it ranges anywhere between around 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils. It is likely this will increase as time goes on and more parents become confident about sending their children to school.” While there were no definitive figures on the number of schools that opened more widely and pupil attendance, a survey carried out by the Teacher Tapp app found that just 26% of state primary teachers said their school would open to more pupils on Monday – a figure close to that suggested by government sources last week. But as this week progresses, more than 50% of state primary teachers said their school will have reopened by Friday, and by next Monday the proportion will have risen to more than three-quarters of schools. While school leaders were satisfied with the plans for physical distancing they were able to put in place for the year groups due to return first, a number told the Guardian they were “at capacity” and there was no way they could fit all primary year groups in before the summer holidays. “It’s not going to happen,” said Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which runs nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire. For most schools, who are having to split classes into groups of less than 15, there will not be enough space. “It’s ridiculous. It’s not possible,” he said. A BBC poll of 2,350 primary governors from the National Governance Association found that three-quarters thought it unlikely that all pupils would be able to return before the summer. Previously, the government made plain in its coronavirus recovery plan that it wanted “all primary school children [in England] to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible”. But in a sign that they are backing away from the proposal, the prime minister’s spokesman said it remained “under review” and added that the government accepted that some primary schools would not be able to reopen on Monday. “It’s hugely important that children do have the opportunity to get back into school and to learn but we are doing this in a very cautious and safe way. We fully understand that there will be some schools who feel that they need more time to prepare.” The spokesman also indicated that there was government backing for a call from Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, for children to get catch-up tuition during the summer holidays. “We are [looking at] what additional measures may be required to ensure every child has the support they need, including over the summer,” he said.  The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, acknowledged continuing safety concerns among parents. “I recognise there may continue to be some nervousness among families, but I want to reassure parents – and those working in schools and nurseries – that the welfare of children and staff continues to be at the heart of all of our considerations,” he said.",education
"The government in Westminster will limit the number of students from England who can go to university in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland next year, leading to accusations that it is “trampling on devolution”. As part of its plans to cap the number of undergraduates that universities in England can teach in 2020-21, the Department for Education (DfE) is also to announce on Monday that it will extend the cap to include English students applying to higher education outside England. The new policy will restrict the number of students from England that, for instance, the University of St Andrews and Queen’s University Belfast could admit. The move has provoked “considerable anger” and opposition from the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which wanted a UK-wide approach to stop damaging competition for students between institutions seeking to fill empty places left as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, said England’s proposals were “regrettable” and cut across efforts to coordinate responses by all four nations. In a letter to Michelle Donelan, the DfE’s universities minister, Williams wrote: “I am deeply concerned that you have chosen to place a control on Welsh institutions rather than work with the Welsh government to achieve a solution that is compatible with devolution. “I do not believe this approach [is] in the best interests of the UK as a whole, and demonstrates a surprising unwillingness to respect complementary policies in each nation.” Williams also hinted the government in Wales was prepared to respond further: “My chief concern is to protect the interests of Welsh students and Welsh higher education institutions. I will consider the consequences for Wales arising from the UK government’s policy and take further action to ensure that those interests are protected.” Richard Lochhead, Scotland’s minister for higher education and science, said: “We do not support these proposals and they should not apply to Scotland. “That view is widely shared within the Scottish higher education sector, given this proposal came like a bolt out of the blue this week with no consultation generating considerable anger. “Putting up barriers that stop students going to Scottish universities is in principle wrong and at this late stage is disruptive and unreasonable.” A Welsh source described the DfE’s move as “trampling on devolution” but said that the government in Cardiff was not going to penalise students. A DfE spokesperson said: “We will shortly be setting out further details on how the student number controls will be implemented, including how they will work in the devolved administrations.” The DfE said its aim was to bring stability to the higher education sector, during “an incredibly difficult time for universities and their students” since the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown closed campuses. With education a devolved area of policy, each government is able to set its own tuition fees and student support. Scotland does not charge tuition fees for students attending its own universities but students from England are charged £9,250 a year, as are Scots who travel to England. Placing a temporary cap on institutions in England and Wales has been sketched out by the Universities UK lobby group, and is to be based on forecast numbers plus an additional 5% growth. Wales is still consulting with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales over mitigating the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, which is likely to cause a fall in the numbers of international students studying in the UK. There are fears that sought-after institutions will recruit more UK students to compensate for the lost international applicants, setting off a lop-sided admissions round that leaves some universities with far fewer students than expected.",education
"My friend Susy Powlesland, who has died aged 90, was a radical educationist. With her husband, John, she set up the alternative Kirkdale school in south London in the mid 1960s. The school adhered to principles of self-sufficiency, equality and creative learning, focusing on the particular interests of the individual child. It ran for over a decade and created a community that still exists today. Susy was an only child born to Jewish parents, Emilie (nee Preis) and Felix Michlowitz, in Vienna, where her father ran a watchmaking and jewellery business. When she was nine the family managed to get on the last train out of Austria before the border was sealed at the approach of the second world war. They were billeted initially in London but were driven out by the blitz, and taken in by a woman in Reading, where Susy never felt fully at home. She attended local schools, and after leaving Kendrick girls’ grammar school at 16 trained as a nursery nurse in Reading, then was accepted for teacher training at the residential Gypsy Hill Training College, in Kingston, Surrey. She taught at primary schools in Stratford, east London, and in Leicestershire. She met John Powlesland when they worked together at Forest School camps. They married in 1954 and later settled in London. Susy was keenly attuned to racial and religious intolerance, and had a passion in particular for the underdog and outsider. In his 2007 book The Islamist, Ed Husain describes a terrifying incident when a group of National Front thugs threatened him and other Muslim school children in a local playground. Susy and the other teachers raced to the side of the children and roared at the shaven-headed bigots. Susy lived in Tower Hamlets for more than 40 years. During her headship at Sir William Burrough school (1980-95) she had a huge impact on the children and families. She went out of her way to support newly arrived Bangladeshi children, especially those without immediate family. In the 1980s, she learnt some Sylheti and travelled to Bangladesh to learn more about the cultural background of her pupils. In 1984 she was the driving force behind the establishment of the Limehouse Housing Project, whose chief aim was to improve the lives of black and minority ethnic communities through the provision of good quality housing. In 2003 she co-founded a new local charity called the Globe Community Project, which aims to provide activities for young and old residents from diverse communities. She was appointed MBE in 2007 for services to BAME people in east London. After retirement, she became interested in meditation and Buddhism and was ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order in 2003, taking the name Shraddhapuspa (Flower of Faith). She brought her dedication to children and families into her Buddhist life and remained active in her charity roles and her Buddhist teaching commitments until the final weeks of her life. John died in 1977. Susy is survived by their children, Stephen, Helen, Francis and Ayen, and grandchildren, Zak, Jasmin, Zain and Zachran.",education
"The Department for Education recently released an overview of advice it received from Public Health England, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and its subgroup the Children’s Task and Finish Working Group – although specific evidence from these latter groups has yet to be published. The new report points out that in general children with Covid-19 have a far milder form of the disease than adults and that, at least for children up to the age of 13, they are far less likely to show symptoms. It also notes there is some, albeit very limited evidence, that such children are less likely to become infected than adults, but it is unclear whether they transmit the virus less than adults. The report also acknowledges other countries: many in Europe have begun reopening schools with few problems, at least so far. Indeed the secretary of state for education, Gavin Williamson, has previously highlighted the lack of negative impacts in Denmark, where schools reopened in mid-April. However, experts found the “R” number – the effective reproduction number – did nudge upwards towards 1 in the first two weeks of reopening in Denmark before falling once again, while some have said that comparisons with Denmark are problematic, with Denmark having had far fewer deaths (under 550 at the time of writing). Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said that another consideration is that there have been few recorded cases of adults catching the disease from children, while there have been no outbreaks in schools around the world – although that could be down to children showing few symptoms. But, he said, teachers may be at risk from other teachers – as is the case between workers in other jobs. The new report notes it is very difficult for young children to stay 2 metres apart, but says measures such as hand washing and emphasising the need to use and bin tissues are important. Frequent cleaning of surfaces, using staggered break times and changing classroom layouts could be used – although each school is asked to carry out its own risk assessment before opening. Face masks or coverings, however, are not recommended, with the report noting that children and staff in schools will only mix in small and consistent groups. Teachers will not be expected to use personal protective equipment (PPE) unless that is already used, or a child develops symptoms of Covid-19 and contact is necessary while they are cared for before returning home. The Department for Education has said that all schoolchildren, staff and members of their households will be able to have a test for Covid-19 – if they show symptoms. If children or staff test positive, all those they mix with in the school will have to self-isolate for 14 days. However as the report itself notes, many children have very mild symptoms or none at all. No. As Boris Johnson outlined in his address on 10 May, the plan refers to England and the first children to return will be children in nurseries, reception and year 1, as well as those in the last year of primary school, year 6. These groups, it has been mooted, will return on 1 June, while other schoolchildren will return to classrooms in the weeks that follow – however this timetable is provisional. Children or staff with pre-exisiting medical conditions that could make them very vulnerable to Covid-19 will not be expected to return to school. Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, said these particular age groups had largely been picked to return on “educational and welfare grounds”. Children can catch coronavirus, but the vast majority have had only mild symptoms, with under 2% of hospital admissions for Covid-19 in the UK among children under the age of 18, and death very rare. There has been a small number of cases around the world of children with a potentially deadly inflammatory syndrome that has been linked to Covid-19. However experts have stressed it is rare, affecting only one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. Dr Liz Whittaker, a clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, has previously said the condition “shouldn’t be a factor when we reopen the schools”. Michael Tildesley of Warwick University, who works on models of the spread of diseases, said it was a possibility, depending on what happens with R. “If we do start to see the reproduction number going above 1 and cases climbing again we should be prepared to take the decision to close schools again,” he said.",education
"My aunt, Christine Nuttall, who has died aged 89, worked for four decades in the field of teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL), in eight countries across the world. Her influential book, Teaching Reading Skills in a Foreign Language, remains an essential text for both TEFL students and teachers. Born in Holcombe Brook, near Bury, Lancashire (now Greater Manchester), she was the daughter of Alfred Nuttall, a stockbroker, and Marjorie (nee Broome), a teacher. Alfred died of pneumonia when she was five and her sister, Barbara, was one. Chris attended Bury grammar school, before studying English and philosophy at St Andrews University, graduating in 1953. She followed this with an MA in linguistics at Manchester University. Chris’s career in TEFL began in the 1950s when she worked in Finland for a year, teaching English to adults and learning Finnish. That experience fuelled her love of travel and diverse cultures. Wherever she went, she immersed herself in the local culture. Following her year in Finland, she spent four years in Nigeria lecturing in English, and studying the Hausa language. At the beginning of the 1960s, Chris joined the British Council, and was appointed ELO (English language officer), for Nigeria. In 1969 she was posted to Milan for a year. This was followed in the 1970s by ELO postings in Ghana and Iran. In 1978 she became ELO in Malaysia, where she spent six years and made many enduring friendships. She also spent some time in China and in Namibia. She was appointed OBE in 1982. In 1985 Chris was seconded to the University of Edinburgh as lecturer in the department of applied linguistics. She was also director of the university’s MSc in English language teaching. She retired in 1989. Chris bought a cottage in the rural valley of Woodland near Broughton-in-Furness, south Cumbria, in 1966 at an auction. She loaned it to friends for holidays while she was abroad but went to live there when she retired from the British Council. Her passions were international cuisine and opera. She was also a keen ornithologist, loved nature and was on the development committee for the Cumbria Wildlife Trust. She is survived by Barbara, her two nieces, Judy and me, and a nephew, Bill.

"British universities face a potential £760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. The results, released by the University and College Union (UCU), come as universities are wrestling with how to reopen campuses for students while protecting them from Covid-19. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year, offering “blended learning” that mixes online teaching with tutorials and in-person seminars where possible. Based on the survey data, the consultancy London Economics estimated that about 17% of prospective UK students would not enrol in September if coronavirus restrictions remained, costing the sector £763m in lost tuition fees and teaching grants. The National Union of Students responded by reiterating its calls for university students to get tuition fee refunds for the disruption they have suffered due to the coronavirus outbreak or be allowed to repeat the year for free. Zamzam Ibrahim, the NUS’s president, said the union welcomed the decision by universities to prioritise student safety in the light of Covid-19 outbreaks. But she said that while next year’s students should be told what to expect in terms of online learning and campus conditions, those who had to endure this year’s disruption deserved a better deal. “Students need clarity as to what they can expect from the next academic year in order for them to make informed choices and all staff must continue to be paid regardless of this decision,” Ibrahim said. “The government needs to move quickly to work with the higher education sector to ensure that all students are able to receive quality education next year and have the resources they need to engage with online learning. “Students must be given the opportunity to redo this year at no extra cost, or to have their course fees reimbursed or written off.”  Universities receive about 530,000 applications each year, of which about 30,000, or 6%, choose to defer their starts. But the UCU poll of 516 applicants conducted by YouthSight suggests twice as many could defer this year even if campuses are operating as normal. Gavan Conlon of London Economics said: “The analysis illustrates that there continues to be a huge amount of uncertainty amongst prospective students in respect of the potential higher education offer in September. “If the current deferral rates as a result of the pandemic are borne out, then the financial consequences facing universities will be even more severe than those identified recently. There are a lot of jobs at risk, both in universities and in the wider local and regional economies where universities are based.” Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said: “I understand that this an incredibly difficult time for students, so it is vital that universities are clear to students about how courses will be delivered in the coming year. I would urge students to think carefully about all their options and make informed decisions that best serve their futures.”  The survey also found that one in four applicants wanted to change their applications and switch institutions through the clearing process in August, which UCU said could lead to a “summer of chaos” as institutions compete to attract students. Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said she hoped the “shocking” results would persuade vice-chancellors to join the union in lobbying the government for more support. “The current wait-and-see approach from ministers is exacerbating the crisis for prospective students and putting tens of thousands of jobs at universities and in the wider economy at risk,” Grady said. The survey asked applicants: “Suppose that the university you have applied to or received an offer from announces that it will not be operating as usual in the first term in autumn 2020, with many classes delivered online, most university activities severely restricted, and many Covid-19 social distancing restrictions still in place, to what extent would you still intend to go to university in autumn 2020?” Seventy-two per cent of respondents said they were likely to attend. If universities were operating as usual with all classes in person and “few if any” social distancing restrictions, 13% said they would still defer starting. Universities also face potential losses running into billions of pounds if international students stay away. A survey by Quacquarelli Symonds found that 49% of international students from China say they do not want to enrol this year if their courses begin online.",education
"The proportion of black British school leavers going to university in England has fallen for the first time in a decade, just as the government prepares to limit the courses available for young people wanting to study in higher education. The Department for Education figures show that efforts to recruit more students from some ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups – including white British pupils receiving free school meals – stalled or went backwards, according to the most recent data, even as the overall proportion of young people enrolling as students continued to rise. While the other main ethnic groups all saw a year-on-year increase in the proportion at university by the age of 19, the rate of black British students fell from close to 60% in 2018 to 59% in 2019, the first reverse after a decade of progress. The figures also show that despite the rapid expansion in students taught by the UK’s most prestigious universities, some groups continue to struggle to gain access: only 5% of British students from black Caribbean families gained places in “high tariff” universities, compared with more than 10% of all students. Graeme Atherton, the director of the university access charity Neon HE, said the decline in black student enrolments was likely the result of a shift in priorities by England’s universities regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), meaning that universities have put less funding into working with school pupils. Atherton said the OfS recently emphasised the attainment gap and student retention, “so universities didn’t include increasing the number of black students in their access and participation plans, apart from high tariff institutions, where it’s being driven by a public discourse pressuring them to have more black students”. Among disadvantaged students, there were fewer enrolments to courses by young white British men on free school meals (FSM), the proportion dipping for the first time in seven years to just 12%. Disadvantaged white British boys and girls remain the least likely group to progress to higher education, other than children from Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller communities. Only 2% of black Caribbean and white British boys eligible for FSM gained entry to selective universities. Overall the “progression gap” between school leavers on FSM and others widened to the biggest gap for 12 years. Nearly half of those not receiving FSM went into higher education, while only one in four on FSM did so. The new figures come after ministers recently declared there was “too much focus on getting students through the door” into university, while the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said it was an “absurd mantra” for 50% of all young people to go into higher education. The government is preparing a series of policies on higher and further education, “rebalancing” funding and students towards skills and vocational training, as well as limiting what it sees as “low value” courses with poor rates of graduate employment. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said earlier this month: “Quite frankly, our young people have been taken advantage of, particularly those without a family history of going to university. Instead some have been left with the debt of an investment that didn’t pay off in any sense.” Atherton said the government’s rhetoric could result in fewer students from poor backgrounds going to university. “If we start to see strong messages being given to universities and particularly to schools that higher education is not a great priority, that will see these gaps widen,” Atherton said. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “We must ensure that all those who have the ability, attainment and desire to pursue higher education are given high quality options that will lead to the good graduate jobs that will transform their lives.”",education
"Fears of a faltering jobs market has sparked an unprecedented rush of people signing up to become teachers, which could wipe out England’s deficit in classroom staff for the first time in eight years. Figures released by Ucas, the university admissions network, showed more than 21,000 graduates had applied to teacher training programmes since the start of the coronavirus lockdown, a rise of 65% on the last five years. From mid-June until mid-July alone, the rate of applications raced up by 91% compared with 2019. Most of the growth since lockdown has come from female applicants. The Education Policy Institute forecasts that applications will continue to rise until course deadlines close in September, with an extra 11,000 trainee teachers likely to sign up. “The pandemic has caused unparalleled disruption to every area of education. However, there appears to be a silver lining in the form of a big boost to the teaching profession in England. These trends are welcome, given the government has fallen short of its recruitment targets for a number of years,” said Joshua Fullard, senior researcher at the EPI. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, said: “Teaching has always been an attractive career, but it’s good to see a continued surge in the number of people looking to enter the classroom.” Nansi Ellis, assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said trainees who qualified during the lockdown were struggling to find positions for the next school year, as turnover is lower among current teachers. “Losing these teachers will be a significant cost to the taxpayer, which is why the NEU is calling on government to follow the example of Scotland by centrally employing newly qualified teachers from this September, so that the needs of schools are met and talent is not wasted,” Ellis said. Other data released by the DfE showed that the diversity of teachers had improved in secondary schools, where 16% of all teachers are from minority ethnic backgrounds, in line with the overall population, for the first time. “This is a positive development, but these trends could be affected by the oncoming recession. The previous financial crisis resulted in a decrease in the diversity of the teaching profession, and there are early indications that this is transpiring again,” said Fullard. In primary schools, 10.6% of teachers are from ethnic minority backgrounds, compared with 8.5% in 2010. Only 14% of primary school teachers are male, while the proportion of secondary school teachers who are male has fallen from 37.7% in 2010 to 35.5%.",education
"Teacher and home educator Anna Dusseau was happy to give advice to parents on home schooling in a radio interview during the Covid-19 lockdown – until the presenter cut her off mid-stream. He said he didn’t think listeners would be interested in what she had to say and severed the phone link. Undaunted, Dusseau, an English teacher, is about to publish a book of advice outlining her approach to home schooling her own children, which includes 100 learning activities parents can try. With some families afraid to send their children back to school in September and the teacher unions warning that it may not even be safe to reopen some schools, parents are likely to need all the help they can get to keep their children motivated. So what went wrong with the interview? With the school closures, the presenter wanted tips on how parents could keep an unwilling child’s nose to the grindstone. Dusseau, however, doesn’t believe in forcing children to learn and urges parents to adopt an “unschooling” approach, at least until the children recover from what she sees as the coercion of the curriculum in schools in England. “Many children’s lives are so busy with school journeys, subject changes, after-school clubs and homework that they have little time to think, or to take ownership of the life they are leading,” she says. “They spend an awful lot of time being ‘processed’ by well-intentioned adults.”  “What home schoolers want for their children is space to grow, space to develop themselves, discover the world, find out what they are interested in, who they really are and what they want to do in life and then the academic qualifications that will get them there,” she says. “There are lots of parents who already home educate and you don’t have to be supermum or dad to do it,” she says. That said, she accepts that some families prefer a school-at-home approach and can do it with great success. “For this, you will be following a curriculum and meeting targets throughout the academic year, perhaps with a timetable or daily window in which study happens and using resources such as workbooks, textbooks or online learning,” she says. In fact, teachers taking their children out of school is becoming a trend, she claims. “Plenty of teachers leave the profession each year, and plenty – like me – decide to home school their own children. They know what goes on in schools. This is a significant trend that the government appears to deliberately ignore, perhaps because it says so much,” she says. Dusseau has three children aged one, four and six with her French husband, a computer network engineer. They both worked in London – she at a large, west London academy – until two years ago, when they left city life for a converted barn in rural Bedfordshire. In her book, The Case for Home Schooling, Dusseau advocates what became known in the 70s and 80s as “discovery learning”, the idea that children learn best by asking questions and following their instincts, be it staring into rock pools or looking up at the sky. The pandemic has been an unsettling time and children need space, she says. She doesn’t teach the times tables, believing her children will learn maths through everyday activities such as cooking and through talking with them about numbers. Instead of five-year-olds studying the Great Fire of London, they should be reading comics, she believes. Sadly, home education has been given a bad name by the formal worksheets and exercises sent home by many schools in the lockdown, she believes, but at least parents now know the kind of pressures their children face every day. In fact she goes further, blaming today’s test- and results-driven English school system for contributing to the ills of society. Dusseau became a home schooler “by accident” after she witnessed what she thought was bullying in the playground but what the teacher saw as normal bickering. And after another incident involving her daughter and an older girl, she says the decision was made. It was not the only problem she had with the school. She disliked the lists of 10 of the 100 most used words in the English language that five-year-olds brought home to learn for weekly tests and she was worried that her daughter seemed to dislike reading. To be fair, her own experience of school as a child has also influenced her. She was a school refusenik and missed a lot of time at primary school, which was allowed in that more relaxed era because she was making good progress. It was when she got to middle school that she began to rebel because she disliked being corralled into learning what the school wanted her to know. After taking their daughter out of school, at first the Dusseaus were looking for somewhere with a different approach, such as a Steiner school. Then, after a few months, they realised their daughter had changed from hating reading aloud to “fluently reading any book from the shelf to her brothers at bedtime”. Last night it was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, she says. “Our son was similarly influenced by the change in dynamic. He began taking anything he could open with a screwdriver up to the kitchen table, to disassemble it. I was quite astonished. And this was when we first thought seriously about home schooling as a long-term prospect,” she explains. Given her dislike of school, why did she go into teaching? It’s an obvious question and she’s ready for it. “It is astonishing – incredible, really – the number of teachers I’ve met who despised school themselves, just as I did. And yet we come back to it; apparently choosing to spend the rest of our working lives governed by changeover bells and despotic leadership, like some form of school-based Stockholm syndrome. We inflict on our students, year on year, what was done to us,” she says. She did well at school in spite of it. “I got one of the best sets of GCSE results in the country because I was good at passing tests,” she says. Her teachers wanted her to apply to Oxford or Cambridge but she chose Birmingham because she thought it would be more fun, dropped out of an English degree and then went back to complete her degree near home at the University of Exeter. She did her PGCE at the Institute of Education in London. “I’ve met quite a few teachers with a similar profile to me, who describe themselves as reluctant students turned teachers,” she says. “I think you have to debunk the idealised view of the profession. This mythology of people having a calling to be a teacher is not real. It is just a job and many people in teaching are quite ordinary people. Not everyone is an exceptional academic who can spout forth about their subject. It is not actually like that in the classroom, it is quite pedestrian,” she says. “I will happily home educate my children all the way through their education, if that is what they want to do. They always have free choice and we take their thoughts and feelings into account with every decision regarding their future.”  She knows she is lucky to have the money to home educate but claims it is not just a middle-class luxury. “I’m middle-income, middle-class and I’m not going to pretend to be anything else, but you will find a wide variety of people home educating their children. Increasingly children are being off-rolled from school so their parents have to do it,” she says. “We need more choice for parents, school isn’t for everybody.” The Case for Home Schooling will be published this month by Hawthorn Press.",education
"Calls for a review to add more black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) history to the English national curriculum have been turned down by the government, the Guardian has learned. Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said there were no plans to hold a review of the syllabus after 30 cross-party politicians wrote a letter demanding that black historians and leaders be asked to offer revisions to what is taught, as well as new topic ideas. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson, who led the appeal, accused ministers of being “tone deaf” to their request, which she said would try to give more space to the historical injustices that have led to racism. Responding by letter, Gibb said education played a vital role in tackling inequality and that the Department for Education had been discussing BAME history with different organisations. He added that it would continue to explore what else could be done to support its teaching in the classroom. Gibb listed the lives of Mary Seacole and Rosa Parks; the achievements of early civilisations such as Benin in west Africa between 900 and 1300; and the transatlantic slave trade and its abolition as examples of subject areas that could be considered by teachers. Moran, who was formerly a teacher, said: “The Black Lives Matter movement has not only exposed the inequalities faced by black people in the UK, but it has galvanised people right across the country who are desperate for change. “If we are to tackle the institutional racism in our society, the curriculum must not only be diverse, but we must equip young people with an understanding of the historical injustices that have led to that very racism. As a former teacher, I know just how fundamental education can be in driving change in our society. “The government’s rejection of a review of our curriculum demonstrates their reluctance to follow their platitudes with any meaningful action.” New topics backed by the politicians could have covered the Windrush generation and the positive contribution people of all ethnicities have made to Britain. Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has said that the curriculum must be improved. The Black Curriculum, a social enterprise, suggests that black history be taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain and 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation. Sir Peter Bottomley, a former Tory minister and the father of the house, was among those who signed the letter asking for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global BLM protests over the police killing of George Floyd. Another former Tory minister, Dan Poulter, also signed it, as well as Labour’s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas. Gibb said that, as part of a broad curriculum, pupils should be taught about different societies and that this can include the “voices and experience” of BAME people. “This can include historical examples of black Romans, Tudors, Stuarts, Georgians and Victorians, and of course extend to other minority ethnic groups. “It can also include the role of the countries of the former British empire in both world wars, and the part black and minority ethnic people have played in shaping the UK in the 20th century. I believe there is clear scope to teach the shared history we have,” he said. The Welsh government is carrying out a review into the way black and minority ethnic history is taught in schools ahead of the introduction of a new curriculum in 2022. It is being led by Professor Charlotte Williams OBE, a leading academic who has written about ethnic diversity in Wales. ",education
"Increasing numbers of middle-class parents are planning to desert state schools this coming September, over anxieties their children have “fallen behind” private school pupils during lockdown and growing fears about the threat of further disruption to state education next year. The Independent Schools Association told the Observer that it has noticed an upsurge in the number of what it describes as “high-aspirational, worried” parents of state school pupils looking for private school places in September, while the Independent Association of Prep Schools said demand had increased considerably during recent weeks. More than a dozen headteachers at private schools contacted by the Observer said they had seen an extraordinary surge in inquiries from “unhappy” parents of state school pupils, with several schools across the country reporting a 20-30% increase in demand for places.  In April, just 3% of state-funded primary and 6% of state-funded secondary schools managed to provide “live” online lessons for students with their teachers, compared to 59% of private primary and 72% of private secondary schools, according to a survey by Teacher Tapp.  “Many affluent middle-class families sending their children to state schools have become aware and often concerned about the digital divide between state and private sector,” said Diane Reay, emeritus professor of education at Cambridge University. “Fleeing to the private sector is an easier option than campaigning for state schools to be properly resourced and equipped, which is what should be happening. The state sector has always been the poor relation in education – around 25% of education spending goes on the 7% who are privately educated – but more middle-class flight will impoverish the sector more.” Reay warned that the social class gap between private and state school pupils will widen as a result of the pandemic, and a compounding parallel gap in achievement will also open up. “It is this that middle-class parents are becoming alarmed about. If the 7% are about to accelerate and amplify their educational advantage, then middle-class parents who have always felt ambivalent about the state sector will want to join them. That’s going to entrench class inequalities in education, as the privately educated move even further away in terms of their privilege and advantage.” Andrew McCleave, headteacher of Ballard School, an independent day school in the New Forest, said parents had been impressed by the school’s decision to provide a full timetable of lessons during lockdown, with the majority delivered by teachers online. As soon as the school closed, “we knew that we would be able to deliver our education that way. Our pupils have greater access to technology [than state school pupils]: if we want to do a Zoom lesson, we can pretty much guarantee that every one of our pupils will be able to access it, while state schools won’t be able to.” He pointed out that private schools also have much smaller classes than state schools, and added that, compared to state schools he knew of, more of his teachers were actually available to teach online. “If staff are in school supervising key workers’ children, they can’t be delivering online lessons to children who aren’t in school. We had a few doctors among our parents, but we didn’t have a lot of key workers’ children in. That meant our staff could deliver live lessons to everyone.” He agreed with Reay that inequalities are being cemented and an academic gap is opening up between private and state school pupils. “There’s no way that the children who are getting online lessons from independent schools are not going to be at an advantage … Because they’ve been taught and others haven’t.” Jules White, headteacher and leader of the Worth Less? campaign for more state school funding, said the idea that state schools had somehow failed parents and pupils was “very odd”. “Throughout the crisis, state schools were instrumental in protecting children of low-paid key workers, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs. On much, much less funding than private schools, families of vulnerable children – and many others – were supported.” The Department for Education said the government had invested more than £100m supporting remote education, and launched Oak National Academy to provide online lessons to pupils during lockdown. A spokesperson said: “Schools and teachers have gone to great lengths over recent months to support and educate children at home and in the classroom.” He added: “Our £1bn Covid catch-up fund will help all children to make up for the impact lost time in school has had on their education.”",education
"After the government’s U-turn over the full reopening of schools before September in England, parents remain divided about whether to send their children back. The Guardian spoke to some parents about their decision. My son is supposed to be sitting his A-levels next year. I’ve got a friend whose son is at private school, and our children don’t get nearly the same experience. There are subject areas where we haven’t really heard anything from the teachers, and work is being submitted with no feedback. My son is worried about it, he tells me there are some subjects where he just Googles the answer.  I’m worried about the impact on his education, but we are at high-risk for coronavirus – our family is Asian/Pakistani, and my partner is shielding. We’ve decided my son is going back to school for one day a week, which is what the school have offered. Obviously there is a worry, but he wants to go, and I don’t feel I can say no to that. Sarah (not her real name), 50, London My 14-year-old child is a Send student (special educational needs and disabilities) and she’s really happy at home. I know this isn’t the case for everyone, but lots of children are really flourishing, particularly Send pupils who are in mainstream schools. My daughter attends a special school that is fantastic for autism. They have far fewer children but their needs are very different. Those children can be impulsive, they may need physical contact, and not be able to socially distance.  Everywhere else has social distancing measures, but you just can’t do that at school. Children will naturally gravitate together and I know as a teacher myself that after months off the first thing they want to do is hug you.  I’m certainly not in a rush for my child to go back. While schools have been brilliant, I feel dismayed that this government is willing to play Russian roulette with our children and school staff. It feels like children are pawns in this game. Susan Wright, 45, north-west England  There’s been very little direct contact with the school. There’s no sense that our daughter’s work is being marked, and she’s not getting any feedback, so it’s becoming really difficult to stay motivated. We try our best, but with our jobs we can’t dedicate the time to her education that we’d like. At first it was a novelty, like a summer holiday, but now we can see there’s a withdrawal. She’s our only child, so there isn’t even that sibling contact, and that’s really difficult. She’s in touch with her close mates, but she’s missing out on the wider, social importance of being with other children on a day-to-day basis.  We can see the damage that not going to school is having far more clearly than the perceived damage of the virus. Gary Jones, 43, Birmingham My daughter is in year 1, and is too young to operate her iPad alone, for things like Microsoft Teams classes. I have an extremely busy work schedule, and it was totally impossible for me to do work and home-guided learning. The isolation and lack of interaction with other children was also extremely important to me. She’s five years old and an only child, so she needs and wanted to be in a school setting with her friends. As soon as the opportunity to resend her was available, I grabbed it with both hands.  After about a week she told me she didn’t want to go to school because it wasn’t the same. She didn’t have her usual class teacher, she wasn’t in the same group as before, or in the same physical space, and didn’t have access to the same facilities. Some of her closer friends were in the other bubble. But a day later, when I picked her up, she was bouncing and skipping again. Teaching is a profession, and it’s not possible to imitate that. I found it absolutely gruelling, start to finish. For so many of us, the choice is just not there. Yvonne Ndege, 41, London I have one daughter who is adopted, and foster three girls. They’re studying for A-levels and GCSEs, and one is transitioning to high school, but no one is telling me what to do. We had to ask school for laptops because the ones we had at home weren’t set up for home learning, but they only gave us one, so all four kids have to share. I’m really worried about the educational impact. Two of them have educational care plans, but that’s all been put on hold because they’re working remotely. Because they’re fostered, we were told the girls had to go to school throughout lockdown, but when they went in, they were told that if they had internet access at home, it was safer for them there. The government say they want the older girls to have some face-to-face teaching before the end of term, but we haven’t been told anything. As for my daughter, I’m not going to send her back. She came to me when she was young, but I don’t have her medical history for the years before she was with me. Kids need structure, so we’ve been doing our own curriculums as well as school work. They’re cooking, sewing, and getting to know themselves. We’ve been doing a lot of black history because the girls are from Africa, and building emotional intelligence during this time instead. Esi, 52, London My husband and I are key workers, so we had a place at school, but we were worried about sending them back. When I started a new job in late March, I really needed total headspace, and my colleagues encouraged me to take up a place. There were very few children in, my two kids, who are seven and nine, doubled the figures, and the headteacher told me about the provisions they had put in place to keep them safe, so I decided to send them in. When I picked them up on their first day, they were beaming, and told me it was way better than ‘mummy school’. I didn’t realise they needed to go back to school as much as they obviously did. Now other year groups have come back, they’re split into pods, sorted roughly by age, and my kids seem to be loving it. They have adjusted easily to new routines like a “soap train” for handwashing, and loved the sense of ownership of having their own dedicated desk and earphones. A lot of my mum friends say they’ve been discouraged from sending kids in to keep them safe, but I’m encouraging them to do it. Lesley Jay, 48, Sussex",education
"Becky Slack, 41, went into lockdown at her home in rural France alone – she’d split up with her husband not long before. “I’ve been very isolated for a long time and that’s given me lots of time for reflection about who I am, what I’m doing, and what I want to do with the rest of my life,” she says. After many long days alone with her thoughts, Slack, who has her own communications business, has decided to make a big change: she is moving to Brussels in September to study a master’s in political strategy and communication. “I decided to take the plunge and apply – lockdown has a lot to answer for,” she says.  The number of mature students at universities in the UK has been rising, according to Ucas, and the biggest increase seen this year, as of the January deadline, was with those aged 35 and over. It’s too early to assess the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on Ucas applications, but many would-be mature students say the pandemic has only increased their desire to study. Camilla Priede, from the University of Sheffield’s department of lifelong learning, which deals with mature students, says she’s seen “a real upsurge in applications” over the past few months. “It’s a promising sign that people are thinking more about lifelong learning, retraining and doing that thing they’ve always cared about,” she says.  A number of things could draw adults to university at the moment. For Slack, the pandemic has made her reassess her sense of purpose. “I was thinking, if I get ill, what have I done with my life?” she says. “I’m now the most free I’ve ever been as an adult [and have a] general sense of frustration at what’s going on in the world.” Rather than venting her anger on social media, Slack wanted to do something practical. The pandemic has also made Nikky Cato, 41, consider going back to university. Cato has chronic fatigue syndrome and left university without a degree years ago, when she was denied reasonable adjustments. But as classes shift online, Cato feels universities have become more accessible and more willing to be flexible.  “Suddenly the pandemic hit and everyone’s like, look at us, we can do everything by Zoom,” she says. “I was half eye-rolling and half thinking there’s no point in being bitter when I can use the opportunity.” She’s now looking into part-time psychology degrees. The shift to online learning also suits Deborah Talbot, 53, who will begin a master’s in existential coaching at the New School of Psychotherapy and Counselling this year. “I was always a bit trapped indoors because I have lupus,” she says. “So it’s almost as if the world is catching up to me.” Financial concerns and loss of work could also persusde people to return to education in order to upskill or retrain. Talbot predicts her freelance work as a writer will be harder to obtain as we enter a recession. “It’s about a retirement plan and sustainability,” she says. Embarking on a university degree is also a big financial commitment, though. “At the moment I’m having to work and save really hard,” says Slack. “I’m definitely going in with a different mindset than when I did my first degree.” Psychologists say it’s not surprising some adult learners may decide to take the leap now. “The lockdown and coronavirus crisis has made [many of] us reflect on our lives, leading us to redefine our concept of success,” says Dr Rachel Allan, a chartered counselling psychologist based in Glasgow.  Claire Goodwin-Fee, a counsellor and psychotherapist, suggests lockdown has given us space to consider something different. “It has stripped away a lot of the excess things in our lives,” she says. Taking proactive steps, such as embarking on a degree, can also give us a sense of control, which is comforting amid so much uncertainty. Still, returning to university, or going for the first time, albeit online, can be nerve-racking. “I’m surprised by how anxious I am about going back to uni and being a beginner again,” Cato says. Slack, who previously did an undergraduate degree at the University of Salford, says she’s nervous too. “I’ve got a bit of impostor syndrome and worry I’m not as good as everyone else, or that I’ll just be the weird old person at the back of the classroom,” she says.  Many mature students opt to study part-time alongside work and other commitments. Nicki Wedgwood, 25, plans to do a part-time undergraduate degree in community development and public policy at Birkbeck, University of London on top of a full-time job at a debt advice charity. ‘I feel like we’re on the cusp of something and thought I want to use this time to study,” she says. “Online [learning] is more accessible and easier to fit around my full-time job.” Annette Baxter, a senior careers consultant at the University of Sheffield, says mature students have many strengths. “Often they come with far more focus,” she says. “They bring their life experience with them.” For Slack, the move to Brussels is both scary and exciting. “I’ll be 42 and going back into education so that’s kind of terrifying,” she says. But after so much reflection on who she is and what she wants, she’s looking forward to it. “I feel like it’s now or never.”",education
"Senior staff at Oxford University’s Oriel college backed plans to give legal protection to a memorial for Cecil Rhodes, weeks after seeking its removal during the Rhodes Must Fall protests. The college this week faced renewed protests demanding the removal of memorials to Rhodes, including a statue of the 19th-century imperialist who supported apartheid-style measures in southern Africa. However, emails obtained by the Guardian suggest senior college officials sought greater legal protection from student protests for a large plaque featuring Rhodes, which had earlier been described by Oriel as a “political tribute” to a man with “racist views”. An investigation has also raised questions for Historic England, which is responsible for advising on which statues and memorials are listed. The investigation found:  Historic England originally backed proposals to protect the Rhodes memorial. The organisation then attempted to find “pro-African” statues and buildings elsewhere in the UK that could be listed at the same time, in order to balance out any negative media coverage.  One of the most senior officials at Oriel college lobbied for legal protections for the Rhodes memorial, saying the colonialist was considered to be “one of the greatest educational philanthropists of modern times”.  Neil Mendoza, the current provost of Oriel college, backed awarding listed status to the Rhodes memorial while in a previous job as a Historic England commissioner. The plan to list the plaque in 2016 – at the height of the Rhodes Must Fall student protests – was backed by senior staff at Historic England. Dr Roger Bowdler, the organisation’s then director of listing, settled on a plan to protect the memorial plaque without publicly undermining his organisation’s efforts on diversity, according to emails obtained under environmental information regulations. He told colleagues the proposal was to wait “for the Rhodes […] flak to reduce”, then take the advice of a colleague who “wisely wishes to accompany it with some pro-African listings”. He said colleagues should do their best to think of appropriate “pro-African” memorials elsewhere in the UK to balance out potential PR damage of being seen to back Rhodes. “Now there’s a challenge – put your thinking cap on! Apparently there is a bust of Mandela on the South Bank [in London] for starters …,” he wrote. The plan was reviewed by Historic England’s senior commissioners, who backed the proposal to protect a plaque that praises “the great services rendered by Cecil Rhodes to his country”. According to a memo from the meeting, one of the people on the committee who gave their approval to grant protection was Mendoza, who was appointed provost of Oriel two years later. Last week, Mendoza co-signed an open letter in the Guardian supporting many of the Black Lives Matter protests, writing that “conscious and unconscious racial bias, and inaction in addressing them, remain prevalent across many institutions”. Following the Rhodes Must Fall protests, which began in 2015, Oriel initially announced it would remove the memorial. However, this stalled when a listing application was made days later by an unidentified woman who claimed to have knowledge of the college’s inner workings. Within weeks, Oriel college’s treasurer, Wilf Stephenson, backed this proposal, lobbying Historic England for the memorial to be listed, saying Rhodes was considered to be “one of the greatest educational philanthropists of modern times”. While Bowdler initially described the decision to list the plaque as a “no-brainer” and said he had it “on good authority that the college wants it listed”, Historic England’s then communications director, Celia Richardson, warned that “it could easily draw major fire and questioning of our record generally”. Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, was said to have expressed “unease”, and was described in one email as being “v[ery] diversity focused”.The proposal then stalled amid media scrutiny. After an unusually long assessment period, in June 2018 Historic England finally sent its advice to the government, concluding that the plaque should not be listed and noting its handling of the case had “been the subject of recent FoI and media inquiries”. As a result, the Rhodes plaque – which is outside an Oriel-owned property on King Edward Street in Oxford, near the college where Rhodes lived – remains in place and can be removed without legal repercussions if the college authorities so desire. Oriel college said its treasurer had been speaking in a personal capacity when he sent an email from his work account backing the proposed listing of the Rhodes memorial, saying his comments reflected a “range of personal views among the college’s governing body”. The college also said the contemporaneous meeting note from 2016 drafted by a senior Historic England official noting the provost’s support for listing the Rhodes memorial was “not an official minute” and “does not reflect Mr Mendoza’s position on the listing of the plaque”. It did not dispute the accuracy of the note. A spokesperson said: “As Oriel has always made clear, we abhor racism and discrimination in all its forms. It is not incompatible with that to recognise that many people from all backgrounds have been beneficiaries of Rhodes’s educational philanthropy, including more than 8,000 Rhodes scholars.” Historic England said: “It’s not uncommon for us to debate different opinions internally before reaching a decision. Our decisions are not based on the views of any individual member of staff; we have a robust process of internal and external consideration and consultation. We take some cases to our external advisory board for a further independent expert look, as we did in this case. “There are still many buildings, monuments and structures worthy of listing that we need to turn our attention to and the heritage sector has a long way to go to be able to tell untold or uncomfortable stories, and we are committed to being part of the positive change that must happen in this area.”",education
"My friend and colleague Roana Roach, who has died aged 58 of cancer, was a social worker who had an unstinting commitment to children living in care or on the edge of care. She was also particularly mindful of the contribution she could make to helping black and minority ethnic children, and was acutely aware of the impact of racism and discrimination on marginalised groups of young people. At the British Association for Adoption & Fostering (BAAF) she devised and delivered training courses aimed at improving care and support for BAME families and children, and also set up one of the first support groups for BAME adopters, who benefited from her valuable advice and skills. Having started her career as a social worker at Waltham Forest council in London and then Barnardo’s, she spent her last 15 years as a trainer, consultant and latterly training manager at BAAF, now CoramBAAF, helping others to change the lives of children who had experienced abuse, trauma, separation and loss. Roana was born in London to Jamaican parents, Lena (nee Campbell), a home help and foster parent, and her husband, Frederick Roach, who worked for British Rail at St Pancras station for 40 years. One of five girls – one of whom, Monica, was her twin – she went to Hornsey school for girls in north London, took a degree in philosophy and humanities at the University of Reading and then trained as a social worker at North London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University). She became a general social worker at the London borough of Waltham Forest in 1982, moving on to become their fostering and adoption coordinator (1991-95) before joining Barnardo’s as a senior practitioner. In 2004 she joined BAAF. Roana was an inspirational trainer with an inimitable style. Gentle and inclusive, with a sharp sense of humour, she could convey a lot with a grin, a lift of an eyebrow or a frown. Over the years she used her knowledge and experience to train hundreds of social workers, adopters and foster carers, both in the UK and abroad.  Away from work Roana also welcomed many children into her family home, which was known locally as the “house of fun”. She enjoyed music, won dance competitions with her husband, Winston Reid, a local government officer whom she had married in 1997, and loved visiting her mother in Jamaica, from where she would bring back delicious coffee, as well as rum fruit cake. She is survived by Winston, their two sons, Kareem and Khalil, her mother and three siblings, Lcilda, Jennifer and Monica.",education
"Reopening primary schools in England from the start of next month could fuel the spread of coronavirus, one of the government’s scientific advisers has admitted. Osama Rahman, chief scientific adviser to the Department for Education (DfE), appeared to undermine the government’s case for reopening schools when he gave evidence to the Commons science and technology committee on Wednesday. Questioned by MPs, he admitted that a wider reopening of schools could bring together “hundreds of potential vectors” that could lead to the spread of the virus. He also said there was a “low degree of confidence” in studies suggesting children transmit Covid-19 any less than adults. Asked whether there was a risk of the virus being transmitted when schools reopen, Rahman said there would always be a risk of transmission. “Even going to school anyway is not a risk-free environment,” Rahman said. “The question is to what extent that risk is acceptable.” The adviser raised eyebrows when he was unable to give a figure for deaths among under-18s from Covid-19: “I don’t have those numbers to hand. It’s an important question.” Carol Monaghan, a member of the committee, said: “As a former teacher listening to this, I don’t think the profession is going to be at all satisfied by what they are hearing at the moment.” The government expects children in England to be able to return to nurseries, reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June at the earliest, and other primary year groups to return before the summer. The plans have been met with fierce opposition from education unions. Schools are currently open only to children of key workers and pupils classed as vulnerable. Rahman told the committee there was little evidence to suggest children transmit the virus any differently from adults. “There are some studies which suggest that they might transmit it less than adults, but this evidence is mixed, it’s quite early, and so there is a low degree of confidence among Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] currently in the evidence which suggests that they might transmit it less.” Monaghan then asked: “Since there is a low degree of confidence, we are potentially putting together hundreds of potential vectors that can then go on and transmit – is that correct?” Rahman responded: “Possibly, depending on school sizes.” Rahman’s evidence is likely to result in headteachers thinking again about reopening, throwing the government’s timetable into doubt. It will also raise questions about the DfE’s level of involvement in the decision-making process behind the reopening, after Rahman told MPs: “That was not a departmental decision, that was a cabinet decision following advice from Sage.” Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, described Rahman’s evidence as shocking and disturbing. “The government has simply not provided a single shred of evidence that opening schools from 1 June will be safe for children or for teachers,” he said. “Schools have been placed in a situation where the wrong decision will result in people becoming seriously ill and dying. The government must now publish the scientific evidence it is relying on to claim that it will be safe for children to return to schools from 1 June.” The DfE later posted a letter from Rahman on its Twitter account offering “some important points of clarification” following his appearance before the committee. He said he had “full confidence” in the government’s plans to reopen education institutions. ",education

"A letter from an NHS nurse urging the government to keep schools closed because of the health risks to staff and the wider community has attracted more than 7,000 signatures, as teachers described trying to maintain social distancing in primary classrooms as “almost impossible”. Iain Wilson, an NHS nurse with two children at school in Lewisham in south London, who has experience of working with Covid patients, wrote to ministers: “Do not make us the global guinea pigs. It is self-evidently unwise to force hundreds of people into small rooms in small buildings during a pandemic. “Some teachers have already tragically died from the virus, and we do not want to risk any more,” wrote Wilson, a member of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, in an open letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. On Monday, as the summer term began with millions of children in lockdown, one headteacher described the challenge of trying to keep the small number of pupils currently in the emergency schools, which are open to vulnerable children and those of key workers, at a safe distance from each other. “It’s almost impossible,” said Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which runs nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire. “We’ve got 56 children in one primary school this morning and the school is full because we’re using social distancing to keep them apart. Every time they move from a table, somebody comes and wipes it. Every time they use a badminton racquet, someone wipes the handle. It’s not easy.” Pupils “returning” to school at home accessed more than a quarter of million lessons provided by the government’s new virtual academy, the Oak National Academy, which opened on Monday. Created by more than 40 primary and secondary school teachers to keep children learning during the coronavirus lockdown, Oak aims to provide more than 180 lessons a week, with video tutorials and resources for teachers to support online learning already being provided by schools. On its inaugural day, 140,000 students took part in an English lesson and almost 120,000 did maths, while the most popular single session was counting up to 10 for reception pupils, followed by reading comprehension for seven- and eight-year-olds. Poetry comprehension and Henry VIII were also popular. On Sunday the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, moved to quell continuing speculation about schools reopening to all pupils, insisting that ministers would not contemplate it until the government’s five tests for beating the pandemic are met, but headteachers and local authorities are worried about the continuing uncertainty. The tests are: protecting the NHS’s ability to cope; a fall in daily death rates; reliable data showing decreasing infection rates; confidence in testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) capacity; and confidence that changes to the government’s approach won’t risk a second peak of infections. Many in the sector remain concerned, however, about not just when but how a return to school will be effected, and there are fears that the longer schools remain closed, the greater the loss of learning, particularly for more disadvantaged pupils who may struggle to engage with online lessons. “Schools are working hard to deliver the best learning possible to pupils at home,” said Jules White, the headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham, West Sussex. “The reality is, however, that self teaching is very hard even when there is strong family support. “Whilst many issues need to be resolved for schools to open more fully, we must begin to think about further prioritising children who struggle most with learning and/or come from disadvantaged circumstances. When it’s safe they must get back into schools in larger numbers than we are seeing at present.” Wilson’s letter warned: “Until we know that children will not learn that their teacher has died because of an infection caught in their class, we should remain sensible and wait. “The economic harm of keeping schools closed is significant – but is known. This means the government can act and intervene to mitigate this harm. We do not know about the harms of reopening schools yet.”",education
"Millions of children in the UK returned to their schoolwork on Monday for the first day of the summer term. But for the first time in recent memory the majority did so from home. Through videoconference classes, assigned written exercises and self-study, teachers have sought to ensure the coronavirus lockdown affects their pupils’ development as little as possible. While some children appear to have managed the transition relatively seamlessly, others are searching for motivation after exams were cancelled and it remains unclear when face-to-face classes will resume for all. “Home-schooling a child is not easy but keeping a tight schedule works wonders for us,” says Faith Mkhonto, from Southampton, whose seven-year-old son, Kayden, has been set assessments from textbooks by his primary schoolteachers. “We both signed a contract to commit him to doing his work at a certain time each day. I let him do his studies by himself and then we go through it together.” She has been furloughed from her job as a retail store manager and is devoting her time to Kayden’s schooling – paying him 50p a day if he completes all his work. “It’s now that you really appreciate the teachers,” she admits. “Its not easy, teaching. I was unable to correctly explain a complicated maths problem so we emailed his teacher for help and he called soon after, and Kayden completely understood.” Joe Parrot, 13, who lives in Stockport, has also been assigned independent study from books, provided with daily online quizzes and sent informative slideshows in the absence of digital classes at his school. Unfortunately, he is in need of greater face-to-face help for the subjects he already finds difficult. “I’m very interested in history and geography so teaching myself those has been great,” he says. “But I don’t like maths and teaching myself that has been awful. I procrastinate a lot and I need encouragement in person.” Particularly with Spanish, he says, self-study has been testing. “I’m used to a teacher saying the words so I can hear the pronunciation but we just have our booklet.” For year 12 student Basma Sayed (not her real name), 16, in Redbridge, east London, the lack of clarity over when she and her peers will return to school has been demotivating. “I have watched Netflix when I could have been working,” she says of the Easter holidays. “All the days are blurring into one.” Her teachers have been giving live classes online for her A-level subjects – maths, history and economics – and have set even more work than usual to keep everyone busy. But she has struggled to complete much of it despite wanting to go to university after sixth-form to study economics. Secondary school English teacher Rosie Bircham, from Aberdeenshire, is also finding that inspiring her older pupils is her biggest challenge, while the younger students are more eager to learn. “Remote teaching is going great,” she says. “Google Classroom allows you to look at their work as they go, as if you are looking over their shoulder in the classroom. “I’m getting over half of every junior class regularly submitting creative writing work to me, which is better than usual. They’re really keen, I think they must be bored.” However, many of her 15- and 16-year-old students’ interest in school has evaporated after exams were cancelled for the first time in Scottish history. “Everyone was both weirdly elated and horribly disappointed and I think they’ve carried on that mood,” she says. “They’re asking me, ‘Why have you set us work, what’s the point?’. Even those who are doing English next year for A-level just don’t seem to care.” But Bircham is mindful that there are multiple barriers preventing some children from effectively studying at home, from food insecurity to a lack of equipment. “We’ve had emails from kids who only have one laptop in their house and need to share it with their siblings and parents,” she adds. While her school is providing online classes, just like Sayed’s, parents elsewhere are incredulous that they have not yet commenced more than a month after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, announced that all schools would close to the majority of students. “It’s extremely challenging trying to keep a teenager motivated with schoolwork whilst simultaneously holding down a demanding full-time job,” says Jo Jarvis, an account manager from Leeds whose 13-year-old son, Evan, has been assigned lots of English work but little maths. “So far his assignments have been a mishmash of tasks, quizzes and articles across multiple sites with very little structure, and with some inconsistency across subjects.” After a chaotic start to home-schooling in places, schools are becoming more organised and have introduced new timetables. But challenges remain. “We simply were not able to facilitate home-learning in the time we had,” says Rob Ward, a secondary schoolteacher from Yorkshire. “Then, there were a series of botched app launches at our school prior to the holidays.” However, he is anxious not to criticise his school at a difficult time, made worse by the haste of the decision by the government which on Sunday supported the launch of the Oak National Academy, which offers some video lessons and learning resources to help mitigate vast differences in the offerings for pupils.  But ultimately the role of mothers, fathers and carers is key, Ward adds: “Sadly, whilst some parents will push their kids to learn, others won’t have the time, skills or the inclination to do so.”",education
"Almost half a million vulnerable children who have been allocated emergency school places to keep them safe during the pandemic were missing from classrooms last week, according to government figures. Just 24,000 pupils classed by the government as vulnerable turned up at schools in England last Friday, which constitutes 5% of the total entitled to attend school during the lockdown, including over the Easter break. The figures from the Department for Education (DfE) confirm on-the-ground reports from schools that few vulnerable pupils are turning up. The Labour MP, Tulip Siddiq, has written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, expressing concern about the low turnout and calling for more funding for children’s charities and better guidance for local authorities to support those most at risk. The Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson, Layla Moran, called for urgent government intervention. “This is utterly shocking and shows just how massive the problem we face is to look after vulnerable children during the pandemic,” she said. “Government has a responsibility to keep kids safe, and we just don’t know if they are.” Schools effectively closed on 20 March as part of the national effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but a skeleton service has remained open for children of key workers and more than 500,000 vulnerable pupils, which include those classified as “children in need” as well as 270,000 children with an education, health and care (EHC) plan for special educational needs. When the emergency schools first opened on 23 March, around 60,000 vulnerable children attended, but by Friday 3 April the number had halved to 29,000. On the same day, 85,000 children of critical workers attended. By last Friday their number had dropped to 62,000, or around 2% of all children of critical workers. Teachers and social workers say many parents have chosen to keep their children at home for fear they may catch the virus. Child protection referrals have dropped by as much as 75% in some areas, with family life hidden behind closed doors during the lockdown and children invisible to the authorities. Siddiq, the shadow minister for children and early years, said: “School is often a safe haven for vulnerable children, and the main source of identification and referral for specialist support. Teaching staff are worried that they are unable to see ‘at-risk’ children as they usually would and that they are not getting help. The very low number of vulnerable children attending school so far suggests that they are right. “We know that many vulnerable children will be more at risk in this crisis with the financial and social pressures of lockdown exacerbating problems at home. We need to see more funding for children’s charities and better guidance for local authorities to support vulnerable children, as well as reducing financial pressure on their families by fixing problems like parents being unable to access free school meal vouchers.” DfE guidance states that many children with EHC plans will in fact be better off remaining at home. School staff and social workers have been working to keep in contact with vulnerable families where children are not turning up at school. Williamson said: “Our first priority has always been protecting the wellbeing of children and young people, but particularly those vulnerable young people with special educational needs or a social worker. Schools are open for them and we’re working to make sure those who should attend do so. “With up to 130,000 children in school every single day, schools are helping keep the country moving. And we are asking our local authorities and schools to ensure every vulnerable child knows that their school is there to support them, that systems are in place to keep in touch with those children who are unable to attend because of health reasons.”",education
"It has been an emotional week for primary school headteacher Kate Baptiste: “I have actually cried,” she says. She is scared that the government will announce today that schools will reopen next month – even though it could be dangerous to do so. “I’m used to making decisions that are rooted in what is best for the children. This is all out of my hands, and it’s terrifying.” The failure of the government to lay out its medical and scientific case for reopening schools has been taking its toll on headteachers such as Baptiste. She has no idea how she can open her school, St Monica’s Catholic primary school in north London, without turning it into a breeding ground for the virus. “I feel torn in many different directions. It’s exhausting trying to reassure everyone with what I feel are empty promises, as we may be forced to open schools when we genuinely don’t feel it’s safe to do so. This is my 14th year as a headteacher and I’ve never felt so scared, unsure, tired or vulnerable.” The problem, she says, is that she can fit a maximum of only six children into each of her classrooms if they need to maintain a social distance of two metres at all times. Her staff numbers have been vastly reduced, as some employees are members of vulnerable groups, leaving her with just 12 classroom teachers. The corridors in her school are less than two metres wide in many places, making it difficult for children and staff to pass each other safely, and she estimates that serving socially distanced school dinners to 300 children each day will take most of the afternoon. Plus, she says, it is unrealistic to expect young children to maintain a two-metre distance at playtime, which she is not prepared to ban. “Play is critical for children to be able to feel happy and to enjoy school life,” she says. “What will happen if we make them sit like little robots in chairs, two metres away from each other, and they don’t have any interaction with their peers all day long? The following day you can just see it: tears and tantrums.” They won’t want to come into school, she says, and who could blame them? “They’ll hate it – it will be such a different experience.”Ultimately, she thinks forcing young children to go to school in these circumstances would be counterproductive, and could seriously harm their well-being. “I understand from an economic point of view that parents need to go back to work – but not at the expense of children’s mental health.” Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner secondary school in Kingston, south-west London, has also spent the last week feeling stressed. He woke up at 4am on Thursday, worrying about how on earth he can reopen his school safely. “You’re constantly running things around in your head. How can we manage that? What’s going to happen if we do this?” There is no possible way to safely social distance all the pupils in his school. “Like most schools, we just don’t have the space to allow that to happen.” Even a partial reopening – allowing just the 160 children who will have to take their GCSEs next year to return to school – would be problematic. “The reality is, children are just not going to stay two metres apart. They just won’t do it. “There aren’t enough teachers to spread the children out into different classrooms, while still providing online learning for pupils in the year groups stuck at home. “If you’ve got teachers in school teaching, how are they also going to be able to set work online? Unless we want them teaching every evening and every day – which I think might cause a few problems in the teaching unions.” He has considered trying to source PPE for his staff, but is unsure where he would get it and has no funds to pay for it. “I’ve already got, thanks to the lockdown, a deficit in my budget of £120,000,” he says. On Friday, unions for teachers and other school staff said schools must not reopen until a UK-wide “test, trace and isolate” scheme is under way and PPE is provided to workers.  An Opinium poll for the Observer shows 53% of parents with a secondary school-aged child and 38% of parents with a primary school-aged child would feel anxious if the government decided to reopen schools. Only six out of 10 would support schools being allowed to even partially reopen before other places such as shops and restaurants, while a significant minority (16%) would oppose any kind of partial reopening.  In a separate survey of more than 250,000 parents carried out last week by the PTA charity Parentkind, nearly one in five parents said they would feel confident about sending their child back to school only when school leaders and teachers said it was safe to do so. One in 10 were even more cautious and said they would rather wait until all staff and pupils had been vaccinated against Covid-19 – even if that meant their children would spend up to 18 months being home-schooled. In Shrewsbury, the principal of Severndale specialist academy, Sabrina Hobbs, spent the early days of the lockdown crying in her car on her way to work. “I was emotionally distraught on the way to school, thinking: how do I manage this? How do I keep everyone safe?” All the pupils at her school have special needs. Some need help with going to the toilet and the vast majority need physical assistance or close contact with staff. Although Hobbs has recently managed to source PPE, including visors and goggles, for all her staff, she can fit only three children in a classroom if she socially distances the pupils. This leaves her with a maximum capacity of 50 pupils, on a rota throughout the week, instead of 405 every day. “The limitations are really around the availability of staff and the space we have available in school. I have a duty of care to protect my staff – but also to protect the children as well.” According to the National Association of Headteachers, 83% of headteachers currently think an inability to implement appropriate social distancing measures would prevent schools from opening to more pupils. Only 48% report that over 70% of staff were available to attend school, while 25% said less than half their staff were available to attend. Jon Henley Denmark became the first country in Europe to begin reopening schools after a month-long closure, with nursery, kindergarten and primary classes resuming on 15 April – although many requested an extra week to adjust to strict physical distancing and health protocols. Two metres must be maintained between desks in classrooms; arrivals, departures and breaks must be organised in small groups; and hands must be washed frequently. Some parents opposed reopening on health grounds, with 40,000 joining a Facebook group called “My child is not a guinea pig”. Pupils aged between 11 and 18 are due to return to class on 18 May following an agreement last week between Denmark’s political parties. Up to 85% of the 50,500 schools will reopen progressively from Tuesday, again with strict hygiene and distancing rules: frequent disinfection of classes and common areas, regular hand-washing or gel, mandatory masks for older pupils, no physical contact, a maximum of 15 per class in primary schools and 10 in pre-school. First to return will be the final year of pre-school and the first and final years of primary school, with most remaining under-16s returning on 18 May – but not in in “red” regions, including the greater Paris area, where the virus is still circulating widely. A decision on whether senior high schools (lycées) can reopen on 2 June will be taken at the end of May. Concerned parents are not obliged to send their children to school, and teachers can refuse to return on health grounds, although they must provide lessons online if they do not. Some municipalities, particularly in dense city centres such as Paris, are expected to open later because their school buildings make it more difficult to ensure the required physical distancing. Dutch primary schools and pre-schools start reopening from tomorrow. About 80% will open for whole days, a survey by the state broadcaster NOS showed, with half the pupils being taught in school and the other half online on alternate days. Around 10% have opted to teach two half-days instead. Some teachers are expected to stay at home, with up to a third saying it was too early for schools to go back. Some families, particularly those with members in at-risk groups, are also thought likely to keep children at home for the time being. Secondary schools can begin preparing to reopen on 2 June, the Dutch government has said. Under the government’s four-stage national strategy, most of Spain’s 8.2 million pupils are not due to return until September. However, children under six whose parents cannot work from home will be able to return from 25 May. The country’s 17 regional governments – which enjoy considerable autonomy – are currently debating how and when schools should reopen. The Andalucían regional government has said it aims to get administrative staff back into schools from 18 May, although no date has been set for the resumption of classes. Schools in Italy are not due to reopen until September, although the government has said it is studying the possibility of opening nurseries and daycare centres before the summer. The delay is already causing problems for working parents, with many of Italy’s offices and businesses having reopened on 4 May. The government has passed measures to help working parents, including an extra 15 days of annual parental leave and a €600 childcare voucher, but some parents’ groups are lobbying for an earlier return to school if safety can be guaranteed. Some primary school years will start reopening from tomorrow, followed by kindergartens, after a federal government announcement last week. Pupils aged 11 and 12 and those with final exams began returning in a staggered system from the week of 1 May, with classes split in two and groups alternating between lessons at school and at home. Some of the country’s 16 states, including North Rhine-Westphalia, which has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 infection, reopened on a voluntary basis in late April, sparking protests and boycotts from older students alarmed not only by the possibility of contracting the virus but by being insufficiently prepared for exams that they will have to sit in difficult conditions.

"My brother Barrie Walker, who has died aged 71, moved to Paris in 1974 to teach English at the British Institute (part of the University of London, and now known as the University of London Institute in Paris). He taught students, mentored staff and organised conferences and public lectures there for 30 years, and lived in Paris for the rest of his life. He spoke fluent French, Spanish and Italian, all with flawless accents. Barrie loved Paris but had periods of depression and extreme anxiety, which led to agoraphobia and alcoholism. He continued working through these periods and eventually overcame his addiction. He loved music (especially jazz), literature, politics, cricket and art. After retirement he began to paint seriously and his semi-impressionistic style of Parisian street and cafe scenes, to his surprise, were much appreciated. He experimented with style, branching into portraits and abstracts. In the last 10 years of his life, Barrie developed a large circle of friends and became loved and fulfilled. Born in Fulham, south-west London, to Harry Walker, a civil servant, and Brenda (nee Wildman), a journalist, he grew up in 1950s London and loved the city. As a child, he used to go to the Natural History Museum’s children’s club at weekends and sketch the birds. He was multitalented and excelled in all academic subjects, gaining a scholarship to Westminster City school. However, being gifted seemed to weigh heavily on him, compounded by a move to the Kent suburbs when he was 12. He refused to make any friends for a year and this started an awkwardness in social relations. After leaving school he went to St Catherine’s College, Oxford, where he studied modern and American history. He disliked university life and became depressed there. However, his passion for languages led him to take a TEFL teaching course and to spend time in Morocco and Spain, before settling in France. Latterly, he rejected what he believed Britain had become, Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson as prime minister being the last straw for him. To his pleasure and relief, he was granted French citizenship shortly before his death. Barrie spent the last three months of his life in hospital with kidney cancer, his illness enveloping him as Covid-19 locked us down and prevented his family from visiting him.

"Downing Street has warned of the risks to children’s education of prolonging school closures, as the government doubles down on plans for a phased reopening from 1 June. Education unions have reacted angrily to the plan, which would see reception and years 1 and 6 return first, calling it “reckless”, and warning that schools have not been given enough time to prepare. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, wrote in the Daily Mail that teachers should be ready to “do their duty” and cooperate with the government’s plan. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman, asked about those remarks on Friday, said: “Safety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child’s education from not getting them back in the classroom.” Teaching unions are meeting the government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, on Friday, to hear the scientific advice behind the decision. Williamson will attend. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “The purpose of the meeting is to allow the union leaders to hear directly from the experts. The education secretary has been in contact with heads and the teachers’ unions throughout the process, and we continue to want to work with them in order to get children back into school, in a way which is safe.” He added that schools reopening was “not happening overnight, and it won’t happen without schools putting in place a range of measures to reduce transmission”. Asked whether teachers would be issued with personal protective equipment, he said face coverings were only recommended for enclosed spaces such as public transport, and should not be necessary for teachers, unless they were giving close care to a child with symptoms. Downing Street has been keen for schools to reopen, in part so parents, who are juggling home schooling with working from home, can be more productive. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised the plans. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, has demanded that the government establish safety conditions that must be met before schools can reopen, instead of first setting a fixed date. “The government must urgently work collaboratively with trade unions to create clear conditions, based on the tests unions have helpfully set out, so that every school can implement them to ensure a safe return. Schools should only reopen when those safety conditions have been met,” she said.",education
"When Harrie Larrington-Spencer was knocked off her bike at the end of the first year of her PhD, she was left with a brachial plexus injury. “My left arm and hand barely work and I have chronic pain,” she says. She knew her injury would affect many aspects of her life, but was surprised to learn just how hard it would be to do her university work as a disabled person. “No reasonable adjustment would make me not at a disadvantage to my non-disabled peers,” she says. “There is also the ingrained but generally unseen ableism inherent in academia.” Larrington-Spencer is used to being unable to attend writing retreats or being reprimanded for using her foot to open doors, but the coronavirus pandemic has presented the biggest challenge yet. “I have some facilities provided at home in terms of desk and office chair but it isn’t set up professionally, and no matter how many YouTube videos I watch I can’t get it right. Without it the pain and difficulties in working are exacerbated,” she says. She also lacks the computer processing power to run the assistive software she needs. “My computer will crash every time.” Despite this, Larrington-Spencer considers herself one of the lucky ones – she’s entitled to apply for a six-month extension to her PhD. “It’s great, but the fact that I have to apply is ridiculous. I am already registered as disabled with the university and have already had to prove my disadvantage and disability through that process,” she says. Larrington-Spencer was among the 1,700 signatories of an open letter sent to the research councils this week, urging for automatic funding extensions for all PhD students who are registered as disabled, neurodivergent or chronically ill. The letter also asked for grants for the assistive equipment and technology necessary for working remotely. Zara Bain, a final-year PhD student who suffers from several conditions affecting her immune system and is one of the organisers of the letter, says many disabled students are so busy trying to adapt to the circumstances that they simply don’t have time to apply for extensions. She sees the bureaucracy as part of a wider misunderstanding of what they’re going through. “The general absence of any mention, until very recently, from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) or universities of this particular student population – who are higher risk, more pressured and less supported, relative to the pandemic – means we’ve been sort of left to deal with all of that,” she says. “And [also] trying to meet existing PhD deadlines, and weather problems like running out of funding.” Prof Jennifer Rubin, who works on inclusion at UKRI, says that “any UKRI-supported doctoral student who needs an extension of time because of Covid-19 can request one”. The organisation will review its policy over the summer. But Penny Andrews, another signatory, says the response from the research councils and some universities belies a lack of understanding. “It feels like we are being fobbed off,” she says. “I am a PhD student struggling to write up, who has already been through major surgery, survived being hit by a car at 40mph, and experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and bereavement, as well as autism, ADHD, cerebral palsy, and anxiety and depression.” It’s not just PhD students with disabilities who are struggling. Bain and Andrews’s views are echoed in a new report by the National Association of Disability Practitioners, which warned that disabled university students are struggling more than their peers during lockdown. The report urges universities to provide better training for academic staff to ensure their online teaching is inclusive. It also warns that neurodiverse students and those with visual and hearing impairments are facing problems with access to teaching and course materials, such as poor captioning and underprepared lecture slides. A separate survey by the Association of Non-Medical Help Providers suggested that 81% of disabled students have been negatively impacted by changes to their academic work due to coronavirus, while 73% said they had issues with access to academic resources such as libraries and workshops, and 57% said access to their teaching had been disrupted. Piers Wilkinson, disabled students’ officer at the National Union of Students, says he was unsurprised to see these concerns. He would like to see the medical evidence requirements suspended during this time for the Disabled Students’ Allowance, which funds equipment. “Institutions must ensure disabled students can choose what best supports them, and ensure any leave of absences or suspension of studies comes at no cost,” Wilkinson says. Stephen Campbell, dyslexia and disability coordinator at Leeds Trinity University, says universities have adapted their courses to the lockdown more effectively than he expected. “But you’re supporting more than just the medicalised condition that the student has,” he says, referring to how the lockdown is affecting students’ mental health. “My colleagues in counselling are saying there has been a direct impact from the lockdown. They’ve seen an increase in referrals to secondary care, to organisations like community mental health teams or Crisis.” Bureaucracy was a problem even before the lockdown, Campbell adds. “If we talk about dyslexic students, there’s already a protracted process of applications and testing before they even get anywhere near their assistive technology,” he says. “Combined with the technology universities are now using to move their courses online, we’re inevitably going to find problems with inclusion in the future.” The picture is not the same everywhere: some universities are providing better support than others, and certain disabilities have benefited from the shift to online learning. Tiri Hughes, a visually impaired medical student at Trinity College, Oxford, is grateful for her university’s adjustments so far.  “From an accessibility perspective, our remote lectures are brilliant [for visually impaired students],” she says. “We’d been calling for all faculties to do them because they’re vital for disabled students. It was often not done properly, but now we’re in lockdown, a lot of disabled students have even better access to education.” But she adds: “It’s frustrating, because we’ve been fighting for this for years. Were we not important enough? We’re determined that, when things go back to normal, we don’t lose some of this progress.”",education
"Government scientific advisers are examining the impact of letting children in their final year of primary school return to classrooms from 1 June, the Guardian has learned. Boris Johnson is due to announce next Sunday that year six children, aged 10 and 11, will be the first cohort allowed back into schools since he announced their closure on 18 March, to be closely followed by other primary school years, and years 10 and 12 in secondary schools.  The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is said to be focusing on allowing back older primary school children initially, with the year group deemed a priority because of their need to transition to secondary school in September. Downing Street confirmed that 1 June after the half-term holiday was its target – subject to the latest data on the spread of Covid-19 – and that the prime minister would make a significant announcement on Sunday offering a roadmap out of the lockdown. Sage is expected to meet on Tuesday. A Whitehall source said: “The focus is getting primary school pupils back first but only if the R [a measure of how the virus is spreading] is at a safe level. After primary schools have returned we will then look at years 10 and 12.” Both Johnson and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, made public comments on the need for schools to quickly reopen in some form. “One of the things we want to do as fast as we can is get certainly primary schools back. It’s not going to be easy but that’s where we want to go. It’s about working out a way to do it,” the prime minister told the Sun on Sunday. Drakeford said schools in Wales could also reopen at the beginning of next month. “Our advice from the trade unions and from the local education authorities is that you will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that, to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June,” he told the BBC. But Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser who has set up an alternative experts’ group to rival Sage, warned school reopening would have to be “watched very carefully”. King said he thought June was too early but wanted to discuss the issue with his expert panel on Monday. The government has been in talks with teaching unions in England over how and when to restart classroom learning. Schools have been using distance learning at home for pupils, with the children of key workers and those classified as vulnerable or with special needs still able to attend in person – though only about 2-5% have taken up their places. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), which represents most primary school teachers, called on the government to detail how it would protect children, teachers and families. He said: “While we all want to see a return to some sort of normality, the NEU believes it’s really premature to talk about a June return date. Instead, the government should be providing evidence about how this can be safe, how many more fatalities would we expect to see amongst school staff and parents and how these can be prevented or minimised.” Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and the public wanted a decision made on robust scientific evidence, particularly on infection and transmission rates for different age groups. Last week a study from Germany found children were as likely to spread coronavirus as adults. “There will be huge practical difficulties to solve, for example the much reduced workforce available due to illness and shielding, and the difficulty of achieving social distancing in schools, especially amongst the very young and on the school gate,” Whiteman said. Sharon Waldron, the headteacher of Stonham Aspal Church of England primary school in Suffolk, said she favoured rotating year groups into schools for a week at a time, starting with year six in the first week after the May half-term holiday. “I feel schools will try their best to implement a way through this situation whatever is asked of them, but I worry that if the plan is too much, too fast we could see a few terrible scenarios: increased rate of R, increased deaths of children and school staff,” Waldron said. Several countries, such as Austria and Denmark, have moved to partially reopen schools as coronavirus fears have receded. But in some of the worst-hit areas of the globe, including Italy and parts of the US, schools will remain shut until the end of summer. Any decision by Johnson would only apply directly to schools in England. Education policy and funding is devolved to national administrations, meaning schools in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland can reopen independently of what happens in England. Eithne Hughes, the director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: “We would caution against fixing a date in stone at this stage, and to make sure the conditions are right first of all. We are happy to plan towards a proposed date, but we would urge that it is clearly stated from the outset that it is moveable if more time is needed. “Exactly how this is managed will need to be guided by public health and scientific advice to ensure that pupils, parents and staff can have confidence that it is safe to return to schools. This will be a complex and difficult task, and there is a great deal of work to do to get this right. That is why the date of reopening must be kept under review.”",education
"If any scholar could bring back to life the holy men and scholars of the Middle Ages it was Richard Sharpe. Richard, professor of diplomatic at Oxford University since 1998, who has died aged 66 of heart failure, was a man of abundant energy, which he poured into writing and editing a torrent of books and articles that threw light on all aspects of these men – saints and sinners alike. He was equally energetic outside his study – his gym sessions were so strenuous that he once broke a leg without at first realising it. He served as an Oxford University proctor and a Lib Dem member of Oxford city council. The son of Dorothy (nee Lord), a pharmacist, and John Sharpe, a butcher, Richard was born in Accrington, Lancashire. From St Peter’s school, York, he went on to study classics and Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Trinity College, Cambridge. But even as a schoolboy he was studying original documents about the Scottish Hebridean island of Raasay. His two-volume book, Raasay: A Study in Island History (1977), was published as he graduated. His first job, in 1981, was as assistant editor of the Dictionary of Medieval Latin in Oxford; he made himself a formidable Latinist by reading nothing but Latin for a year. His promotion to Oxford’s readership in diplomatic (charter-scholarship) and a fellowship at Wadham College in 1990 allowed his research abilities to flower. Though an inspiring teacher, he had only limited duties, which gave him time to maintain a flow of publications about Celtic Scotland and Ireland as well as to run two major medieval research projects. One project became his life’s work: to put at our fingertips the key information about all the books and their contents that were known to every clerk, monk or friar in medieval Britain. With precision and clarity, he brought these books to three-dimensional life in a wholly original way. For him — and now us — they were not just catalogue-titles but living texts, with origins and histories traceable back to their first authorship and down to their physical, present-day location. Richard’s method was systematic, producing monographs and editions on each aspect of the medieval book. Most are definitive works of reference, like A Handlist of the Latin Writers of Great Britain and Ireland before 1540 (1997), so unassumingly titled but 900 pages long. One is short and provocative — Titulus (“Title”, 2003), defining the nature of texts. The biggest, a publication of all extant medieval library catalogues, now runs to 18 volumes (and will soon be 24). These had their own editors (of whom I was one), but Richard’s stamp as general editor is clear on every page. He is survived by a cousin, Michael.",education
"My father, George Wedell, has died aged 92, following a stroke and pneumonia, in Manchester Royal Infirmary, just a stone’s throw from the flat in Nelson Street where he and my mother, Rosemarie, lived following their marriage in 1948. It brought a lifetime’s connection to Manchester and its university to a close. As professor of adult education at Manchester University, 1964-75, he developed a practical and scholarly field of research within the disciplines of education and broadcasting. Groundbreaking research resulted in books, including Broadcasting and Public Policy (1968) and Broadcasting in the Third World (1977), that influenced higher education, social change, and broadcasting policy and regulation worldwide. In 1973, he “chose to work for rather than at the European commission”, he said, heading up the division for employment and retraining. This commitment shaped the second half of his life. Returning to Manchester University in 1982 as professor of communications policy, he established the European Institute for the Media, funded by the European Cultural Foundation. Research focused on the role of media particularly during the democratisation of former communist countries in the 1990s. These achievements brought him several distinguished European awards. He was born Eberhard Artur Otto Georg Wedell in Düsseldorf. His father, Hans Wedell, was a lawyer – and the son of Rabbi Abraham Wedell; his mother – was Gertrud Bonhoeffer – a cousin of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was my father’s godfather. This dual heritage laid the foundations for George’s commitment to faith and social responsibility. In 1939, the Wedells found refuge in the UK while the Bonhoeffers joined the frontline of resistance that culminated in the assassination attempt of 20 July 1944 on Adolf Hitler, and their subsequent execution. As a child refugee, often regarded as an enemy alien, my father faced integration into his host country with fortitude. Educated at Cranbrook school in Kent, he received a scholarship to the London School of Economics, where he studied economics and international relations. After their marriage, he and Rosemarie (nee Winckler), lived briefly in Manchester, where Rosemarie was employed as a youth worker. From 1950, George worked for eight years in the Ministry of Education in London and for six years as secretary of the newly created Independent Television Authority, before in 1964 my parents returned to Manchester, now with three sons and a daughter.  Over the last decade of his life he accepted the civic invitation to Düsseldorf’s annual commemoration of Reichspogromnacht (Kristallnacht), and in later years I accompanied him. Our journey together to the city of his birth was a way of acknowledging a trauma too difficult to speak about. Rosemarie died in 2010. My father is survived by his children and four grandchildren, and his brother, Klaus.",education
"Meera Navlakha, 22, is a Durham University student who has returned to Singapore. She says her sleep cycle is now “messed up”, making it difficult to study. “I have friends who take classes post-midnight,” she says, “and everyone is worried about exams.” Navlakha is one of many international students who have fled the UK to be with family without their belongings, and don’t know when they’ll be able to return to collect them due to lockdowns, border closures, or cancelled flights. International students from outside the EU are meanwhile paying the highest rates for their tuition. Some who went home are attending online lectures at night because of time differences. Harshita Iyer, 25, studying at the London School of Economics (LSE), is back in Canada with a five-hour time difference. “I’m lucky most of my classes are in the afternoon, but I know people who have lectures at 1am,” she says. She is also worried about how the time difference will affect her ability to do upcoming exams. Some who have returned home have internet problems. Shanavi Dessai, 18, who is one of around 400 international students at the University of Sussex to have signed an open letter calling on the university to reimburse their fees, is back in India. “It’s monsoon season here soon and electricity problems are rampant,” she says. “This is honestly horrible.” Alex Arroyo, 18, studying at the University of Portsmouth, is stuck in Menorca trying to study online without his laptop. “My return flight was cancelled and I’ve been in lockdown for five weeks,” he says. “I left everything in the flat.” Arroyo says he’s been using his iPad to study but can’t access all of the sites he needs. He studies in the kitchen, as the WiFi is better, but says it’s difficult to concentrate with all of the family stuck at home, too. For those stranded in the UK there are also difficulties. Bart Schermers, 23, is studying at LSE and has only just made it home to the Netherlands. He says he experienced a “nervous” atmosphere in his private student accommodation in London, which housed around 200 students. “On the floor below me a flat was sick [with coronavirus]. We use the same elevator, doors and hallways, so it didn’t feel safe,” he says. Schermers is on a rent strike to try to break his housing contract. Tama Knight, studying at LSE and from Canada, decided to stay put because her sister and mother back home are at high risk from Covid-19. Like Schermers, she says she was scared to stay in cramped university accommodation. Instead, Knight moved into her partner’s flat, but now faces the daunting prospect of having to pay thousands of pounds in double rent for six months, because she can’t get out of her student housing contract. “I don’t qualify for any financial assistance because I’m not a UK citizen, and [to qualify for financial assistance from Canada] you have to have been working for the past 12 months. It leaves me in a scary situation,” she says. Growing numbers of students are facing financial hardship during the lockdown, after losing work and support from parents. Dessai says many international students, who are not entitled to domestic loans and pay far higher fees, are also worried about how they will cope financially. Many students, including Iyer, lost jobs due to the pandemic. Loanna Siomou, 19, studying at the University of Bedfordshire, has recently made it home to Greece but was frightened at the prospect of being stuck abroad with little money – especially when she saw empty supermarket shelves, as she couldn’t afford to stock up. “It was scary to think I could have been stuck in a foreign country with nothing to eat because I couldn’t afford it,” she says. It’s perhaps particularly unnerving to be overseas during a crisis. “In many ways it’s harder when abroad,” Knight says. “I don’t know how I would get home, so it’s very stressful.” Many will have planned and saved for years to study in the UK. “International students came here with a dream,” Anne Marie Graham, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA), says. “Many of them have travelled huge distances and left families behind. Studying abroad is a pretty emotional experience at the best of times, so to do it through a crisis is understandably really difficult.” Some universities are expecting to lose more than £100m as foreign students drop out as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Eva Crossnan Jory, vice-president for welfare at the National Union of Students (NUS), urges them to do whatever they can to support at risk groups such as international students. “It’s important [those studying] know they can engage with their students’ union at any time,” she says. For Navlakha, in Singapore revising for her exams, the sudden move has been difficult. “I wasn’t ready to leave and left a lot of my stuff behind,” she says. “I feel like my life is back in the UK. I just hope I can get back to take care of it.”",education
"Schools across England that have been closed for almost six weeks as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown will reopen in phases, with headteachers given as much notice as possible, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has said. The secretary of state would not give a date for reopening, but ruled out schools opening during the summer holidays as a way of helping pupils who have missed out on education to catch up. Questioned by the education select committee on Wednesday, Williamson told MPs: “We recognise that the idea of schools all returning on day one with the full complement of pupils is not realistic or practical. “I do expect schools to be opened in a phased manner. I also intend to be giving schools as much notice as possible.” There has been continuing speculation about when schools might reopen, and whether older year groups, including pupils in their final year of primary school and those in the middle of GCSE and A-level courses could be among the first to be brought back into schools as they might benefit most. Asked which pupils might return first, the education secretary said the government was looking at best practice in other countries where schools are already beginning to reopen. He said a sub-group from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advising the government on its response to the pandemic had been set up to focus solely on issues surrounding school reopening. “It is incredibly important that we get the right balance in terms of actually making sure that we create an environment that is good to learn in but also that is a safe environment for people to both work in and learn in as well,” he told MPs. The education secretary faced persistent questioning about the impact of school closures on the most disadvantaged pupils from committee chair, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who warned of a “potential cascade of mounting social injustice that could last a decade”. Only small numbers of children classed as vulnerable by the government have taken up school places kept open for them during the course of the coronavirus crisis, and research has suggested many children from disadvantaged backgrounds are accessing little if any online learning. Williamson said the government had put in £100m worth of investment in equipment and IT support for children disadvantaged by the digital divide. During the course of the hearing it emerged however that the promised 200,000 laptops would not start to arrive in schools until the end of next month, with the majority delivered in June. The government’s free school meal voucher scheme, set up to try to ensure that the poorest children do not go hungry during the crisis, also came in for sharp criticism from MPs who were concerned about long delays and “deeply frustrated” headteachers who were spending “hours and hours” trying to access the Edenred ordering system. Williamson acknowledged schools had faced challenges because of the high level of demand. “We’ve been doing everything we can to support them in terms of being able to get these vouchers out as rapidly as possible.” The education secretary reiterated plans for an autumn series of what he described as “shortened” exams for pupils unhappy with their grades, which will this year be calculated largely on teacher assessment as exams have been cancelled. There have been reports that some headteachers are opposed, arguing that it would be “totally impractical”.",education
"The competitions watchdog has issued a strongly worded warning to private schools in the UK, threatening hefty fines if they are found to be price-fixing during the coronavirus crisis. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had been made aware that a number of independent schools “may be engaging in discussions with each other about the level of discounts and/or refunds on school fees”. A letter from the CMA to the Independent Schools Council and other bodies representing the sector warned that moves to agree prices and exchange commercially sensitive information would almost certainly infringe competition law and could result in fines of up to 10% of total turnover. Independent schools have been badly hit by the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, with some parents who have lost work unable to pay fees while others are reluctant to pay the full amount for the online education schools are currently providing. Many schools have already offered discounts and refunds to try to keep families onboard and stay afloat. While the bigger, more established schools will most likely survive, there are fears that smaller schools, which may have already been facing difficulties, will go to the wall as a result of the crisis. The CMA letter, written by its senior director, Howard Cartlidge, and obtained by the Private School Policy Reform thinktank, acknowledged that in the current crisis there may be a need for increased cooperation between businesses to ensure the supply of scarce products and services. This, however, did not give businesses a “free pass” to engage in non-essential collusion, he warned. He told sector leaders: “We are sure that you share our concerns not just about the unacceptability of anti-competitive practices in the current circumstances, but also the risk of undermining public trust more widely across the independent school sector. It is therefore vital that any poor behaviour is nipped in the bud now.” Robert Verkaik, a co-founder of Private School Policy Reform, said families who paid school fees would be dismayed by the revelation. “Those parents who have spent tens of thousands of pounds to send their children to an independent school will be rightly very angry if some of the schools are working against their interests by setting uncompetitive fees.” It would not be the first time private schools have fallen foul of competition laws. In 2006 the Office of Fair Trading, which preceded the CMA, ruled that 50 fee-paying independent schools including Eton College, Harrow and Winchester had breached competition law by systematically exchanging information about pricing intentions. Each school was fined £10,000. The CMA letter, dated 17 April, was also sent to other representative bodies in the sector, including the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses Conference, and the Independent Schools Association. They have been contacted for comment. A CMA spokesperson said: “Where cooperation amongst businesses or other organisations is necessary to protect consumers in the coronavirus outbreak, the CMA will not take enforcement action. “But we will not tolerate organisations agreeing prices or exchanging commercially sensitive information on future pricing or business strategies with their competitors, where this is not necessary to meet the needs of the current situation. “We welcome the confirmation by the independent schools representative bodies to whom we have written that they are urging competition law compliance on their members.” The ISC’s chief executive Julie Robinson responded: “We know of no evidence that schools are deliberately sharing information with each other and the CMA acknowledges that schools are striving to do the right thing.”",education
"Teachers can legally refuse to return when schools reopen unless they get the same protections against coronavirus as other frontline staff, one of the UK’s leading teaching unions has warned. In a letter to local authorities seen by the Guardian, the 300,000-strong NASUWT threatens to invoke legal action to defend teachers against being forced back into schools on 1 June because of the risk to their health. The union’s letter marks a significant hardening against the government’s push to reopen primary schools in England from 1 June. It comes as one academy chain says it is aiming to invite pupils back on that date. Signed by the NASUWT’s general secretary, Patrick Roach, the union’s letter threatens to delay that start date by forcing the government and local authorities to consider their legal obligations. The union says it has “fundamental concerns” about guidance issued by the government this week, saying it was inconsistent with guidance given to other workplaces, including care homes and the NHS. “Stringent guidance has been issued for the NHS, for care homes and for employers across the UK. It is unacceptable that this has not been the case for schools,” it says. “The NASUWT believes that teachers and other school staff have the right to the same consideration and protections, and to be confident that their health and welfare, as well as that of pupils, is at the heart of any planning for wider opening.” The union said it had to warn local authorities as employers, and the government, that they risked legal action for “breach of duty of care and personal injury due to foreseeable risk, and any other legal recourse available” if efforts were made to force teachers into classrooms during the epidemic. “The NASUWT recognises that schools and employers have been placed in a situation where the wrong decision will result in people becoming seriously ill and dying, and will therefore appreciate that there can be no compromise on health and safety. “If this means that schools are unable to open safely before September, because they are unable to make arrangements to safeguard their staff and pupils, then that position must be accepted,” Roach said. It comes as councils in England call for the power to close schools and nurseries to protect vulnerable families in the event of local Covid-19 outbreaks, as pressure grows on the government to reveal its scientific evidence on transmission. The Local Government Association (LGA) – which represents nearly all of England’s councils – says that “local flexibility” is needed to reopen primary schools, as well as the ability to close them if testing reveals clusters of new Covid-19 infections. The association said a major concern was the likely impact in areas with more vulnerable residents, including “communities where there is higher risk, such as those with a high proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic residents”. Judith Blake, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said: “Councils need to be able to close provision where testing indicates clusters of new Covid-19 cases and it is vital that schools have the resources to provide staff with necessary protective equipment, as well as soap and hand sanitiser for cleaning.” Giving power over closures to local authorities has been pushed for by both the main teaching unions. “The Department for Education (DfE) has not done nearly enough thinking about the emerging evidence about the racial disparities of the epidemic and what it means for schools with diverse pupil populations,” said Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, told MPs earlier this week that the scientific advice would be published, but did not give a deadline. The government is holding a briefing for education sector leaders on Friday with leading advisers – expected to include Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, alongside Russell Viner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and other experts. Representatives from the teaching unions and sector bodies have been invited to the briefing to submit questions, as the government hopes to convince key figures that it will be safe to reopen primary schools, initially to reception, year one and year six pupils on 1 June. The governments in Wales and Scotland have so far refused to follow England’s decision, meaning their schools will remain closed into next month. Heads have been advised by the DfE that they should prioritise the early years pupils, ahead of those in year six, if their facilities do not allow safe operation. While many heads say they remain unsure about reopening, the Oasis academy chain said it was expecting to reopen its 30 primary and all-through schools on 1 June. Some independent schools have also told parents that they intend to reopen at the start of June.",education
"Child mental health experts have urged the government to prioritise children’s play and socialising with friends over formal lessons and academic progress when schools in England reopen and lockdown restrictions are eased. They say they are “extremely concerned” about the impact of the lockdown and more than six weeks without face-to-face play with peers on child mental health. They are calling on ministers to ensure that play is at the top of newly permitted activities. They are also calling for children to be allowed to play with their peers without social distancing as soon as it is safe to do so, based on a “risk-benefit approach”, recognising the benefits while ensuring children are not exposed to unnecessary risk. Helen Dodd, professor of child psychology at the University of Reading, said: “Returning to school after a long period at home will be challenging for lots of children. It will be especially challenging if they are expected to remain 2 metres away from their friends. “We ask that, once it is safe to do so, the loosening of lockdown is done in a way that allows children to play with their peers, without social distancing, as soon as possible. This may mean that close play is only permitted in pairs or small groups or within social bubbles that allow repeated mixing with a small number of contacts.” The experts, who specialise in child mental health and development, warn that children will be suffering from loneliness and isolation after being required to stay at home as part of the national effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. While ministers will be keen for schools to kickstart academic studies and begin the process of catching up on work missed, the panel of experts who represent five universities including Cambridge and Sussex, say play will be essential to help relieve stress and anxiety among children. In a letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, they write: “At this time, many children’s emotional health will be suffering due to loneliness and isolation. As experts in children’s mental health and development we urge the government to prioritise children’s social and emotional wellbeing in all decisions related to the easing of lockdown restrictions and the reopening of schools.” Focusing on children aged 3-11, they recommend a series of measures to support children as the country emerges from lockdown, asking the government to ensure that children have the time and opportunity to play with their peers, both in school and outside. They say schools should be given the necessary resources and guidance on how to support children’s emotional wellbeing as schools reopen and that “play should be a priority during this time, rather than academic progress”. While many parents and teachers will be anxious about educational progress and health risks, the experts say the government’s public health message must highlight the social and emotional benefits of play and socialising with peers. “We hope that when policy decisions are made in the coming weeks and months that children’s emotional health is given the consideration it deserves,” the letter says. “Poor emotional health in children leads to long-term mental health problems, poorer educational attainment and has a considerable economic burden.” The panel based their recommendations on a “rapid review” of academic literature exploring the harmful impact of isolation on children and the alleviating benefits of play, including one study which found that children who experienced quarantine or social isolation in previous pandemics were five times more likely to need mental health interventions than those who did not. Sam Cartwright-Hatton, professor of clinical child psychology at the University of Sussex, said: “All the research indicates that children’s emotional health is suffering in the lockdown and it seems likely that this suffering will, in many cases, continue into the long term. We are urging ministers and policymakers to ensure that children are afforded substantial, and if possible enhanced, access to high-quality play opportunities as soon as possible.” Dr Jenny Gibson, senior lecturer in psychology and education at the University of Cambridge, added: “It’s easy to dismiss play as unimportant, but for children, playing with friends and classmates has a very significant impact on their social development. “Critically, it is an important way of working through emotions and will therefore be one of the principal ways in which they cope with the isolating effects of the lockdown. For that reason it’s important that whatever steps are taken to ease social distancing restrictions, children are given time and space to play with friends.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the importance of children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing during the coronavirus outbreak. That is why we have published guidance to schools and families about how best to support children and signposted resources to help them to do so. “Mental health support continues to be available for those that need it. NHS services remain open and leading mental health charities are being supported to deliver additional services through the £5m coronavirus mental health response fund.”",education
"My friend and colleague Roger Bowers, who has died aged 77, was influential in English language teaching (ELT) over five decades and a key figure at the British Council for many years. Roger was born in south London, the son of George Bowers, an accountant, and his wife, Hilda (nee Wells). He attended the Royal grammar school in Guildford, then studied classics at Wadham College, Oxford. On graduating in 1964, he joined the British Council, and was posted in 1965 to Ghana, where he lived with his first wife, Gwen (nee Pith), and where their children, Mark and Alison, were born. He later led projects in India and Egypt, and in 1985 became director of the British Council’s English language division. Roger completed his PhD on classroom talk at the University of Reading in 1980, and subsequently combined the roles of academic and education manager. His research was the basis for a series of publications and editing roles, such as the ELT Docs series. He was seconded by the British Council to Birmingham University in 1965, where he was a tutor to international students, and was a visiting professor at Ain Shams University, Cairo, from 1980 to 1984. At the end of the cold war in 1989, Roger was a key figure in the UK government’s response, setting up initiatives to develop English teaching in eastern and central Europe, where English was quickly replacing Russian as first foreign language in schools. In 1992, he became assistant director-general of the British Council, overseeing restructuring and expansion as the organisation became more commercial and enterprise oriented. In 1998 he became CEO of the Trinity College London (TCL) Examinations Board on English language testing. He retired in 2006, and in 2007, after 10 years of work as a trustee, became chair of the Hornby Trust, an English language education charity. He helped to expand the charity, creating grants to language education projects in the global south. Roger and Gwen divorced in 1989. In 2009 he married his long-term partner, Jenny Pugsley, who was also a colleague at the British Council. They were great hosts, welcoming many to their home in London, and in Macclesfield, when the British Council moved him to Manchester, or at the farmhouse they were restoring in France. Roger loved cooking, was a keen angler and, as a linguist, had an enduring curiosity about words. Roger was made OBE in 1984 and CMG in 1997. He is survived by Jenny, by Mark and Alison, and by his four grandchildren, Ellie, Holly, Hazel and Pippa.",education
"Parents in England have complained that the decision by the UK government to reopen primary schools on 1 June was “rushed and premature”. The plan is that primary schools will bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as nursery children, if they have them. According to thousands of accounts submitted by parents and teachers to the Guardian community team, there is still a lot of concern about how physical distancing will be managed and how to balance keeping children and teachers safe with the need for them to return to state education. “There is absolutely no chance I will allow my children, aged 4 and 16, back to school as early as June, while death toll figures and cases are still fairly high. I’d like them to as they’re driving me up the wall, but it doesn’t feel safe yet. September is the earliest I would consider. I have the ability to work from home so I understand it’s hard for parents that need to go to work. But what is more important than your children’s lives?” “Part of me is glad [schools are set to reopen] because both our boys are missing out on so much – one’s in year 1 and the other has special needs and is in year 7. Our youngest son is missing his friends and the socialising aspect of school the most. Schools only have two weeks to get it sorted and unions are rightly kicking off. It doesn’t help that the Department for Education wasn’t consulted, but schools will need to go back at some point.” “We’re very nervous, but we’re unlikely to send them in. Our four-year-old has slight respiratory problems so we’ll keep him off, but what if our 10-year-old daughter catches it and brings it home? She’s missing her friends and at some point the weight of that emotional toll will take precedence. It’s very hard to know how real the fear of how it could impact our family is. Everyone’s so scared and it’s difficult to be rational right now.” “I feel it is too early to say June is the right time – the country is not ready. As a teacher, I work in a secondary school, and can understand going back to work with year 10 and year 12. But as a mother of a two-year-old and five-year-old, I’m very concerned. We know that children don’t seem to get very ill and that’s reassuring to a degree, but there’s no conclusive evidence yet about how they pass on the virus to adults. To me, the decision seems rushed and premature.” “It is crucial. My son is a SEND [special educational needs and disabilities] child in year 6 and he will go to secondary school next school year. He will need a lot of transitional experience in order to manage moving around and learning in a new school, independently. Without this, he will be hugely disadvantaged. He is an only child, so the social side of going back to school would be beneficial too.”",education
"Roads are to be temporarily closed near schools when parents drop off and pick up their children, in order to deter people from driving on the school run – and to encourage more walking, cycling and scooting. The plans to shut off roads at school rush hours, using barriers, cones and other measures, are already far advanced in London and Manchester and are expected to be followed in other cities and towns. Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, told the Observer: “It will mean timed restrictions on traffic around schools to allow people to safely walk to school, cycle to school, scoot to school. I don’t mind if they are on space hoppers as long as it’s not by car. You need to reduce the amount of traffic to allow pupils and parents to walk safely.” Norman said there would be an added danger to parents and children who would have to keep two metres apart if the roads were busy near schools. “The last thing we want is kids and their parents stepping into a busy road or to see increasing air quality problems around schools. “So that [temporary closure of roads twice a day] is going to have to be something that schools and local authorities plan for and I want all schools and councils to be looking at this urgently.” Transport planners are worried that if more people opt to use their cars after the lockdown ends, to get children to and from school, there will be gridlock in urban areas. They also warn that there will be a rapid rise in pollution levels around schools that will be bad for pupils’ and teachers’ health. Yesterday [SAT] the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a £2 billion package “to put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy”. He said that even if the transport network was running at full capacity, the two metre social distancing rule would mean only one in 10 passengers could travel. A national cycling plan will be published in early June to help double cycling and increase walking by 2025, he said. Measures will include pop-up bike lanes and wider pavements as well as cycle and bus-only streets. Trials of e-scooters will also be fast-tracked in a bid to get rental schemes up and running in cities as fast as possible. The length of time that temporary road closures around schools would last, and precisely how they work, will be left up to local councils. But both London mayor Sadiq Khan and the mayor of Greater Manchester, have made clear money will be available and emergency powers can be used to allow them to do so. They say the closures would also make it safer for people to walk or cycle at safe distances from each other en route to and from schools, and help buses carrying children avoid running into heavy congestion. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling gold medallist, who is now cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, said the current crisis had created a unique opportunity to try out ideas that people might find they want to adopt permanently. In Manchester, councils had been given £5m to help develop such schemes and had emergency powers to close or adapt roads. “They [councils] could say, right we need to make a lot more space around these schools so people will stay apart. They could say we will do it with cones, with planters, we will temporarily close roads, we will make it one way so we can use one lane. All of these measures can be adopted … quickly.” Every year more than 200 million car journeys of less than 1km are made, many of these being on school runs. Graham Stapleton, the CEO of retail chain Halfords, said he supported calls by Boardman for trials on e-scooters. “We welcome reports of a forthcoming government announcement on fast tracking e-scooter trials and think if this is true, it will go some way to setting a legal and regulatory framework that means they can be lawfully used on our roads. There is overwhelming public support for trials.” Khan said: “To help mitigate the impact of a greatly reduced capacity on public transport, due to social distancing, we will need millions of journeys a day to be made by other means. If people switch only a fraction of these journeys to cars, London risks grinding to a halt, air quality will worsen, and road danger will increase. “Modelling has shown that there is potential for a tenfold increase in kilometres cycled and up to five times the amount of walking. Our Streetspace plan will act as a catalyst for this change, fast-tracking schemes that will enable many more people to take to two wheels or travel on foot. This includes repurposing traffic lanes on main roads for temporary cycle lanes, widening footways so that people can safely socially distance, looking at where we need to restrict roads to buses and bikes only at certain times of the day, and reducing traffic on residential streets.”",education
"To countless middle-aged people around Dorking, Surrey, who were once pupils at Powell Corderoy school, my mother, Brenda Jenkins, who has died aged 96, was always known, slightly reverentially, as Mrs Jenkins. But to her family she was Mum or Grandma.  She started teaching at Powell Corderoy, a state primary, in the mid-1960s and stayed there until her retirement in 1984. She had a real ability to get the best out of children who were struggling, which is why she wanted to work with children with special educational needs. Born in east London, Brenda was the daughter of Christopher Harley, a merchant at Billingsgate fish market, and his wife, Eleanor, a former milliner. At the outbreak of the second world war Brenda was evacuated to a mining village in South Wales along with other girls from Ilford county high school. More than 30 years later, watching the children’s TV series Carrie’s War, she spotted it had been filmed in the same village to which she had been evacuated, and as the story unfolded Brenda realised some of the events were very familiar to her own experiences. Only then did she realise that the Nina Mabey with whom she had been at school had later found fame as Nina Bawden, the author of Carrie’s War. Brenda loved children and always wanted to be a teacher. By the end of the war, after training in Saffron Walden, Essex, she had started teaching, first in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and later in Ipswich, Suffolk. She married William Jenkins in 1950; they set up home in Chessington, Surrey, and Brenda took a break to raise their four children, Peter, Colin, Marion and me, before starting at Powell Corderoy.  Having children, and later eight grandchildren, kept Brenda in touch with new technology. Even if it required getting completely new skills she would not be daunted. In her 80s she taught herself how to use a computer so she could email her friends and family, and she joined Facebook, passing comments and occasionally posting photos. In her final weeks, when she was isolated at home because of the lockdown, she even managed to make video calls. Brenda’s rapport with children was obvious from the affection generations of her ex-pupils held her in. She was still in touch with one former pupil she had taught in the late 1940s, and who is now in her late 70s. She is survived by her children and her grandchildren, Charlie, Liz, Angus, Emily, Sarah, Hetty, Alasdair and Billy.",education
"Four families who say their children have received “little or no” education since schools in England were closed to most pupils have started legal action against the government. Lawyers acting for the families say their intention is to sue the government over its failure to ensure access to the online learning that has largely replaced classroom teaching since March, because the four are unable to afford laptops or internet connections. Clare Jennings, a solicitor at the law firm Matthew Gold, said the Department for Education’s scheme to provide laptops and internet access for some was restricted to only a small number of pupils, leaving many others without reliable access to online lessons. Teachers in England report pupils having to share laptops or tablets with family members, including with parents working from home. Many schools have distributed or bought their own devices to give to their pupils. The four families living in the south-east of England are eligible for universal credit or local authority support, and include five children eligible for free school meals, aged between six and 13, attending local primary and secondary schools. “The government really hasn’t engaged with the number of children who need access to the internet. They don’t seem to have really addressed how many children are missing out on their education because they don’t have a laptop,” Jennings said. The DfE announced on 19 April it would provide devices to disadvantaged year 10 pupils, as well as pupils who had been in care or assigned a social worker. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs that 200,000 laptops would be distributed at a cost of £85m. Internet access will be provided only to year 10 pupils. But most of the devices will not be delivered until June, while an investigation by Schools Week found that schools were being allocated only a fraction of the devices for which they were eligible. One school, Longdean school in Hertfordshire, said it had applied to the DfE for 66 devices for its year 10 pupils on free school meals but was told it would only get 21. Jennings said the families had sent a “letter of claim” to the DfE to start proceedings, but she hoped the department would instead “respond positively” and provide extra resources to allow all children to learn online. Researchers at the London School of Economics have said the schools closures could open a “chasm” between the education of low-income children and those from better-off families. The work by the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance found that previous unexpected shutdowns had a large impact on children’s education. It said a four-week closure could be equivalent to moving an average child down into the bottom 30% band of achievement. “The effect is greater for children in low-income families,” the centre said. Andy Eyles, one of the authors, said: “It is clear that children from more advantaged backgrounds attending schools where technology is in place to substitute for classroom teaching, and whose parents have both the time and skills to plug the deficit, are likely to be less adversely affected by the closures than others.” The report said options that could help overcome the lost learning included: having pupils repeat the entire year; schools opening over the summer holidays; extending the school week by two hours for every week of closure; and a funding injection of £1,350 per pupil to improve teaching.",education
"Schools in England should not reopen before September and the government must not force parents to send children back if they object, two leading unions have warned the education secretary. As the prime minister prepares to outline plans for an easing of the Covid-19 lockdown, speculation has mounted that schools will reopen from as early as 1 June, first to 10- and 11-year-olds in year six, followed by other primary year groups and then for those mid-GCSE and on A-level courses. But with the death toll from the virus still mounting and continuing anxiety among parents, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, urged the government to rule out reopening before the start of the next academic year. The union intervention came as the Welsh government declared that its schools would not reopen on 1 June, regardless of decisions in England. Earlier this week, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also said schools in Scotland may not return until the end of summer. Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, said: “As you’ll know, there is a lot of speculation about what may or may not be announced regarding schools in England this weekend. The situation for schools in Wales will not change on 1 June. You have my guarantee that we will give everyone time to plan ahead of a next phase starting.” In a letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, seen by the Guardian, Roach warned that any change to the current restrictions on the opening of schools would be “highly premature and extremely damaging”, given the public health emergency. “With the highest Covid-19 mortality rates in Europe, it is clear that the government must continue to adopt an extremely cautious approach which does not contribute to further deaths and a further intensive wave of spread of the virus in the UK,” he said. “In view of the continued and pressing public health challenges and the considerable task that will be required to ensure that every school is ready to admit increased numbers of children and adults into safe learning and working environments, the NASUWT urges the government to end speculation on the reopening of schools beyond the current restrictions prior to September 2020.” Schools in England have been closed since 20 March to all but the children of critical workers and those classed as vulnerable. Pupils have been attending in tiny numbers, with the bulk of learning taking place at home and online. With parent surveys suggesting widespread nervousness about sending children back, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned that parents should not be compelled to do so and schools should not be asked to fine parents for their child’s non-attendance. “It’s very clear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school,” said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT general secretary. “I would not like to see a situation where schools are instructed to issue fines for families who do not feel able to send their children to school even if the government gives them the all clear.” A survey of over 250,000 parents has found that 90% of those who took part did not want to see their children return to school immediately after the government ends lockdown. One in 10 who responded to the Parentkind online survey said they would be happy to wait until staff and pupils have been vaccinated, even if this takes up to 18 months. When asked when they would be happy for their child to return to school, a quarter of parents said they would be happy with a September return date, but that they would like this to be confirmed now; 23% and 18% respectively said they would be happy only when government or school leaders say it is safe to do so, and only 10% said they would be happy with a return to school as soon as lockdown ends. Whiteman said: “If we open schools and no one arrives, it seems a bit of a pointless exercise. Children are precious to parents. They won’t want to be taking any risks with their health and future. Their level of confidence in [coming back to school] is a very serious matter.” Meanwhile, a petition by the National Education Union demanding schools reopen only when it is safe to do so has now attracted 350,000 signatures from parents, teachers, heads, support staff, doctors and health workers. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Gavin Williamson has been clear that schools will not reopen until the scientific advice indicates that it is safe to do so and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met. “Parents of pupils not currently in school due to closures will not be fined, and there are no immediate plans for this to change when schools begin to reopen.”",education
"More than 10,000 childcare providers in the UK are likely to have folded or gone out of business by the end of the coronavirus lockdown, with leaders saying the sector has been “crushed” by financial instability and a fall in demand. A survey by the Childcare online platform found nearly one in six of more than 2,000 providers said they were likely to have permanently closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, while one in three said they were unsure if they would be able to reopen. Just 50% of the childminders, daycare centres and nurseries surveyed said they were likely to remain open after the lockdown ends. In England alone the results would mean a loss of about 150,000 childcare places currently available for children under school age. The Childcare survey found that out of those likely to close permanently, nearly three-quarters blamed financial difficulties. But the remainder said they expected fewer parents to be able to afford or need the childcare they had previously employed. Richard Conway, Childcare’s founder, said it was “shocking” to discover how many providers were likely to close. Conway said a previous poll had found that many parents were considering keeping their children at home after the lockdown ended, meaning providers were likely to suffer. “But, as other parents plan to head straight back to the office, hopefully the business of childcare will pick up,” he said. According to Department for Education (DfE) figures, there were more than 23,000 private daycare centres or nurseries and nearly 40,000 registered childminders operating in England before the advent of coronavirus this year. About half of childcare providers appear to have remained open since the lockdown began in March, with access restricted to the children of key workers. Many report a shortage of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies, similar to schools and care homes. The likely closures follow the government’s reversal of a policy that would have seen nurseries receive their government-funded childcare entitlement, even if they shut during the lockdown, allowing them to continue paying rent, wages and bills. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said at the time the lockdown began in March: “We will continue to pay for all free early years entitlements places, even in the event that settings are closed on the advice of Public Health England, or children are not able to attend due to coronavirus, and we will not be asking for funding back from local authorities.” But on Wednesday the government announced that local authorities would be able to redirect funding away to those settings that remained open. Tulip Siddiq, Labour’s shadow minister for children and early years, said: “Childcare is the fourth emergency service in this crisis, and I know that the government does not want the early years sector which provides it to collapse. So I am urging ministers to rethink this decision and come forward with a proper funding plan to ensure that childcare providers can stay open and survive this crisis.” The Early Years Alliance said providers had told it that local authorities were reducing the level of funding given to settings that had temporarily closed, in order to offer additional funding support to those which are open to key worker families and vulnerable children. Neil Leitch, the chief executive of Early Years Alliance, said it was unacceptable for the government to “continually move the goalposts” for the sector and deprive childcare providers of support they had budgeted for. “While we of course recognise the desire of government and local authorities to do all they can to support providers to stay open for key worker families and vulnerable children, this should not be at the expense of providers who have closed, given that many have had no choice but to take the difficult decision to do so,” Leitch said. A DfE spokesperson said: “Our first priority is ensuring that critical workers and vulnerable children are able to access the childcare places they need at this time. Local authorities will continue to receive free early education entitlement funding throughout the Covid-19 outbreak, and a wide range of support is available for early years providers.”",education
"Teaching unions say they are willing to work with the government to begin reopening schools in England as long as it can be done safely, amid concerns about a renewed coronavirus outbreak. The debate over Boris Johnson’s decision to return some primary pupils to classrooms on 1 June has grown increasingly acrimonious after the British Medical Association (BMA) backed teaching unions who said the government was moving too quickly. Pressure on the unions increased after the children’s commissioner for England called on the two sides to “stop squabbling” and agree on a plan. Anne Longfield said she was in “despair” at the increasingly entrenched positions being taken by the two sides, and that the interests of children were being ignored. However, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, said members supported schools reopening provided they could be made “Covid secure” and it would not put public health at risk. Discussions between unions and government scientific advisers took place on Friday. However, the meeting was inconclusive and critics of the government’s plan said it raised more questions than answers. Roach said teachers needed unequivocal guidance from the government that there would be strong controls in place that would satisfy both teachers and parents that it was safe to return.“We are continuing to say to government but also to schools and employers, that we are here, we want to work with those employers to put plans in place to see whether schools can be ready for reopening from 1 June,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We want schools to be reopened, we want children to be safe and we want staff to be safe. It is not a zero-sum game here. It is about ensuring that we get back to a place where we can return to some form of normality.” Longfield said that until a vaccine was found there would have to be a managed approach to risk. “My worry within all that is that the needs of children and the best interests of children are disappearing from view,” she told Today. “There are really strong reasons why children need to get back into school. It is really imperative to see the can-do willingness to work together that we have seen in other parts of society. “None of us want to put children, or indeed staff or parents, into any kind of situation that is unsafe. But until we get a vaccine we are going to have to be managing risk.” Prof Sir Mark Walport, the chief executive of UK Research and Innovation and a former government chief scientific adviser, said ministers were taking a cautious approach and that a similar phased reopening in Denmark had not led to an increase in the transmission rate of the disease. “It is very harmful for children and complicated for families if their children aren’t in school,” he told Today. “It is clear that although children do get infected – and the evidence is that they are infected probably as often as older people – nevertheless they show less symptoms and almost certainly transmit less than older people. “Class sizes are being kept low, not all school years are going back, so it is being done in a very cautious fashion.” Meanwhile, another English council has publicly stated it would oppose the government’s timetable. Hartlepool borough council said: “Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, the council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1 June. “While we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible.” Hartlepool’s statement followed confirmation that Liverpool’s schools would only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on 1 June. The BMA, the UK’s largest doctors’ union, said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Teaching unions had been “absolutely right” to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on 1 June, it said. “We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,” the BMA council’s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney.",education
"My friend and former colleague Robert Burchell, who has died aged 79, was a historian of the US whose career saw a huge growth in the subject’s popularity in the UK. He was professor of American history at the University of Manchester and the first director of the Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library. Born in Plymouth, Bob was the son of Lucy (nee Symons) and Arthur Burchell, an electrician at the Devonport submarine base. His earliest memories were of South Africa, where the family moved for a few years after being bombed out during the second world war. Returning home, he attended Plymouth college and won a place at Oxford to study modern history, graduating in 1963. He then spent a year at the University of California, Berkeley.  After two years as a senior scholar at Queen’s College, Oxford, in 1965 he became a lecturer at the University of Manchester, where he was eventually appointed professor in American history. For a decade from 1981 he supported the British Association for American Studies in efforts to expand the study of US history in the UK, becoming its chair in 1987. In 1991 he became the first director of the Eccles Centre, retiring in 2001. Eventually Bob would visit all save two of the US states but California had a special allure: his most important book, The San Francisco Irish, 1848-1880 (1979), combined statistical data with personal accounts to reveal how Irish immigrants adapted surprisingly well to life on the Pacific coast. A master of statistical methods, he published a number of closely researched articles challenging standard interpretations of American elections and immigration patterns. He also worked with the US embassy and the Fulbright Commission to fund visiting academic fellowships in the UK and US and to improve resources for libraries. A serious scholar and challenging, occasionally sardonic, teacher, Bob also excelled in administration. He was a tall man, and used his height, wit and political nous to commanding effect.  Bob collected china, glass and Penguin books, and was very private: layers of irony, affected detachment and gloriously ribald stories were a shield. He could appear forbidding, but his wide circle of friends appreciated his kindness and loyalty. His cultivated eccentricity left a vivid impression – as when, his car once having broken down on the open road, he left it there for good, to the relief of his passengers. In 2006 Bob entered into a civil partnership with Stephen Torr.  He is survived by Stephen, his nephew, Mathew, niece, Becky, great-niece, Davey, and great-nephew, Jarrah. His brother, David, predeceased him.",education
"Scientists have cautioned against the reopening of schools after findings suggested children could be as infectious as adults. The study, which was carried out by the team of leading German virologist Christian Drosten, found that even though children tended to have far milder symptoms, those infected appeared to have the same levels of circulating virus in their body as adults. This suggests schools and nurseries could act as hubs of Covid-19 transmission if current restrictions are lifted. “We have to caution against an unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens in the present situation, with a widely susceptible population and the necessity to keep transmission rates low,” Drosten and colleagues concluded. “Children may be as infectious as adults.” The study’s findings came as Unicef warned that the low number of vulnerable and disadvantaged pupils attending UK schools was “deeply concerning”, raising the risk of their education and safety being badly affected by the coronavirus crisis – particularly if schools are seen as hotbeds of infection. Department for Education figures show just one in 10 pupils classed as vulnerable – those in care, with a social worker or with certified special needs or disabilities – went to school in England last week, despite being encouraged to do so. Unicef’s views were echoed by the UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs. Sacha Deshmukh, the executive director of Unicef UK, said that with more than 90% of vulnerable pupils not attending schools, British governments needed to think carefully about how they should receive greater support when schools are able to reopen. “Low school attendance of vulnerable children is deeply concerning. School provides more than an education – for many it is their only safe space. “We know that in the UK, continued closures are likely to widen inequality gaps, with the poorest and most vulnerable children expected to suffer ‘learning loss’ and have lower education attainment. This will have far-reaching implications on their futures,” Deshmukh said. But policymakers will be forced to balance those concerns against the immediate risks that could be attached to reopening schools if children are just as infectious as adults. The German study, which was published as a preprint that has not yet been peer reviewed, screened nearly 60,000 patients for Covid-19, of whom nearly 4,000 tested positive. When the team compared the viral load across age groups, they found similar levels throughout, ranging from one to 10 years to 91 to 100 years. There has been continuing speculation about when schools might reopen, and whether older year groups, including pupils in their final year of primary school and those in the middle of GCSE and A-level courses, could be among the first to be brought back into schools as they might benefit most. When questioned at a select committee hearing on Wednesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, declined to give a date for reopening, saying schools would open in a phased manner. “We recognise that the idea of schools all returning on day one with the full complement of pupils is not realistic or practical,” he said. “I also intend to be giving schools as much notice as possible.” As countries across Europe move to ease lockdown restrictions, there is growing discussion about the role of schools in boosting transmission. However, studies looking at the actual rates of transmission have been complicated by the fact many schools are currently shut or open only to small numbers of children. Some contact tracing studies suggest infection rates are similar in children to adults, while other studies have found little evidence of transmission in children. “This lack of clarity on transmission produces uncertainty for planning to reopen schools,” said Prof Russell Viner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who was not involved in the latest research. “Both keeping schools closed and reopening them carry degrees of risk in terms of population harms. Further data on susceptibility and transmission from population-based studies is urgently needed.” Fewer children have been picked up in national testing programmes, due to milder symptoms. And during the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travellers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children were more likely to catch Covid-19 than to spread infections to other household members. “This observation may be misunderstood as an indication of children being less infectious,” the authors said. The latest work aimed to provide an indirect insight into infectivity. It is possible, the authors concluded, that because asymptomatic children are not coughing they would be less infectious, but the close physical contact between schoolchildren might compensate for that. Prof Martin Hibberd, of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “This new research is consistent with the concept that children can be infected and perhaps also transmit the virus, just as easily as other age groups, without suffering as many symptoms. With testing currently focussing mostly on those with COVID-19 symptoms, it may be difficult to quickly identify the full role of children in transmission.” Unicef has published joint guidelines, with Unesco, the World Food Programme and the World Bank, on how local and national governments can best keep children safe when schools reopen. Deshmukh said: “Reopening schools must be done with the safety and best interests of children at the heart of decision-making. We urge the UK government to use these guidelines as they consider a phased reopening of schools, and develop a comprehensive children’s recovery plan that outlines ongoing support for learners who may have fallen behind during school closures.” ",education
"Schools must not reopen until it is safe to do so and the government must launch a public campaign to convince parents their children won’t be at risk, the shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has said. Ministers see reopening schools to more pupils as a crucial step on the way to allowing people to return to work when lockdown restrictions are lifted. But Long-Bailey said they would first need to persuade parents. “There needs to be a proper strategy: they can’t just open schools and expect everybody to go back to school without a proper public health campaign convincing parents that it’s safe to do it,” she said. Far fewer pupils are attending schools than ministers expected when they closed them on 20 March to all but the children of designated key workers, with many parents presumably keeping children at home for fear they could catch or spread Covid-19. Long-Bailey said parents and teachers would expect to see stringent measures in place to control the spread of the disease before children return. “You need to have mass community testing – not just those who are going to school – so that everyone’s being regularly tested. Then you’ve got to have your personal protective equipment (PPE) to back it up, where appropriate. Then you’ve got to have more frequent and more intensive cleaning of schools,” she said. Asked whether it was feasible for most pupils to return after spring half-term in June, as some in Whitehall have suggested, she said, “it all depends on the science”. “Life is the most important thing, and this is the thing that I’ve found concerning over the past few weeks. Obviously everyone is worried about the economy, and it’s right to be worried about it – but there is nothing more important than protecting human life. So if it’s not safe to send people to school, we shouldn’t be sending people to school.” England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said on Monday that experts on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) were reviewing evidence on the role of children in spreading the disease, as they prepare to make recommendations to the government about which lockdown measures can safely be eased. The lockdown is due to be reviewed by Thursday 7 May, and the government has set a list of five tests, including availability of PPE, testing and the avoidance of a second peak in the virus – which the prime minister has called a “wave of death”. Long-Bailey was handed the education brief after coming second to Keir Starmer in the Labour leadership race: making her one few Jeremy Corbyn allies to remain in the shadow cabinet. Like all members of the Labour frontbench she has been in touch with her Conservative opposite number, Gavin Williamson, and will be briefed by civil servants in the coming days as part of the government’s bid to involve opposition parties in decisions about managing the crisis. Williamson is due to appear before the education select committee on Wednesday. Its chair, the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, has called for teachers to be given priority access to testing and PPE. Long-Bailey listed several questions the government should answer before schools can return. “What happens to vulnerable children who’ve got health conditions? What happens to staff who are at risk? What about people who live with people who are at risk – are they going to be exempted from coming back?” she said. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday it was “inconceivable” that schools could return without some social distancing measures in place. But Long-Bailey cast doubt on that idea. “There’s no way you can socially distance, particularly small kids in a school, never mind keep the parents apart from each other at the school gates when they’re going to pick them up. So it’s quite difficult,” she said. And she urged the government to consider making special dispensation in next year’s exams for the time students will have missed. “When they do go back to school, you’re not just going to have children who need to catch up, you’re going to have children who’ve probably had severe psychological trauma from what’s happened – particularly if they’ve lost family members, but even just being on lockdown for this period of time it’s going to be difficult for them to get back into the swing of things,” she said. “So they’re going to need that extra help. But in terms of catching up, to expect teachers and students to put that much pressure on themselves to catch up on this time, it’s just not feasible – and the assessments that kids have to take, there has to be allowance made – whether it’s a GCSE or an A-level – to not have to force them to make up for that lost chunk of time.”",education
" It was a Friday afternoon. With lessons over for another week, Jill Evans, a deputy headteacher in Herefordshire, set off for a weekend away, telling the school’s head, Julie Rees, her friend and colleague, that she would see her on Monday. She didn’t. Over the weekend Evans, 58, was killed in a car accident. By Monday morning, Rees was not only having to process her own grief but also putting structures in place to help Ledbury primary’s 440 pupils, plus staff and parents, through the enormous emotional fallout the tragedy would bring. Rees’s experience has become exceptionally relevant in these days of coronavirus, as heads and teachers begin to prepare for a return to the classroom. Whenever that time comes, one thing is already clear: many children will have experienced grief and trauma since they were last in school, and school will have a crucial role to play in helping them and their families process their emotions in the time ahead. Looking back to the period around her deputy’s death, in January 2019, the biggest thing Rees says she learned was the resilience of human beings in the face of shocking and unthinkable circumstances. “I’d never imagined I’d have the resources to deal with what I had to deal with,” she says. “If you’d told me I was going to get that call, I’d have thought I’d be a wreck. So I’d say to teachers: believe in yourself in these difficult times, in your inner strength, and trust your intuition about what’s the right thing to do.” The first thing Rees did, on the Monday morning after her colleague died, was to give staff the flexibility to run their classes any way that felt right. “I told the teachers it was up to them to decide how to use the time in class,” she says. “With grief you need time to respond to the children’s emotional needs. You have to make sure there’s plenty of flexibility in the timetable, and that’s how it will need to be when schools go back.” As well as the trauma affecting almost all children, many may have lost a family member – a grandparent, or even a parent – and could be experiencing the death of someone close to them for the first time. “We all process grief in different ways, and that’s as true of children as it is of adults,” says Julie. “Some will be angry, some in denial, some just carrying on with their lives. What’s important is that they know there’s somewhere they can go and someone they can talk to.” After Evans’ death, Rees set aside a room in school for time out, with a counsellor on hand. “If people were having wobbles they could go there and sit quietly or talk, and the staff needed that support as well as the children.” As is so often the case, supporting children means supporting their families, too. Another of Rees’s initiatives at Ledbury primary was to establish a Monday morning parents’ drop-in group. “We invited parents for coffee in the staffroom, to talk to one another and to support one another,” she says. That model of peer support was extended to pupils, as it will surely need to be when school resumes after the coronavirus shutdown. “We focused on encouraging two things: deep listening, and noticing,” says Rees. “Our message to the children was: don’t judge anyone who is crying or angry. Instead, ask them about it. And don’t give advice; just give them space to talk.” Phoebe Gilbert, 21, knows all about being a grieving pupil – she was eight when her mother, Lesley, died suddenly. Along with her father, Ian, and siblings, William and Olivia, she has written a book on how schools and teachers can help, called Loss: a Little Book of Bereavement for Schools. She agrees with Rees that it is vital to acknowledge what a bereaved child has gone through and is continuing to go through. “It meant so much to me, especially on a day like the anniversary of Mum’s death or her birthday, that someone would give me a supportive look or a cuddle – some signal that they knew this was a day when I’d have an especially heavy heart.” Grieving can be lonely, including for children. If teachers are prepared to share their grief, and even their tears, that can be helpful, says Gilbert. “You feel on your own when you’ve lost someone, and we all need to come together. So I’d say to teachers: cry with the children. If a child sees a teacher crying, that’s teaching the child that it’s OK to feel sad, it’s OK to show it, and it’s OK to talk about it. We learn so much from how we see teachers behave – so much more than what they actually teach us in the classroom.” Her father, Ian, founder of Independent Thinking, a platform for educational practitioners to share ideas, says it is vital teachers understand that grief can hit children in waves from nowhere, and they might need to talk or to cry at any time. “One thing that helps is to give them cards they can hand to a teacher when they need help, or to get out of the classroom for a while,” he says. He thinks there will be a need after schools go back to honour those who have died by, for example, holding special assemblies, and says these could be particularly helpful where it was not possible to attend a funeral, or when there might not even have been one. He feels strongly, too, about the need for teachers to be aware of “post-traumatic growth”. “All three of my children value this sense of growth in their own lives,” he says. “With grief and loss come opportunities to grow and learn and to be a better person. It can help bring purpose to a life – a young person might think, how can I share my experiences? How can I use them to help others? “So there are potential positives. And that’s why it’s important not to make death into a big taboo that we don’t talk about, because if we do, we’re likely to miss the opportunities.” Winstonswish.org has information on how schools can support bereaved children and specific advice for the coronavirus pandemic Loss: a Little Book of Bereavement for Schools is published by Independent Thinking Press       ",education
"It was around the time the lockdown began and his wedding photography jobs were drying to a drought that Chris Seddon spent a few hours idly looking through maps and images of the area close to his home in southern Derbyshire.  He was following the line of the River Trent when he noticed an unusual feature close to the village of Swarkestone “and I thought, what’s that? It looks a bit odd, and a bit round.” Aerial photos of the ploughed field were unremarkable, but a Lidar image – a topographical scan using laser light – showed something that maybe, just maybe, appeared to be the ghostly image of a lost henge. A week or two later, having joined an online course run by the archaeology firm DigVentures – in part to help pass the time – Seddon uploaded his pictures to a discussion group, unsure if he had discovered a forgotten Neolithic monument, a former course of the river or a modern drainage ditch. The response from coursemates and professional archaeologists was as excited as he had hoped. While there is no way of knowing for sure without digging, says Lisa Westcott Wilkins, managing director of DigVentures, “we are very happy to say that this does indeed look like a ‘thing’”. Other known Neolithic sites nearby, the scale of the feature and the fact that historic field boundaries respect its course, all support the hypothesis, she says, that it could be a large henge – a significant find in this part of the country if so.  “Of course, we are all just itching to get out there and investigate,” – just one more ambition put on hold by the current lockdown conditions. Seddon’s circular feature might be the most intriguing, but it is far from the only discovery shared by participants of the course. Developed several years ago to let students explore archaeology for the first time, or brush up on existing research, excavation and documentation skills, previous cohorts have seen about 80 participants at a time. But with almost all of this year’s excavations being shutdown because of the coronavirus crisis, the company decided to offer the course for free, and received an overwhelming response; 4,000 people from 69 countries are currently learning how to read maps, draw up plans and record finds from their own laptops. It is far from the only online course to have seen a rush in interest since lockdown began, nor the only one focused on archaeology. The Council for British Archaeology and Lincoln University last week launched Dig School, an online programme of archaeology-themed workshops aimed at school children and families, devised by Carenza Lewis, professor for public engagement at the University of Lincoln and a former presenter of Time Team. But while remote learning can be a challenge in any subject, acquiring practical skills such as how to handle a trowel or dig a test pit might seem a particular challenge for participants who, in many cases, are confined to flats without gardens or limited to a brief daily spin of their neighbourhoods. Learning about archaeology online “has renewed my hope [of finding] a dig to volunteer at, despite my age,” says Bonnie Stewart, a recently retired former quality manager from Asheville, North Carolina, whose lifelong passion for archaeology was sparked when she dug up a revolutionary-era stone musket ball in her back garden as a child. Living in an apartment, she has no opportunity to practise her trench-digging, so has opted for an online investigation into the area around Bath. “It was fun to find the Roman Baths and pretend that I was digging there.” Christine Green has had to temporarily close the craft shop she runs in Talgarth in the Brecon Beacons; her daughter had upcoming surgery cancelled as the crisis began, “so this is a very worrying time for both of us”. Inspired by the DigVentures course, she has dug a trench a metre-deep in her back garden, in which she has found nothing more precious than a fork and a marble. “But a couple of days ago when sitting in my trench with my brush and my palette knife, I suddenly realised that I actually felt happy and unstressed – both feelings somewhat alien to me currently.”",education

"As university researchers race to find a way out of the coronavirus pandemic, top institutions are warning that losing at least half their international students will blow a huge hole in their research budgets and lead to cuts in vital scientific projects. Many universities are anticipating a loss of between 80 and 100% of their usual intake of international students as a result of the virus, with most agreeing a reduction of at least half seems inevitable. This is an enormous hit in cash terms, with some institutions braced for potential losses of more than £100m. But it is all the more painful because universities have been relying on the surplus from international students’ higher fees to subsidise vital research. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “The rhetoric around the budget was all about making Britain a great global science nation, but without international students, that can’t happen.” Vice-chancellors say that almost every university will be in financial jeopardy if the government refuses to give them any support. Prof Colin Riordan, of Cardiff University, a member of the elite Russell Group, says: “Any university that hasn’t got substantial reserves will be at risk. There is barely a university that will be able to last without significant help from the government. Lots would struggle to last beyond a year or so. At the very least, we need some help to buy us some time.” Last week the Treasury was said to be blocking an appeal by the vice-chancellors’ group, Universities UK, for a multibillion-pound bailout. Without it, the group says some institutions will certainly go bankrupt.  A report by London Economics for the University and College Union found that universities faced a £2.5bn black hole from the loss of tuition fees, and without government intervention, 30,000 jobs would go.  Hepi has found that on average every international student pays £5,000 more than it costs the university to teach them. The thinktank says universities typically spend most of this surplus on propping up research, a crucial activity because most funding bodies only pay around three-quarters of what it costs the university to carry out a research project. “International students subsidising research is a huge deal,” Hillman says. “What happens if all that goes? It’s quite simple. You do less research.” Riordan agrees. “Universities are playing an absolutely pivotal role in the crisis, in understanding what is going on and developing routes out of it. Research is critical to that. But at the same time that research is being propped up by a revenue stream that is massively threatened by the virus.” The most prestigious universities say they are being hit with a double whammy because they are the most dependent on international student fees, and also are doing far more research than other universities. Another Russell Group head says some members would need to take in “several thousand extra home students” to make up the lost revenue, “which they just can’t do”. Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, says the extent to which international students support research is “not widely understood”. Riordan says that there is “profound pessimism” in the big research universities about how the crisis could play out if the government fails to step in. Universities UK is lobbying ministers for a multibillion bailout package to stave off financial disaster for many institutions. Among its requests is a plea for government to double research support funding from £2bn to £4bn a year, as well as providing extra assistance for universities relying on high numbers of international students. One senior academic close to Westminster told the Guardian that any help from the government would almost certainly come with strings attached. One condition might be to push struggling modern universities at the bottom of the sector to shift towards shorter and cheaper vocational courses at pre-degree level. This would be controversial, moving back in the direction of the pre-1992 system, when there were polytechnics and universities. Hillman, who used to be a government adviser, says: “There are definitely people in Whitehall who think that what should happen at the end of this crisis is a reshaped HE sector with some universities looking more like polys, with less emphasis on degrees.” However, he says this would be a “dangerous” mistake because, although Britain is lagging behind countries such as Germany on vocational skills training, persuading more people to stay on and gain skills after GCSE should not mean depriving young people of the chance to get a degree. “Many students in universities are doing vocational training anyway. They aren’t sitting around learning Latin, they are training to be pharmacists or nurses, and this crisis has shown us how important those advanced skills are.” Before the coronavirus crisis, the Treasury was pushing for a student numbers cap to control spiralling costs of unpaid student loans. Now UUK is calling for a one-year cap, with institutions limited to recruiting no more than 5% more students. The idea is that this would stop prestigious universities from hoovering up thousands more home students to compensate, with universities lower down the food chain struggling to fill places and facing ruin. But Ian Dunn, provost at Coventry University, a modern university heavily reliant on international student recruitment, says institutions at the top may still increase their numbers significantly. “When we last had a cap in 2012 it was set at 1% of the last year’s intake. Now we are talking about 5%. If that is based on the optimistic projections that many institutions put forward, it could mean some places could still take 10 or 15% more students than last year.” He says that if even 10 large universities at the top do this, that would have a big knock-on effect lower down the chain. Riordan can understand the anxieties lower down the sector, but says: “If the outcome is that there isn’t enough money to support crucial research, then clearly everyone will try to get as many students as they can.” Prof Anne Carlisle, vice-chancellor of Falmouth University, says that even though her university is not as reliant on international students as other institutions, it is bracing itself for an impact on recruitment. “We are still anticipating a scenario in which fewer UK students decide to enrol because of the uncertainty – though I feel the worst thing a student could do right now is defer, or not complete their degree, and join the unemployment queue.”",education
"Most of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours – phone calls and messages flying around between friends – but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week. The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn’t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed. Still, to our three kids – Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) – the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn’t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis. The announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. Spending per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest. Nor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams. Because of that lack of money, and because, according to the OECD, Italy has the oldest teachers in the world – 59% are over 50 – Italian schools are heavily analogue. Kids carry a dozen books to and from school every day in massive backpacks, like Obelix and his rock, which did not seem like a promising basis for remote learning. But if Italian schools weren’t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try. Parents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children’s learning. But slowly – over the course of two months – something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated. The first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don’t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day. In those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of “otium-negotium”, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies – unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life. We had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I’ve also spent much of my life teaching. I’ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we’ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have “fingers on buzzers”. The few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child’s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: perudo (“liars’ dice”), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren’t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser. Being the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip. Despite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren’t sharing these cultural delights with our children. The following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown. We were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan “andrà tutto bene” (“it’ll all be fine”), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise. It was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded. The other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer. The closing of all Italy’s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. “The entirety of this new form of online teaching,” said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, “was created by us teachers at the last minute.” At the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn’t only that sites and servers crashed as the country’s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn’t connect at all. The Digital Economy and Society Index rates Italy 24 out of 28 European countries in its “digitalisation index”, and last year Italy’s national statistics agency, Istat, reported that 23.9% of Italian families have no access to the internet. As one teacher said to me: “We’ve discovered how democratic pencil-and-paper is.” The attempt by many teachers to get less-privileged students the necessary laptops and internet connections is one of the untold stories of this crisis. By 19 March, the ministry of education claimed to have distributed 46,152 tablets throughout the country. Since then, an emergency budget has created a €70m fund for providing computers to those without. Even if the necessary hardware is distributed, one special educational needs teacher told me that online classes just don’t work for children who need bespoke lessons: “Those who are already doing well at school are now doing even better, but those who were struggling are just falling further behind.” At the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as “DAD” – didattica a distanza, or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. “I have an exceptional digital consultant”, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. “He’s 11, and is one of my students. He’s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.” The teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren’t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren’t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn’t bring them back into the circle. Teachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. “I could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,” said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. “I now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.” But school was also being reinvented because Italy’s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they’re bocciato – failed – and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer. Traditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed. “Many of my colleagues are really struggling”, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. “Before, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points – 5.4, 5.5.” These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents. There has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria Montessori. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: “A child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.” Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family – parents, siblings and grandparents – all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room. Many teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. “Some of them have lost a grandparent”, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. “Their parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.” At the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn’t be the one overloading them, but vice versa – they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: “They no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available”, she said. “They have this need to be immediately reassured – that their work has been received, that it’s OK, that you’re happy with them.” That fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces – their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. “There’s no longer the intimidation of the pack,” said one teacher, “and so they’re bringing out what they really know. I’ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.” Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. “It makes you understand”, said Lante, “that we need a very varied form of education”. By the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they’re monosyllabic when describing their days at school – “fine” usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on. It was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn’t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated. Another consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools – boisterous disturbances – suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents’ presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters. But there was no timetable to our children’s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn’t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided. We had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become – if not agoraphobic – certainly “agora-meh”. They wouldn’t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas. As often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow. It’s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if – as a writer – you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me. I tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought “if they’re not going to read, I’ll read to them”. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. “I just don’t get poetry,” Emma grumbled. Fortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn’t – outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and – their much-missed English snack – digestive biscuits. It’s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds. I changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney’s Digging. It’s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It’s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it’s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. “Go on then,” I said, “write it your way.” Suddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction – “squelch”, “slap”, “rump” – the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands. As they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren’t about approval (external) but honesty (internal). The more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone’s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens. Even those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: “Distance-learning is a strange video game,” he said, “but in the end it’s a torture. A teacher can’t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional – an artificial TV personality.” Many parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because – without those marks – they have no measure of their offspring’s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me “parents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn’t ‘an eight’ or hasn’t completed the set book. They’re the ones we really need to educate.” Surprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. “When all this talk about digital learning began back in March,” he said, “I was very, very worried, because it’s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.” Edoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: “A WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn’t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.” No one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only “a willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge”, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, “is how we educate each other together.” It’s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we’ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it’s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that’s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide. And with almost five months to go until schools (possibly) reopen in mid-September, I’m sure we’ve still got a lot to learn.",education
"MPs with university constituencies are calling on the government to set up emergency maintenance grants for students from low-income backgrounds who are in financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic. They are part of a cross-party campaign seeking to alert the chancellor to the students’ plight and calling on him to offer financial support to those who have lost jobs and are not entitled to claim universal credit. Layla Moran, the education spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, who is leading the campaign, said students from low-income backgrounds, without parents to fall back on for financial support, were among the most economically vulnerable in society as a result of the crisis and were in need of government support. “They are not eligible for universal credit, and many who do work throughout their studies have fallen through the cracks in the government’s furlough scheme,” she said. “That’s why I, along with 13 other cross-party MPs with university constituencies, have written to the chancellor calling on him to introduce a maintenance grant to help poorer students through these tough and stressful times. We cannot allow the most vulnerable in our society to fall through the gaps.” The Covid-19 pandemic has caused huge disruption in universities, where teaching has moved online and student life has been brought to a standstill. Most students have travelled home to be with family while others remain stranded by the lockdown. Students from low-income backgrounds who work throughout their studies in low-wage, zero-hours jobs to top up maintenance loans have been hard hit. Most have lost their jobs as the pandemic has closed businesses, yet they continue to have to pay rent and bills. A survey of 250 university and college students who have been in care or are estranged from their family found they were most worried about being able to earn money to pay for rent and bills (62%), finishing their course (62%), mental health due to isolation (55%), and getting essential food and medical supplies (50%) during the lockdown. While many universities have set up hardship funds, the Scottish government has announced a £5m package of emergency financial support to help students facing . Campaigners would like Boris Johnson’s government to do the same. Becca Bland, chief executive of Stand Alone, which campaigns on behalf of students estranged from their parents and was one of three charities that carried out the survey, said: “Many students who are estranged from their family remain on campus as it is their primary residence. “We want the government to recognise, as the Scottish government has done, that losing income for students in this position will impact their ability to feed themselves, pay their rent and subsequently their chances of graduating.” The MPs’ letter to Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, warns that businesses relying on temporary student labour will find it far easier to hire a new cohort of students to fill vacancies when the shops, pubs and restaurants reopen, rather than furlough students that may not even be resident in the same city when the pandemic subsides. “Many of these students will not be able to find another job but will still be paying bills and rent. Full-time students are also not entitled to benefits through universal credit. Instead, they must rely on the generosity of their parents or guardians, some of whom will not be in the financial position to support their children.” Among those MPs who have have put their names to the letter are Caroline Lucas, from the Green party, Labour’s Clive Lewis, Claire Hanna of the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and Wera Hobhouse of the Liberal Democrats. The Treasury and the Department for Education have been contacted for comment.",education
"Dr Li Wenliang was an astute observer. Back in December, the Chinese opthamologist noticed that there were a series of patients who had upper respiratory infections in Wuhan that seemed similar to prior Sars outbreaks. He alerted colleagues on WeChat but was quickly criminalized by the state for spreading “false rumours”. It wasn’t until after the young doctor’s death from Covid-19, the same disease he had identified, that the Chinese authorities cleared him of wrongdoing. Just a few weeks later, and a few thousand miles away, American doctors are experiencing a similar silencing. Physicians and nurses have lost their jobs during the surging pandemic for alerting media about shortages of masks and hospital equipment. At the highest level, the Trump administration has resisted the advice of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and a physician, when he called for a more urgent and intense federal response. Central to the art of doctoring is observation. Physicians see disease and destitution in clinics and hospitals. They interview and listen, and trace illness back to family histories and living situations and environment. They advise politicians and government agencies with data and science. For many centuries, this has led doctors to speak out against the powers that be – demanding that they treat at the source. But in many countries, this has also led to backlash, even death. Rudolf Virchow was a German physician in the 19th century, known for linking cancer to the cell. He was also a writer, a scientist and a politician, applying his faculties in microscopy to the city infrastructure in Berlin to curb the spread of disease through sewage and water. Virchow is credited with creating Germany’s first public health programs. Virchow got in trouble regularly – he was expelled from Charite hospital for joining the 1848 revolution, and was ostracized by his colleagues. But the doctor truly found himself in the line of fire when he criticized the government’s investment in the military instead of education and alleviating poverty. As one story goes, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck was so furious that he challenged Virchow to a duel. Bismarck found Virchow at work in his lab, where he had recently identified the roundworm Trichinella spiralis, which can contaminate meat. “I suppose I have the choice of weapons,” the doctor apparently said, and held up two large sausages. He told the Bismarck that one was filled with the roundworm he was studying, the other was completely safe to eat, and asked him to choose one. The duel ended there. Virchow’s fate, however, is in some ways a lucky one. Other physicians who have spoken out on behalf of their patients, or the poor, have suffered blackmail, violence and persecution. The British physician Judith Mackay, for instance, started speaking out against tobacco companies in the 1960s when she studied the stark impact of smoking on health in Hong Kong. But when she started pushing the government to adopt stricter regulations, she was immediately threatened. Mackay was called “psychotic human garbage”, a “power-lusting piece of meat” and “a key individual [whose] presence is a danger signal” by multinational companies that launched campaigns to discredit her research. In more recent years, Binayak Sen, an Indian pediatrician, highlighted the struggles and inequities in healthcare faced by the most marginalized in Indian society: the country’s adivasis, or indigenous people, some of whom identified with a Maoist movement. For three decades, Sen lived in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, where he trained health workers to provide where government healthcare failed. He systematically documented the senseless deaths from malnutrition, lack of access to adequate healthcare and lack of political agency. But the central government started noticing Sen’s activism when he became involved in the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, a human rights organization that investigated abuses against indigenous people. In 2007, the Indian government charged him with sedition, a law originally created by British colonial government to control the local population. He was sentenced to life in prison on charges of supporting a Maoist insurgency. Sen was jailed for several years and spent a considerable amount of that time in solitary confinement. He was released without comment from the supreme court of India in 2011. But 13 years later, his appeal is still pending in front of the Chhattisgarh high court. While some physicians are criminalized for speaking from the margins of society, others are involved in larger revolutionary movements. Such was the case for Steve Biko, a South African medical student who began a social movement to fight apartheid in the 1970s. At the time, healthcare systems for black and white individuals in South Africa were separate and unequal. Black doctors were largely not allowed to take care of white patients, or even examine their bodies when they died. As Biko was highlighting systemic inequities through his black consciousness movement, he was subject to a “banning order” from the government, which censured his speech and movement. In 1977, he was detained by police under the pretext of a terrorism act, and beaten to the point of brain hemorrage. The prison physician ignored recommendations by a consulting neurologist and neurosurgeon, and Biko died at the hands of the state, alone in a jail cell. That year, a group of doctors filed a claim, demanding that the Medical Association of South Africa take action against the prison doctors, but it was left idle in the court. Eight years later, Dr Wendy Orr, a medical doctor for the government, started to take notice of these cases. Orr said later that she was the only physician “to reveal evidence of police torture and abuse of political detainees in South Africa”. After seeing countless patients showing signs of being tortured by police forces, she alerted her superiors, only to be informed that her job was solely to tend to the wounds and physical complaints that the prisoners had. In the mid 1980s, Orr took her claim to the South African Supreme Court. The court heard both Orr’s case, as well as the one brought on by the doctors hoping to seek justice in Steven Biko’s death. But the Medical Association of South Africa turned their head yet again, refusing to punish those responsible for these prison deaths. Orr became the commissioner for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, where these abuses were recounted in detail for the first time. She recalled later that the stories of witnesses such as Mr Nalgas, a subject of the torture, brought Archbishop Desmond Tutu to tears. “For me this sums up the damage done to all of us by apartheid: it treated black people as something less than human, and it dehumanized white people because they came to believe that,” she wrote. As the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, the censorship and silencing of whistleblowing physicians persists. One the one hand, health workers are held on a pedestal - with citizens lining their windows and balconies to applaud them every evening in cities like London and New York. But when they push their institutions or governments too far - whether calling for public health measures like physical distancing, or funding for something as simple as a mask, doctors risk not only their lives on the frontlines, but also their jobs and basic rights. As Virchow, the German pathologist, astutely noted: “Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale.”",education
"Sixth formers, whose A-level exams were cancelled because of coronavirus, may miss out on freshers’ week too. Universities have confirmed they are making plans to start the next academic year online if social distancing continues.  Vice-chancellors are braced for potential huge losses from the lucrative international student market from September, following disruption to end-of-school learning and exams, as well as to the English-language testing required to get into a UK university. And now experts are warning that if social distancing measures stretch into the autumn, many UK-based students might also choose to defer going to university rather than start the year in their bedrooms at home. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank says: “I feel for these young people as their A-levels have been disrupted and they won’t get to go to their school leavers’ proms. Now they may not have their freshers’ weeks either.” He warns that if home students don’t turn up in September, institutions will face a dangerous cut in income. “Some universities will start falling over. Universities will play a valuable part in pulling us out of the recession that is coming, so it is more important than ever that they survive.” Vice-chancellors are hoping to reopen campuses in time for the new academic year, but say they are working on contingency plans in case the lockdown is still in place, or they are forced to close again at short notice if the virus resurges in the winter. Many institutions are proposing to start first-year degrees online and move to face-to-face lectures and teaching in the second term, or as soon as campuses are able to open. But some say this is not a good option for school-leavers who haven’t yet learned to study independently, and they would push the start of the year back to January. Colin McCaig, professor of higher education policy at Sheffield Hallam University, says: “I have real doubts about young people’s willingness or preparedness to start an online degree this autumn.” Existing students who are used to studying at university are more able to cope with the disruption of teaching shifting online for a term or two, he says. “But it’s another thing entirely for young people who have been looking forward to starting the more usual higher education experience.” Diana Paton, William Robertson professor of history at Edinburgh University, has been talking to her daughter about the possibility that the drama degree she plans to begin at Queen Mary University of London in September might have to start online. “We are advising her to wait and see. But drama is a very practical subject that involves working with other people in the same physical space. So she doesn’t feel it would make sense for her to start studying her degree online, and we agree,” she says.  Paton says this would be a big disappointment for her daughter, who has already had her gap year ruined by the virus, having returned from a planned three-month trip to south-east Asia after only three weeks. She thinks starting online would be challenging for students regardless of their subject. “One of the things first-year undergraduates find difficult is the transition from school to university. Part of dealing with that is getting to know their cohort, and meeting people outside of their degree.” Hillman agrees that first-year students may feel lost without a face-to-face university experience. “Our research has shown that students really like lectures. That’s not because they are a good way to learn, but because they are a social occasion. Online learning is a good second best, but for many it is just that – second best.” He adds: “Students who move into a hall with 300 other people often feel lonely, so how are you going to feel if you are sitting in a bedroom at home on your own?” Hillman says many young people will not be keen to put university on hold. But, he adds, if they do, the consequences for universities, already struggling to deal with losing international students, will be grave. Neil Morris, professor of educational technology at the University of Leeds says, however, that good online courses are in fact “very social”. “They are very much about interactive discussions and group work. But they have to be designed from the start with that in mind.” With online learning traditionally taking months to design, universities will be scrambling to produce something sufficiently professional and engaging in time for September. Morris says: “I think a lot of universities should be able to do this by the autumn, given that they’ve been up-scaling online provision in recent years anyway. But those that haven’t already been working on this will find it much more difficult.” Dr Doug Clow, who spent 20 years at the Open University and is now advising higher education on the Coronavirus, says universities have delivered an “incredible” emergency response, moving all teaching online overnight with “next to no resource”. He is confident they will be ready to launch their degrees online in the autumn. “But the fact is that whatever universities prepare, it is still going to fall far short of what a sensible, planned start to an online programme would be.” Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at the University of Bath, says: “Students are accepting that the sudden switch to online teaching is all a bit belt and braces, but if we are relying on this as a means of delivery in September then it will need to look and feel much slicker.” He says learning technology experts and academics are working hard to find new ways to put often very complicated teaching online – but says the sector must not forget poorer students. “There is a big issue of whether all students have access to high-speed broadband or a quiet place in their household where they can study.” However, Prof Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor of Aston University, is sceptical about pushing first years online. “I’ve always been reticent about online education for school leavers. It is fantastic for older learners who are juggling study alongside work and family commitments, because they tend to be very self-motivated. But it is different if you are just starting out.” If social distancing is still in place, Aston would look at starting first years in January. They would aim to “accelerate” the year, with students making up the lost time between June and August. Chris Ince, secretary and registrar at London Metropolitan University, says his university might also postpone the start of degrees. “We might look at pushing back enrolment to October or November, depending on what is happening, and then compress the academic year by removing reading weeks and so on.” He adds: “We already have about 10% of our undergraduate intake starting in January, and they compress their course into two-and-a-half years, so we know it is achievable. But trying to do that with an entire cohort would be a big shift.”",education
"Schools across England are being asked to donate science goggles and other apparatus to the NHS due to a shortage of protective equipment for doctors dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. The Guardian has heard from a number of schools and teachers who are responding to urgent messages from NHS trusts that need face shields. NHS England and the government have made a major effort since the weekend to address concerns about protective gear. The army has been called in to help deliver millions of pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) and 200 hospitals were due to receive extra kit overnight on Tuesday. However, doctors say deliveries are not arriving soon enough, and groups representing frontline staff say doctors could quit over the issue. Unsworth academy in Greater Manchester has donated more than 50 pairs of science goggles since the outbreak. The school’s principal, Sue Armstrong, said: “We are delighted to be able to help the NHS at a time when we all need to pull together. Schools across the trust are doing all they can to support national services during these unprecedented times and will continue to strive to meet the needs of our students, families and wider school communities.” Lindsay Skinner, the headteacher at St James school in Exeter, said: “On Sunday my best friend, who is a paediatrician, contacted me to ask if my school had any PPE. I said that we had goggles and glasses in science and technology. I hadn’t imagined that they would be of much use as they are secondary school quality, not medical grade quality. However, she put me in contact with Lowri Harris, the lead south-west GP appraiser, who was very clear: school-quality PPE is better than no PPE.” She added: “She collected just shy of 200 items from us on Monday. When she saw them, she almost cried. She then delivered them to eight different GP surgeries, including her own.”  Skinner said she knew of two heads and two trust leads who had donated their school PPE to support health workers across the NHS. Huntington school in York sent “well over 100” pairs of goggles and “as many rubber gloves as we can get hold of” to York hospital after a plea from a parent who works there as a nurse, Schools Week reported. The headteacher, John Tomsett, said it “does feel like war effort stuff” but the school was keen to help the community in any way it could. David Weston, the chief executive of the Teacher Development Trust, a UK charity that works to raise awareness of the importance of professional development for teachers, said: “The first school I heard giving equipment was Huntington in York, who donated a whole bunch of personal protective equipment. There are loads of people saying they are grateful for it. I wonder if there is a central approach to doing this.”  A south London hospital has also asked schools for supplies, the Guardian understands. And Newton Abbot college, a secondary school in Devon, has donated goggles from its science labs to local hospitals. Other sectors are taking the same approach, with some vets giving ventilators usually used on animals to the NHS. Dr Rachel Dean, the director of clinical research and excellence in practice at VetPartners, said: “We are providing ventilators but also monitoring and general anaesthetic equipment. Some of the equipment we have is specifically made for animals. But some of the kit we use was originally manufactured for humans so it is appropriate to use in human healthcare setting.” Some ventilators were believed to be in hospitals already, she said, adding: “If we can give the NHS a machine … and we have to do more work for our patients, then that is what we have to do.” Dr Rinesh Parmar, the chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, which represents grassroots medics, said: “The longer this epidemic goes on for, if doctors feel that there is a widespread lack of personal protective equipment then some doctors may feel they have no choice but to give up the profession they love.” The Royal College of Nursing, which represents Britain’s 400,000 nurses, also signalled its deep unease with the serious shortages of PPE and said the issue could compel nurses to choose between their jobs and their safety.",education
"PhD and master’s students have signed an open letter asking to be given extensions to their funding by research councils so they can finish work disrupted by the coronavirus. The letter, which has more than 1,000 signatories across UK universities, asks for research councils to urgently publish a plan outlining additional financial support for all postgraduate students. Many postgraduate students are currently unable to continue their research projects and theses because fieldwork has been halted and university labs and libraries are shut. Other students may be caring for relatives, while many international students have returned to their home countries.Most funded PhD students are reliant on the stipend they receive from research councils to cover the cost of living, usually over a three-year period. Some research master’s students and postdocs receive equivalent funding. The letter states: “Postgraduate research studies are undertaken with limited resources, both in terms of time and finances. Many will have to redirect their efforts away from research to manage the crisis. Through this precarious time they will need to use their funding to support themselves.” The letter is authored by the Cambridge branch of the University and College Union and the university’s graduate union. Alessandro Ceccarelli, the graduate union president and a co-author of the letter, said he was prompted to write the letter by the “massive concerns” voiced by postgraduate students both in his university and others. “Without serious guarantees from UK Research and Innovation and research councils on funding to cover non-medical breaks from study and extensions, students are worried that necessary pauses to their research will leave them without funding to live on, and are unable to make informed decisions about how to continue their research,” he said. Alice O’Driscoll, a third-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge who signed the letter, said that the libraries and archives she uses to research her thesis were shut at short notice. “We’re in limbo at the moment. I don’t have all the books I need. The funding deadline remains the same as far as we know so that keeps coming closer, and yet we obviously are having to stop or significantly slow down our workload,” she said. O’Driscoll has received an email from the team at her university on behalf of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which funds her PhD, but it does not offer any guarantees around funding. The letter states: “At present, our assumption is that we will consider requests for extensions to submission dates or maintenance funding on a case-by-case basis but we will clarify this point in due course.” O’Driscoll thinks the proposed approach would force PhD students to endure uncertainty over their funding arrangements for too long. “Everyone is facing the same problems and no funding bodies have the capacity to deal with that amount of case work. That’s why we’re asking for a structural response that extends everyone’s funding rather than asking us all to apply,” she said.UK Research and Innovation, which funds 20,000 students, said: “We will be responding to the letter directly. We recognise the serious challenges facing universities and students as well as the businesses, charities and research organisations we work with. “We are committed to working closely and at pace with our communities and with the government to understand and respond to the impacts of Covid-19 and find the best solutions.”",education
"Kirsty Ackah was in her second year at Southampton Solent University when she went to hospital for 24 hours with mental health problems. “I missed my last exam,” she says. Although her university knew what had happened, it was marked down as a fail. “I was going through severe mental health issues and I didn’t realise I needed to organise retaking the exam over the summer,” she says. “By the time I found out, it was too late.” Ackah had to wait 12 months before retaking her third year. “It’s really sad because many students are young and not that well equipped to handle life-altering decisions,” she says. “Some guidance would’ve made all the difference to me.” According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), increasing numbers of students are dropping out. Failing assessments can be a reason, as retakes are potentially expensive and stressful. Universities minister Michelle Donelan says institutions need to step up and take action. “We cannot let these students down and let talent go to waste,” she says. If you’re struggling or you’ve failed already, here’s what to consider. Although each university has its own rules and regulations, Lanisha Butterfield from the University of Oxford says key reasons for mitigating circumstances include acute illness, unforeseen circumstances such as a traffic accident or bereavement, or a disability or long-term health condition. “All cases are looked at individually. It’s about putting your case forward and asking for help with your application,” she says.Be aware that financial difficulties, mild illnesses, work commitments, poor time management or loss of material do not generally count as mitigating circumstances. People often put off applying for extenuating circumstances because they think they don’t deserve it. James-John Connorwood, a law student at Glasgow Caledonian University, developed abdominal pains before sitting his last exam but the prospect of not graduating with his friends terrified him. “I attempted to push through and go ahead with the exam but the pain was excruciating,” he says. “I left the hall before finishing the paper.”Many universities now allow self-certification requests for extensions. You can often apply for one or two per academic year and they can be used for coursework, written assignments, dissertations and projects. Be careful not to waste them. “I used my free pass for the sake of having extra time on a subject I disliked,” says Valerie Cole (not her real name), who studied sociology and media studies. When she was unwell later that year, she was unable to use a self-certification request and failed two exams. “It cost me. It was £1,500 just for the retakes and I had to pay for the extra year. I’ve had to defer my graduation because I’m still paying my fees back in instalments.” If you think you may be unable to perform in an exam, act quickly and make sure you keep a record of all events. Most universities will require written evidence. This can include an official police report if you have been a victim of a crime, a death certificate if you have suffered a bereavement, or a dated letter from a doctor or hospital. “It can be difficult as it can be quite defeating to fight your case. But you have to do it,” says Ackah. Take advantage of academic skills support services, student counselling, lecturer office hours and personal tutors. If your application has been declined, you can request a review of the decision. Education lawyer Rhys Palmer says students are increasingly taking legal action. “Many people don’t appreciate at the time that they have mental health conditions or were unwell and they want a fair chance to resit,” he says.After a conversation with lecturing staff, Connorwood was made aware of the mitigating circumstances process and will resit the exam. “It’s meant that I haven’t had to give up on my dream of becoming a solicitor. I feel hugely supported by my uni,” he says. “I recommend any student that finds themselves in a similar situation seek help. It could save you from dropping out.”",education
"My father, Pino Chirico, who has died aged 81, taught Italian to generations of students in the east of England, and had a lifelong commitment to a united, peaceful, inclusive Europe. He was born in Reggio Calabria, southern Italy, the son of Domenico Chirico, a station master, and Isabella (nee Pirozzo). He was profoundly affected by his early memories of war, having spent the summer of 1943 sleeping in his grandparents’ olive groves near Rosarno, a small town 30 miles from Reggio, to avoid bombings. Pino was educated at Tommaso Campanella classical high school. He played tennis, and, while a teenager, became junior champion of south Italy. He wrote weekly articles for the local newspaper, and was active in the church. He recalled with pride being told off by his father for his graffiti: “Long live the Catholic communists.” Later he spent summers at international work camps in Germany. In 1956 Pino enrolled in the language faculty at Naples University, studying English and German. When his father died in 1959, Pino left his studies to support his mother and sister, and went to work as an interpreter in the state railways, first in Milan and then Messina. One evening in October 1965, a young teacher and sociology graduate, Margaret Thomas, walked into the information office at Messina station. Had she arrived 12 hours earlier, as planned, Pino would not have been working. As it was, it was love at first sight. Pino and Margaret were married in 1967.  Pino completed his studies in Messina. In 1971 he got a job as a lecturer in Italian at Liverpool University, and also worked as a researcher on Cassell’s English-Italian dictionary. The family lived in Ainsdale, north of Liverpool, and Pino became a loyal fan of Liverpool Football Club. In 1974 he moved to Peterborough Technical College, later Regional College, staying for almost three decades, as lecturer in Italian and German and multicultural co-ordinator. He developed a nationally validated interpreters’ course, helping non-English speakers in hospital, social services, courts and similar situations. After “retirement” in 2002, he taught Italian at Oakham school in Rutland for 10 years. Pino remained a committed member of St George’s church, Stamford, and a vocal supporter of the UK’s membership of the European Union. He and Margaret bought a ruined farmhouse in Brittany and spent 30 years of holidays bringing it back to life. In the last three years of his life, he cared for Margaret as she recovered from a stroke. He is survived by Margaret, by his sons, Paul and me, and his grandchildren, Lola, Sonny, Ashley and Hartley.",education
"Universal free meals for children in key stage 1 are rumoured to be under threat, possibly in tomorrow’s budget. The policy has been controversial since it was introduced in 2014 by the coalition government. headteacher, St Matthew’s primary school, Cambridge  YES. I questioned the policy when it started as I thought the funding could have been targeted at the children who most needed it. But I have seen the impact it has had on my school. There’s been a big uptake in school meals, which helps to improve the quality of school meals for everybody. More children are now accessing nutritious food at lunchtime at lower prices, due to economies of scale. It’s also changed behaviour in key stage 2. We have seen more children continue to opt for school meals, and an increase in the number of children who register for pupil premium so that they can continue to get their meals for free. So I think it has helped more disadvantaged children to get support that they weren’t accessing before the policy came in. Food poverty is a challenge in our community, and not just for children who qualify for pupil premium. A lot of parents are in low-paid employment, with children who don’t quite qualify for support. They are right on that boundary. By making free school meals universal, we are supporting families who are struggling to make ends meet. Many schools have put in new kitchens, employed additional kitchen staff, midday supervisors and office staff to manage the big increase in the number of school meals. To suddenly turn around a few years later and take the funding away would be typical of the thoughtlessness and disregard government can show to schools and the communities they serve, and their failure to understand what it’s like on the ground. I find it really quite insulting. The government needs to have a proper long-term strategy for dealing with poverty and disadvantage in childhood, instead of flip-flopping between policies. CEO, Passmores Co-operative Learning Community trust, which includes three primary schools in Essex  NO. I would like to say yes, because we should be able to fund universal infant school meals alongside everything we have lost because of austerity. However, I’ve had my idealism battered out of me over the last few years. I’ve got to be realistic. There is only so much money in the public pot and this policy means we are spending money on food for some affluent families. That is not the best use of that money, which should be spent on our most vulnerable children. A hungry child doesn’t learn well and it’s right that children get a decent meal every day at school. But the government says there’s not enough money to do everything, that we can’t afford a short waiting list for mental health services for young people in crisis, that Sure Start centres have to shut. If we could reinvest in those services, sacrificing free meals for the families who can afford to pay for them would be worth it. The other issue is that at our school we have to use money from our education budget to supplement the cost of providing free meals. The amount the government provides is around 30p short per child, per day. Those costs add up. Money that could be spent on teachers is feeding children of some families who could afford to feed themselves. So I would support cutting back on funding for this policy as long as the most deprived families continue to be eligible for free meals and there’s a guarantee that the money saved stays in education. The problem is that when the government cuts back on something for young people, the money often disappears into a different pot.  school governor and education campaigner, Dorset NO. There is no evidence the policy has any of the educational or health benefits that were promised when it was introduced. It’s costing schools money as they are forced to subsidise the policy from teaching budgets because it has never been properly funded. The government pays only £2.30 per meal, which was the average cost of providing a meal in 2011. Food prices have risen. Any costs over £2.30, schools are having to fund from teaching budgets because they are legally obliged to provide those children with a free school meal. As a result, the catering industry has made a lot of money out of this policy. They have a great vested interest in keeping the policy going. Because of austerity, there are children going hungry. A primary school can have a child of a millionaire sitting with a free meal next to a child living in poverty, who is a year older and doesn’t get a meal. That is obviously not fair. We should be prioritising based on need, rather than a child’s age. Instead of funding this policy, the government should offer targeted interventions. Free school meal eligibility should be expanded to include everybody whose parents are claiming universal credit, and funding for holiday hunger projects should be increased. headteacher, Millfield primary school, Walsall  YES. In fact, I would like to see universal free meals for all primary pupils. And I would like the policy to be properly funded, so no school has to spend money from its education budget on food. Not all families in poverty are eligible for free school meals. Some on low incomes rely on meals being provided at school so they do not necessarily need to give their children a hot meal in the evening. It helps to lift them out of poverty. I would worry about those families if the funding were taken away. At our school, we have seen positive changes in afternoon concentration levels since the policy came in. Children are not eating junk food at lunchtime any more. Free meals also encourage children to develop healthy eating habits and expose them to new foods. CEO of the charity School-Home Support  YES. We work with a large number of families whose children are not eligible for means-tested free school meals, because of their family income. But they’re still living in poverty because rents are extortionate. Parents are having to choose between buying food and paying the rent.  If the benefit is not universal, children will always slip through the net. For example, because of their immigration status, some children have no recourse to public funds.  We see how not having a free meal during school holidays impacts families. Often, parents go without food themselves. If this policy were to end, the holiday hunger issue would expand to school time too. The stress that comes with food poverty affects children’s mental health as well as parents’ mental health – this affects their behaviour, attendance and attainment at school and makes them worry about what they’re going to eat. Schools are suffering on the budgets they have got. But dropping a policy that has been successful and made a difference is not the solution.  There is one little boy we are working with who only gets a decent meal at lunchtime at school. His mother is working, but she cannot afford to give him anything except a sandwich in the evening. She has to prioritise food for her two older children, who do not qualify for free school meals. At home this little boy gets sandwiches, which he never cuts in half because that would create crumbs. He cannot bear to see those crumbs wasted on his plate. If that child loses free school meals, what will happen to him?",education
"A charity led by the archbishop of Canterbury is preparing to help feed children if schools are closed by coronavirus, amid fears the withdrawal of free school dinners could leave up to 3 million children at risk of hunger. Feeding Britain, which runs food poverty schemes in 12 areas of England including Cornwall, Leicester, Barnsley and South Shields, is exploring how to set up emergency programmes similar to those used to feed the poorest children during the summer holidays. The Akshaya Patra Foundation, which serves thousands of hot meals to children every summer in London boroughs, is also “prepared to enter crisis mode”, while food projects in Bristol and Huddersfield said they were exploring how their schemes to feed hundreds of children in school holidays could be adapted to help cope with emergency closures. “For so many families now, schools are the first line of defence against hunger,” said Andrew Forsey, the national director of Feeding Britain, whose president is the Most Rev Justin Welby. “In many cases it is breakfast as well as lunch, so if the schools close it’s two meals we have to find. There is early-stage planning going on around ensuring supplies of food and the extent of voluntary support that could be drawn upon if some schools do need to close.” Downing Street said on Tuesday that school closures would be among “distancing strategies” used if the virus became established in the UK. On Thursday, Italy closed all of its schools and colleges for a month.  FareShare, a charity that distributes food to more than 700 holiday food projects, has said it wants to recruit more volunteers to tackle the fallout from coronavirus. An immediate challenge is likely to be finding a way to deliver meals in a way that maintains the distance between people that school closures are meant to achieve. The Bristol project said it could involve delivering food parcels door-to-door. Forsey also said panic-buying that cleared supermarket shelves could hinder efforts as many free meal programmes relied on retailers’ donations. MPs have estimated 3 million children are at risk of being hungry in the school holidays – made up of more than a million children who qualify for free school meals, and about 2 million who are disqualified from free school meals because their parents work but remain in poverty. Donna Sealey, a charity worker at the Ambition Lawrence Weston food project in Bristol, which fed 175 children over the summer, said: “If it is a week off, many can scrape along, but a month would be a significant amount of time. By the second week, you haven’t got any money or food. We would kick in the programme to do something similar to the six-week school holiday.” Sealey said problems could be worsened because many families relied on money from zero-hours contract work, which meant if they had to look after their children their earnings would dry up. Teachers have said that closures are likely to most disadvantage the educations of pupils at state primaries because they lack the IT infrastructure of private schools and state secondaries. A survey has found that while a majority of state secondary school teachers said they could set work for their pupils remotely, fewer than one in 10 state primary school teachers said their school was able to broadcast lessons to pupils by video. Only about one in six said they had the technology to set and receive work from pupils, according to the survey by the Teacher Tapp app. Nearly 30% of teachers at primary and secondary independent schools said they already had the capacity to deliver lessons by video. “State schools can’t take for granted that every child has their own device at home and limitless data access,” said the former teacher Laura McInerney, a Guardian education columnist and co-founder of the app.",education
"My mother, Keda Cowling, who has died aged 94, started her career as a teacher at Sandal primary school in Baildon, West Yorkshire, in 1968. Her great passion – and soon her all-consuming obsession – became the teaching of reading. Keda would ask the parents of any struggling readers for permission to teach their children at her home – without charge – at the end of the school day. She tried anything and everything to see what helped and this process of trial and error was the genesis of her reading system that later came to be known as Toe by Toe. Keda had chosen the name when a grateful parent said: “I see how it works now. Progress by tiny steps – almost one toe at a time …” Toe by Toe was finally published in 1994 and Keda’s Little Red Book has now taught hundreds of thousands of people, young and old, to read. It has been used in prisons in the UK, Ireland and Australia, with literate prisoners teaching their counterparts in their prison cells. In recognition of her life’s work, Keda was named the Sue Ryder Yorkshire Woman of the Year for Education in 2011. Born in Saltaire, West Yorkshire, she was the daughter of Annie (nee Hollywood) and Henry Brannan, a mill worker. At the age of 14 Keda got a job at Salts Mill in Shipley and, like so many of her contemporaries, she was unable to accept her scholarship to the local grammar school for financial reasons. She married Albert Cowling, a bricklayer, and raised a family, and it was not until 1965 that she returned to education, at Bingley Training College, leaving in 1968 with her certificate of education. Throughout her long career, she was absent from school for only two days after breaking a leg in the icy playground. Three days later, leg in plaster, she was back in the classroom. So many children discovered a love of books and stories after listening, enthralled, as Keda read, and embellished, The Borrowers at the end of the school day. Twenty years after she retired in 1989, middle-aged people in Baildon would stop her in the street to thank her for their love of books. Keda and Albert, and Keda’s brother, Pat, were the founders of the Baildon Edwardian Society, which met at the Angel pub every week for an evening of dressing up, singing and entertainments; members of the society also visited local nursing homes. It lasted for 20 years until Albert’s death in 1997. Keda is survived by two sons and four grandchildren. Another son predeceased her.",education
"Schools in Wales and Scotland will close by the end of this week, as Boris Johnson hinted that a similar decision on closing schools in England was “imminent”. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said schools were to close by Friday at the latest, and would then be repurposed to provide childcare and supervision for children affected by the coronavirus outbreak, including the children of key workers. “From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak,” Williams said. “The key areas we are looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. We are looking in detail at how we can support and safeguard all those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs.” The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said “lives are being disrupted like never before” before announcing schools and nurseries would be closing at the end of the week. Sturgeon said her government would be focusing on three things as schools closed: supporting vulnerable students, particularly those who rely on free school meals, addressing the issues with exams, and arrangements that provided some kind of support and care for key workers’ children. The Scottish government will set out the details on Thursday. “In some areas, private daycares and nurseries can play a massive role in helping key workers keep going,” Sturgeon told a press briefing in Edinburgh. “In other areas, councils will use school buildings to reach vulnerable children. We will support any and every plan that helps people make this work.” The first minister said people should not assume that schools and nurseries would reopen after the Easter break or summer holiday. “We will of course only keep them closed for as long as we absolutely have to. But at this stage, I cannot promise that they will reopen before the summer holidays.” Sturgeon described closing schools and nurseries as one of the hardest decisions the government had had to make so far during the pandemic. Schools policy is devolved to individual national administrations, allowing them to make their own decisions over closures before those in Westminster. The moves in Scotland and Wales came as headteachers were increasingly being forced to turn away pupils, cancel events and secure essential supplies while preparing for closure. Hundreds of state schools in England have either closed or partially closed because of severe staff shortages sparked by the government’s new policies on long-term self-isolation, affecting pregnant women and those with conditions that make them vulnerable such as asthma. Independent schools, including some of the most famous names in English education, have also announced immediate closures. Winchester college announced that all pupils would return home from Wednesday afternoon because of staff shortages. “The requirement for more stringent self-isolation on both academic and support staff means that we are nearing the point where we will be unable to offer boys the necessary levels of care,” parents were told. Meanwhile, local authorities and schools were pre-empting the government by drawing up plans to keep skeleton staff in schools to look after the children of key workers such as those in the NHS or frontline services. Some schools are preparing to go further and offer supervision for children whose parents are still required to work, such as those in catering or delivery networks. Schools in local authorities including Hackney and Rotherham have been contacting parents to ask whether they are employed in key sectors. Answering questions in the Commons, Johnson told MPs that they “should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools”. He has previously promised to resolve issues including looking after the children of key workers and providing food for pupils currently eligible for free school meals. School leaders have expressed frustration with the lack of advice on staffing and staying open they have received so far from the Department for Education, with heads waiting on hold for more than an hour for their calls to the DfE’s coronavirus hotline to be answered. Meanwhile, British universities also moved to empty their their campuses of all but essential staff and researchers. Oxford University’s famous Bodleian library shut its doors on Wednesday, while Imperial College and University College London told students that services and facilities would be unavailable, and that they should prepare to move out of accommodation. The University of Cambridge said its libraries would close from Wednesday evening and other buildings would shut on Friday, with staff to work from home unless needed for “business-critical” activities.“We are asking students – both undergraduate and postgraduate – to return home now, if possible. It is especially urgent for international students needing to make travel arrangements to do so as quickly as possible, as many countries are already imposing travel restrictions,” Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, said.Toope said for students unable to leave Cambridge, “college accommodation will be available if needed”. Previously, universities had cancelled lectures and in-person teaching while otherwise remaining open, but are now taking more aggressive action.",education
"Cambridge University is facing calls to allow students due to graduate this summer to restart their final year in September due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. More than 1,000 students have signed a letter to Graham Virgo, the pro-vice chancellor for education, calling on the university to overhaul its summer exams amid widespread fears that the outbreak will adversely affect their exam performance. The demands came as the university’s vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, announced it was asking all students to leave, with all teaching moving online and no exams being held in Cambridge. The university plans to shut on Friday.He wrote: “We are all facing an unprecedented crisis. It may be months before we resume normal activity.” The students’ letter raises concerns that they face significant hurdles to revising and taking exams remotely during the Covid-19 outbreak, such as self-isolating or being quarantined due to potential exposure to the virus, and restrictive firewalls in some international students’ home countries. The students called on the university to offer alternative modes of assessment, such as vivas conducted via video or coursework or postponing exams and dissertation deadlines until after the pandemic passes or restrictions such as social distancing and quarantining have been relaxed. Some degree courses are normally entirely graded on final-year exams. They also want final-year students to be given the option to restart that year in September, or to retake the Easter term in 2021. They also propose students could receive a degree classification based on previous grades, dissertations and other coursework, or even be awarded an unclassified degree. The letter warns that unless students’ needs are accommodated the situation could be detrimental both to their academic performance and their wellbeing. It adds that marginalised and less privileged students, including those with disabilities and those who have gone back to repressive regimes, would likely be worst affected. The letter warns that students have raised concerns in recent days about issues posed by studying at home, such as lacking desks, books, computers and a stable, high-speed internet connection. A final year social sciences student, who signed the open letter, said he was concerned that even taking exams remotely might become untenable if growing numbers of staff and students became ill or had to care for loved ones during the pandemic. The student added: “We are asking for students to be given a choice of options because they faces different challenges. All my family are self-isolating, and I do not have a stable high-speed internet connection in London. Many overseas students will likely face further difficulties.” The finalist said he would prefer to receive a grade based on his previous assessments or a portfolio of essays submitted next term. If he postponed his graduation this would prevent him from either pursuing a masters degree or a job offer in the autumn, both of which were dependent on him achieving specific grades, he added. A director of studies at Cambridge, who is also a teaching officer in one of its faculties, said the students were “rightly concerned” about the summer exams, as the situation posed serious challenges for the university. The academic, who asked to remain anonymous, added: “There is for most students also four weeks of teaching still to be done. Cambridge also has more to decide about in that relatively little teaching has ever been done online and there is relatively little continuous assessment. The academic added that exams contributed to between 60% and 80% of a student’s grade – a higher proportion than at most other universities.  In an email to all staff and students today, the vice-chancellor announced that the university had moved into its most serious “red” phase in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with all students asked to return home. Toope added: “There will be no face-to-face teaching in the Easter term, and there will be no examinations in Cambridge. All teaching will move on-line. The university will communicate with all students by the end of March about alternative assessment arrangements.”",education
"One in five students would be financially better off if they skipped higher education, according to groundbreaking research that compares the lifetime earnings of graduates and non-graduates. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found while 80% of former students gained financially from attending university, about 20% earned less than those with similar school results who did not attend, highlighting how some subjects, such as creative arts, offer negative financial returns. The IFS research – which uses tax data to measure the earnings of those who went to university from the mid-90s onwards – found that after accounting for taxes and student loans, men gained on average £130,000 and women £100,000 over their careers, compared with their peers who didn’t enter higher education. As well as the total “graduate premium” being different between the sexes, it is also unevenly distributed over time, with women reaching a glass ceiling on earnings growth in their 30s and 40s, even among Oxbridge graduates. The premium also differed depending on the subject studied. The report comes as the government in England is applying additional scrutiny to universities and outcomes for graduates, with some ministers looking to restrict the numbers taking so-called “low-value” courses. Overall, the IFS found the government benefited from extra tax revenue and national insurance contributions of £110,000 per man and £30,000 per woman, over and above the costs of study to the government. “The exchequer gains a lot on average from higher education, despite the high costs of writing off unpaid student loans. That is mainly because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax,” said Ben Waltmann, an IFS economist and co-author of the report. “But this analysis also shows that the government makes an overall loss on financing the degrees of nearly half of all graduates. These losses are concentrated amongst those studying certain subjects. “For creative arts, for example, the losses are substantial. This need not mean that the government is misallocating funds but it is important to be aware of the costs involved.” Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said that while the benefits of higher education included “unquantifiable experiences and friendships,” she was still concerned about value for money. “It is no surprise our universities attract students from all over the world. However, that prestige is built on quality and my role is to work with the regulator to safeguard that, while ensuring students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment,” Donelan said. The Department for Education said the earnings data would define the benefits of higher education and “help students of all ages make smart choices about their future”. However, Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “It is vital to recognise that education is about much more than just financial benefit. Focussing on future income following university ignores the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society.” The data also revealed a chasm between men and women in earnings, with the top 10% of males who studied economics or medicine earning on average £500,000 more than their peers, while women studying the same subjects had average gains of just £250,000. But while men’s earnings rocketed up from the age of 30, women’s earnings growth was far lower, with childbearing and family formation the most likely factor. The IFS said women “see little difference in average returns” across different universities, while male graduates who attended Oxbridge and Russell Group universities earned more than their peers at other institutions. Jack Britton, another co-author of the report, said: “This work highlights how important the 30s are for graduate men. Rapid earnings growth of male graduates in this period has a large positive impact on their average return to higher education such that three quarters of men end up better off as a result of having done a degree.” The new research is based on annual incomes and fails to take account of hours worked, with non-graduates working longer hours for the same income, according to previous research.",education
"The provision of free school meals is a useful weapon in the fight against childhood obesity, according to a groundbreaking study, whose findings are likely to be studied closely by health officials and politicians amid mounting concerns about the problem. A quarter of UK children are overweight or obese when they start school aged four or five, and this rises to a third of children by the time they leave primary school at the age of 11. The new study, by Birgitta Rabe and Angus Holford at the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, tracked the impact of the policy, which provides a free midday meal for all four- to seven-year-olds in English primary schools. It concludes that free school meals make a valuable contribution to tackling Britain’s childhood obesity crisis. The pair looked at body mass index (BMI) data for children in 16,000 primary schools to examine the impact of the nutritionally balanced, universally free meals, with their maximum 530 calories, that were introduced by the coalition government in 2014. Rabe said: “This intervention has a significant impact by reducing reception children’s obesity rates by 7%. It’s a small impact but it’s fast and it’s more effective than other school-based initiatives on children of this age, like running the daily mile or healthy eating messaging.” They found “a steady decline of average BMI over the school year, totalling approximately 12% of a standard deviation, which suggests that the school environment has a beneficial influence on the energy balance of children”. Significantly, the children’s BMI reverted to higher levels after school holidays of just one or two weeks, which invites speculation that children consume more calories at home or expend less energy through play and exercise than when they are at school. The new healthy school meals, which was prompted by campaigns from Jamie Oliver, cost £437 a year for each child and have hugely reduced the use of home-packed lunches for Britain’s youngest schoolchildren. Research done in 2010 found that the average lunchbox contained at 624 calories, and two-thirds of lunchboxes had at least two items of high-calorie, nutritionally empty foods, such as sweetened drinks, crisps and chocolate bars. Holford added: “We found a beneficial effect of school meals nationally, but it is also apparent when we look only at schoolchildren in more affluent areas. This suggests that even for children of middle-class parents, the school meals were more nutritionally balanced than what they were bringing in their lunch boxes.” The study is part of a larger Nuffield Foundation project tracing the impact of the policy of providing balanced school meals for all young children, on bodyweight outcomes, rates of absence as a result of ill health and attainment in school tests, with the full results due to be published early this summer. Campaigners want the government to roll the policy out to all primary and secondary schoolchildren, in a bid to counter a predicted rise in childhood obesity levels. Many US cities, such as New York, Boston and Chicago, provide free school meals for all school-age children. Free school meals have been given to children in Sweden since 1973 and in Finland since 1948. But there is speculation that the policy, which costs £600m a year, may be scrapped in this week’s budget as the Department for Education is asked to find savings of 5%. In 2017, Theresa May’s government signalled that it wanted to end the policy, a move Oliver described as a disgrace. Stephanie Wood, founder of School Food Matters, which campaigns for healthy school meals, said the study’s findings were a wake-up call. “The policy of Universal Infant Free School Meals ensures that every day infants can enjoy a hot, nutritionally balanced free school meal, normalising healthy eating from their very first day at school. These early results are exciting, particularly when a study from University of Leeds recently showed that only 1.6% of primary school packed lunches meet the nutritional standards for school meals, and less than a fifth contain any vegetables or salad.”",education
"British universities face a black hole of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees from the impact of coronavirus as international students from China and other severely affected countries are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments. Sources told the Guardian that most universities are planning for new students from China to delay entry until January next year, with online teaching offered. Exams, including English language tests required for visas and university admissions, have been cancelled in China, where 80,000 people have caught coronavirus. In addition, university leaders report that Chinese and other international students are unhappy at the British government’s response to the outbreak, with some asking to suspend their studies, seek a refund and return home. Revelations about the funding deficit faced by universities came as: British universities increasingly rely on revenue from international tuition fees, with students from China providing the vast majority of growth. There are more than 120,000 students from China studying in the UK, as well as 17,000 from Hong Kong and Macau, and 8,000 from South Korea and Japan. A 10% fall in enrolments from those regions could cost higher education £200m or more in lost tuition fees alone. International student fees at British universities can range from £60,000 for MBAs at prestigious institutions such as Oxford’s Said Business School, to about £21,000 a year for a bachelor’s degree at University College London. Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International (UUK), the umbrella group representing British universities, said: “Coronavirus is likely to have a significant impact on this year’s recruitment and admissions cycle for international students, including but not only from China.” Stern said UUK was working with organisations such as the British Council, which administers English language tuition and testing in China and other affected countries such as Vietnam, and the government. “Measures universities are considering will include greater use of online delivery and delayed start dates. Meanwhile we are engaging with government on a wide range of issues affecting the student recruitment, admissions and visa application cycle,” she said. More than 90,000 new students from China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other affected countries had been expected to arrive on British campuses in September, but universities are braced for substantial numbers of current applicants being unable to travel or to pull out completely. In that scenario, the UK economy would also stand to lose hundreds of millions pounds in lost revenue from spending by international students on accommodation, travel, entertainment and living expenses. Helen Higson, provost and deputy vice-chancellor of Aston University, said the experience of Australia, where the academic year coincided with the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, suggested the impact would have “big implications” for the cash flow of some British universities. “In order to address this, institutions are already trying to find ways round this, including more online delivery – if we can get over the issues of the Chinese firewalls – [and] moving start dates from September to January,” Higson said. She added that universities were looking at lengthening their pre-sessional English programmes and putting in extra language support to help compensate for the difficulties students faced in taking the English language qualifications, called IELTS. Since the outbreak began, the British Council has closed down IELTS testing in China and several other countries. Other test providers have also shut, while governments have closed schools and colleges. “The health of our students, customers and colleagues is our priority throughout this rapidly evolving situation. We are responding in line with local government and health authority guidance, continuing to run exams as planned where it is possible to do so. In line with health authority guidance, all exams in China are cancelled until the end of March,” the British Council said. The University of Oxford has advised applicants that it is monitoring the situation. British universities already face uncertainty over links with the EU after Brexit, including continued membership of the mammoth Horizon Europe science funding programme and the Erasmus+ student exchange programme. Higson said the differing approaches to dealing with coronavirus had to be addressed by universities to make international students more comfortable. “As the official advice from China is to use face masks, the official British advice to focus on hygiene and frequent washing of hands is interpreted by some of our Chinese students as not being strong enough and creates concern with our Chinese students about the official UK response to Covid-19. In turn, this is resulting in some of our Chinese students now believing that it might be safer to return to China rather than staying in the UK,” she said. Students from China, Hong Kong and South Korea are particularly concentrated in a range of taught postgraduate courses, meaning some universities may be forced to cancel masters’ courses because of lack of student numbers.",education
"Quitting the EU’s Erasmus student exchange programme would “blow a hole” in the UK’s economy, taking away income of £243m a year and depriving 17,000 British young people of valuable work experience, according to a group of education and business leaders. The group, including further education colleges and universities, is calling for the British government to make clear that continued Erasmus membership is a high priority in its talks with the EU. Britain’s membership of the EU-wide exchange scheme known as Erasmus+ is to expire at the end of this year, alongside membership of the EU. The government’s negotiating outline offered scant hope of continued full membership, saying only that it “will consider options for participation in elements of Erasmus+ on a time-limited basis, provided the terms are in the UK’s interests”. Universities UK International (UUKI), the umbrella group representing higher education providers, said membership of Erasmus gave a bonus to the British economy worth £243m a year, after subtracting membership costs from the £420m generated by EU students visiting the UK under the programme. It also said the 17,000 British students and young people who use Erasmus for work placements and study would also lose out, particularly students from disadvantaged backgrounds who would struggle to fund their travel and expenses without it. Joe Fitzsimons, the head of education and skills policy at the Institute of Directors, said: “Many employers deeply value the kind of international experience the Erasmus scheme helps foster. Given the benefits it can bring students and businesses, maintaining access to Erasmus and wider EU research and education partnerships has been a priority for the IoD from the off.” Emma Meredith, international director at the Association of Colleges (AoC), representing further education, said its data showed 85% of colleges were using Erasmus+ to find work placements that were not available with local employers, particularly for students in vocational subjects such as construction and social care. “For college students in some of the most deprived parts of the country, Erasmus+ helps to level up opportunity, experience and aspiration as well as ensuring that we are viewed as an open, tolerant and welcoming country to the rest of the world,” she said. An AoC survey found more than 90% of colleges would be unable to fund work placements for further education students if Erasmus is not extended or replaced. The director of UUKI, Vivienne Stern, said: “We know that disadvantaged and disabled students have the most to gain from an international experience. They will be the students who will lose the most if Erasmus+ falls by the wayside. “Yet I am worried that government isn’t committed to keeping the UK in Erasmus. Now is the time to commit to this unique programme that boosts not only students’ prospects, but those of businesses and the economy.” The Department for Education has previously said the government “is committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so”. The UK’s post-Brexit membership of Erasmus is likely to hinge on the EU’s stance on the cost of continuing membership, and whether the EU ties it to another top priority: continued access for UK universities to the EU’s Horizon 2020 research programme, which is worth billions of euros. Losing access to either the Horizon or Erasmus programmes would be a further blow for universities struggling with student recruitment difficulties, including potentially huge losses in international tuition fees caused by the coronavirus disruption. A new report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) also suggests that the UK government will struggle to meet its targets for national research spending if universities suffer cuts to domestic or international fee income. “If the UK university sector is to continue thriving, then it is crucial that the chancellor recognises the interdependencies between teaching and research in the budget and subsequent spending review,” said Nick Hillman, the HEPI’s director and the author of the report. “Universities roughly break even on teaching home students but make a big loss on research. They fill in part of that gap from the surplus on teaching international students. But they now face a looming large loss on teaching home students, for example because of tweaks to tuition fees in England. If that happens, they will have to use international student fees to subsidise home students and there will be less money for covering gaps in research funding.”",education
"Campaigners have raised fears that children with special needs, such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, could lose out from new government rules that will prevent councils from subsidising education spending from other parts of their budgets. The failure of government funding to match growing demand has led many councils to overspend on their education budgets and raid their reserves, with the situation particularly acute in special-needs education. From next month councils will no longer be able to reduce education budget deficits by taking money from other areas of spending. Instead they will have to clear their education overspending with money from within their education budgets, unless they get special permission from the government. Critics fear this will squeeze funding for early years and special-needs education – two areas already financially stricken. Growing numbers of parents have to take legal action to get councils to provide special-needs support for their children, while nursery closures have risen sharply in recent years. Gillian Doherty, of the special-needs campaign group Send Action, told the Observer: “Last year the government argued at the high court that local authorities must ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’, using reserves and general council budgets to plug inadequate high-needs budgets. “The Department for Education’s new funding proposals will close off this flexibility. They have decided to forge ahead with these plans despite serious concerns raised through their own consultation about the impact on children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities. “Local authorities that are already failing to meet their legal duties are now being pressured to make further Send cuts in order to reduce deficits and stay within budget. A number of local authorities have identified cuts to Send provision, with the main targets being Send transport and funding levels for Education, Health and Care Plans, a move that will further undermine inclusion.” The government argues the changes are needed because, if councils can use general funds to cover education overspends, auditors will require them to increase their reserves in response – which would force them to cut spending in other areas such as social care. Councils backed the plans during consultation. Jonathan Broadbery of the National Day Nurseries Association said that some councils were already taking money from early years to cover gaps in special-needs funding. “While additional school funding should make overspends in school budgets less likely, these reforms make it harder for councils to cover these from other sources of funding. If school budget overspends have to be carried over to future years we could see more early years funding diverted to plug these gaps. “We want to see proper investment in early years and that budget ring-fenced to ensure that all the funding that is allocated for our youngest children goes to ensuring they have the highest-quality early education and care. Otherwise overstretched councils will just be moving money around in their schools budget.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are increasing high-needs funding for local authorities by £780m next year. We have made clear councils are not required to cover the deficits from general funds. The department will work with councils with the largest deficits to agree plans to reduce deficits while ensuring that young people with special educational needs and disabilities continue to receive the support they need.”",education
"School closures and cancelled exams are a big deal for all pupils, but they’re likely to be especially distressing for students preparing for GCSEs and A-levels in England or National 5s and Highers in Scotland. They will already have begun revision, and many will be anxious about putting their lives on hold. That’s why looking after teenagers’ mental health during the coronavirus pandemic is the first priority for parents. The uncertainty over how exams will be replaced will put a strain on many students. Polly Davies, who has home-schooled five children on and off over 12 years, took her daughter out of school before the enforced closures. “She was so anxious and upset,” she said. “She needs to not think about it, which I know is really hard, but she’s been doing other things to take her mind off it and not just obsess.” Davies has encouraged her daughter to take a walk, read a book or chat to friends. Studying can resume later. Parents should start by getting a copy of the curriculum from their school and finding out what resources are available. Since teenagers are studying more advanced material, parents should be realistic about what they can achieve during this period – especially if they are working themselves. The core message from education experts is that structure is essential. This does not have to exactly replicate the school day, but there should be clear boundaries between learning and relaxing. Amit Gadhia, the director of Lotus Tutors, recommended sticking to the 45-minute lessons used in schools: “The attention span of even the most genius pupil is not more than that.” He said students should not be in one-on-one lessons for more than four hours a day, since these require higher concentration levels than in a classroom of 30 pupils. The rest of the time can be used for sports or creative activities. Some schools and colleges will be in a position to offer more support than others. Tom Coles, an English teacher at Portree high school in Skye, said he planned to deliver an adapted but more or less full remote-learning curriculum through Google for Education. For schools and colleges offering remote learning, his main message was for parents to support their children in the same way they would normally: “Get them to complete their work, and stay motivated and connected,” he said. If in doubt, parents can fill in any gaps with simple but stimulating activities. All students should be reading a book for an hour a day, for example. A good way to motivate young people is to focus on why they are doing a given task. “Try and explain the purpose and value of what they’re learning. This will be different for every family, but is so much better than the answers ‘Because I said so!’,” said Jack Pannett, who runs a children’s coaching service. As the days of social distancing turn into weeks, teens may struggle with the lack of social interaction. Parents can encourage their children to speak to friends by phone rather than messaging, or to organise sports in the park, which is currently acceptable under government guidelines if they maintain distance. The lure of social media and video games may also be hard for teenagers to resist, so setting limits may be helpful. “Do as you do on weekends and school holidays. We shouldn’t be telling parents how to discipline their children but I would honestly say less screen time,” Samatar said.",education
"Cambridge lecturers have criticised the university’s colleges for provoking “wide-scale panic” among international students and staff by urging them to return to their home countries due to the coronavirus pandemic. The condemnation from the local branch of the University and College Union (UCU) came after international students complained they had been bombarded with “aggressive” emails asking them to leave their colleges at short notice. The president of Cambridge UCU, Jennifer Marchant, warned that the advice put overseas students from countries with weaker healthcare systems at risk and would exacerbate the global spread of Covid-19. In a letter to the central university and college masters, Marchant wrote: “We are extremely concerned that the invitation to leave the country at such short notice, when most countries are closing their borders, will dramatically affect the most economically and socially vulnerable members of the college community who cannot afford to leave the UK at the last minute, who do not have healthcare coverage in their country of origin, who simply have nowhere else to go, and do not have clear instructions on how leaving will impact their visa status. “Furthermore, we are concerned that some students and staff come from countries … with a much weaker healthcare system than the UK, and travelling right now would only contribute to further spreading of the pandemic.” The UCU also criticised the confusing and contradictory advice issued by the colleges and the central university, and called on them to offer financial help to international students who were returning to their home countries and put in place safety measures for those unable to leave. On Friday the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, sent an email to all students advising against international travel. But an email from the senior tutor and principal of Newnham college sent on 15 March advised students to “make plans to leave your college accommodation by 19 March at the very latest and earlier if possible” unless it is “truly your home”. A director of studies at Cambridge, who wished to remain anonymous, said the messages to students from different colleges he had seen shared the “same cold-blooded and brutal core message, basically we really don’t want you here”. He added that international students and those from Northern Ireland had been put in a position of having to find flights “at very short notice and so at high cost”. “Colleges are very protective of their students in the good times but it now appears that in times of crisis they look after themselves.” Marina Veličković, a PhD student at Pembroke college, said she had to scramble to get home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as many flights were being cancelled. She said her college’s handling of the situation had been irresponsible and panic-inducing. In a Twitter thread, Veličković complained that the college had told international students not to leave two weeks ago, when travel could have posed less risk of spreading the virus, then abruptly changed its position. She wrote: “[T]elling us not to leave, telling us to revise our plans … and then telling us, our bad, actually leave, is irresponsible. It is also costly, it is stressful and it breaks any trust that might have existed. “[I] now feel like [my college] see me as a drain on their resources, an inconvenience to be returned to place of origin when going gets tough.” An international student at St John’s college, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “The colleges are being inconsistent and alarmist. What disturbs me most is the callous approach and the panic they have created. “In some cases they’ve asked students to pack up everything and move out completely in two or three days. The fact that they have sent so many emails essentially means they’re forcing people out. In a message to students on Tuesday, the vice chancellor said that if the university moved from its current amber alert on the coronavirus to the more serious red alert that students still in Cambridge will be asked to return home, or “on an exceptional basis, will be accommodated and supported by colleges if they cannot”.He added: “Already foreign governments are closing their borders to all but their own nationals, and students are strongly advised to make their plans accordingly.”",education
"The private tuition industry is booming amid the coronavirus pandemic, with school closures and fears of infection driving unprecedented demand for online teaching. UK tutoring firms said there had been a surge in online tuition in the past three weeks as parents anticipated and then responded to the decision to close schools indefinitely. Meanwhile, several agencies said some wealthy families had requested tutors go into isolation with them on remote country estates or super-yachts. Leo Evans, a co-founder of The Profs, a tuition firm that works with around 2,000 schoolchildren and 3,000 university students internationally each year, said: “There has been a hike in online tutoring related to existential concerns around the coronavirus and schools being shut.” Evans said the number of daily users of its online classroom platform BitPaper had risen more than sixfold in two weeks, from 5,000 to 32,000 . “There were 11,000 hours of online classes on Monday, almost a fifteenfold rise from 750 hours on 2 March,” he said. “It’s absolutely exploded since the coronavirus.”  Hannah Titley, the founder of the Golden Circle, which has about 80 homeschooled and several hundred after-school students, said all lessons were now being taught online, compared with 10% a few weeks ago. “There’s been a huge shift,” she said. “Most homeschooled students in London have transitioned to online learning this week, and those families who can are staying in the countryside. This week 16 new homeschoolers have joined. We have another 11 starting after the Easter break.” Titley said a drop-off in demand for GCSE revision as a result of the cancellation of exams had been more than offset by demand for other tutoring. For example, private schools were continuing to assess key-stage three pupils, aged 11-14, and after Easter some schools will start A-level courses for those pupils who were due to do GCSEs this summer.  One of the Golden Circle’s clients, Claudine Ries, who lives in central London, has switched to online tutoring for her 16-year-old son who is studying for US exams. She said: “We are trying to socially isolate by seeing fewer friends and staying away from large crowds. We switched to online tutoring mainly because we felt it would unnecessarily expose the tutors who need to travel to our house while they could be isolating themselves at home.” Will Chambers, the founder of Bramble, an online tutoring platform, said the number of daily users rose by 1,125% in two weeks, to 2,500 on Thursday. Many of the new users were elderly tutors concerned that homeschooling could put them at risk of infection, he said. Adam Caller, the founder of Tutors International, which caters to rich families, said he had received several requests from clients in the past few weeks for tutors to go into isolation with them at short notice. “We’ve seen a sudden rush, especially from Switzerland,” said Caller. “They’re looking for tutors who are willing to come and be locked in. One family has relocated from an area affected by the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy to St Moritz in the Swiss Alps. “Another family, from Dubai, want to go and hide on their super-yacht in the Mediterranean. It’s paying £24,000 a month to the tutor.” Mark MacLaine, the founder of Tutorfair, said one tutor had gone into isolation with a family in upstate New York, and another family who had flown to the Caribbean to escape the outbreak were now receiving online tuition. MacLaine said the additional demand was a boost to Britain’s private tuition sector, worth an estimated £2bn. He said this year could be his highest earning yet because so many families were looking for private tuition due to the uncertainty over the next academic year. “A few of my A-level students have decided to resit their exams next year but most want to keep working,” he said. “A couple of parents said they’ll have their kids resit their GCSEs in their A-level year if they have to.” ",education
"My father, Gerald Grainge, who has died aged 84, was a teacher and education manager who rose to be chief education officer for the London borough of Bromley in 1985. He had a deep belief in the importance of delivering the aims of Butler’s 1944 Education Act, providing the opportunity for education for all, as well as the importance of ensuring that each person achieves their maximum potential. These aims drove his career. He was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, where his parents, Margery (nee Sinkins) and George Grainge, ran a greengrocers’ shop. Gerald won a scholarship from the local grammar school to Christ’s College, Cambridge. At Christ’s he studied modern languages, focusing on French and Russian. At Cambridge he met Christine Wright and they married in 1959. Upon graduation he joined the RAF and spent much of his three years’ service in Germany, where he used his language skills to good effect listening in to the Russians and East Germans at the height of the cold war. After leaving the RAF in 1959 he taught modern languages, including a stint at Rugby school, before moving into education management, starting with a role as assistant education officer in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, with subsequent senior roles in Croydon, Sutton and ultimately his appointment as director of education for the London borough of Bromley. After retirement in 1993 there was no let-up in his activity, whether it was his passion for sailing his ketch or his rekindled academic interests. The two were often intertwined in his academic subject matter. He undertook a research degree in maritime archaeology at Southampton University. He published two books, The Roman Channel Crossing of AD 43 (2001) and The Roman Invasions of Britain (2005). From 2003 he edited the monograph series of the Nautical Archaeology Society. He featured in two historical television documentaries, Bloodbath at Hastings (2003) and Britain’s Lost Roman Wonder (2003), the latter being about Richborough Roman fort in Kent. Following completion of his doctorate, he edited a book about Sri Lankan traditional outrigger Oruwa sailing canoes which provided an opportunity to visit Sri Lanka. He went out with my mother on one such canoe which capsized and was dismasted after being hit by a squall in the Indian Ocean; fortunately they were not too far from land. His work continued and in the last days before his death he was working on editing and cataloguing documents from Lord Northbourne’s estate in Kent. Last summer he and Christine enjoyed two family weddings as well as their own diamond wedding celebration. He is survived by Christine and their three children, Mark, Penny and me, and nine grandchildren.",education

"Oxford and Cambridge universities are to replace this summer’s exams with online assessments due to the coronavirus pandemic, amid calls by thousands of UK students to be allowed to opt out of doing their finals or restart their final year. The move comes after students from Oxford, Edinburgh and University College London (UCL) joined their peers at Cambridge in calling for a choice of final-year assessments, warning that the worsening Covid-19 outbreak threatens their academic performance. Cambridge University announced on Friday it would replace this summer’s exams with online assessment. Students unable to do this due to “illness, caring responsibilities or technical difficulties” will be allowed to undertake assessment at a later, as yet undetermined date, when the university is fully operational again. It added that this “will inevitably impact on when they can graduate”. But students will not be allowed to defer their assessments until the next academic year. In an email to students on Friday, Prof Martin Williams, pro-vice chancellor for education at Oxford, announced there would be “no conventional exams” next term. He said the the university expected the replacement assessment to include “open-book exams, taken remotely and submitted online”, and invited students to state their preferences in an online consultation. Williams told the Guardian that the pandemic had forced students “into an academic limbo”. His announcement came in response to an open letter from more than 1,200 Oxford students, including almost 30% of this year’s finalists, that called on the university to allow those due to graduate this summer to restart the final year in September or at Easter 2021. The students proposed that final-year students could receive a degree classification based on previous grades, dissertations and other coursework, or even be awarded an unclassified degree. Some Oxford degree courses are normally entirely graded on final-year exams. Seven students at the university have so far tested positive for Covid-19. Politics, Philosophy and Economics student Luci Dennewill, co-author of the letter, said the university needed to give students different options to complete their degrees because they faced different challenges due to the pandemic. For example, overseas students who were forced to return to authoritarian regimes faced difficulties taking exams online due to restrictive firewalls, she added.  “For me personally, the best option would be doing online exams at home. I can’t delay graduating because I am due to start an job in business intelligence in September,” she said. Around 1,200 students at Edinburgh University have signed an open letter calling for final exams and coursework to be made optional, with finalists given the choice to have their degree grade determined on the basis of their assessments to date. The letter, written by Ruby Wlaschin, a final-year international relations student, called on the university’s principal, Peter Mathieson, to consider refunding each student the equivalent of at least four weeks tuition fees, £3,036.37 for international students, due to the disruption caused by the outbreak and strike action by lecturers. In an email to Wlaschin, published in the Tab, Mathieson acknowledged that her year group “has been particularly unfortunate” due to the industrial action and “the unprecedented emergency of Covid-19”. More than 1,000 students from UCL have signed a letter questioning its plans to push ahead with summer exams. The letter states: “Asking us to carry on working as normal seems like madness. The situation is most definitely going to disadvantage us. The current stance UCL has seems to neglect both fairness, and their students’ mental and physical health.” Durham University announced this week that all summer exams will be replaced with online assessments.  A spokeswoman for Edinburgh University said: “First and second year students will be assessed on the basis of work already submitted as an alternative to exams. Those in third year and beyond will take their exams online. Students should be assured that they will achieve their qualifications on time and will still hold the same value.” A spokeswoman for UCL said it had decided to move all teaching online and to create alternative assessments due to “the significant risks to our students of postponing exams to some undefined point in the future”. She added: “This is extremely complex and will take a few weeks. In the meantime, we have advised students to continue to prepare as per their exam schedule.”",education
"Some schools in the UK are investigating the use of unregulated examinations to get around the government’s decision to cancel A-level and GCSEs exams this summer over coronavirus fears, the Guardian has learned. A group of schools have been discussing the possible use of qualifications such as international GCSEs known as iGCSEs, or alternatives to A-levels known as Pre-U or international A-levels, which are offered by examination boards and almost exclusively used by independent schools. The move comes as the Department for Education said pupils would be awarded assessed grades for conventional GCSE and A-level courses by the end of July, using an algorithm to be developed by Ofqual, the exam regulator, with each pupils’ grades then ratified by their teachers and exam boards. The DfE said pupils unhappy with their assessed grades would have the option of appealing, and the opportunity to sit exams in the affected subjects after the start of the next academic year or in summer 2021. “I have asked exam boards to work closely with the teachers who know their pupils best to ensure their hard work and dedication is rewarded and fairly recognised,” Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said. But while A-levels and GCSEs have been cancelled, schools and students say they have not been told that iGCSEs or similar unregulated qualifications have also been called off, leaving them in limbo. Both OxfordAQA – a joint venture between AQA and the Oxford University Press – and Cambridge Assessment have said they intend to continue with the international versions of the exams this summer where schools remain open, because of demand from overseas. A spokesperson for OxfordAQA said: “Our qualifications are specifically designed for international students and are only available outside the UK. In countries where schools are open and it is safe for students to sit exams as normal this summer, they’ll be able to take our international GCSEs and A-levels.” Cambridge Assessment plans to go ahead with its exams and is currently advising users: “For schools in England that take Cambridge International exams, we are working with the UK government to understand more about their intentions. We will provide more information to schools as soon as possible.” Cambridge International later announced that it would not allow UK schools to offer its international qualifications this summer [see note at end of story]. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “We are making clear to all awarding organisations that no exams should go ahead in schools and colleges in England this year.” The international versions of GCSEs and A-levels have been controversial in recent years, with claims that private schools use them to bolster their results since the qualifications are not subject to Ofqual regulation and their grades are not limited by prior attainment like their domestic counterparts. The move comes as most state schools in the UK were frantically adapting to the government’s order to close to all but vulnerable children, those with special needs and those with parents who work in key sectors, while at the same time holding emotionally charged meetings with staff, parents and pupils for what is almost certainly the end of the school year. Headteachers said they were working as fast as possible to provide remote learning for most of their pupils staying at home, while also trying to figure out the number of children to be looked after at school next week, and if it was safe to host them, and administering efforts to get food to those eligible for free school meals. The government delayed defining key worker status until Friday morning, leaving headteachers with little time to get parents to supply details and arrange staff rotas, catering and – in some cases - transport before the end of the day. “This week has been an epic one, with schools told they have to be closed but open,” said Kat Pugh, headteacher of St Marylebone CE School in central London, who described how her school called each family of pupils with special needs or vulnerabilities to establish if they wanted their child to attend. Pugh said the school then emailed all parents with a questionnaire about key worker status, but on Friday afternoon said she still wasn’t sure how many pupils or staff would be in on Monday morning. “We’re expecting 40 to 50 students, but it may be 20 or it maybe 60,” said Pugh, who said she needed to balance the needs of the families with the dangers caused by students mingling and using public transport. Other school leaders were preparing to juggle staff and sites to provide the supervised care that the government has demanded. Martyn Oliver, chief executive of Outwood Grange academies trust in the north of England, said: “All our 33 schools are due to be open from Monday for those students coming in – children with an educational, health and care plan, children in need, those on the child protection register and looked-after children, while all of our schools have a vulnerable register. Then we will have children of those parents working in critical sectors. “We also have two children who attend private school and whose parents are doctors, so they have asked if they can come to school from Monday, which of course they can.” The pressure has been particularly acute for the leaders of pupil referral units (PRUs) and alternative provision, which educate a high number of vulnerable and special needs pupils outside of mainstream education, while special schools are also likely to have a high proportion of children eligible for care. Philip Potter, the headteacher of Oak Grove College special school said: “Teamwork from staff, families and the local authority is amazing, it is how we juggle numbers in a special school while operating with skeleton trained staff.” The headteacher of one primary school in Dorset said: “Staff are responding well, spirits are high and we are getting on. It is all very Dunkirk spirit!” Paul Tarn, the leader of the Delta academies trust that runs more than 40 schools across Yorkshire, said his organisation was grouping its schools into clusters to keep fewer open and support social distancing. “We are more likely to sustain our support through the length of the epidemic this way than if we try to run standalone schools,” Tarn said. Update: Cambridge International has announced that schools in the UK will not be able to offer its international qualifications this summer. “Our first priority is always the safety of students. The UK government has decided there won’t be any GCSE or A-level exams held in the UK in May and June this year. Cambridge IGCSE, Pre-U, and international AS and A-level exams will not run in the UK in the May-June series. “In countries where schools are open and it is safe to take exams, Cambridge IGCSE and Cambridge International AS and A-level exams will go ahead.”  This article was amended on 21 March 2020. International GCSEs and A-levels are offered by OxfordAQA, a joint venture between AQA and Oxford University Press, and not by AQA as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",education
"Long before most of the US population, it seems the coronavirus was in my proverbial backyard. An urgent knock came on my office door in mid-February. I opened the door to find one of my students with tears pouring down her face. Just moments before, she had been told that her parents, who lived in China, had succumbed to Covid-19. She would not be able to return for their funerals. She’s an only child. As I would soon learn, this was only the beginning of how this virus has impacted my students, most of whom are from east Asia. They now feel stuck in an environment where they often feel unwanted, with nowhere to go anytime soon. When our own president injects such blatant racism into the Covid-19 conversation by calling it the “Chinese virus” – it’s no surprise that my students are having to deal with xenophobia. I instruct and develop classes for international students at the Claremont Colleges in Los Angeles. Over eight weeks, we help them improve their American English skills and teach them how to manage pressure and survive graduate school in the US Most of the students are only here for this program while their families stay behind in China. Many of them are isolated here – they’re in the US alone and they won’t be able to return to their home countries anytime soon, they are worried about loved ones back home, and on top of all of that, they are experiencing renewed racism. It started before the school closed, with my students sharing stories in class about how some people on campus were giving them dirty looks, whispering, sitting as far away as possible from them. I wanted to believe these incidents were the result of college student immaturity, despite the reports that had come out about similar racist behavior. Clearly, I was in denial. Then suddenly, it was in my face. After our final face-to-face class before, 20 or so of my students and I decided to have one last hurrah at a local pizza parlor since we wouldn’t be seeing each other again for a while. At the time, restaurants were still open and we were still allowed to gather in groups of 100 or less. I had taken students to this restaurant many times before without incident for end-of-the-term celebrations – parties for completing milestones in our program, and simply for them to get a sense of US dining culture. This time was different. The host asked us to wait, though only a couple tables were occupied. Then the manager – who is also the owner – came out, gave our group the once-over, and said that I (a Caucasian woman) could stay, but the others had to leave. I could not understand why, and asked over and over what the problem was; I thought maybe the restaurant’s safety or sanitation had been compromised in some way. My students understood the true reason why before I did. It was one of those moments where my white privilege was obvious to everyone but me. I began to argue with the manager, so angry I could hardly get the words out, until one of my students gently pulled me back and said it wasn’t worth it. Rather than making a scene, my students suggested we try another restaurant. Again, we were denied service even though there were only a few people in the place. This happened four times before we finally found a Chinese restaurant that would seat us. This place was actually quite full, with other east Asian diners. I couldn’t help but wonder if the same injustice had happened to them at other restaurants in town, but regardless, I was glad these diners had a safe place to go. The owner, who’s from Shanghai, stopped by the table to thank us for coming in. We thanked him in return and told him what had happened at the other restaurants. He shared that business started tanking back in January when people learned where Covid-19 originated. He was even being denied service at local grocery stores, gas stations, car washes, cafes and farmers’ markets because workers either assumed he was a carrier or blamed him for the pandemic because of what he looks like. To this day, I’m still hearing stories from my students – we have been Skyping regularly – about how people walk in the other direction when they see them. Sometimes strangers get aggressive and say things to them like: “This is your people’s fault.” They’re afraid to walk into places like Walmart or Target because of this. I fear for their safety beyond the coronavirus itself. One student, whose husband and kids are here in the US with her, just told me a story about going to a PTA meeting at her son’s elementary school. She and her husband sat in the back corner of the room so as not to upset or alarm other parents – it has happened so often, they have come to expect it. She told me other parents approached the person running the meeting and asked for “that Chinese couple in the back” to be asked to leave. Thankfully the request was not granted, but my student was still deeply upset by it, understandably. We are all having to go into isolation because of Covid-19, through no fault of our own. But many of us have family, friends, co-workers and other members of our community to lean on as we approach the unknown. Now, simple human interactions like visiting the grocery store or even driving down the street and seeing another human face are a treat. My international students are even more isolated and vulnerable than the rest of us. They are in a country that’s becoming increasingly hostile toward them. Everyone in every part of the world is fearful of this infection and how far it will spread, of how many people it will affect. The one thing we have control over right now is how we behave and how we treat other people. Basic compassion, empathy and kindness for our fellow human beings – right now, this is what we can and should be spreading.",education
"My grandfather Keith Ebbutt, who has died aged 100, dedicated most of his life to education, leftwing politics and the peace movement. Born in Surrey to an American debutante, Louise Ingram Crockett, and a British naval intelligence officer, Norman Ebbutt, Keith grew up in Germany. His father was the Berlin correspondent of the Times from 1925 until his expulsion by the Nazis in 1937. Keith was sent to London to be educated – at Belmont prep, then Mill Hill school – in the 1930s, but arrived speaking English with a strong German accent. Being different invited relentless bullying, and this experience led him to empathise with the downtrodden. As he later wrote: “The way I was treated gave me some insight into the experiences of others and provided the emotional drive that kept me involved.” He was appalled by what he saw as the arrogance of his schoolmates, whose privilege contrasted sharply with what he described as “the unfairness of most people’s lives”. He began reading about socialism and the arms industry in the school library. In Berlin he often witnessed the Nazis in action, which gave him his lifelong aversion to fascism. Keith joined the Communist party of Great Britain in 1939 and was a delegate to the final party congress in 1991. He was also active in numerous other leftwing organisations, including CND. He knocked on doors, organised meetings, edited publications and held various elected positions. For more than 70 years he devoted his free time to improving the lives of others. Even in his early 90s he ran a discussion group, credit union and other projects. His political views attracted the attention of MI5, which he claimed derailed his career as an industrial chemist. He went on to work in the field of education, where he stayed until his retirement as vice-principal of Hounslow College (now West Thames College). He loved teaching. In 1942 Keith married Valerie Clinkskill. After their divorce, he had two other long relationships, first with Connie and then with Gill. Generous, curious and fun, he gained great joy from his grandchildren. His organisational efficiency, resilience and moral courage were widely admired. He was a believer in restraint, sound judgment and good sense. He is survived by Gill, his daughters, Susie and Sheila, from his marriage, and a daughter, Jude, from his relationship with Connie, four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.",education
"‘I want to see social mobility rising once again,” said prime minister Tony Blair in 2004. “We can unleash the biggest wave of social mobility since the second world war,” said prime minister Gordon Brown in 2010. “I want to see a more socially mobile Britain,” said David Cameron in 2013. “I want Britain to be the world’s great meritocracy,” said Theresa May in 2016. The politicians’ message has been consistent. But so too has been the message from Britain’s leading sociologist, John Goldthorpe, emeritus professor at Oxford University. The politicians have it all wrong. Social mobility did not, as they assume, rise after the second world war. Nor, as they also assume, did it decline from the 1970s. And crucially, education, which they believe to be the engine of social mobility, has played no such role and, without reforms far more radical than any yet contemplated, can never do so. Britain is as far away from meritocracy as ever. It’s not schools and universities, but differences in home environments, and particularly the time parents can give their children, that are the obstacles to equality of opportunity, Goldsmith argues. “People find that very hard to accept,” he tells me at Nuffield College, Oxford’s main centre for social science since 1937. “Family is a good thing. Equality of opportunity is a good thing.” But we can’t eradicate all the ways in which families give their children advantages. “Would we want to stop parents from reading bedtime stories or engaging in supper table debates? Of course not.” Goldthorpe has studied class and social mobility for more than half a century, using studies that followed thousands of Britons from birth through their school and working lives. He invented the seven social classes – from higher managers and professionals at the top to “routine occupations” at the bottom – now used in official statistics. A grammar school boy who read history at University College London and did a PhD in sociology on a miners’ welfare scholarship, he was born and bred in an isolated Yorkshire mining village where his father was a colliery clerk and his mother a dressmaker. Both had left school at 14. Goldthorpe’s life is a model of the upward social mobility that thousands from backgrounds like his experienced from the 1940s. So why does he insist that conventional wisdom about social mobility and education’s role in it is wrong? In a recent book, Social Mobility and Education in Britain, written jointly with Erzsébet Bukodi, a Nuffield colleague, he distinguishes between absolute and relative mobility. Absolute mobility is your chance of ending up in a different social class from the one you were born into. That is around 80% and has been remarkably consistent for at least a century; if anything, Britain has slightly more mobility than other European countries. But the movement is often small: from class 2 to 1, say, or from class 5 to 6. Relative mobility is different. That is your chance, if you started in, say, class 6 or 7, of making it to, say, class 1 or 2 compared with those who started at the top. Here, if you start at the bottom, you are many times less likely to make it to the top than somebody born there. That remains as true as ever, say Bukodi and Goldthorpe. Neither grammar schools nor comprehensives made any difference either way. What has changed, however, is the availability of top jobs. In the 1950s and 1960s – Goldthorpe calls it “the golden age” – professional and managerial jobs more than doubled as a proportion of the UK labour market. That spurred a dramatic growth in upward mobility, which far exceeded downward mobility. There was, to borrow the title of a 1950s novel, “room at the top”. Now the growth in top jobs has slowed. Social mobility hasn’t disappeared, but for those born since the early 1980s, it is at least as likely to be down as up. “It was a positive-sum game when you could have increasing numbers moving up without anybody moving down,” Goldthorpe tells me. “Now it’s a zero-sum game. Nobody can move up without others moving down to make way.” When he tried to explain this to Blair in 2001, an aide interrupted: “But Tony can’t possibly go the country on a platform of increasing downward mobility!” As Goldthorpe observes, “Downward mobility is a taboo subject in politics.” “Loss aversion”, as psychologists call it, dictates that those who now occupy managerial and professional positions will do all they can to protect their children from falling down the social ladder. They will pay for the best pre-school provision, buy houses in areas with high-performing state schools, hire private tutors, and arrange educationally enriching experiences. In the most extreme examples, women, whose social mobility patterns are now otherwise similar to men’s, move into low-grade part-time work to maximise their availability to their children. “That’s the phenomenon of the tiger mother,” says Goldthorpe. “She is highly educated and could be competing for high-end jobs but deliberately chooses not to.” But, he adds, her partner is usually a well-paid professional or manager. “My daughter who has a PhD in virology works as a part-time science writer. She is married to the head of a top German technology transfer company.” Even if children from the top social classes fail at school, they often fall on their feet. The majority of men with the double handicaps of low qualifications and socially disadvantaged backgrounds end up in the working class and only 16% become professionals. But of similarly qualified men from the most advantaged homes, only a fifth sink to the working class and nearly half stay in the managerial and professional class. How do they manage that? “Some get jobs in a parent’s business. Others in the service sector, selling to people from similar social backgrounds: high-grade travel firms, marque car dealers, high-grade hotels and restaurants, fashion shops.” Typically, they are versions of Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice-But-Dim. Can education be made more effective in countering the advantages of the already advantaged? “I would support lotteries for allocating secondary school places,” he says. “And to even things up, you could give disadvantaged parents vouchers to buy private tuition for their children.” Abolishing private schools, he says, wouldn’t make much difference, except at elite levels of the civil service, the judiciary and so on, because it involves such a small proportion of children. But before meddling further with education, Goldthorpe argues, governments should develop an industrial strategy that creates more good management jobs and also upgrade welfare services such as old people’s care which, instead of providing mostly unskilled and low-paid jobs, could be turned into a profession. We need to get back to the golden age, he and Bukodi argue, when jobs that offered a secure, regular income and prospects of career progression steadily increased. Instead, we’ve moved in the opposite direction to the insecure, dead-end work of the gig economy. “I’m not against education,” says Goldthorpe. “More people than ever have a chance to realise their academic potential. We’re a better educated nation now. And that’s what I think education ought to be about, rather than an instrument to achieve social mobility, which is taking it out of its proper sphere.”",education
"The government is being urged to monitor teachers’ wellbeing after research revealed that one in 20 are reporting mental health problems which last more than a year. The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is the first to examine the mental health and wellbeing of teachers in England over three decades, based on data from more than 20,000 staff. It found that around 5% of teachers today are suffering long-lasting mental health problems, up from just 1% in the 1990s, and there has been a similar increase in prescribed antidepressant medication. The figures will ring alarm bells for policymakers who are grappling with a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention in England’s schools at a time when the number of children of school-age is on the increase. The government has made a series of pledges to reduce workload, but teachers say they are yet to reap the benefits. According to the report, a third of new teaching recruits leave the job within the first five years. The paper also quotes recent Department for Education (DfE) research, which found that “sleeping problems, panic attacks and anxiety issues” had contributed to teachers’ decisions to quit the profession. The lead author of the report, John Jerrim, a professor at the UCL institute of education, said: “The teaching profession in England is currently in the midst of a crisis and one potential reason why it’s struggling to recruit and retain enough teachers is due to the pressures of the job. “It has long been known that teaching is a stressful and challenging career and we wanted to see if the mental health and wellbeing of teachers had improved or declined, especially in light of government promises to ease the burden upon the teaching profession.” The report concedes that the increase in reported mental health problems is not specific to education, but can be seen in other professions, including those working in human resources and accountancy which may be due to an increased willingness to discuss mental illness and seek help. It concludes: “In our view, the most pressing issue is for the DfE to make a commitment to monitor the mental health and wellbeing of the teaching profession – similar to the commitment it has made to monitoring teachers’ workloads over time.” Sinéad Mc Brearty, the chief executive of Education Support, the UK’s mental health and wellbeing charity for education staff, said work-related anxiety and depression were high in education. “The sharp rise in teachers reporting long-term mental health conditions mirrors the increase in the severity of cases that we support through our counselling helpline. Teachers are presenting with ever more severe mental health symptoms.” Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was no wonder schools were unable to recruit and retain staff when workload demands continued to be unsustainable. “The challenge for the government is to address these issues and ensure that education staff are nurtured and supported in their role but there is currently little sign of any concrete action in this respect.” A DfE spokesperson said action was already under way to improve work-life balance for teachers. “This includes reducing workload, supporting early career schoolteachers, promoting flexible working and tackling accountability pressures, as well as supporting schools to deal with behaviour management.”",education
"Senior academics are refusing to act as external examiners – a vital part of higher education assessments – in protest at pay and working conditions in UK universities, and are urging colleagues to join them, potentially disrupting this year’s results for students. British universities rely on external examiners to independently validate the results of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, meaning that mass resignations would cause headaches for universities in the setting and marking of exams. A letter to the Guardian signed by 29 professors said they were resigning as external examiners and refusing to take on new contracts because of pension cuts and insecure contracts throughout the sector, as well as gender and ethnicity pay gaps, heavy workloads and stress. “We are refusing to act as external examiners because although we believe that this role is crucial in underpinning the quality of education provided to students, so too is the need to provide fair pay, pensions and job security for those who work in universities,” the letter states. “It is long past time for universities to address these festering problems, and we believe we have a responsibility to staff at the start of their careers to make a stand now. Please join us by resigning external examiner posts and refusing to take on new contracts until universities take action to address these issues.” Phil Taylor, a professor of work and employment at the University of Strathclyde, said he had signed the letter because he was “fed up” with universities treating their staff with contempt. “Someone starting now is likely to have to deal with one insecure contract after another, face cuts in their pension, spiralling workloads, unrelenting pressure, soaring stress levels and pay inequality. Universities must start to value staff more or they will lose what little goodwill that is left,” he said. Another signatory, Natalie Fenton, a professor of media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London, said British universities boasted about their global reputation while treating staff as second-class citizens. “It is really important that senior academics on established contracts make a stand in support of less fortunate colleagues. I will be refusing any invitations to act as external examiner for degree courses until universities address these issues,” Fenton said. External examiners are experienced academics such as professors or senior lecturers, who give independent assurance that a university’s assessment system is fair and help to maintain rigorous academic standards. The external examination boycott comes during industrial disputes at many British universities, with the University and College Union leading a strike at 60 institutions last year and more strike ballots being held this month. “External examiners resigning their positions, and refusing to take up new ones, are very serious steps and demonstrate the huge levels of frustration that exist,” said Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary. “External examiners are vitally important both to protecting educational standards and to the sector’s academic reputation but they want to support colleagues who face pension cuts, insecure contracts, spiralling workloads and pay inequality. “Universities must now recognise the strength of feeling that exists across the workforce and make substantial changes in the way they treat staff or they will undoubtedly face not just further industrial action, but also more withdrawals of cooperation.” A spokesperson for the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the protest “does not seem to reflect accurately the issues” in the current industrial disputes. “Many universities have also been in dialogue with their unions over the wider employment issues that have been packaged in to one of these disputes and it is wrong to assert that there is any unwillingness within universities to discuss and address these issues,” the association said. A spokesperson for the industry body Universities UK said: “It is right that university staff should expect good working conditions, fair pay and an attractive pension. This is what universities are striving to provide.”",education
"Francis Elive deserves a bonus. The 55-year-old maths teacher recently helped his entire class of 30 year 11 students at the Fitzalan high school in Leckwith, Cardiff, to achieve A* grades in their GCSE maths exam – six months early.  Inspirational teachers like Elive, who has been dubbed the “maths whisperer”, don’t come along often. But when they do, they can have a lifelong impact. When Lauren Aitchinson was 17, she had a wobble with her mental health. Her boyfriend had dumped her for her best friend and her confidence plummeted. “I thought I was the most stupid person alive,” Aitchinson, a 31-year-old caseworker from Perthshire, remembers. “I didn’t deserve to go to uni.” Aitchinson refused to sit the exams she would need to pass to go to university. “All the teachers thought I had an attitude problem, so were like: ‘Let her fail,’” Aitchinson says. Only Mr Pullar, her religious studies teacher, thought differently. “He said: ‘No, she needs encouragement.’” Pullar arranged for Aitchinson to sit her exams on a day the school was closed. When she passed them, he didn’t make a big deal of it. Aitchinson went on to college and has a book coming out next year. She plans to send him a copy when it is published, with a note saying thank you. If it weren’t for Miss Cockburn, Léonie Drury’s life would have turned out very differently. It is down to her that Drury, who is 36 and lives in London, became a teacher. “In my 20s, I was lost and I didn’t know what to do, so I went to see her,” recalls Drury. “She said: ‘Become an English teacher! You love books.’” She was right – Drury has been an English teacher for seven years, and loves her job. Cockburn was an inspirational teacher. “She had a bright-red bob and was the most literary person I’ve ever met,” Drury smiles. “She could bring anything to life.” Cockburn started a poetry competition at Drury’s all-girls school. “We all thought we were Sylvia Plath, obviously,” Drury laughs.  “It was the sort of school where everyone’s ambition was to be a football hooligan,” says Shaun Paul Tomkiss, a 42-year-old chef from Shrewsbury, of his secondary school. “You weren’t allowed to like books or art. It wasn’t on.” As a result, Tomkiss kept his passion for books quiet. After school, when his classmates were playing football, Tomkiss would read Oscar Wilde in the privacy of his bedroom. Miss Herbert changed everything. “She’d read aloud from the The Catcher in the Rye, but insist on doing it in a New York drawl,” Tomkiss laughs. He was transported, and took the JD Salinger novel home to finish in his own time. The next lesson, Herbert noticed he seemed disengaged, and pulled him aside. What was going on? “I said: ‘I took the book home and read it already and loved it to bits. Are there any more books like this?’” Her eyes lit up. She wrote him a list of books, which he devoured. Tomkiss credits her for his lifelong love of books. Drury and Cockburn remain friends to this day, catching up once a year to talk about books and life. Sadly, Herbert died while Tomkiss was in his late teens, so he never got a chance to say thank you. “It took a lot for a 14-year-old council estate boy to follow such lofty pursuits,” Tomkiss says. “I’m not sure I’d be the same person without her.”",education
"For three years, Ione Gildroy worked on Saturdays in her local library. The 18-year-old from Leicestershire issued and returned books, organised children’s events and stacked bookshelves. She planned to pool her earnings with some compensation she’d received after being in a car accident to pay for her dream gap year: Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bali, Australia. Working in a turtle rehabilitation centre on the Great Barrier Reef. An elephant sanctuary in Thailand. Gildroy booked the trip at the beginning of January. She’d heard of coronavirus then, but wasn’t worried. “I didn’t think it would even slightly affect my travelling plans,” she says. Gildroy looked forward to the summer of her dreams: a joint 18th birthday party with friends and then off backpacking. But then coronavirus hit. Her travel plans were ruined; her raucous 18th birthday party was a picnic with her mum and a socially distanced visit to her grandmother’s. “It feels like all the rites of passage you go through when you turn 18 we haven’t gotten to go through,” says Gildroy. “I turned 18, but I haven’t been out for a drink anywhere. We only knew it was our last day of school the day before. We didn’t have to do our exams, sure, but I would have preferred to have done A-levels, and got all the good stuff that goes with it, such as going on holiday or having my prom.” These are strange times for this year’s cohort of A-level students. Schools and colleges closed in March; exams were cancelled. Sectors young people would normally seek casual employment in, such as retail or hospitality, have been shedding staff at an alarming rate. Many universities, including Cambridge, are moving to online tuition. Apprenticeship opportunities have largely evaporated. For school leavers, this is a crucial time: deciding whether to travel, work or go to university. The pace of change at the age of 17 or 18 is the equivalent to years as an adult. But now, with plans shattered, these young people are facing a year in limbo. “Everything just feels really uncertain,” says Ben Forrest, 18, from Bradford. Like many others, Forrest had carefully sketched out his summer: two music festivals and a joint birthday party before studying journalism at the University of Leeds. “Before this happened, I was really excited,” he says. “Now I don’t know what to do with myself. When I’m occupied and doing stuff, I’m all right, but when you have those days when you’re not doing owt, it’s not great for the mental health side of things.” Although lockdown restrictions are being eased, there is no timeline for the reopening of clubs and festivals, and many teenagers have lost the part-time jobs they rely on to fund those activities. Forrest has been trying to make the most of the downtime: he is reading a lot and meeting friends in the park. But he still feels pretty down. “The summer between A-levels and uni is meant to be the best time of your life,” he says. “I’ve just spent it in my room.” Among Forrest’s friendship group, the levels of ennui are high. “Everyone is just disappointed, fed up and bored,” he says. Losing your freedom and autonomy just as you are trying to make your mark in the world can feel devastatingly limiting. “Emerging adulthood is the period when people are trying to reach lift-off in their adult lives,” says Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts. “That time is really difficult, and to have that all come to an end, even temporarily, is painful.” He explains that the lockdown will be felt more acutely by 18- to 24-year-olds than any other generation. “You’ve gone through puberty, with the rush of hormones that entails,” says Arnett. “You’re confronting big questions about what you want your future to look like. When you’re thwarted from exploring those questions as you had intended, you’re likely to see anxiety and depression.” Covid-19 has also forced school leavers to make hard calculations about their future: do they push ahead with their university plans or defer for a year in the hope that a vaccine will be made available, and that they will be able to have a more typical student experience? Faced with the prospect of online-only learning and a lacklustre, socially distanced freshers’ week, many students are choosing to defer. “I feel like with university next year, my education will be very halfhearted,” says Jawwad Khan, 18, from London. “Especially when you’re paying £9,250 a year for online learning. It’s like buying an online book over a real book. You’d rather have the real book.” Khan has a place to study economics at Warwick University, which will offer a mixture of in-person and online learning. The prospect of online lectures doesn’t appeal. “I’m not going to be motivated to study online,” Khan says. “I’m just going to end up sleeping in and watching the lecture on my phone.” Khan plans to defer for a year, and he isn’t alone: as many as one in five UK students are also expected to defer the next academic year. In response, some universities are fighting to shore up their student numbers (and revenue) by blocking students from deferring, particularly after the government’s announcement that it will ditch the 50% target for the proportion of young people going to university. “They should either drop the fees or give everyone the first year for free,” says Khan. Like Khan, 17-year-old Morgan Davies, from Warrington, is also deferring. He has a scholarship to the University of North Carolina to study economics. “I really wanted the full freshman experience,” Davies says. “I wanted to ‘rush a frat’ and go to Halloween parties.” In anticipation of the college year, he had befriended his roommates online, and socialised with them on Zoom. But Davies’s university is moving to online learning, meaning there will be no in-person lectures or frat parties. At first, Davies thought he could study from his dorm, but the US immigration authorities recently announced that international students would not be allowed into the US if their courses were online-only, meaning that Davies faces the prospect of spending his first year at university in his bedroom in Warrington, studying in US time zones. “For me,” Davies explains, “university is about being physically present … although it wouldn’t affect me academically, being there was a huge part of going to the US. I thought I’d rather delay a year and get the full experience.” Not all students plan to defer. “I’m definitely starting university in September,” says 18-year-old Lily Good, from Aylesbury, who plans to study politics and sociology at the University of Exeter. “I was umming and ahhing, and wasn’t really sure what to do. But things are reopening now, and I’ve spent so much time at home this year. I honestly cannot wait to go somewhere new, meet new people and have a new start in a different place.” Good is optimistic that she will be able to have a relatively normal student experience. “I think that, even if social distancing is officially in place, I can’t imagine 18- and 19-year-old students staying apart, especially in halls and stuff. And, hopefully, the clubs won’t be shut for too long.” Of course, making it to university is contingent on getting predicted grades. When Abubakar Finiin, 18, from London, found out that A-level exams were cancelled, he was initially jubilant. “I was dancing, I was so happy,” says Finiin. “I was sending voice notes to my friends, screaming: ‘We don’t have to do A-levels!’” But then reality sunk in: he would be receiving a predicted grade based on his mocks. Finiin didn’t put much effort into them because he was focused on his university application: he has a conditional offer to study philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford. Now, there is a very real possibility he won’t make his offer. “I kind of cruised through the mocks,” Finiin admits. “I’m one of those people who leave it to the last minute, and then puts 100% focus on it.” Already, there are indications that exam boards may mark this cohort of students harshly. After the international baccalaureate (IB) examiners released its grades this month, online forums erupted in fury: scores of students felt their grades had been unduly marked down, causing them to miss out on university offers. The IB grading body is now being investigated by England’s exams regulator, Ofqual. “I’m stressed,” Finiin says. “I worked so hard for the offer, and I was ready to transition all my efforts into getting the grades. If I don’t get the grades, I don’t know what I’ll do.” If you had banked on entering the world of work via an apprenticeship, now is just about the worst possible time to be a school leaver. “Apprenticeship vacancies have collapsed,” says Kathleen Henehan of the Resolution Foundation. “There were just under 2,000 apprenticeship vacancies in England this May, compared with 13,000 the May previously.” This month, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced incentives for employers to hire more apprentices. “It’s a nice step, but there’s a big question mark as to whether that’s enough to incentivise employers struggling to hire them,” says Henehan. Mason Gunn, 16, from North Shields, left school this year. He planned to find a level-one electrical apprenticeship. “Most companies I’ve spoken to have said if it wasn’t for Covid they would have taken me on,” he says. “They all said the same thing – ‘lack of work due to Covid’ but they would ‘keep me in mind’.” Gunn has phoned or emailed more than 35 local firms, with no luck. “I’m trying to stay positive because I understand that many of these companies are struggling to pull in money, so having an apprenticeship would only make things difficult.” And young people who had hoped to enter the workforce straight away will find themselves on the sharp end of hiring freezes. “School leavers always tend to suffer during recessions because there are fewer vacancies,” Henehan says. “And when firms are hiring, they want someone with more experience.” She explains that during the 2008 crisis, graduates were pushed into jobs previously taken by non-graduates – leaving the non-graduates jobless. “I’m kind of scrambling to get work even remotely related to the field of work I want to do,” says Marianne Zamgoni, 18, from Doncaster. Zamgoni planned to get a job as a trainee estate agent on leaving school: she was getting interviews for positions before Covid-19 hit, and then everything dried up. She has applied for 50 jobs in the past three months, with no luck. “I have signed up for every job website under the sun,” she says, “and whenever I get an alert about a new job post, I apply for it.” All the firms who come back say the same thing: they’re on a hiring freeze. Zamgoni is trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard to not be dispirited. “It can be quite depressing every time you open an email and it says: ‘Sorry to inform you …’” she says. “My future feels very uncertain.” The Resolution Foundation recently predicted that more than a million young people would be unemployed in the coming years. “I wouldn’t want to be 18 right now,” sighs Henehan. “In terms of the labour market, it’s too soon to tell if this recession will be worse than it was in the 1980s, where we had mass youth unemployment, but it’s possible … it certainly looks more challenging than the 2008 financial crisis. At least in this century, this is the worst time to be a young person.” Being 18 right now can feel a little like being a member of a cursed generation. “We’ve had it so bad,” says 18-year-old Aisha Akram from Manchester. “We had the new GCSEs, when there was a new curriculum and no past papers. And now Covid.” Akram, who plans to study psychology at the University of Manchester next year, worries about her generation’s long-term prospects with a recession looming. “It’s probably going to be really hard to get a job when I graduate,” she says. Some of Akram’s friends think deferring will improve their job prospects – the labour market should be in better shape by then – but Henehan says that is far from certain: “If everyone stays in education a bit longer, they all exit en masse, and will be competing for the same jobs.” Finiin’s friends have started jokingly referring to themselves as the “class of Covid-19”. “I remember our economics teacher joking about coronavirus in January, and everyone was laughing,” Finiin says, “and then – bam! – we were all locked down in our houses and school was cancelled. Everything happened at once. I think we’ll look back in a few years and think: ‘Wow, how did that happen?’” But Akram is confident that the class of Covid-19 will emerge victorious, pointing to the Fridays for Future climate crisis movement and the recent Black Lives Matter protests as evidence of Generation Z’s commitment to making a positive impact on the world. “All these protests will equate to something,” Akram says. “We’ve been hard done by, but in the end we will come out stronger. Our generation is going to make a big change in the world.”",education
"Germany’s culture of dual educational and vocational training programmes has never been short of admirers, including British education secretaries of the present and the past, the Chinese communist party and the daughter of the current US president. In a 2017 interview Ivanka Trump praised the German system, whereby employers and local authorities cooperate to provide a “two-track” apprenticeship as an alternative to purely academic higher education, as “a great trailblazer”. Its advantages are hard to ignore: around half of each year group in Germany do not go on to complete a university degree but a three-year apprenticeship with a company, of which they spent about 50% learning “on the job” and 50% at a vocational training school. The 325 recognised dual training occupations are wide-ranging, including carers for the elderly, bakers, booksellers, architectural draughtsmen or bow makers. Through the mix of practical and theory-based learning, trainees acquire skills that tend to be well matched to the needs of employers and can be plugged into businesses with relative ease: before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, youth unemployment in Germany hit a record low of 5.6%. Yet if the benefits of the dual system are apparent, copying “a world-class, German-style further education system” into another labour market, especially the British one, is more easily said than done. For one, the German dual system requires a high level of complex coordination between the employers who pay the trainee’s wages, the federal states that fund vocational training schools tailored to the needs of local industry, the unions that feed into the curriculum, and the chambers of trade and industry that carry out the exams at the end. Previous British attempts to build up German-style dual systems – New Labour’s “14-19 Diplomas” and David Cameron’s ambitious apprenticeship targets – struggled to build up the educational infrastructure required to go with it. “One problem Britain has is that it doesn’t have the same tradition of social partners sitting down together and building a consensus”, said Hubert Ertl, vice president of the German Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training. Most British unions don’t have the capacity to feed expertise into training programmes, Ertl said, and while there are big employers like Rolls Royce and British Gas who do, there isn’t an equivalent tradition of employers’ umbrella organisations developing training programmes for their entire sector. In addition, not just Britain but Germany too is experiencing a gravitational pull that draws more and more young people towards universities rather than apprenticeships. The number of students enrolled at German universities rose to a record 2.9m last year, while the number of newly signed twin-track training contracts has declined for several years in a row. In 2019, as many as 58,000 apprenticeship training positions remained empty. One reason for the trend, labour market experts speculate, is that academic degrees promise more flexibility, which is one of the downsides of the dual system. While Germany’s dual training programmes produce highly specialised workers that can be perfectly matched to a sector’s current needs, they can struggle when digitalisation or globalisation throws that sector into crisis, as German printers, tailors or photo laboratory technicians have discovered in recent years.",education
"Students at British universities should not expect automatic tuition fee refunds for disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak, according to MPs, despite complaints from thousands of those affected. The MPs on parliament’s petitions committee said while many students had lost out as a result of campus closures and the switch to remote learning, at least some universities had made “enormous efforts” to provide effective teaching. In a report, the committee concluded: “While students do have a right to seek a refund or to repeat part of their course if the service provided by their university is substandard, we do not believe that there should be a universal refund or reimbursement of tuition fees to all university students.” The National Union of Students has said UK universities should offer the chance to repeat the year at no extra cost, or reimburse students’ debts and costs. The committee heard evidence from students and policymakers after a petition to reimburse all students for this year’s fees gained more than 300,000 signatures. The report will be forwarded to the government and requires a response within two months. Catherine McKinnell, the Labour MP who chairs the petitions committee, said: “Despite the hard work of lecturers and support staff, some universities have been unable to provide courses in a way that students feel is good value for money. Therefore, while we do not consider that a blanket refund for all students is necessarily required, we believe that the government has a role in ensuring any student whose university experience has fallen short is compensated.” The report calls for refund procedures to be streamlined and better publicised, saying the existing complaints process or use of the courts places too much of a burden on individual students and are likely to be overwhelmed by a flood of cases. The MPs also said the government should pay for tuition fee refunds this year, “given the importance of the higher education sector to the UK economy, and the exceptional circumstances”. The committee’s research found just 7% of students were satisfied with the quality of education received this year, while 87% said their teaching hours had decreased since March. About 47% said they had paid for accommodation they didn’t need. The committee heard from one student who said that after lectures were cancelled, “half my lecturers just stuck up last year’s recordings”. Another said: “We lost all of our international courses, events, networking opportunities, and even access to university facilities, like the library and data terminals.” Another student told the MPs: “Most private schools have given a tuition fee decrease for the final term, which students will not be attending. If a private school can do that, when they are practically reliant on those funds, I feel that universities should be able to as well.”",education
"No one could accuse CEO and businessman Ben Nelson of lacking ambition. “I wanted to create a university that serves as a model for other institutions, by being indisputably the best university in the world,” he says, bouncing up and down on a video call from his San Francisco office. “Unless you demonstrate that you are the absolute best, that you can provide an education that Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford cannot come close to, no one will listen. And we are doing exactly that.” In 2012 Nelson founded the Minerva Project, a venture-backed Silicon Valley startup, with the aim of revolutionising higher education. It partnered with the Keck Graduate Institute to create Minerva Schools at KGI, a non-profit university programme headquartered in San Francisco. This year Minerva received 25,000 applications from 180 countries for undergraduate entry in 2020 and admitted just 2% of them, making it the most selective degree programme in the developed world. One draw is Minerva’s unusual curriculum, which is rooted in Nelson’s student campaigning at the University of Pennsylvania 25 years ago. “I realised that colleges were fundamentally failing in their promise to educate,” he says. “A liberal arts education is supposed to teach students to think freely, critically and logically. But our elite universities no longer do that at all.” The Minerva offering is very different to what most UK students were accustomed to, prior to the coronavirus pandemic shifting universities online. There are no lectures, faculty buildings, or exams. All teaching is done through online video classes. There is only one programme of study for first years, and rather than reading maths or history, students take courses aimed at teaching transferrable skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, through classes named “multimodal communications”, “empirical analyses” and “complex systems”. Subject specialisms are chosen in the second year. There is no campus; students are housed in a residence hall in San Francisco in their first year. Subsequent year groups spend semesters variously in Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires, London and Taipei. The first undergraduate class enrolled in 2014. Among them was British teenager Kayla Cohen, who, armed with top A-level grades, had been selected out of 2,000 applicants to join a cohort of just 30 freshers. “It was a privilege, it was exciting,” says Cohen, now a 25-year-old graduate. “I remember the thrill of going to San Francisco, meeting my class, and feeling like I was joining the birth of something special.” Minerva’s first class graduated in 2019, and of 103 students, 94% were in full-time positions or graduate programmes within six months. Just under a fifth (16%) have landed roles in the technology sector, and graduates have gone on to work at such companies as Google, Twitter, Uber and Razor Labs. Twenty-year-old Jade Bowler has just completed her first year at Minerva, and admits she was sceptical when she first learned about the institution from an online advert. “I was half-convinced it was a scam, it sounded like a cult,” she says. Bowler originally planned to read biology at Bristol University, so there was surprise when she decided to go to an obscure new US university. “I posted about my choice on social media and had thousands of people telling me not to go. But I just had a gut feeling that this was the future of education.” Minerva’s appeal, Bowler says, was its practical teaching style. “It’s so different from just sitting in a lecture theatre. You learn as you do, not learn by rote. And I have learned so much more in the past year than in any year of my life.” According to Nelson, this is what makes Minerva different to its traditional counterparts, where “students sit in a class, they’re not called upon to answer questions, or apply the content to novel contexts. A professor simply talks to them.” He adds: “Six months after their exams, students will have forgotten 90% of the course content – because they were never really taught it.” Study after study has shown the efficacy of active learning, and Nelson says Minerva has taken that research and implemented it. As such, professors are not supposed to speak in classes for any longer than a few minutes at a time, and students are expected to contribute to class discussions and group work. The online live video platform Forum is instrumental in facilitating this. “To achieve this kind of education, you have to have data,” says Nelson. “You have to actually be able to track how engaged every single student is.” This is achieved through a system that colour-codes students based on how much they talk in class. Allison Littlejohn, professor of learning technology at University College London, worries about the implications of data gathering for students. “Staff can see when a student logs on, how long they spend on an activity, how much they contribute to a discussion. There are real problems with this method: it puts a lot of pressure on students, and there are issues with privacy and surveillance. Everything a student does is monitored.” Currently half a dozen UK students have offers to study at Minerva this autumn. But despite its undeniable novelty, Littlejohn is doubtful that a university without lecture halls, societies and sports teams has mass appeal. “Lots of people go to campus-based universities not just for love of their subject, but for the whole experience of being a student on a campus, and all the social and extracurricular opportunities that offers,” she says.  But Nelson believes the lack of a campus is a draw for some students. “At Minerva, you live in the heart of a city, in seven different countries,” he says. “There’s no campus cafeteria, or bar, or gym – your gym is the gym at the end of the road. Instead, you live as an adult in a city. You learn to be a global citizen.” Either way, Minerva’s innovations certainly pose a challenge to a sclerotic university model in both the US and the UK. Even if the venture does not upend the landscape of higher education in the way Nelson intends, campuses across the world will at some point have to address the deficiencies he identifies – and many already are as a result of the pandemic. “Many campuses are now realising the importance of flexible online learning, flipped classrooms, and interdisciplinary programmes,” Littlejohn agrees. But she adds: “There will always be a place for the campus, and for in-person teaching. At a campus with world-leading researchers, you see how academics spend their time and what they do. You see first-hand how knowledge is created.” The other crucial question is what’s really driving the success of Minerva’s graduates. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says: “A mix of excellent pre-university qualifications and a hyped-up higher education is likely to be a winning one. It is worth noting that it is much easier to deliver an excellent education to people with high prior qualifications than to students with more challenging backgrounds.” For the time being, Minerva graduates seem satisfied with their gamble. “I’ve learned so much, and I’m not sure I’d leave any other university with that same conclusion,” says Liberty Pim, who has just finished her final year. “Minerva built a completely new university without the constraints of a traditional university. When I applied it felt like a big risk, but it paid off.” ",education
"An 18-year-old student who predicted this year’s A-level results crisis in an award-winning dystopian story about an algorithm deciding school grades according to social class, has had her own results downgraded. “I’ve fallen into my story. It’s crazy,” said Jessica Johnson, a student at Ashton Sixth Form College in Greater Manchester. “I based it on the educational inequality I already saw. I just exaggerated that inequality and added the algorithm. But I really didn’t think it would come true as quick as it did!” Johnson won an Orwell youth prize senior award in 2019 for her short story titled A Band Apart, which was the first one she had written. Set in 2029, it imagined a system where students were sorted into bands based on their background. “Mum still thinks I can be a doctor. She doesn’t understand how hard it is to get into Band 1 for people like us,” says a character in the story.  Johnson had her English A-level result downgraded from A to B and lost her place at the University of St Andrews before the government’s U-turn on Monday. Now that results will be based on teacher assessments instead, she is hopeful that her place will be restored. “I’ve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, waiting to hear back from universities,” she said. “We got told you can go wherever you want in life if you work hard enough, but we’ve seen this year that no matter how hard you worked, you got given a grade based on where you live.”  Prof Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell prize, said: “Jessica saw into the heart of what the system represents and her story demonstrates the human ability which exams only exist to uncover.” Johnson said the inspiration behind her writing was to mix educational inequality with the dystopian genre. “It’s not exactly a fairy tale I wanted to come true!”",education
"Keir Starmer has condemned last-minute changes to the A-level appeals system as “complete fiasco”, after the schools minister Nick Gibb conceded they would only affect “a small group of pupils”. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, announced changes late on Tuesday night, after the Scottish government was forced to restore the exam grades of more than 120,000 students marked down by a computer algorithm. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb confirmed that students in England would be allowed to contest individual results and that past performance in mock exams would be one basis for such an appeal. But he said: “It will only apply to a small group of people; it is just another source of evidence on which they can base an appeal.” Starmer said: “This is complete fiasco. It was obvious that this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming. To have an 11th-hour decision that’s caused widespread chaos amongst teachers I have been speaking to, families and young people – it smacks of incompetence.” Speaking in Wakefield, where he has been visiting businesses, he added: “It’s shambolic. It’s hours to go before the results. The problem is obvious and it’s been sitting there for weeks or months.” Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, confirmed it was working on the new appeals format requested by the Department for Education (DfE) using mock exam grades. “We are working urgently to operationalise this as fairly as possible and to determine what standards of evidence will be required for the appeal. We will provide more detail early next week,” it said. Ofqual also defended its system for moderating A-level and GCSE grades this summer as “essential to create a level playing field”, after controversy over the high proportion of downgrades it is imposing on teachers’ assessments. “Adjustments were only made where necessary to bring consistency to the standards between schools and colleges,” the regulator said. With 24 hours to go before A-level results are published, Starmer’s criticism was echoed by university leaders and teachers, who will have to grapple with the changes. Julia Buckingham, of Universities UK, said: “This last-minute policy change presents a number of challenges for universities and we are seeking urgent clarification from the Department for Education on a range of issues including the likely scale and timing of appeals.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The idea of introducing at the 11th hour a system in which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief. If the government wanted to change the system, it should have spent at least a few days discussing the options rather than rushing out a panicked and chaotic response.” In a press release sent out at 11.30pm on Tuesday as the government scrambled to avoid a Scotland-style backlash, the DfE said students unhappy with their grades would be able to “appeal to receive a valid mock result”. Ministers have asked Ofqual, England’s exams regulator, to “determine how and when valid mock results can be used to calculate grades”. Ofqual had previously not allowed individual appeals. The DfE has also announced £30m for schools to pay entry fees for the extra set of A-level and GCSE exams being held in autumn. A-level results in England are due to be announced on Thursday, calculated on a similar basis to Scotland’s. Teachers’ predictions have been moderated by a model that takes into account factors including past school performance. “Most people can rely on this standardisation model in delivering the right result,” said Gibb, stressing that without the computer-aided moderation, there would have been grade inflation of 12%. He underscored the government’s continued confidence in the system, despite the fiasco in Scotland, which has led to calls for the Scottish education secretary, John Swinney, to resign. “It is a robust, it is a fair system. Tomorrow, students can be confident that the grades they receive are a fair reflection of their ability and their work, and that those qualifications will have value,” Gibb said. He also confirmed that, as the Guardian reported last week, 40% of grades had been downgraded by the standardisation model. “The majority of students tomorrow will get the grades submitted by their teacher, and of those 40% that are adjusted, it will be just by one grade,” he said. Williamson claimed the changes represented a “triple lock”: because students can accept the grade they are given; appeal on the basis of their mock grade; or resit that subject in the autumn. But the Education Policy Institute thinktank said the phrase was unhelpful. “The government is in danger of creating confusion for students, parents and universities by talking of a “triple lock”, including the implied option for students to choose to receive their “mock” grade. In fact, the use of a mock grade seems to only be part of an appeals process, rather than being a guarantee. The president of the National Union of Students, Larissa Kennedy, said: “The use of mock exams results risks making a mockery of the whole system, given the lack of a standard approach to mock exams and the fact they are not taken by all candidates.”",education
"When student vlogger Ehis Ilozobhie went through his closet before starting his first term at King’s College London, he wanted to take everything. “I vividly remember my dad telling me: ‘Oh you’re not going to need all this,’” he says. Despite that long-suffering parental sigh, Ilozobhie packed all his kicks, his clothes and four different suits. It didn’t take long, though, before he realised that what he was actually wearing day-in, day-out, was T-shirts, sweatpants and a jacket. And all of the stuff he wasn’t wearing? It was making an already small room feel way smaller. So the most important bit of style advice is this: pack basic. Homesickness will probably have you home before you know it, by which point you’ll have a clearer idea of exactly what uni life is, and how best to dress for it. When packing the first time round, be practical. What’s the weather in autumn generally like where you’re headed to? What do you need to keep up your current sport or hobby? Crucially, what makes you feel most at home? Be it a onesie (AKA a wearable hug), a hoodie or your slippers, you’re going to need something cosy to pull an all-nighter, for movie nights with flatmates, or just to make whatever version of lockdown September brings that bit more bearable. Likewise, the 9am lecture, or the late-afternoon tutorial. As vlogger Maninder Sachdeva puts it, things are way more casual than you’d think. Even at Oxford, where he is in his final months of a degree in computer science and philosophy, things might start out smart, but within a few weeks people are literally heading out in their PJs. This isn’t to say getting dressed up can’t actually have a role to play – even if social distancing measures have you stuck in your room more than you expected. As YouTuber Elena Handtrack recently posted to Instagram: “Did I get dressed up to sit in my room and study, knowing full well that no one would see me? Absolutely.” Even while quarantined back home in Stuttgart, she has kept up the daily 5am rise and full-on hair and makeup routine she’s often vlogged about from her room in Cambridge. When she’s done with work at her desk, it’s sweatpants and socials on her bed. She’s changing clothes as a way to structure her day. If you’re someone who navigated secondary school without ever giving your clothes much thought, university might just be an open window of sorts. “You’re exposed to so much more,” says Ilozobhie. Capitalise on the sense of freedom that brings. Explore. Have fun. Ask people where they got things. Make moodboards, pinning stuff you like the look of on Pinterest, TikTok and Tumblr. The danger of a student budget is how sneakily fast fashion has risen to meet it. Ilozobhie recommends saving your pennies and spending that bit more on timeless basics from more ethical sources. For the rest, shift your focus to charity shops, swap meets and thrifting apps (Vinted, Depop and Vestiaire Collective, to name a few). Conscious shopping is that bit more time-consuming, but you’ll be setting up wardrobe habits to last you a lifetime.",education

"There is a persistent misconception that students only ever “eat like a student”: hangovers for breakfast, beans on toast for tea, and coffee mainlined in between. Clued-up undergrads TikTokking their uni experience are real-time proof, though, that healthy student eating is not a myth. You just need your feet on the ground and some tricks up your sleeve. While she was all over the place upon arrival at Essex University, it didn’t take long for Emily Solman to find solace in cooking. “It became my little getaway, especially when living with other people, having my own time to watch a YouTube video and chop up some veg. I’d be like: ‘Mum, look what I’ve done!’” For #onepoundmeals cookbook author Miguel Barclay, the single most important tip is to learn to cook from scratch. Your food will be tastier, healthier and cheaper. His Instagram, @miguelbarclay, is a good place to start: all familiar ingredients and recipes no longer than a tweet. Fancy a curry? “Fry up some onions,” he says. “Then chuck in finely diced potato, some curry powder and a can of chopped tomatoes (two solid store cupboard staples right there). Add in any other veg and a protein if you like, cook and serve with rice.” Of course, learning to cook involves learning to shop. Ehis Ilozobhie (@ehis) loves his seafood, and when he first arrived at King’s College London was a dab hand at prepping it. But he’d never had to pay for it. “I was like, ‘Mom, are these prices right?’” He soon got organised. He’d go through his fridge on a Sunday to make a list, then head to the supermarket for that, and only that. When shopping, there are three things to remember: own-brand items are just as good as branded ones; fresh produce is often discounted at the same time every day, so clock when that is; and the frozen section is your friend (berries, peas, chopped broccoli, you name it, it’s a bargain). Solman’s diet is mostly plant-based, but with added fish. Ilozobhie began his second year cutting out meat too. For anyone wishing to go full vegan, chef and musician Denai Moore (@deestable) says it’s easy: “You can veganise pretty much anything!” She still makes mac ‘n’ cheese (albeit with nutritional yeast), and a scramble on toast for breakfast – only it’s tofu, not eggs. On her vegan website, Pick Up Limes, Sadia Badiei has a super-helpful visual prompt for ensuring your nutritional intake. She calls it the plate method. At every meal, make sure your plate is: half fruit and veg, one-quarter carbs (potato, bread, rice, oats ...) and one-quarter protein (pulses, tofu, nuts, meat, fish ...), with some added fat (avocado, olive oil ...) and, twice a day, a serving of dairy (or plant-based equivalent – for the calcium). Badiei only started paying attention to what she ate a year into her dietetics degree. In other words, you’ve got time to get it right. Try to keep healthy and get into a good routine of sleep, take regular exercise and eat balanced meals. These habits will safeguard your mental and physical wellbeing for life. But don’t beat yourself up when you can’t. If you need the coffee, drink the coffee (add soy milk to boost nutrients). Likewise, allow yourself to snack – but try to stick to healthier options such as malt loaf and oat bars. And remember it’s the basics that are most important: always have something in your fridge.

"A healthcare degree is a route into a lifelong career in which you get to make a difference to somebody’s life every day. What’s more, with current vacancies for NHS nurses in England alone at approximately 40,000, a job as a health professional is almost guaranteed to be recession-proof as the economic fallout from Covid-19 continues. The national health emergency has thrown the NHS under a new spotlight, with universities reporting unprecedented interest in degrees which lead to a health profession. Applications to train to be a nurse, midwife or paramedic have soared, in some cases by as much as 24%, since the coronavirus pandemic began. Meanwhile, the NHS Careers website received more than 1.2m visits during seven weeks in March and April – a 52% rise compared with the same period last year. The biggest interest – 139% – came from 18- to 24-year-olds and the number of hits on how to become a paramedic rocketed by 217%. The increased interest comes as no surprise to Natalie Eccleston, who holds an offer for child nursing at Staffordshire University. She says the profession’s response to Covid-19 and the public support for the NHS have made her realise she is making the right career choice. “There is so much going for the NHS at the moment in terms of respect,” she says. “It’s always been revered by the people in it, in their own field, like nurses, but now that recognition is felt by everybody. It makes me feel proud that I am going to be part of it.” Ann Ewens, dean of the school of health and social care at Staffordshire University, agrees that the coronavirus pandemic, although devastating, is a big moment for the NHS. “I do think changes may come and one of those is a resurgence of the role of health careers.” Since last autumn, applications to train as a nurse or midwife at Sheffield Hallam University, which has one of the UK’s largest nursing departments, went up by an average 16%, while radiotherapy and oncology rose by 24%. The university is now confident that if local trusts can increase their number of practice placements for students – usually 50% of a health degree programme – it can meet the increased demand for more student places. Its head of department for nursing and midwifery, Dr Toni Schwarz, says the university is working with its partners to increase placement capacity as well as looking at its own resources. “I think it will be achievable, especially if you consider the move to more blended learning (a mix of face- to-face and online learning) because of Covid-19.” The increased interest in NHS careers may also be down to new annual non-refundable maintenance grants from September of between £5,000 to £8,000 for nursing and some allied health profession undergraduates in England – including physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Prof Brian Webster-Henderson, a University of Cumbria pro vice-chancellor and chair of the council of deans at Health UK, thinks healthcare is a safe bet for students starting their degrees during a recession. “I think there is a very small chance of a student not getting a job at the end of their studies,” he says. “The NHS workforce is in a bit of a crisis – so I can’t see employment being a problem in either the short or long term.” There are a host of specialist vocational qualifications in healthcare on offer at universities, and degrees in IT, computing, English or maths can open the door to jobs in health informatics, communications and finance too. Here are three unusual healthcare degrees and where they could take you. BSc (Hons) in operating department practiceThis three-year undergraduate degree leads to a professional qualification as an operating department practitioner (ODP). ODPs work in all three phases of surgical care. They are responsible for supporting the patient during the anaesthetic phase ahead of surgery, as well as preparing surgical equipment and drugs. During surgery, they are the link between the surgeon and the rest of the operating theatre team and are responsible for the surgical equipment and handing what is needed to the surgeon. With postgraduate training, ODPs can go on to become surgical care practitioners – qualified to complete certain surgical procedures under the supervision of a consultant surgeon. BSc (Hons) healthcare science degreeWhen this degree is included in the NHS practitioner training programme, it can open the door to a career as a healthcare scientist. Health scientists have a crucial role in helping to prevent, diagnose and treat illness by applying their scientific knowledge and technical skills. They rely on highly specialised equipment to analyse body tissue, blood and other bodily fluids and many will also have direct patient contact working in clinics or hospital wards. The degree is a mix of academic and practice-based learning, which can lead to different specialist roles. Students spend the first two years undergoing broad scientific training and choose which branch of health science to specialise in for their final year. The five options are: cardiovascular, respiratory and sleep sciences; neurosensory sciences; life sciences; clinical engineering or medical physics technology. Master’s in nursing (dual registration)This four-year degree, studied as an undergraduate, offers students the opportunity to qualify in two branches of nursing rather than the single branch of the traditional three-year programme. The combinations are: adult and child; adult and learning disability; adult and mental health; learning disability and child; mental health and child and mental health and learning disability. The master’s is also seen as a fast-track route for a career in nursing research or education. From September, all nursing degree students in England qualify for a non- refundable annual maintenance grant of £5,000. An extra £3,000 is available for eligible students.",education
"Britain’s equalities watchdog has warned it will intervene in the controversy over the handling of A-level results in England after students from disadvantaged backgrounds were worst hit while private school pupils benefited the most. The release of A-level results on Thursday revealed that the largest share of rises in A* and A grades in England had gone to independent schools, with two privately educated pupils receiving an extra A* for every one at a state secondary. Nearly 40% of teachers’ recommended grades – 280,000 in total – were downgraded, it was confirmed. Deprived pupils were more likely to have seen those grades lowered by Ofqual’s algorithm, and the gap in results between pupils on free school meals and better-off pupils widened compared with 2019. While grades improved overall, claims of bias triggered an outcry from headteachers and students, some of whom reported dropping from a predicted A to an E or from a C to a U. At Wales high school, Rotherham, where 84% of students saw their teacher-assessed grades lowered, 18-year-old Anna Hogarth said: “In years to come we’re always going to be the year that didn’t count. The pandemic year.” Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, acknowledged the danger that an “exceptionally high-performing child in a low-performing school” would not get their expected grades. But Boris Johnson later insisted the results were “robust” and “dependable”. More than 200,000 sixth formers in England received their results on Thursday, decided for the first time this year by a statistical model developed by Ofqual, the exams regulator, to replace exams cancelled during lockdown. In a rare intervention, Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said Ofqual must “remove bias” and allow students to appeal directly if they feel their A-level grades have been unfairly reduced. The EHRC has told Ofqual it must mitigate against any “potential negative affect” of its process on ethnic minorities and disabled children, as well as those from deprived backgrounds. “Ofqual should be clear about the impact of the algorithm used in the standardisation model and the steps taken to remove bias and take into account equality,” Hilsenrath said. “To better understand any disparities for different protected groups, Ofqual must publish a full breakdown of the differences between teacher-assessed grades and the final grade. Students who have been downgraded must be able to appeal directly if they believe their grades are unfair. We will continue to discuss this with Ofqual and consider all our powers so that ethnic minority and disabled children, for example, are treated fairly in this process.” Scotland was forced into a reversal this week after a quarter of exam results were downgraded from teachers’ recommendations. All 124,000 changed results were reinstated, it was announced on Tuesday. Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, said on Thursday that “something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year’s [English] exam results” and a Scotland-style U-turn should not be ruled out. “Nearly 40% of young people have had their grades marked down and that’s thousands of young people whose opportunities could have been dashed. Parents, teachers and young people are rightly upset, frustrated and angry about this injustice,” he said. “The system has fundamentally failed them. The government needs to urgently rethink. We need to guarantee the right to individual appeals, the fee for appeals waived and nothing to be ruled out, including the U-turn that was forced on the Scottish government.” Williamson suggested that exam boards responsible for administering the A-levels should encourage schools to appeal against their results if they feared disadvantaged candidates were affected.Johnson insisted he had confidence in Williamson, prompting Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, to respond on Twitter: “Nobody else does.” Speaking during a trip to Belfast, the prime minister added: “Let’s be in no doubt about it: the exam results that we’ve got today are robust, they’re good, they’re dependable for employers.” Ofqual said it had been forced into the downgrades by inaccurate predictions by many teachers, although the vast majority had submitted accurate estimates. “Because there was no opportunity to develop a common approach to grading, the standard applied by different schools and colleges varies greatly,” an Ofqual spokesman told the Daily Telegraph. “A rare few centres put in implausibly high judgments, including one which submitted all A* and A grades for students in two subjects, where previously there had been normal distribution.” But many headteachers and education experts have joined the chorus of complaints about the way A-levels had been decided, with some pointing to flaws in Ofqual’s system that favoured private schools in particular. Analysis by the FFT Education Datalab showed that the quirk in Ofqual’s method – which relied heavily on teacher assessments for grading very small classes with up to five pupils – resulted in higher grades for less popular subjects such as German or music, and for schools that had much smaller average course entries. About one in 10 A-level entries from independent schools were in subjects in which the schools entered just five or fewer students. In contrast, state academies – the largest school type – had just one entry in 20 within small classes. Sixth form and further education colleges had A-level course sizes more than three times as big as the average private school. Ofqual’s data showed that 49% of entries by students at private schools in England received an A grade or above, compared with 20% awarded to students at state academies or comprehensive schools.  Natalie Perera, executive director of the Education Policy Institute, said: “There are early signs that the results process may have had a disproportionately negative impact on the most disadvantaged students. It is crucial that we establish whether this is the case as new data emerges.” Sammy Wright, a member of the government’s Social Mobility Commission and the vice-principal of Southmoor Academy in Sunderland, said: “The Social Mobility Commission believes the process of calculating grades for these students has led to significant unfairness. We therefore call on Ofqual to allow every school to submit whole-school appeals using their own evidence where they see fit, and not only in exceptional circumstances. “We recognise that allocating grades this year has been a uniquely difficult task. But we see that there are many inequalities in the process.” A string of headteachers were also joining the protest, including the headteacher of Sir William Borlase’s grammar school, a leading state school in Buckinghamshire, who said she was “bitterly disappointed that the system has let many of our students down”. “We will challenge this decision to ensure students from our school and students from schools across the area and country receive the results they deserve,” Kay Mountfield, the school’s head, said. But the day did include many high points for pupils, especially those who gained from Ofqual’s allocation of more A* and As, with girls overtaking boys in gaining the top grades in England. Brampton Manor Academy, a state school in east London with a highly selective sixth form, was celebrating its pupils securing 47 confirmed places at Oxford and Cambridge, up from 39 last year. Ian Bauckham, an Ofqual board member, said results were up “across the board”, including for disadvantaged candidates. “Any statistical model, however well intentioned it is and however good the overall outcomes are, is going to produce anomalies,” he said.",education
"A sharp rise in students applying to UK universities through clearing – months later than the traditional admissions cycle – is paving the way for the biggest-ever scramble for places, with A-level results this week set to become a “pressure cooker” day, experts have warned. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) has predicted a record 80,000 students will find places through the clearing process this summer, up from 73,325 last year. Clare Marchant, its chief executive, says that it will “probably [be] the busiest yet”. Once the last-ditch option for students who had received poorer grades than expected, the weeks-long clearing process traditionally matches students who have failed to make it on their chosen course with a university that still has places unfilled. Amid uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic this year, including cancelled gap years due to travel restrictions, the number of students who have applied to enter university directly through clearing – instead of via Ucas in late 2019 or early 2020 – has risen by 22% to reach 8,670 compared with this time last year, Ucas statistics showed. Exams were cancelled in England and Scotland this summer as a result of Covid-19, and teachers were asked to supply predicted grades and pupil rankings, which were then moderated using a statistical model designed to ensure consistency. There was outrage after the system resulted in nearly a quarter of recommended results in Scotland being downgraded. English A-level pupils are set to see even greater net downgrades of nearly 40%, the Guardian revealed on Friday. Clearing has been growing in popularity as students wait to receive their grades before making choices and universities make more places available, including on 4,516 courses at 17 of the elite Russell Group universities. This year clearing opened on 6 July for students who don’t hold an offer to a university and will be available to all students on A-level results day, Thursday 13 August.  It is likely to be especially popular this year as school-leavers are looking to avoid entering the job market during the coronavirus economic downturn. Several universities, including Leeds Beckett and London Metropolitan, said they are seeing an increase in applications directly to their university from students who already have A-levels. Ucas reported a late surge in applications before the end of the main admissions cycle on 30 June, dispelling fears that students would be reluctant to study online and would take gap years or find jobs instead of going to university this year. Experts warned that the late application surge, cancelled gap years and few deferrals could lead to an especially chaotic day for school-leavers when they receive their A-level results. There could be fierce competition for places if English results mirror the downgraded results in Scottish highers, meaning students could fall short of their university offer conditions. Mark Corver, an admissions expert and founder of dataHE, predicted a panicked “pressure cooker” this year. “We would read [the increase in direct to clearing applications] as another signal – along with the strong January to June applications, and fewer withdrawing – that the system is running hot. There is evidence of demand and there is probably going to be a shortage of places for UK students. Calculated grades, which will inevitably give wrong results for some, simply adds more pressure,” he said. Gary Davies, pro vice-chancellor at London Metropolitan, said that last year over 60% of the students his university recruited during clearing did not apply during the main admissions cycle. Many applied directly to the university, bypassing the Ucas process entirely. “Higher education has traditionally been a port in a storm during a recession, because people think if there aren’t jobs around, let’s go to uni,” said Davies. Universities including Greenwich and Leeds Beckett said they have seen substantial increases in the number of students already holding an offer who have registered to be fast-tracked when clearing places become available on A-level results day. Chris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, said: “We’ve been seeing for the last three to four years that applications have been moving later, and there are more applications that come in after the Ucas deadline.” The University of East Anglia’s academic director of admissions, Richard Harvey, said that direct-to-clearing appeals to students as it is less stressful than the main admissions, and can result in better outcomes. “It’s a hassle to apply – all that visiting campuses. If there are plenty of places then why rush?”",education
"One day after school in January this year, Isabelle walked to the high street in East Grinstead, West Sussex, where her mother works in a shop selling gifts and clothes. She was with her boyfriend, Alex, who would be meeting her mum for the first time. “It kind of took her by surprise a bit,” Isabelle says, remembering the awkwardness of the moment. When that was over, Isabelle sprang another surprise: a few hours earlier she had received an offer to read Earth sciences at Oxford University. “Mum gave me a big hug,” says Isabelle, who is now 18. “She was absolutely over the moon for me.” That evening, Isabelle made herself pasta for dinner and sat down to think about it. Over the past month she had convinced herself that she wouldn’t get into Oxford, and that she didn’t belong there anyway. She remembered the terrible night after her first interview, sitting in a college room in tears, feeling like an impostor. But now, with an offer letter sitting on the table, she started to have a change of heart. She was going to be the first person in her extended family to go to university, and this was an offer from one of the best universities in the world. “I thought, I’ve got to do it,” she says. Late that night she sent me an email about how she was feeling. “It hasn’t really sunk in yet, to be honest,” she wrote. “But I’m pleased.” Isabelle and I first met in March last year at Sackville school, the West Sussex comprehensive she attended from the age of 11. The school is close to where I grew up, and for the past year and a half I have been mentoring students there, trying to help them get into Oxford, Cambridge, University College London and other leading universities. It started as a casual offer of help to my local school and went on to become an all-consuming project – the thing my friends would ask about first when I saw them, and a challenge that has given me more satisfaction than any story I’ve written as a journalist. High-achieving students at state schools like Sackville often lose out in the battle for places at the most selective universities. The application process is supposed to uncover talent and potential, but often seems designed to reward traits such as confidence and polish, handing a significant advantage to applicants whose parents went to university, and whose school knows the subtleties of a good application, often due to decades or even centuries of experience. In the case of many private schools, knowing how to convert great A-levels into places at elite universities is the reason they can charge such high fees. When I first met Isabelle and her schoolmates, I had just moved home to live with my mother, after my father died suddenly in late 2018. Dad had lived in this area all his life, and when I was growing up he volunteered to help dig various local institutions out of financial difficulty, including a school and a community farm. Helping out at Sackville provided a distraction from my grief, and felt like the kind of civic-minded thing he would do. Added to that, three generations of my relatives have gone to Sackville, since my grandparents settled in this corner of West Sussex as Jewish Czech refugees in the 1940s. These included two aunts, a bunch of cousins and, currently, my cousin’s 12-year-old daughter. If you are passing through East Grinstead on your way to Lewes or Brighton, you might spot Sackville, crouching behind some high hedges just before the town gives way to fields and villages. It is probably what many people picture when they think of a comprehensive: cheerless 1960s buildings, well over a thousand students, and some very average A-level results, literally: the school’s average A-level grade is a C, which is the national average. It performs above average at GCSE and is rated “Good” by Ofsted; but its sixth form isn’t selective, and around four out of every five students have parents who didn’t go to university. In recent years, Sackville’s deputy headteacher, Adrian De Souza, had become frustrated that too few of his best sixth-formers were getting places at leading universities. “We talked about it a lot,” he says. “We had the feeling there was something we weren’t doing.” No Sackville student had gone to Oxford or Cambridge since 2013, despite plenty of them having good enough grades – including some who got interviews but didn’t get places. The proportion of school leavers going to the most sought-after Russell Group universities was also disappointing. De Souza is a preternaturally warm and engaging teacher, who seems to have a running in-joke with every second student we pass in Sackville’s corridors. He felt that, as the resources at his disposal have been squeezed (spending per pupil in England has fallen 8% in real terms since 2009-10), it was becoming harder to compete with the private sector. The six-year Oxbridge dry spell was only a part of the problem, but it was symbolic. De Souza went to Bristol University, and knows that this country’s obsession with Oxbridge borders on the perverse. But he also thinks that what’s possible for students at the local private schools should be possible for his students, too. (Disclaimer: I went to one of these private schools, and to Cambridge University.) At one point in my first meeting at the school, Isabelle was waved in – a confident girl wearing black jeans and white Converse trainers, with wavy blond hair that she dyes a reasonably convincing ginger. After being introduced, she asked me what she could do to prepare for an application to Oxford and other prestigious universities like Imperial, Manchester and UCL. I didn’t have a good answer ready, but later that night I emailed friends who had also studied at Cambridge. I asked them all: what would you tell her? “Interview training is imperative,” replied a friend who now works in the City of London. “If you have never been in a situation where someone is challenging your intellect/interest/whole identity, such a massive part of it is just retaining your cool.” Others offered tips about preparatory reading, or emphasised the importance of making sure the students have the confidence to apply in the first place. A few weeks later, Sackville’s head of sixth form, Helen Valentine, assembled 10 of her highest-achieving year 12s, including Isabelle. They sat in front of me around a U shape of desks in a computer room, wearing casual clothes and chatting among themselves. For those who wanted to apply for Oxford or Cambridge, or to study medicine, the deadline was about six months away. These students became known among teachers as the “Oxbridge group”, but everything we were doing was supposed to work for Bristol, Durham and all the other Russell Group universities they were applying to at the same time. I told them I would try to give them something approximating the support students from private schools get. We would meet every week or two to talk about their subjects. They seemed receptive, but didn’t ask any questions. I tried to project confidence about the whole thing, because I knew how important a commodity confidence was going to be. But naturally, I also had some doubts. If you want a place at one of Britain’s top universities, you need to beat a lot of very well-prepared, expensively educated young people to get it. A recent report showed that almost half the schools that teach the most privileged 20% of students in the country – mostly private schools and grammars – have at least one dedicated “university adviser”. St Paul’s in London has 12 teachers who are trained as “UK university advisers” and nine staff who act as “counsellors and support staff for US university applications”, according to the school’s website. And if wealthy parents aren’t content with what their school is giving them, they often top it up with private tutors. “Parents normally say, ‘I need someone who has graduated from that course in the past few years,’” the head of a leading tutoring agency in London tells me. “If you are applying for PPE at Oxford, we will find tutors who have done that course.” A new book, Social Mobility And Its Enemies, calls this “education’s dark side” and argues that parents are engaging in an “ever-escalating educational arms race”. Lee Elliot Major, the book’s co-author and a professor of social mobility at Exeter University, tells me that in an increasingly complex admissions process, there are big advantages for applicants who know “the rules of the game” – including the subtle art of tailoring your personal statement. It goes without saying that most state schools don’t have the time or resources to offer this kind of preparation. A school like Sackville gets £4,000 a year to educate each member of its sixth form, a small fraction of most private school fees. Teachers spend most of their time teaching or preparing for class. “Teachers could go and learn the rules of the game at various careers conferences,” says Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, “but do they have time? The conferences I speak at are full of private-school teachers, often ones who are dedicated to uni preparation.” The result is that entry to the most sought-after universities is utterly dominated by private schools, and a narrow group of state schools that are either highly selective, or have a long tradition of getting students into elite universities, or both. Admissions data obtained by the Guardian from Oxford and Cambridge under freedom of information laws illustrates this clearly. Both universities made about half of their undergraduate offers to state school students in the past few years, with the remainder split roughly evenly between private school and overseas applicants. But the vast majority of the state school offers – more than two-thirds – went to just 300 schools. These schools represent the highest-performing 10% of state schools in the country and are mostly grammar schools, highly selective sixth-form colleges or academies in wealthy areas. They average around five Cambridge offers a year, and four from Oxford, so have plenty of experience in getting the best students in. Students from the remaining 90% of state schools – roughly 2,700 – get significantly fewer Oxbridge offers. On average, students from these schools, which include most regular comprehensives like Sackville, get an offer from Cambridge once every four years, and an offer from Oxford every five years. And before anyone dismisses this disparity on the grounds that these schools aren’t applying: the figures show that at least one student at most of this country’s schools and colleges applies to Oxford or Cambridge every year. When top universities boast about their state school intakes, it’s easy to forget this silent majority of frozen-out schools, where the students who get in are statistical outliers. Or, as one of my friends put it when I worked out the figures: “That’s a pretty sad state of affairs for anything resembling a meritocracy.” And when it comes to university applications, failure begets failure, according to Sir Peter Lampl, founder of social mobility charity the Sutton Trust. “It’s hard for state schools to gear up, because they only get one student in every five years,” he says. That isn’t a bad description of what had been happening at Sackville. The daunting challenge was to help the school jump from the forgotten 90% into the tiny elite. When she was in year 8, Isabelle remembers telling three friends that she wanted to study science at Oxford. She was half joking, half dreaming, she says. “It didn’t seem real, to be honest. It was very much something that people like me didn’t do.” Five years later, Isabelle and those three friends were all in our little group, including Lucy, applying to study English at Cambridge. Also in the group was Eren, a tall, unflappable young man who spends his weekends either working at a garden centre or climbing sheer rock faces. He grew up in Croydon, south London, before his parents moved to Sussex (his father works in construction and his mother is a yoga teacher). He has a similar memory to Isabelle: aged 13, he told a girl sitting next to him in science class, “I want to do physics at Cambridge”, but remembers thinking, “That’s not really going to happen, is it?” There were definitely times in my months working with the students when it felt as if it wasn’t going to happen. My notes for the early meetings sometimes just say: “Didn’t email” or “Didn’t come”. I was spending a lot of my time just persuading a few of the students that they were good enough. Eren says the school’s track record played on his mind. “For however many years, no one got in [to Oxbridge], so you think there must be a pretty good reason for that.” After a month or two, though, I started to have a good feeling about the students. They had the kind of work ethic and grades that top universities expect, and they seemed to enjoy the challenge we had been set. I told them to treat getting into university like a mini extra A-level: something that requires a bit of work every week, reading interesting articles about their chosen subjects, and learning how to talk about what they had read when we met. Ayo, Sackville’s head boy and one of its best footballers, whose parents had come to England from Nigeria when he was small, prepared for his application to Stanford in California by reading longform articles about economics. Lucy read lesser-known short stories by F Scott Fitzgerald and made interesting connections between them. Eren had been reading fairly advanced books about physics since he was a teenager, and just needed reminding that mentioning them in his application was a good idea. Sometimes our sessions were about sharpening the students’ thoughts, or picking them up if someone or something had knocked their confidence. As last spring turned into summer, my Tuesday morning volunteering gig was occupying more of my thoughts. I would email ideas to De Souza and Valentine at 1am, while watching Netflix. I used my group chat of university friends to answer questions about courses, colleges and future careers. Two of them took a day off work to do practice interviews, meeting the students one by one. At the end of each interview, I could hear them give the same pep talk: we think you’re good enough for this, so believe in yourself. When I visited the school, De Souza, Valentine and I would sit in Valentine’s office next to the sixth-form study room at lunchtime, drinking coffee and making plans. It had become a team effort that energised a handful of staff, and it was exciting. We felt these kids were going to do well, and they deserved to. The teachers had worked with most of the students for half a decade, and they deserved it, too. On a beautiful, sunny day in June, my former tutor at Cambridge agreed to show the students around the university. He gave them tips for their applications, and subjected me to a rapid-fire mock interview in his office to show the students what their own interviews might be like. On the bus back, the pupils chatted about Love Island, debating who was more of a snake, Maura or Mollie-Mae. I wasn’t sure how they would respond to the visit, but looking back, Valentine says it was a turning point. “They felt they had a really good chance,” she says. “There were no more tears and drama after that. We felt that something was in our grasp, that something special could happen this year.” Eren says it was the visit that convinced him to apply: it had made an unrealistic prospect seem real. Around the time that the Sackville students were putting the final touches to their applications, Dr Marchella Ward, the outreach fellow at Worcester College, Oxford, was challenging her colleagues with a radical proposal. Ward, whose job it is to attract a wider cohort of students to the college, wanted to make this year’s intake – the ones starting their courses this month – “genuinely representative”. She resolved that the students who got offers from Worcester should look like the students nationwide who achieve AAA and above at A-level, in terms of their schools and economic backgrounds. That meant persuading the college’s admissions tutors to focus on how they were assessing potential in students; to figure out why they were admitting a lot of privileged candidates. One of the key areas they looked at was personal statements – the one-page sales pitch that every applicant has to submit via the Ucas system. As all 21 university advisers at St Paul’s know, there is a particular skill to writing a personal statement for an elite university. It involves a certain type of showing off: talking about a 1971 lecture you came across by a Nobel prize-winning chemist; or linking something you studied at A-level to a review you read in the Times Literary Supplement (which you most definitely did not come across at school). Making those kinds of references suggests to admissions tutors that you are a highly engaged, impressively self-directed learner who will thrive at universities where embracing the specific and the obscure is a way of life.  It’s the oldest trick in the book, and Ward wanted her college to stop falling for it. She felt strongly that the college was missing out on outstanding students in favour of ones who were better coached. “It was about asking tutors to think really hard about what it was that was making them impressed,” she says. “We’ve got to be thinking carefully about why we think potential looks that way.” When it came to targets, Ward wanted Worcester to move away from thinking about simple binary metrics like state or private school, which she says can always be gamed. Instead she asked her colleagues to pay particular attention to a new dashboard of “contextual” data, provided by the university to its colleges about all Oxford applicants, which ranked every student by factors like what percentage of their school is on free school meals. “It’s about assessing potential in a way that takes all sorts of advantage into account,” she tells me. By mid-January this year, we knew our efforts at Sackville had paid off. Every student in our group had offers from universities such as Durham, Imperial, LSE, Edinburgh, Manchester and UCL. And then, while I was driving along the motorway on a grey and drizzly morning, I saw an email from Valentine: Isabelle had an offer to read Earth sciences at Oxford – with grades of A*AA. And Grace, another of our applicants, had been accepted by Oxford to study geography, having taken her A-levels last year. I pulled into the next service station, sat down in a Starbucks to read it again, and messaged my friends Shyam and Frankie, who since doing the practice interviews had become almost as invested as me. I punched the air several times, and worried that the man at the next table would see I had tears in my eyes. Valentine was on a school trip in Hamburg with Sackville’s headteacher, Julian Grant. “I can only describe it as like an election night, when you’re sitting up waiting for the seats to come in,” she remembers. “I realised it meant an awful lot to very many of us.” She kept refreshing her phone, watching Ucas Track, the website where university offers show up, until the news came through that both Lucy and Eren had offers from Cambridge. “We really felt very proud for the school,” Valentine says. “There was a feeling of elation, first and foremost, for the students, and for you, and for ourselves as well.” Eren got his offer to study natural sciences at Cambridge via email on his phone first thing in the morning, feeling “as psyched as you can be when you’ve just woken up”. He put a screenshot on his family WhatsApp group. “I think my mum replied first – she was quite chuffed. I think she just said, ‘Well done’, and probably made a joke about posh people.” His dad called him from his office. “He was crying a bit. He said he had told all his friends from work.” Ayo was offered a place at Stanford, majoring in economics. The final list of offers felt almost unreal; overall, twice as many Sackville students as the year before had offers from Russell Group universities. What does it prove? “I think the interesting thing about your story is that it puts a big question mark over the admission practices of these universities,” says Nick Hillman, who was an adviser to the former universities minister David Willetts. “The kids who got in, Oxbridge obviously thinks are good enough. And previously Oxbridge would never have found out about them.” Duncan Exley, former director of the Equality Trust, says he isn’t surprised, either. He points out that social mobility charities like the Brilliant Club, Into University and the Sutton Trust have shown “measurable results” from mentoring talented state school students. But that support is unevenly spread. One of the people interviewed in Exley’s new book, The End of Aspiration? Social Mobility And Our Children’s Fading Prospects, told him: “If you are a kid in Tower Hamlets, you are practically chased down the street by social mobility charities. But in rural Norfolk, there is nobody.” Marchella Ward’s efforts at Worcester also bore fruit. She says 83% of the college’s offers went to state school students and 20% went to students from areas with low progress rates into higher education, both comfortably above the percentages from those groups who get AAA or above. Several Oxford colleges have asked her to explain how she did it. After thousands of A-level students were downgraded in this year’s exam fiasco, Worcester was the first Oxbridge college to say it would honour its existing offers. Between Sackville and Worcester, you have two different approaches to solving the problem of access to our most selective universities. You either teach a lot more students the rules of the game – or you change those rules. Some people, like Elliot Major, support sending trained advisers into every school, paid for by the government. Ward says that’s fine as a stopgap until universities get better at assessing potential rather than coaching and polish. “Let’s do that as long as we have to. But as universities, let’s make that time as short as possible,” she says. The independent Office for Students, which regulates universities, has been running a consultation on changes to the application process; proposals include scrapping personal statements, and the system of applying for university before you get your results. But this has been paused during the pandemic. All of the Sackville group ended up with the grades they needed, despite the flawed A-level algorithm. Isabelle is in various WhatsApp groups with other students who held offers from Oxford, which lit up with emotional messages when people lost their places on results day. “Some people missed their grades by one, and others were getting Cs and Ds,” she says. Some got their places back, after the government U-turn, or on appeal. Those who didn’t left the group chats. Of course, none of us had any idea how strange and disrupted their university experience would turn out be. Ayo is beginning his Stanford degree remotely, and Eren says he has “accepted it’s going be different”. One of the students I spoke to recently isn’t too upset about the cancellation of freshers’ week (“I’m sure we will have plenty of fun on the sly”), but says it is “demoralising to have worked so hard and be paying so much for this ‘world-class education’ via Zoom”. She is resigned to a compromised first year, but hopes it will improve afterwards.  The students applying for university next year have to submit their applications by 15 October if they are applying to study medicine, veterinary science, dentistry, or want to go to Oxford or Cambridge. Many have missed out on a huge chunk of lessons, particularly at state schools. There are well-founded fears that students at private schools and those with private tutors will have an even greater advantage this year. A study by UCL’s Institute of Education found that while 31% of private schools provided four or more live online lessons per day during lockdown, that was the case for only 6% of state schools. Eren says he now wonders about all the other state schools that don’t send many or any students to Oxbridge. A couple of times he told me about his old school in Croydon, an underperforming comprehensive. His old school mates have struggled to get the places they wanted. “If you go to a school that hasn’t given you all the opportunities that you can have, it’s going to be way harder for you,” he says. “I think there’s a loss of talent and intelligence. It’s just a waste of people.” ",education
"When you applied to university, you probably imagined spending hours in the library surrounded by friends, or rocking up to your halls late at night and falling into bed. Chances are you’re going to be spending more time in your own room than you first thought, so it’s essential to make sure your study space works for you. “Studying online gives you more control over where you study,” says Aidan Moloney, wellbeing service manager at the University of Law. “It helps to consider how and where you work, the type of task and the level of concentration needed. Things to bear in mind might include, how long the study session will take, where it will be done, what resources you need, what you want to achieve, how you’ll make your goal achievable and how you’ll record your study.” Experts suggest taking short screen breaks often, rather than longer ones less frequently. Aim to have five to 10 minutes in every hour away from your screen. Also consider ways to get the information or interaction you need without logging on – you could print off reading materials or phone a friend to test each other’s knowledge. It’s also a good idea to work no longer than six hours on-screen every day. How your screen and desk are set up is also important. Hunching over a laptop on your bed might be OK now and again but doing so long-term could cause back and neck problems. Also think about what motivates you. “The advantage of online learning is that you literally don’t need to go anywhere, just open your laptop and go to all your lectures. But if you’re staying in bed you’ll still be in chill mode and won’t properly engage with the lesson,” advises 22-year-old University of Gloucestershire MA student Lauren Fletcher. Studies have shown that standing desks improve health markers and even boost productivity – you can buy a cardboard version for about £20. Otherwise, try and use a separate keyboard and mouse so your laptop can be put on a stand and your screen opened at eye level, with your lower arms perpendicular to your body and your feet on the floor. Though you want to be as productive as possible in your workspace, it’s worth remembering this is also likely to be where you relax, so fill it with things that bring you joy. Research suggests that plants may reduce psychological and physiological stress, so consider filling your room with leafy greens.",education
"My friend and colleague Mark Ormrod, who has died of cancer aged 62, was professor of medieval history at the University of York and a prolific scholar who helped to change the school history curriculum, creating content focusing on the history of immigration.  In 2011 he published a groundbreaking biography of Edward III, whose reign from 1327 until 1377 was particularly long and eventful, encompassing the Black Death and wars with France. Mark’s study combined unrivalled knowledge of unpublished archives with the ability to address difficult subjects with clarity and verve. This was just one of more than 100 publications.  Mark’s dedication to writing was indefatigable, even after he fell ill. In 2020 alone two new monographs were delivered to the publishers, together with a volume of essays he co-edited: Migrants in Medieval England, which reflects his commitment to interdisciplinary scholarship. Mark was born in Neath, Wales, to David Ormrod, a horological engineer, and his wife, Margaret (nee Billings), a housewife. He was educated at Neath boys’ grammar school and then took a degree in history at King’s College London, graduating with a first in 1979. He later did a DPhil at Oxford. In 1984 he took a lecturing position at the University of Sheffield and then at Queen’s University, Belfast, and Cambridge. He arrived at York in 1990 as a lecturer and was appointed professor of medieval history in 1995. At York Mark became director of the Centre for Medieval Studies, head of the Department of History and dean of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. Mark was an enthusiastic supporter of the York Festival of Ideas, which was launched in 2011 and became an annual event. He served as general editor of the York Medieval Press. In 2013 Mark was instrumental in the creation of a doctoral training centre, the White Rose College for the Arts and Humanities, which is shared with the universities of Leeds and Sheffield. He also built a lasting research partnership with the National Archives to ensure that their major series of government records were made available to the public online. The last of these projects, England’s Immigrants 1350-1550, with the Historical Association and the Runnymede Trust, contributed to changes in the national school curriculum in 2015, focusing on the long history of immigration in Britain. This work also led to the creation of the Runnymede Trust’s Our Migration Story, which won the Guardian Award for Research Impact in 2019. Above all Mark was committed to supporting younger scholars. He supervised more than 40 PhD students and research assistants, raising large grants for projects that supported their career development. His tolerance and good humour guided all that he did: for him kindness and cleverness were never incompatible. In 1995 he met Richard Dobson, a school adviser in maths. They entered into a civil partnership in 2006. Mark is survived by Richard and by his parents and his brothers, Nicholas and Jonathan. ",education
"Government plans to reopen all schools in September were called into question by leading scientists and the head of a major teaching union last night amid signs that cases of Covid-19 are increasing again at an alarming rate. Despite imposing new restrictions on people meeting indoors in parts of the north of England on Thursday – and postponing plans to allow bowling alleys, casinos, skating rinks and other venues to reopen a day later – ministers insist that reopening schools fully early next month remains a top priority. But in a sign of growing concern and uncertainty about the strategy, Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, which represents more than 300,000 teachers across the UK, said the government needed to take urgent action to convince parents and teachers that schools would be safe. While insisting he was not calling for a postponement, Roach told the Observer: “In light of recent changes to plans for relaxing lockdown measures, the government needs to provide greater clarity to school leaders, teachers and parents about what this will mean for the reopening of schools in September.” He added: “The warning from the chief medical officer [Chris Whitty] that a fine balance has to be struck in ensuring public health at this stage of the pandemic, and that the country may have reached the limits to the easing of lockdown, will no doubt prompt questions for many parents as well as for those working in schools. “If schools are to reopen safely, the government will need to give them clarification about what they need to do to take account of the latest scientific evidence and advice, as well as sufficient time to review and, if necessary, adjust their reopening plans.” Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it had become clear that there is a link between closing schools and controlling the spread of the virus. “The evidence is clear that schools are important in the spread of Covid-19,” he said. “Our studies show that, across Europe, closing schools was the single factor most strongly associated with drops in infection rates.” Hunter added that while individual risks to children and teachers were probably low, school transmission was likely to push up general infection rates, so the disease would rise exponentially again. “Would re-opening schools increase the spread of Covid-19 in the population? Yes. I think it would very probably do that.” The chairman of Sage’s sub-group on pandemic modelling, Graham Medley, said it could come down to a choice between reopening schools and shutting other venues such as pubs. “Most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households,” Medley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. However, he cited Whitty’s warning about the limits of reopening society. “So closing some other networks, some other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools,” Medley said. “It’s a matter of prioritising. Do we think pubs are more important than schools?” Virologist Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University, also warned about the risks of reopening schools as infection levels are rising. “We don’t yet understand whether children play a major role in transmission either to each other, or to the wider community, though we do know that they can be very good incubators and spreaders of viruses.” The fear is that infection rates will start to increase in autumn because coronaviruses are seasonal and levels peak in winter months, he added. “There is real concern now about how easy it will be to safely open schools without threatening the wider community. It may well be that there is a quid pro quo to be made and we have to stop going to pubs or restaurants. It is not just about educating children and preserving their mental health, after all. It’s also about allowing parents to go to work as well.” One concern for teachers is the wearing of face masks. While this is compulsory for children of 11 and over in shops and on public transport, the guidance is that masks are not necessary for pupils or teachers in schools. One union source said this “makes no sense at all”, adding that parents would justifiably query apparent inconsistencies in the rules. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission. This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.” Another DfE source said ministers remained committed to schools reopening, but added: “In the event of a local outbreak, Public Health England health protection team or local authority may advise a school or number of schools to close temporarily to help control transmission. Schools will need a contingency plan for this eventuality. This may involve a return to remaining open only for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers, and providing remote education for all other pupils.”",education
"Bedales school, in Hampshire, with its 120 acres and eclectic mix of old and modern buildings, boasts an array of impressive facilities. But it’s not your archetypal English private school. “We have always worked within the progressive tradition,” says Alistair McConville, the school’s director of innovation and learning. “We try really hard to build in ‘idling time’ and cultivate the appreciation of beauty.”  From the autumn term, Bedales will have a cross-disciplinary project on refugees; it also offers qualifications in baking and book-binding. In its outdoor work department students can rear sheep, pigs and chickens, renovate tractors and build polytunnels, and the school offers its own level 3 (A-level equivalent) qualification on living with the land. Its sixth-form timetable has been reshaped to adapt to findings on adolescent sleep science.  For decades, Bedales – whose motto, Head, Hand, Heart, is taken from the views of the Victorian radical philosopher and art critic John Ruskin – was viewed as the batty older relative of the independent schools, sticking to its alternative approach while the mainstream private sector kept its back straight, and its values traditional.  No longer. Today, an independent schools conference is as likely to discuss futurology as Latin. “There’s been a huge change in the educational approach of the private sector,” says Toby Seth, headteacher at the Pocklington school foundation in Yorkshire. “Why? Because schools have had to.” Employers, he says, want new and different skills, such as teamworking, not just the ability to retain facts. Seth recently held a “learning skills evening” for parents, demonstrating concept-mapping, effective note-taking and a variety of learning games. “Those parents who are employers told me ‘these are the skills I need. I am much less bothered about knowledge. I can train them up in that. What we can’t easily do is instil those fundamental people skills’.” He adds: “Trying to teach character feels just as important as anything to do with the curriculum. That’s what’s going to help our pupils succeed at university and into a good job. It’s those qualities – that grit – that are important.” Meanwhile Alleyn’s, a co-educational independent school in Dulwich, south London, is offering its own programme focusing on “curiosity, a lifelong pursuit of learning and the knowledge of ways in which it is done”, says Melanie Huntley, its head of marketing. Its students may explore gardening, mindfulness, relaxation and teamwork. “Students are encouraged to think about their own aspirations through heroes and characters in myths and literature, and in senior years to work on project-based active research.” This progressive shift shines a searching light on the current dominance of neo-traditionalism in the state sector, which dates back decades but found its apotheosis during Michael Gove’s stint as education secretary, from 2010-14.  In a 2013 speech titled The Progressive Betrayal, Gove praised the “liberating power of a traditional education” found, he said, in Britain’s private schools. He laid into what he judged to be the folly of moving “away from a set hierarchy of knowledge – literary canons, mathematical proofs, scientific laws, musical exercises and artistic traditions”. Gove’s traditional approach is seemingly shared by today’s education secretary, Gavin Williamson, who even wants children to sit in rows facing their teacher as a response to the pandemic. During the Gove era, free schools were opened on a traditionalist template, among them Toby Young’s West London free school and the Michaela school in Brent, north London, established by Katharine Birbalsingh and hailed as proof of the success of authoritarian approaches, particularly for poorer children. Birbalsingh is highly critical of current developments in the private sector. “They have got things shockingly wrong,” she says. “They now lag 20 years behind the state sector, which has ditched all that group and project-work stuff. They are resting on their laurels, relying on the cultural capital, the immersive learning culture, that affluent pupils from book-lined homes bring to their education.” She adds: “There are still some traditionalists left in private schools, 55-year-olds who are doing it the old way. Privately, they tell me how horrified they are at the progressive approaches of their senior leadership teams.” Of course, resources are at the heart of this issue. Bedales’ senior boarding fees are more than £37,000 a year. Michaela has an annual budget of £4,500 per pupil and students receive only two hours of art and music a week. Wouldn’t Birbalsingh love to add more creative pursuits to her curriculum if she had the money? “Knowledge is creativity,” she insists. “The radical educationalists of today are the traditionalists, providing a knowledge-based education for the disadvantaged. I don’t have time for shearing sheep.” But Diane Reay, emeritus professor of education at Cambridge University, argues that double standards are in play. “Progressive is such a slippery term, which has been used and abused within English education. “In the private sector, given their resources, it can be viewed as a positive development, helping to provide a broader, richer blend, creativity as an add-on to academic education. But in the state sector, progressive education has wrongly been represented as holding children back, wrongly associated with over-permissive and inexperienced younger teachers and seen as getting in the way of powerful knowledge and high achievement.” While ministers actively promote traditionalism, David Price, author of a forthcoming book, The Power of Us: how we connect, act and innovate together, says many state schools are afraid to innovate. Price trains teachers in project-based learning and holds parental engagement workshops all over the world. “Many international schools are doing mindblowing things, really preparing kids for the future. And in the UK, private schools have shown an interest, although there is always that worry about sacrificing the bottom line: results. But it’s much harder for the state sector. There’s a lot of fear out there.” Things might be starting to shift. In recent years, a few state schools have successfully bucked the traditionalist trend, including Peter Hyman’s School 21 in Newham, east London, which places oracy at the heart of its curriculum, and XP school, Doncaster, a free school that promotes “expeditionary learning”. Its project-based approach has yielded “outstanding” Ofsted ratings across the board, with excellent GCSE results and a highly engaged and confident pupil body. Other schools have quietly adopted more innovative methods, including greater interdisciplinary learning and team work. More generally, there’s a rising discontent within state education at a “drill and kill” approach that feels particularly inappropriate during the Covid crisis. According to Reay, “The UK is already at the top of the international league tables for routine memorisation, teaching to the test, and at the bottom for collaborative and critical thinking. Yet research shows that you don’t just get better teaching and learning if you undertake collaborative group work, you get better outcomes.” Price believes the pandemic is bringing us to a decisive moment. “We’ve had 30 years of compliance in the state sector, but we now have to get beyond test scores and targets, learn from the courage being shown by some of our school leaders. Now is the time to rally the sector – and parents – behind a different approach.”",education
"Turning your hobby into a job isn’t always an active hustle. Sometimes, you just turn around one day and realise that that’s what you’re doing. This was what the journey towards becoming a professional journalist was like for me. I started writing towards the end of sixth form, when I was really getting into my English A-level and wanted to start creating as well as critiquing. Back then, I was mostly dabbling in (bad) poetry. With this little bit of experience, I landed a volunteer role at an arts and literature journal on my year out, which is when I first fell in love with editing. I loved how creative, interactive and feedback-based the job was – as well as the fact that the work was remote, so it fitted flexibly around the travelling I was doing that year. When I got to university, I became curious about journalism and opinion-writing. This was during the big personal essay boom that swept the blogosphere in the mid-2010s, and there were quite a few fledgling new-media platforms being started up by people of a similar age to me. Many of these had a slant towards underrepresented issues such as race and feminism, and I gravitated towards online zines like Rookie (founded by teenager Tavi Gevinson), Black Ballad (aimed at black British women), and gal-dem (platforming the perspectives of women and non-binary people of colour).  I didn’t have much academic or professional expertise, but I had my own lived experiences – so I started pitching opinion pieces about my experience as a woman of colour. I found that getting your first piece published was the biggest hurdle; after that, editors know that they can trust you, and understand what you can do – and the offers started rolling in. With a proper portfolio under my belt, in the summer of my second year at uni, I landed a work experience placement at the Guardian. In my final year of university, I was becoming invested in the issue of mental health, and decided to start up my own magazine called Blueprint, which explored student mental health in Cambridge. This gave me invaluable experience of acting as editor-in-chief of a magazine – and I loved seeing how it genuinely started important conversations about mental health on campus. I was also doing some student activism around race issues at university, and started writing about that too. By the time I graduated, I had two key areas of real journalistic expertise – race and mental health. This led me to an editing role at gal-dem, and saw me start writing for the Guardian regularly about the topics I’d become well versed in. It was at this point in the game when I realised I’d done it – I was a freelance journalist who was being paid for their work, writing nationally on issues I was passionate about. As I left university, I had a solid CV which led me to a job at HuffPost, and a paid position at gal-dem, when it got set up as a real business. Recounting my progress, it looks like a long journey, but I genuinely enjoyed every step of the way. If I had a few pieces of advice for this point in your life – I would say grab hold of every opportunity that comes your way, do what you are passionate about, and fake it till you make it.",education
"Noah Jones, 18, aims to study psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. “It’s the perfect uni for me. It’s right on my doorstep and the course is what I’ve always wanted to do,” he says. But since Covid-19, he’s questioning his decision. “The lack of information has taken its toll and I feel stressed before I’ve even arrived. I’m thinking about going into the care sector instead,” he says. Other prospective students have similar concerns. “I’m mostly worried I won’t get that cliche first-year experience,” says 18-year-old Hannah Carr*, who was hoping to study business at the University of Liverpool. “Events like freshers’ week help with making friends and the possibility we may have to start university as online classes is a daunting one. Imagine not being able to see the faces of the other people on your course for possibly months?” Three years is a long time and many students are anxious about investing in a university experience that is not going to be the one they were expecting. In the ordinary world, if you were having doubts, the advice would have been to get some work experience or go abroad and figure out what to do. But with the jobs market likely to be in a difficult state for some time, are you better off gaining new skills? And is uni the only way to do this? Although practical roles such as plumbers, electricians and carers have been some of the least affected by coronavirus, experts advise looking at the bigger picture. “We are likely to see a shift towards automation and jobs that allow remote working will be safer,” advises Manuel Souto-Otero, professor in social sciences at Cardiff University. “You need to take a long-term view on possible career pathways.” Others agree. “In comparison to a humanities degree, vocational jobs have improved their standing. But in comparison to maths? I doubt it,” says Christopher Rauh, an economics lecturer at the University of Cambridge. The greatest demand for jobs at the moment is in IT, science and teaching, but there are other options. Rauh says that although the crisis is terrible, it will bring some entrepreneurial opportunities. “A lot of companies won’t survive, but there’s room for innovation and people will be looking for new solutions,” he says. “Any startup that needs a lot of funding will have problems but interest rates will be low, so it could be a time to try things out. Retail space is going to get cheaper and old factories will be empty.” Others say if you want to be really strategic, take six months and learn to code. “There aren’t a lot of growth areas at the moment, but IT is one of them,” says Raph Mokades, founder of Rare, a recruitment agency for ethnic minority graduates. He thinks writing code is lockdown-proof. “All you need is a laptop and the internet and you’re away.” Coding bootcamps are one way to do this and most have moved online. Rifke Sadleir, a coder who works with brands such as Converse and Dazed, says since the pandemic started, everyone’s been forced to go digital and there’s huge demand for coders. “You can get involved on platforms such as Instagram and online workshops allow people to learn at their own pace,” she says. Ultimately, university doesn’t make sense for everyone, especially if it’s studying just for the sake of putting off making a decision about your career. Whatever happens, in the post-Covid-19 world, transferable skills will likely become more important. “Research your options and follow your heart when making life-changing decisions,” advises Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute. *Name changed on request",education
"Student finances might not be what you expect as we adjust to the changing post-covid landscape. With student fees expected to stay the same, there is still financial support for clearing students. It’s especially important to first think about your wellbeing. The pandemic will mean lots of students’ situations will have changed – including financially. “You’ve got to decide what is the best learning environment for you. We’ve been living in lockdown, and if you’re going in September, will you be able to cope with being away from home?” asks Ruki Heritage, the University of Bedfordshire’s director of student experience. What and where you study will affect your finances. Can you commute or will you live on campus? And if you live at home, what costs will that entail? UK students coming via clearing apply for loans in the same way, but switching courses may affect your application – where you live and study changes your maintenance loan. The tuition loan is standard, but the maintenance loan depends on household income. In Wales, all students get the same amount, but a higher family income means it’s more of a repayable loan than a grant. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, it’s a mix of grant and loan, depending on your parents’ income. In England, the higher the income, the lower the loan. These calculations imply that the government expects help from the bank of mum and dad, if it’s available, so make sure you have honest conversations with parents or caregivers. The student loans website has a student finance calculator, and MoneySavingExpert has built one to work out how much parents need to contribute to fill the gap. “The average parental contribution is £130-140 a month,” says Heritage. “But if parents can’t afford this, the lower the income the bigger the student loan.” When you apply for a student loan, you provide household income from the previous tax year, but if for any reason – including Covid-19 – it is at least 15% lower this year, you can give these income details, which could mean a bigger maintenance loan. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, says that the price tag of university is almost irrelevant. “Too few consider the greater practical challenge of how to afford to live while studying, and then there’s the hidden parental contribution,” he says. “Too many are put off by the high price tag on tuition fees, and the overall ‘debt’ figure they’re left with, which bears little resemblance to what they repay.” You’ll only start repaying the loan once you earn more than £26,575 a year (the current threshold). Check out uni advice services – there may be scholarships, grants or bursaries to apply for, that are still accessible through clearing, and some charities, councils and businesses offer funds. If you’re looking for part-time work while you study, the university’s careers and employability service can advise on what work may be available. Shireen Ahmed, 22, a final-year business school student at the University of Bedfordshire, explains how her two student roles help pay her way through studies I felt it was essential for me to get a job. I have a tuition and maintenance loan, but I still have to worry about my living standards – every student needs equipment and books. Even though I live with my parents, I believe that financially taking care of yourself is a learning process in life, and situations change, so you never know exactly what could happen. At university I’ve had two main jobs: as a student ambassador, where I welcome students to university and help answer any questions; and one on the marketing team of the students’ union. I’ve been a student ambassador for years, but financially it was a bit of a struggle at times. Even though it was a part-time role, it was only really once a month, and got busier around times like the clearing process. I decided to join another team to help my finances. I became a marketing adviser for the students’ union, working on all sorts of campaigns. By taking this job, I felt a greater sense of being part of the university and the student bubble, which is important for me as I live at home. The work was related to my course in project management, and my manager got me involved in other activities to see how the university runs projects and events. This experience helped me launch my own event for this year’s International Women’s Day, a conference to raise awareness for gender equality. These jobs have helped me both financially and as a person, as I’ve built confidence and met new people from different backgrounds. I’m meeting lots of new students as an ambassador, and they recognise me when I’m walking by. That’s really nice, as it feels like I’ve managed to help someone. I’ve gained a lot of skills and abilities – that’s the best benefit about it. I used to be a very shy person and used to sit there thinking “I can’t do it”, but slowly I started learning you can do something if you put your mind to it.",education
"The government has been accused of having “its head in the sand” over next year’s GCSE and A-level exams, as headteachers complain that amendments do not go far enough to mitigate for the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. England’s exams regulator, Ofqual, published the outcome of its consultation on how GCSEs and A-levels will be assessed in 2021, and despite widespread objections by teaching unions to earlier proposals, they say it remains “business as usual” with content largely unchanged. In one concession, GCSE students taking English literature exams next summer will no longer have to cover all of the topics in the curriculum and will be offered a choice of subjects in their exam papers. Ofqual also confirmed that pupils sitting their history and ancient history GCSEs next summer will be offered a greater choice of subjects at examination. School leaders and teaching unions said the latest amendments did not go far enough. Ofqual is still to decide whether to delay the 2021 summer exams to allow for more teaching time following the disruption caused by the pandemic. The consultation had proposed delaying the start of the GCSE exam series to 7 June 2021, after the half-term break, but the watchdog said it was still working with the government and the exam boards to consider the best approach. “While there was general support for a delay to the exams to allow more time for teaching, respondents were less positive about this if it meant a potential delay to results,” it said. Amanda Brown, the deputy general secretary at the National Education Union, said the government had its “head in the sand” and called for content to be reduced in other subjects. “The government is going to need to adjust the content in GCSEs and A-levels beyond what was announced today. If the content isn’t set at a realistic level, the results will become more a measure of which groups of students lost the most access to learning under Covid,” she said. Duncan Baldwin, the deputy director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We remain concerned that these plans for exams in 2021 amount only to tinkering at the edges when it is clear that students could experience widespread ongoing disruption over the course of the next academic year.” Ofqual’s consultation originally proposed that there should not be any changes to the GCSE English literature assessment next year, but after “significant concern” among respondents about the ability to cover all the required content in the time available the regulator agreed to offer a choice of topics. Forty-eight per cent of those who responded to the consultation opposed plans to leave the English literature assessment unaltered, highlighting the challenges for pupils trying to get to grips with complex literary texts remotely. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said the changes were a case of too little, too late. “Part of the rationale for adapting assessments for summer 2021 must be to support young people’s wellbeing and mental health. Ofqual’s plans for next year don’t contain sufficient adaptations proposed to achieve this. “Instead, schools and students are now being left in the unenviable position that they will be expected to cover as much content as possible in a reduced amount of time. This is unfair on students and it is unfair on schools and colleges.” Ofqual said: “We understand students preparing to take exams and assessments in 2021, and their parents, carers and teachers, are concerned about the impact coronavirus has had on their education. “We have consulted on proposals for changes to exams and assessments next year, given the disruption and potential for ongoing public health safeguards, and developed a package of measures. “Overall, these will free up teaching time, reduce pressure on students and allow assessments to be undertaken within current public health restrictions.”",education
"My mother, Sheila Oglethorpe, who has died aged 86, was a respected specialist in the field of teaching music to children with dyslexia. After nearly 40 years of teaching the piano, frustrated by the lack of resources, she decided to acquire a more formal understanding of dyslexia and ended up writing the book that she and her colleagues had so badly needed: Instrumental Music for Dyslexics: A Teaching Handbook (1996). It remains the standard in this field. Sheila was born in Halberton, near Tiverton, Devon, the third of four children of Molly (nee Freeth) and Arthur Miller, a civil servant in the Indian education service, and brought up in Devon and Hampshire. She attended Redvers school, Tiverton, and then Sherborne school for girls. She won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, graduating in 1954, then taught at St Michael’s school for girls, Petworth, West Sussex. On a skiing holiday she met a solicitor, Bill Oglethorpe. They married in 1956 and had three children in Caton, near Lancaster. In 1966 the family settled in Downton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, where Sheila and Bill lived for 48 years. With her children at school, Sheila resumed teaching the piano, and was on the music staff of Salisbury Cathedral school for more than 30 years. There she started to develop a repertoire of alternative methods as the “go-to” piano teacher for musically gifted children with dyslexia, whose difficulties with printed music mirrored the problems they experienced with the written word. A member of local choirs and staunch supporter of Salisbury music and musicians, Sheila was a familiar figure in the city’s musical circles. For 32 years she was the honorary secretary of Salisbury’s Saturday Morning Concerts, which brought world-class musicians such as Jack Brymer and Evelyn Glennie to local children. Rising 60, Sheila studied at evening school for the Royal Society of Arts diploma in specific learning difficulties, acquiring a formal grounding in her specialist interest. Her landmark book soon followed, and she was then much in demand, lecturing widely around the UK. She sat on the British Dyslexia Association music committee for 14 years; while chair, she oversaw a hugely successful conference at the Royal Academy of Music in 2010, herself delivering a session on multisensory instrumental teaching. Ever modest, she was proud to be honoured as Classic FM’s special educational needs music teacher of the year on retirement in 2011. In 2014 Sheila and Bill moved from Downton to Salisbury, and then in 2018 they both went into a care home. Bill died last year. She is survived by her children, Justin, David and me, by six grandchildren, a great-granddaughter, and her siblings Nancy and Tony.",education
"School budgets will be less than 2% better off next year after it was revealed that the government’s pay increases for teachers will absorb more than half of the extra funding promised for state schools in England. Analysis by the House of Commons library for the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran calculated that the pay award announced by the government last month would come entirely from school budgets, eating into the funding boost announced for 2020-21 onwards. The extra billions for school funding promised in the pre-election spending round will shrink to just £1.7bn in 2020-21 after accounting for the pay rise. Compared with 2019-20, that means the school budget increase from the Department for Education (DfE) will slow from 5.1% to just 1.9% in real terms. The Commons researchers said the funding figures also do not include the additional costs that schools face as a result of Covid-19, such as intensive cleaning and remodelling or other extra spending. Moran, the Lib Dem education spokesperson and a contender for the party’s leadership, said: “Our teachers have gone through the most tumultuous times in their careers because of Covid-19, and they deserve a pay rise. But the government’s failure to budget for this increase means many schools risk being left short-changed. “Boris Johnson claims getting children back into school is a national priority. He must now ensure schools have the resources they need to cope with the pressures caused by coronavirus and ensure no child is left behind.” The researchers said the DfE’s schools budget increased from £44bn in 2019-20, to £47bn in 2020-21, including additional funding for pensions, for an overall increase of 5.1% in real terms. However, last month the government said teachers’ salaries would rise by 3% overall next year, including a 5.5% bump for new teachers. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the pay rises would be funded from existing budgets, in effect cutting the net increase to £1.7bn, or just 1.9% in real terms. “This indicates that in both cash and real terms, the teacher pay increases will not erode all of the announced increases in school funding. However this will vary greatly between different schools depending on their individual circumstances,” the researchers stated. They also noted that the figures do not include “increases in pupil numbers or other cost pressures schools may face,” such as extra cleaning to limit the spread of Covid 19, or the additional £1bn catch-up tutoring and support fund announced in June. Jules White, the leader of the Worth Less? Group of headteachers lobbying for better school funding, said many had feared the promised increases in school funding would not be as significant as the original headlines suggested. “We are already operating on a shoestring and it would be disastrous if the promised ‘levelling up’ and improvements to school budgets turned out to be little more than a mirage,” White said. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “This means an anxious summer for school leaders as they decide what they have to cut to afford pay increases for their staff – or if they even need to lose some people to pay the rest more. A summer of stress and difficult decisions is no reward after months of going above and beyond during the pandemic.” A DfE spokesperson said: “We want to make teaching attractive to the most talented candidates by recognising the outstanding contribution teachers make to our society. This is why we are introducing the biggest pay rise the profession has seen since 2005, with above-inflation rises to the pay ranges for every single teacher in the country. “We are increasing core schools funding by £2.6bn in 2020-21, rising to a £7.1bn increase in 2022-23 compared with 2019-20. This is part of our three-year £14bn funding settlement to level up education funding and opportunity across the country.”",education
"Pupils starting secondary school in England may need to be “retaught” subjects they missed during the coronavirus lockdown, while others may learn a narrower range of subjects or drop GCSE courses to help them catch up, according to the government’s official guidance for schools reopening in September. However, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, rejected suggestions that pupils would not be taught a full curriculum when they returned, despite the Department for Education’s guidance detailing “exceptional circumstances” in which pupils would instead focus on English and maths. The guidance received a mixed response from school leaders, including criticism for vague or unworkable rules around such issues as social distancing, school transport and protective “bubbles” containing potentially hundreds of pupils and staff. The DfE’s guidance explicitly states that some pupils in both primary and secondary schools will need to make up for lost time on core subjects, such as literacy and maths, to the detriment of other subjects. “Schools may consider it appropriate to suspend some subjects for some pupils in exceptional circumstances,” the guidance states. It says later: “In exceptional circumstances, it may be in the best interests of a year 11 pupil to discontinue an examined subject because the school judges that, for example, they would achieve significantly better in their remaining subjects as a result, especially in GCSE English and mathematics.” However, Williamson said at a Downing Street press conference: “The idea that there is going to be a watered-down curriculum is totally, totally untrue. “There’s going to be a full and total curriculum. This is going to be delivered for our children across all subjects.” The DfE’s guidance also says pupils in year seven, commonly the first year of secondary school in England, may need to repeat parts of the primary school syllabus they missed out on during the lockdown which closed schools to most pupils from March onwards. While some pupils are to receive extra time to catch up, those taking A-level and GCSE exams will in most cases still be examined on the full course content, despite also missing several months of classroom teaching. GCSEs and A-level exams will go ahead next summer, but the exam regulator Ofqual has proposed starting them in June, rather than May, to give some extra time to catch up. Ofqual said it would not reduce the course content for A-levels or for the compulsory GCSE subjects of maths and English, with teachers expected to deliver the full curriculum. Jules White, a secondary school headteacher in West Sussex, said: “The government have moved in the right direction by giving schools more flexibility to fully open in September. Now they must really bite the bullet and reduce content in GCSE and A-level exams for next year. “Too much learning time has been lost for the vast majority of students to simply ‘catch up’ on huge swathes of content and knowledge. We don’t need to dumb things down, but asking students to sit two high-quality GCSE maths papers rather than three, for example, would make sense for students and their teachers.” Nansi Ellis, the assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, described the changes to GCSEs and A-levels as minimal and said the government’s expectations were unrealistic. “In the majority of subjects, the expectation that the full specification can be covered by next summer, after many months of lost teaching time, still remains,” Ellis said. There was also criticism of the government’s decision to drop any limits on the numbers of pupils who could be arranged in a “bubble” within schools, one of the few active social distancing measures that the guidance retains within schools. The DfE removed any reference to specific sizes, and instead said that primary schools and the first stage of secondary schools would be advised to place pupils in groups based on their class. But it also said that later years and larger schools could instead use year group-sized bubbles, which in some secondary schools could have more than 200 pupils each. The use of bubbles is intended to limit the scope of a coronavirus outbreak within a school, so that testing and isolation would be needed only for the members of a bubble rather than an entire school. Teachers on social media mocked the DfE’s bubbles as “colanders” after it was found that the guidance allows teachers and other staff to operate across bubbles and allowed mixing of pupils for “specialist teaching, wrap-around care and transport”, while siblings may be in different groups within the same school. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said the late publication of the DfE’s guidance put school leaders and teachers under pressure to finalise arrangements for the next school year. “The government has been asleep at the wheel but heads and staff cannot be left to do this alone. Labour is calling for a cross-party taskforce to focus urgently on getting the necessary arrangements in place so that all students can return safely in September,” Green said. There were no signs of a threatened crackdown on school absences when pupils returned in autumn. The DfE’s guidance says “the usual rules on school attendance will apply”, while Downing Street said headteachers would retain some leeway. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “Returning to school in September will be mandatory. It’s always the case that headteachers do have some discretion. They know their pupils and their family situations. But, in general, children need to get back into school and get back learning again.”",education
"My former colleague Malcolm Brynin, the influential sociologist and leading expert on labour market inequalities, has died aged 70 of cancer. He was the longest serving member of staff at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, joining the team in 1989 to work on the development of the world-leading British Household Panel Study. Born in Tottenham, north London, Malcolm was the son of Rose and John Brynin, a station master. The family moved to Brighton, East Sussex, when he was a child, and he attended Brighton, Hove and Sussex grammar school. While Malcolm was an executive officer in the Department of Trade and Industry he studied in the evenings for a sociology degree at Birkbeck, University of London, graduating in 1976. The following year he gained an MA in sociology at Reading, followed by a PhD at City University (1983). During this time he also worked as an interviewer with Social and Community Planning Research (now NatCen). After completing his PhD, he became a research fellow in sociology at City University (1983-84), then a research fellow in the Centre for Television Research at Leeds University (1985-89). Seconded to the Cabinet Office for four months in 1995 to work on the Technology Foresight project, Malcolm gained the admiration of all who worked with him. In 1976, he met Terri Lappin while chair of governors at a school where she was the headteacher. They married in Keighley, West Yorkshire, in 1989. Malcolm’s publications included three books, many papers in mainstream journals on various forms of inequality and their effects, and two studies for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (2017). He was extremely effective at communicating the results and relevance of his work to the wider policy community. Even after he became ill, he provided evidence to select committee inquiries, briefed the Cabinet Office ahead of a review of women and low pay, and gave a Westminster keynote speech on BAME inequalities in the workplace. As well as a wide knowledge of classical music, opera and theatre (especially Shakespeare), Malcolm played the clarinet and travelled widely. He loved Italy, where his parents taught English for 15 years, as well as France and Germany. He also had a particular interest in medieval church architecture. Malcolm was charming company and will be remembered as a generous man with a wry sense of humour. He is survived by Terri, his brothers, Peter, Bruce and Robert, and a sister, Susan.",education
"Schools in England have been given few restrictions on how they will be able to operate when pupils return in autumn, according to government guidelines, but the welter of recommendations and advice has led headteachers to complain of “mind-boggling” practical difficulties. The guidance published by the Department for Education imposes only a handful of demands, principally that primary and secondary schools divide pupils into “bubbles” of entire classes or year groups, which in larger secondary schools will include hundreds of children. But few social distancing measures will be required within schools, with much of the advice left to school leaders to interpret, including recommendations about staggering school start and finish times, break times within school hours, and hygiene routines. Children and staff will not be required to wear face masks in schools but children over the age of 11 travelling on public transport will need to wear a mask or face covering and maintain social distancing. Teachers are told “to distance from each other and older students where possible” but are allowed to move freely between classes and year groups. Staff will be expected to return to their school’s site for work, because “the risks to all staff will be mitigated significantly” by the new guidance. Staff classed as extremely clinically vulnerable can also return if they maintain social distancing. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It will be immediately apparent to anyone reading this guidance that it is enormously challenging to implement. The logistics of keeping apart many different ‘bubbles’ of children in a full school, including whole-year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind-boggling.” From 20 July, restrictions on group sizes for nurseries, childminders and other early years providers will also be lifted. In a separate announcement, Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, said it would consider delaying the start of next year’s GCSE exams until after 7 June to allow more time for pupils to catch up. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “I want to reassure parents and families that we are doing everything we can to make sure schools, nurseries, colleges and other providers are as safe as possible for children and staff, and will continue to work closely with the country’s best scientific and medical experts to ensure that is the case.” Mobile testing units may be sent to administer tests to entire schools in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak, according to the DfE’s guidance. “Where there are two or more confirmed cases in a two-week period, [Public Health England’s] health protection teams may ask a larger number of other children or young people to self-isolate at home as a precautionary measure,” the guidance states. “Where an outbreak in a school is confirmed, for specific detailed investigations a mobile testing unit may be dispatched to test others who may have been in contact with the person who has tested positive. Testing will first focus on the person’s class, followed by their year group, then the whole school if necessary.” The guidance also says schools will be expected to “secure full attendance from the start of the new academic year”, with the reintroduction of mandatory attendance requirements for pupils and the possibility of fines for parents imposed by local authorities. Inspectors from Ofsted will resume visiting schools in the autumn term, “to discuss how they are supporting the return to education for their pupils”, according to the DfE. Formal Ofsted inspections are to restart in January 2021. Schools will also be required to have plans in place for remote teaching in the event of some pupils self-isolating or a wider school closure. Teaching union leaders urged the government to have a “national plan B” in place for England in the event of further outbreaks jeopardising the full reopening in September. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “The situation seen in Leicester this week has demonstrated that this crisis is far from over, and there will be further disruption ahead. It is therefore essential that government continues to monitor the data when it comes to school return and that it also has a credible plan B in place should it be required.” Much of the guidance repeats the rules in place for schools that have remained open for selected pupils, including keeping movement around the school to a minimum and avoiding busy corridors. School assemblies are to be restricted to single bubbles of pupils, while school choirs are banned. The government continues to struggle with the reliance on public transport for many pupils to travel to school – and the guidance hints that more extreme measures may be needed similar to those used in London during the 2012 Olympics. The guidance bluntly states the use of public transport by pupils “should be kept to an absolute minimum”. But it then says: “To facilitate the return of all pupils to school, it will be necessary to take steps to both depress the demand for public transport and to increase capacity within the system.” The Department for Transport is asking local authorities to survey parents on school routes, and to “consider using traffic demand management” and “a range of options for shifting demand for public transport onto other modes” from the start of the autumn term. “Experience during the 2012 London Olympics showed that it is possible to make a very real difference to travel patterns where there is a concerted effort to do so and where the general public understand the imperative for doing so,” the guidance states.",education
"After months of disruption, the government has said it will be compulsory for all pupils in England to return to school from September. New guidance has been published, offering advice on everything from choirs and classroom ventilation to Covid-19 testing kits and corridor management. These are the headlines. The government wants schools to stagger the start and end of the day to keep groups of students apart and avoid congestion, with staggered lunch and break times to minimise contact. While some schools have been practising this with limited numbers of pupils, it is likely to be significantly more complex when 1,500 teenagers return from their enforced break at the beginning of September. Headteachers say transport to and from school will be one of the biggest challenges. While dedicated school buses can be managed to a certain degree, schools have no control when it comes to public transport. Pupils over the age of 11 must wear face masks, which must be safely removed at the school entrance, but the use of public transport should be kept to an absolute minimum. Ministers would like pupils to walk and cycle where possible, but that will be impossible for many. Rather than measuring social distance by the metre in schools, the new government guidance talks about minimising contact and using protective bubbles. Initially the maximum number of children in a bubble was 15; in primaries that has been expanded to 30 and in large secondaries a bubble may have to incorporate an entire year group made up of hundreds of pupils. The bubbles must be kept away from each other throughout the day, in different areas of the building, but staff can move between bubbles so long as they keep their distance. The idea is to reduce transmission of the virus and that if a pupil tests positive, fewer people have to self-isolate. School leaders have their doubts about how well this might work in often cramped sites with little outdoor space. “The logistics of keeping apart many different ‘bubbles’ of children in a full school, including whole-year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind boggling,” said Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. With the teacher at the front of class, and pupils sitting at well-spaced desks, all facing forward, classrooms may look rather old-fashioned to children and young people used to greater freedoms in school. The guidance says windows should be kept open where possible to maximise ventilation and suggests singing and music lessons might be held outside because of the heightened risk of infection. School-wide assemblies are banned and use of staff rooms should be “minimised”. The government is keen to send out the message that it will be business as usual, with a return to a full timetable and broad curriculum. In reality, many children will need extensive help to catch up on lost learning and may need to focus on core subjects. Year 7 pupils starting at secondary school may need to recap their year 6 syllabus and some GCSE pupils may be encouraged to drop a subject so they can focus on maths and English. “We are aware that this may lead to concerns that the curriculum is being narrowed for these children,” Barton acknowledged, adding that it would only happen if it was in the best interests of the pupil. The aim will be to return to the normal curriculum by the summer term in 2021 but child development and mental health experts have said the emphasis should be on wellbeing, friendships and play as children get back to school, rather than academic attainment. The government acknowledges that remote learning may continue to play a significant role in the case of local lockdowns and for individual pupils, but there remain concerns about access to computers and online resources among the most disadvantaged. The government wants all tests and exams to go ahead in the next year, including the phonics screening check in year 1, key stage 1 and 2 tests in primary, and the year 4 multiplication tables check. The new reception baseline assessment, which was due to be introduced for four-year-olds starting school this September, has been postponed. GCSEs and A-levels will go ahead next summer, though they may be delayed for a few weeks to allow extra teaching time, and some content may be reduced. Unions say the changes being proposed are minimal and that the government’s expectations are “unrealistic” given the amount of learning time lost. The government guidance warns schools to prepare for more bad behaviour and acknowledges that some pupils will need additional support. The main message, however, is that there must be consequences for poor behaviour, particularly for breaches of new hygiene and distancing rules within schools, and that exclusion can be used as a last resort. Campaigners working with children who have special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are concerned there will be spike in exclusions among pupils with Send, who struggle with school in the best of circumstances and may be significantly affected by lockdown. The government has said it will be mandatory for pupils to return to school from September, with fines for non-attendance as a last resort. Headteachers have opposed this, saying many parents will continue to have genuine fears about health and safety and the school should work with them rather than penalise them for absences. In reality, although the government is insisting on all pupils back in school at the start of the next academic year, headteachers will be allowed to use their discretion over fines and many will no doubt be sympathetic. The government guidance includes the now familiar regime of regular hand-washing, “catch-it-bin-it-kill-it” messages and regular cleaning of spaces and equipment. Each school will be given a small supply of home testing kits and in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak mobile testing units could be sent to administer tests to a class, year group or entire school if necessary. Where there are two or more confirmed cases in a two-week period, a larger number of pupils may have to self-isolate at home.",education
"British children could lose £40,000 of their potential lifetime earnings unless UK governments can repair the gaps in learning caused by this year’s coronavirus school closures, according to a worst-case scenario published by the Royal Society. The report issued by the society urges the UK’s governments to “do everything feasible” to avoid further school closures – including shutting pubs and shops ahead of schools in the event of repeat outbreaks – or risk further harming the mental health and future careers of a generation. Simon Burgess, an author of the report and an economics professor at the University of Bristol, said missing a third of a school year would cause lasting damage to pupils’ education. Based on evidence from prolonged school closures overseas, the report said average lifetime earnings could be lowered by up to 3% if pupils were not given opportunities to catch up. “The 3% loss of earnings potential is an estimate, based on assuming that home learning during lockdown was largely unsuccessful, and nothing is done to address the learning losses we have seen so far. The Department for Education [in England] is designing a remediation programme which may significantly reduce this impact and alongside other measures may help remediate it entirely,” Burgess said. “If there were to be no remediation, and if learning at home during lockdown was not very successful, the evidence from other countries considered in the report with similar lost learning time suggests a 3% loss in earning potential would be plausible. “Average earnings in the UK for 2019 were around £30,000, meaning a 3% reduction would amount to a loss of around £900 per year. Over a working lifetime of about 45 years this could theoretically amount to lifetime lost earnings of up to £40,000 in younger children, but we would expect this to be much lower where remediation measures are taken.” Anna Vignoles, professor of education at the University of Cambridge and another of the authors, said: “Shutting down schools has impacted all children but the worst effects will be felt by those from lower socio-economic groups and with other vulnerabilities, such as a pre-existing mental health condition.” Children from low income households were more likely to lack the home support needed to engage with remote teaching during lockdown, while those with pre-existing conditions were more likely to experience worsening mental health, Vignoles said. The national governments in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have already announced measures to help schools and pupils catch up, but they vary greatly in policies and funding. John Swinney, the education secretary for Scotland, on Thursday announced that 850 more teachers and around 200 support staff would be hired for when schools reopen after the summer. In England, the government has allocated £1bn for catch-up efforts to be spent in the next school year, including £350m for a new national tutoring programme. Burgess said governments should only consider closing schools as a last resort. Schools should be supplied with additional resources, including personal protective equipment for staff and older students to avoid further transmission, to help them stay open, while governments should implement effective community monitoring linked to a workable “test, trace, isolate” system to curb outbreaks. A separate study by the University of Southampton found that children from the most advantaged families, with access to digital devices and with parents working from home, spent longer on school work during lockdown than their peers in less advantaged households. Advantaged primary pupils spent on average 2.9 hours a day and secondary pupils 3.8 hours day on school work. But those with shared access to devices and a parent working outside the home only worked for 2.3 and 2.6 hours respectively. The study used data taken from a longitudinal survey of 3,000 UK school-age children in April, when schools across the country were closed to all but vulnerable pupils and children of essential workers.",education
"The provost of University College London announced in June this year that its Galton Lecture Theatre, Pearson Lecture Theatre and Pearson Building had all been renamed. They are now known by the perfectly unmemorable names of, respectively, Lecture Theatre 115, Lecture Theatre G22 and the North-West Wing. What sounds like a dull piece of administrative news is in fact a complex tale of a racist legacy, student politics, academic disputes and an impassioned debate about the history of science and how it is taught. It also goes to the heart of an issue that looks set to become one of great contention in the months and years ahead: by what criteria do we judge who should no longer be commemorated – at universities and in society at large? The UCL announcement was in keeping with one of the recommendations made by an inquiry set up to look at the history of eugenics at the university. Put simply, eugenics is the study of how to improve the genetic quality of a human population. The concept dates back to Plato and beyond, but its modern form was developed, and given its name by Francis Galton, who called eugenics “the science of improving inherited stock, not only by judicious matings, but by all the influences which give more suitable strains a better chance”. Honouring the academic tradition of intellectual dispute, the inquiry published a report earlier this year that the majority of its committee refused to sign, in part because it failed to examine the current situation on campus. Yet the inquiry was prompted by contemporary events, namely a controversial conference that was held on UCL grounds on four separate occasions. The London Conference on Intelligence (LCI) was an invitation-only gathering that, among other things, examined the issue of race and intelligence. It also included presentations on eugenics. The conference had almost nothing to do with UCL, aside from the fact that the honorary lecturer who organised it was able to use his status to book a room on site. According to the inquiry report, on discovering the presence of LCI, BAME students and staff lobbied for an inquiry. And that inquiry, it turned out, set its sights primarily on Galton. A 19th-century polymath who made key contributions to a number of disparate fields of study, Galton is perhaps less well known than he ought to be. He is the man who popularised the principle of “regression to the mean” in statistics; he effectively created the modern weather map by linking areas of similar air pressure; he gave us the phrase “nature versus nurture” and pioneered the study of twins. He also revolutionised forensic science by showing how fingerprints could be used to identify individuals. But those achievements lie in the lengthening shadow cast by his commitment to eugenics and his lasting links to UCL. Galton funded a professorial chair in eugenics at the university (it changed its name to the chair in genetics after the second world war) and financed a laboratory that also took his name. In addition he endowed his personal collection and archive to the college. Even by the standards of his own time, Galton was undoubtedly an egregious racist. Here is a not untypical example of his perspective, taken from a 1904 essay on eugenics: “But while most barbarous races disappear, some, like the negro, do not. It may therefore be expected that types of our race will be found to exist which can be highly civilised without losing fertility.” As the inquiry report stated: “Through the financial donation of Galton to UCL, racism was allowed to be married to science and within UCL this link between science and racism was embraced.” It also noted that “some students felt distress at sitting through lectures and exams in rooms celebrating eugenics”. Steve Jones, the former head of the Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment at UCL, has little truck with such sensitivities. About one student who is alleged to have burst into tears when she discovered she had to go into the Galton Lecture Theatre, he says: “Well, my rather brutal response to that is you shouldn’t be coming to UCL then.” Against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement, and in an era in which vigilance to micro-aggressions is deemed an essential aspect of academic pastoral care, Jones risks sounding dangerously out of date. He blames the “weak” provost, Michael Arthur, for capitulating to a “woke” campaign. “UCL used to be known as ‘the godless university’ because it was set up for people who didn’t have faith and for Jews [only members of the Church of England were eligible to go to Oxford and Cambridge ],” he says. “Now it is spineless.” His friend and former student, the author Adam Rutherford, says Jones is “old and angry now” and annoyed by the way denaming has become the answer to problems within academia. But Jones is not indifferent to Galton’s racism. Far from it. For several decades he has given a lecture on eugenics, looking at its history, its science, and most glaringly its racism, examining the legacies of Galton and his fellow UCL eugenicists Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher. He doesn’t shy away from their obnoxious opinions but sets them within the context of their times and against their remarkable contributions to science. The fact is, he says, belief in eugenics was widespread among the British intelligentsia in the late 19th century and especially in the early decades of the last one – all the way up to the Nazis: the Holocaust effectively destroyed its reputation. “[JBS] Haldane, the most famous British biologist of the 20th century – he was at UCL and he did genuinely revolutionary work on statistics, genetics, physiology,” says Jones, “but he nevertheless felt that people of so-called ‘low quality’ shouldn’t be allowed to breed.” Others included Marie Stopes, the campaigner for women’s rights, whose birth control clinics, says Jones, were opened “in order that people of low quality should be discouraged from having children”. George Bernard Shaw, HG Wells, the economist John Maynard Keynes, William Beveridge, whose eponymous report formed the basis of the welfare state, and Winston Churchill were also in favour of eugenics – it was a belief system that spanned the political spectrum from left to right. Rutherford, who is an honorary research fellow at UCL, agrees that it would be wrong to remove such eminent figures from prominence purely on account of their now unpalatable views. “I think Galton’s a shit, but he’s also a shit who’s a genius, whose legacy we absolutely rely on,” says Rutherford. “We’ve got to be mature enough at a university to recognise that people can be both brilliant and awful at the same time.” He is neutral on the issue of denaming but that’s because he’s “not the recipient of the pernicious legacies” of eugenics. On balance, he thinks it was right to change the buildings’ names. Nevertheless, he has several reservations about the nature of the inquiry. He believes it used the history of eugenics as a means of indirectly addressing decolonising the curriculum and the absence of black professors, and as a result failed to do justice to either. “Broadly, the content of the report itself wasn’t befitting of standards of scholarship associated with UCL,” he says. “Secondly, they conflated the history of eugenics with scientific racism. It was pointed out by me and others many many times that these are connected but discrete ideas.” Eugenics didn’t produce slavery or colonialism – both of which predated its inception – but it did offer pseudo-scientific justification for the ideology of white supremacy, which had been long propagated by western elites. While racism was manifest in society, eugenics, as Jones points out, was never actually enacted in Britain or its empire. In some respects, eugenics was the first iteration of what was to become genetics, a limited understanding of biological inheritance that was informed by all of the prejudices to which social class, race and disability were subject 100 or more years ago. It built on Darwin’s ideas of natural selection, seeking to speed up and improve the process by active human intervention. In other words, it promised to produce more able-bodied white people of a certain class and intelligence. Many of its assumptions, however, were scientifically as well as morally wrong. For example, as Rutherford notes in his book A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived, the Nazis murdered or sterilised around a quarter of a million people with schizophrenia. After a postwar dip in numbers, the incidence of schizophrenia returned to the norm in Germany or, in some areas, much higher than the norm. In reality, eugenics failed to account for the many genetic variations that underpin schizophrenia, nor was its crude conception of race grounded in biological fact. Rutherford argues that the scientific process disproved key principles of eugenics. “Galton founded a field in order to demonstrate racial superiority and the wonderful irony of his legacy is that science has said exactly the opposite of what he wanted. That is the point of science, to remove personal biases from understanding reality.” “No,” says science writer Angela Saini, “science didn’t defeat eugenics. Science created eugenics in the first place, it created the scientific racism of its day. These ideas still live on in present-day science, and I think that’s the thing that some scientists don’t want to accept.” She cites the way some scientists have tried to look for genetic explanations for the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on the BAME population as an example of present-day scientific racism. Saini wrote about the UCL inquiry in a piece for Nature, the premier science journal, in which she criticised the university’s biologists for ignoring its eugenic past. It was the humanities scholars, she wrote, “who forced their workplace to confront a sordid history that some geneticists had been willing to overlook”. Rutherford and Jones were among a number of geneticists who published a letter in Nature pointing out that they’d been teaching and discussing that very history for several decades. “We’re part of a conspiracy of silence that manifests itself by writing bestselling books, doing radio programmes and TV programmes,” says Rutherford sardonically. “We estimate that Steve Jones has lectured to more than 10,000 students over the last 30 years, and Galton, Fisher and Pearson and eugenics have been part of each one of those courses. The week that the report was published, I taught eugenics for medicine and the history of race science three times that week.” Saini remains unapologetic. “Everybody wants to be seen as the good guy here. But if everyone is the good guy and everyone was doing their job, then we wouldn’t be in a situation where the report was needed.” It’s clear that the issues surrounding the inquiry are highly emotive, but possibly the most charged of all, at least for the academics involved, is that of disciplinary expertise. The geneticists feel that the inquiry was loaded with too many participants from the humanities who didn’t really understand the science or the scientific history. The non-scientists, for their part, tend to view the science establishment as inward-looking and complacent. Subhadra Das is UCL’s curator for science and medicine. She is in charge of the Galton collection – complete with its ghoulish instruments for measuring racial differences. She was part of the inquiry committee and she accepts that the genetics department, and in particular Jones, has worked for many years to expose the eugenicist past of UCL. “What I would like,” she says, “is an acknowledgment that it’s not only scientists who get to say what is and isn’t anti-racist.” As someone of Bangladeshi heritage, not to mention a part-time standup comedian, Das is fully aware of the ironies of her position looking after the arch-racist Galton’s collection. Her approach has been to use Galton as a way of addressing the troubled legacies of science. Initially, she says, she was doubtful about the wisdom of removing Galton’s and Pearson’s names. “I was concerned that what it meant was that the conversation would disappear,” she says. She’s since changed her mind, and now believes the process of name-changing should go much further. She agrees with Saini, who says that people we commemorate are those “we want to emulate… whose values we want to cherish”. This seems like a high bar that few scientists, or indeed anyone else, would be able to clear. After all, even a giant like Darwin held some views that, by today’s standards, are objectionable. Das argues that there is no way of infusing nuance into a building name or a statue. Ultimately, she believes, “naming a building after scientists is anti-science, because it’s holding people up to really high standards that no one can be held up to”. In any case, whatever its merits, the denaming of buildings is likely to have limited impact on the reality of the world as it is today. Eugenics has been very largely debunked and yet it still exists. It has been argued, for example, that terminations after early prenatal screenings are a form of eugenics. More apposite is what has been taking place in Xinjiang in China with the targeting of the Muslim Uighur population. A recent report shows that a campaign of forced sterilisation has seen Uighur population growth decline by 84% in the regions with the largest proportion of Uighur people between 2015 and 2018. Though Uighurs account for only 1.8% of China’s population, Uighur women make up 80% of those fitted with intrauterine devices for long-term contraception in China. It is arguably the greatest human rights issue of the 21st century, and yet on campuses across Britain – including UCL – that rely increasingly on Chinese investment and students, there has been barely any protest at all. Saini can see the inconsistency, but puts this down to corporate interest rather than a lack of student concern. “Universities tend to operate like businesses these days, and their brands therefore matter, especially when it comes to attracting lucrative overseas students,” she says. “So while you will see declarations of support for women and minorities, or statements regarding diversity or decolonisation, in practice you don’t see very much in the way of action.” Rutherford says he doesn’t know enough about the sterilisation campaign in Xinjiang to comment, but points out that we shouldn’t forget China’s one-child policy “or indeed the Iron Fist campaign in 2010, in which 10,000 women were forcibly sterilised in three months for violating it”. Both are examples of eugenics, as is sex-specific abortion, or the kind of infanticide that is practised in India. “We need to get much much better at talking about this,” says Rutherford, “because it’s a siren song, and it’s not going away.” In the meantime, universities are going to have to prepare themselves for more name-changing, if the UCL experience is anything to go by. Though unhappy with the denaming, Jones has an idea for the next name that should fall: the oil magnate John D Rockefeller, who funded the eugenics institute in Germany that inspired and conducted eugenics experiments in the Third Reich. “The building in which the UCL medical is housed is called the Rockefeller Building,” says Jones. “He didn’t just approve of eugenics, he promoted its practice. He was not a scientist. He didn’t make any scientific progress. But you try unnaming that building and the medical school will go ballistic.”",education
"More than 4,000 people have signed a petition calling on the exam board of the UK’s royal schools of music to include more black composers in their syllabus. This follows new research, which has revealed that 99% of pieces in the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) exam syllabuses are by white composers. Musicians, academics, teachers and students tell us why the overwhelmingly white syllabus is deterring young black talent from pursuing classical music in higher education and as a career. Aseye Olympio, violin student at the Royal College of Music Aseye Olympio says she had been discouraged from applying to study further at the conservatoire partly because of its lack of black representation. Olympio, who is 17 and lives in Kennington, south London, says: “It does put me off when I don’t see enough people from ethnic minorities, especially black people, in higher roles, like conductors, theory teachers, musicianship teachers, even one to one violin lesson practical teachers. I think: ‘How come people like me are not in a position like that? How come we don’t have the opportunity to be in this role?’” Her mother, Patience Vivor, says her daughter was not exposed to black composers during her music education. “I didn’t know that black composers actually exist,” she adds. “I was very enthusiastic when I found out about Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. It would be very useful for black children, [as] they are not widely represented in the college, [to] have the opportunity to study music from black composers. These conservatoires need to really change not just the culture but the curriculum.” Kadie Kanneh-Mason, former university lecturer Former university lecturer Kadie Kanneh-Mason’s seven children have all attended the Royal Academy of Music and its primary and junior academies. Her son, Sheku, became a household name after performing at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018. She and her husband introduced their children to Coleridge-Taylor and other black composers. She says: “What we did was say to them [was] you should listen to music that is not necessarily classical but is by black artists. We very much wanted to give them a sense that all music is owned by everybody, and there is a lot of black talent out there. If you are a child learning music and you see a black composer and you’re learning that piece of music, I do think that makes a huge difference. “We’ve never really found that the classical music world itself is not welcoming. But I know that when they all turned up – I’m especially [thinking of my daughter] Isata when she first arrived at junior Royal Academy – she was the only one. And that is, I think, slowly changing.” Kanneh-Mason believes the main barrier to improving diversity in classical music is the cuts to state school music education. She adds: “I think in defence of the conservatoires, you can’t accept students who are not there to apply. It has to start with the state school curriculum.” Eleanor Alberga, composer Alberga, an internationally renowned composer whose choral work Arise, Athena! was performed at the Last Night of the Proms, says ABRSM previously asked black and minority ethnic composers to write pieces for its syllabus when public attention was drawn to its lack of diversity. But, she says, the board will always “revert to the status quo”. “The ball is dropped, it’s picked up again and then it disappears again. Conservatoires should regularly be choosing composers from all ethnic groups and should celebrate their own distinguished alumni by performing their work.” “We need to build up audiences as well. If students don’t take up music, at least they might become interested in classical music and they’ll go to concerts. But from that huge body of people who are being exposed to classical music from primary school we should start getting more black teachers, more black performers and more black composers. I think that’s the only way. They can’t just fall out of the sky at age 20.” Uchenna Ngwe, artistic director of Decus EnsembleNgwe, whose historical project PlainsightSOUND documents classical musicians in Britain of African and Caribbean descent, says racist stereotypes still hold black students back. She explains: “There have been black students at conservatoires since they were established in the late 19th century. But even now you have teachers and prominent musicians openly saying that black people are biologically unsuited to playing particular instruments or unable to sing specific styles or genres of music.”“Despite what we’re often taught in this country, classical music has never existed in a cultural silo. Black people have participated in it for centuries and more research is going into understanding the cross-cultural influences that are still evident in European history. It’s extremely strange that this is still ignored in our teaching on classical music history.”",education
"Thousands of excluded pupils who are at risk of criminal and sexual exploitation have no school, college or training place to go to in September because of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 crisis, headteachers have said. Around 10,000 year 11 students who were excluded from mainstream schools in England and moved to alternative provision (AP) are due to leave at the end of this term, but a survey suggests a quarter have no plans in place and may have become further disengaged under lockdown. AP leaders who responded to the survey, conducted by the teacher training charity The Difference and the Centre for Social Justice thinktank, estimated that a third of their year 11s may be vulnerable to criminal or sexual exploitation. They also said they expected a quarter of their pupils would not be in education, employment or training (Neet) in September and called for specialist sixth-form provision to be opened to keep them safe next term. APs are not funded to teach pupils to 18 and students are expected to move to a college after their GCSEs, but headteachers have reported “exceptional challenges” during lockdown in supporting their students to transition. This month the government announced an additional £750 per pupil to support students leaving AP to transition into education or training, but even with the extra funding leaders said one in four students would still not have anywhere to go in September. The majority of headteachers surveyed said they would ideally keep on the most vulnerable pupils so they could resit the year if they were funded to do so, though some feared the students would not engage. Nine in 10 were in favour of setting up long-term sixth-form provision for their pupils. Ellie Doyle, an associate senior leader at Mayesbrook Park school, which offers AP in Barking and Dagenham, east London, said: “Learners heard on the same day that school was shut and exams were cancelled. This was devastating. “A small minority are simply not yet ready for transition to post-16; they have had such gaps in their learning so far, and now they have lost these most important months during lockdown. They still feel so uncertain about what September holds.” Year 11 students who were already at increased risk of becoming Neets as a result of being excluded have not been able to attend college open days or engage with training providers as a result of the pandemic. An estimated 35% are vulnerable to criminal or sexual exploitation and 29% have serious mental health conditions. Richard Cronin, the head of Everton Free school, another AP, said: “The legacy of the Covid-19 lockdown will be even more damaging for those learners who have already fallen through cracks in the school system. “These young people are at a critical point in their learning journeys which will impact on their future employment and life chances. Now more than ever there is a clear need for high quality, funded post-16 AP provision and pathways.” The Difference chief executive, Kiran Gill, said: “These are the most vulnerable children in the country – disproportionately living in extreme poverty, suffering mental health problems and at risk of exploitation. “These 16-year-olds need stability and to continue in education over the next six months, or they could be not only lost to the labour market but further caught up in criminal and sexual exploitation.” The survey was based on responses from school leaders representing 86 APs, of which 78 were state maintained, constituting a quarter of all state-maintained AP schools with provision for year 11s. A government spokesperson said: “Leaving Alternative Provision at 16 can be a difficult transition – especially this year as many young people will have missed out on time with their teachers and peers during the coronavirus outbreak. That’s why we recently announced a bespoke package of support for each year 11 currently in AP to help engage them in further education, employment or training through the next year.  “We are also working across government to protect vulnerable children from county lines gangs and other exploitation as schools re-open, and we are investing into early intervention projects to divert young people away from violent crime.”",education
"An Oxford University theology professor and former pastor who downloaded 28,000 child abuse images and videos has been sentenced to a year in prison and placed on the sex offender register in France. Jan Joosten, 61, who holds the prestigious regius professorship of Hebrew at Oxford, was suspended by the university’s Faculty of Oriental Studies and Christ Church college on Monday night. He is considered one of the most distinguished biblical scholars of his generation. The academic, who lives in the Bas-Rhin region of France, was sentenced by a court in the city of Saverne last week over possession of about 27,000 images and 1,000 videos after he admitted the facts of the case, Agence France-Presse reported. Prosecutors said the material downloaded by Joosten, who spent six years as a pastor in his native Belgium, included depictions of child rape. The images, downloaded over a six-year period, were discovered through a lengthy police investigation by cybercrime specialists in Strasbourg. Joosten, a father of four, accepted the facts of the case and told the court he was relieved to be arrested, describing his addiction as “a secret garden, in contradiction with myself”. Joosten was not immediately committed to prison. His sentence would be supervised, and may be amended, by an independent judge, AFP said. The court also ordered a three-year programme of treatment and barred him from any activity bringing him into contact with minors. The defence had said that his family were aware of his offences and argued he should not be imprisoned because he was a first time offender, presented little risk of reoffending, and had sought psychiatric help voluntarily. A judicial source told AFP that Joosten was yet to decide whether to appeal on Friday. Joosten, who studied in Belgium, the US and Israel, taught at the University of Strasbourg for 20 years before joining Oxford in 2014. He still holds a role at Strasbourg and was until recently editor-in-chief of Vetus Testamentum, a leading journal of Old Testament studies. Christ Church college sent students a statement saying that it is “fully committed to safeguarding and has robust policies and processes in place.” It added: “Our thoughts are with anyone affected by this news.” A statement issued by Oxford University said: “We can confirm that, following the conviction in France of Professor Jan Joosten for possession of images of child pornography, he has been suspended by the Faculty of Oriental Studies and Christ Church pending further action. “We have informed any staff and students who would have had contact with him and have provided them with the contacts of the University’s welfare and support services in case that any of them require additional support.”  This article was amended on 23 June 2020 to replace a photo of Merton College with one correctly showing Christ Church.

"One in five British undergraduates who won a place to study at the University of Oxford last year were from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, but privately educated students are still significantly overrepresented, according to the latest admissions data. The university says it is making “steady progress towards a more inclusive student body”, with the proportion of British students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds now at 22.1%, up from 14.5% five years ago. By comparison, in 2017, BAME students made up 26.2% of students at all UK universities. Widening access programmes have also resulted in an increase in the proportion of black students gaining places at Oxford, from 2.6% in 2018 to 3.1% last year, but the data shows many colleges still admitting few black students. Between 2017 and 2019, 12 of Oxford’s colleges admitted five or fewer black undergraduates and, over the same period, there were five or fewer black undergraduates on 13 of Oxford’s most popular courses. None were admitted to study geography and only one for biology. While there has been progress on increasing the number of state-educated students at Oxford, up from 55.6% of its UK undergraduates in 2014 to 62.3% five years later, they are still significantly underrepresented given that only 7% of pupils in the UK go to private school; an exception is sixth form, where the figure is about 16%. The data, published on Tuesday, also revealed the continuing dominance of students from London and the south-east, who made up 49% of all those admitted to Oxford between 2017 and 2019. In contrast, just 2.1% came from the north-east and 4.5% from the East Midlands. Over the last five years, admissions of students from the most deprived areas of the UK have increased from 8.6% to 12.2%, the proportion of women have risen from 47.5% to 54.4%, and those declaring a disability from 6.9% to 9.4%. In the past, the university has been criticised by MPs and policymakers for ignoring well-qualified state-educated students, especially those from black or disadvantaged backgrounds, but over the past five years it has overhauled its application system and expanded outreach efforts to widen the diversity of its student body. In recent weeks, however, there has been criticism over the university’s handling of racist incidents. Some BAME students have complained about their experiences at the university, and Oxford’s Oriel College finally voted in favour of removing a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes after campaigners inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement targeted the university once again. Commenting on the admissions figures, Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race & Education at the University of Birmingham, said: “These figures show that progress is being made regarding admissions representing a more diverse student body. This is good to see, but in addition, Oxford will need to address its BME attainment gap and the lack of BME academics in senior decision-making roles.” Oxford’s vice-chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, said: “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the deep education inequalities in our society. We are acutely conscious of its differential impact both on our current students and on those considering applying to Oxford.” The university also revealed that its state school access programme, which supports 1,350 students annually and usually involves week-long residential visits to Oxford, will move online as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues. Oxford’s digital expansion also includes the university’s first virtual open day and an online Target Oxbridge 2020, the programme that helps black and mixed-race students with black heritage to succeed in their Oxford and Cambridge applications. Prof Richardson said: “Notwithstanding the major challenge of adapting to the constraints posed by the pandemic, we fully intend to continue our progress towards ensuring that every talented, academically driven pupil in the country, wherever they come from, sees Oxford as a place for them.”",education
"The government is considering delaying the 2021 summer exams in England in order to allow for additional teaching time to make up for lessons lost to school closures during the pandemic. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs that the government would be consulting with the exams regulator, Ofqual, about moving exams back to give pupils more time to study for their GCSEs and A-levels. Teachers’ leaders have said pupils preparing for exams next summer have not had sufficient time to cover the syllabus, after schools closed to all but key worker and vulnerable children on 20 March and lessons went online. This year’s summer exams had to be cancelled as a result of the lockdown. Instead of sitting their papers, pupils will have their grades awarded by a combination of teacher assessment, class ranking and the past performance of their schools. Previously, Williamson has insisted that next year’s exams will go ahead, but when asked during education questions in the Commons on Monday, he said the government was considering how to give pupils extra time. The Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke has previously suggested moving the 2021 exam season from May to the end of June or July to give students and teachers more time in the classroom to complete the curriculum. Addressing Williamson in the Commons, he said: “I wonder if my right honourable friend will be giving consideration to that or other matters to get extra teaching time in ready for the exam season.” Williamson responded that the government’s £1bn catch-up package announced last week would help ensure that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds would benefit from extra support through one-to-one or small group tutoring. He added: “My honourable friend raises an important point about how do we add more teaching time in, and that’s why we will be consulting with Ofqual about how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn and really flourish and do incredibly well.”  An Ofqual spokesperson said later: “We recognise students expecting to take exams next year, and their parents and teachers, are concerned about the disruption to teaching and learning caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “We are working closely with the Department for Education, exam boards and groups representing teachers, schools, colleges and students, to carefully consider a range of possible measures. We are planning to publish for consultation, before the end of term, our proposals for 2021.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned of potential complications. “If the intention is to move the full six-week exam season to a later date, this would have significant ramifications. “It would mean either exam boards having a much narrower window in which to mark millions of scripts, or results being published later, which would potentially run into the autumn term. This would affect progression to further and higher education. “It’s important that the approach to next year’s exams supports pupils without creating more problems than it solves, and that it is agreed as soon as possible so that schools and colleges are able to prepare accordingly.”",education
"My brother, Barry Hoffbrand, who has died aged 86, was a national leader in postgraduate medical education who helped countless junior doctors to pass examinations vital to their future careers. He was also a highly successful editor of the Postgraduate Medical Journal.  Barry came to be regarded as the physician other doctors would consult about their own families’ medical problems. Born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, Barry was the son of Philip Hoffbrand, a bespoke tailor, and Minnie (nee Freedman). Both parents were from eastern Europe. He was educated at Bradford grammar school, where he showed talent as an artist, then studied medicine at Queen’s College, Oxford, where he was a member of the college cricket team. He qualified as a doctor from Oxford in 1958. After junior doctor positions at University College hospital, London, and St Luke’s hospital, Bradford, and a year as a research fellow at the Cardiovascular Research Institute, San Francisco, he became a consultant physician at the Whittington hospital in north London in 1970.  Barry’s enthusiasm for postgraduate education developed at the Whittington, where he became director of its Academic Centre for Postgraduate Medicine in 1975. He edited the Postgraduate Medical Journal, from 1980 to 1994, bringing it international success. And he wrote more than 100 scientific papers of his own and chapters for books, mostly on renal disease and hypertension. He held honorary physician posts, including at the Italian hospital, in London, which prompted him to learn Italian. Among other appointments he was a vice-president of the Royal Society of Medicine and president of its clinical section, president of the Harveian Society of London and of the London Jewish Medical Society, and was on the council of the Royal College of Physicians. After retirement from the Whittington in 1999, he became a governor of the hospital and, from 2009 to 2015, was founding chairman of the Whittington’s organ donation committee. Barry was a kind, compassionate doctor with a reassuring reliability not only for his patients but also for his family and friends. He had a warm personality and was wonderful company. He felt passionately about matters of contemporary importance such as Brexit, the NHS, antisemitism and Israel, and frequently had letters published in newspapers. In his retirement, Barry developed his talent as an artist, studying at the Hampstead School of Art, showing at exhibitions and selling many of his paintings. He was never without his sketchbook. He took a serious interest in art history and developed an ability to spot previously unnoticed medical features in well-known works of art. In 1961 he married Marina Morduch, a fellow student, who became a psychiatrist. She survives him, as do his daughters, Sara, Julia and Rachel, and seven grandchildren.",education
"Climbdowns, U-turns and calls for Gavin Williamson to resign resounded across Tuesday’s front pages following the education secretary’s apology for the exams algorithm fiasco that has marred the prospects of hundreds of thousands of pupils and unleashed a wave of anger in the direction of the government. The Daily Mail portrays Boris Johnson and Williamson as a bumbling cartoon Laurel and Hardy above the headline: “Another fine mess.” It asks why the minister still has a job and urges the PM to “get a grip”. The Guardian captures a sense of celebration, showing students’ joy outside the Department for Education in its main picture. “Government forced into humiliating exams U-turn” is the headline and the story notes the minister’s efforts to blame regulator Ofqual for the problem. The Telegraph also focuses on the search for culpability. Next to a large picture of Williamson is the headline: “Williamson shifts blame on to exam watchdog after grades climbdown.” It also carries a mention of an opinion piece by William Hague, who says the fiasco threatened to become “another poll tax moment for the Tories”. The Mirror puts the blame on Johnson, with the headline: “This is no way to run a country.” It describes the exams U-turn as “the latest in a list of massive errors during pandemic”. It adds a third picture showing a protester holding a “sack Gavin” sign. The traditionally loyal Express finds a third way, describing the U-turn on the no-U-turn policy as a “victory for common sense in exams fiasco”. It portrays Johnson as taking control by telling Williamson to scrap the disastrous algorithm policy. The Times looks ahead to the next step for some A-level students: “Scramble for university places after exam U-turn”. Quentin Letts is particularly scathing in his sketch of Williamson and his Whitehall experts, saying: “This had been a day to remember, a day when our political class showed its world-beating ineptitude.” The FT says “A-level and GCSE results restored after latest government U-turn”, noting in bullet points Williamson’s apology, and that the rest of the UK is following Scotland’s lead.",education
"An A-level student has launched a legal bid against the exams regulator Ofqual to “force them to come up with a fairer system”. The Good Law Project, which is supporting six other students over a judicial review of Ofqual’s “failings”, has so far raised almost £60,000 by crowdfunding to cover legal costs. Curtis Parfitt-Ford, 18, accused the government of “playing politics” with the futures of thousands of young people after a standardisation algorithm that took into account schools’ historic performance downgraded almost 40% of predicted grades. This led to many missing out on their first-choice universities and some facing an anxious future with no current university place, leaving students and parents angry and confused. Parfitt-Ford, from Ealing in west London, said that despite getting the grades he was predicted, he could not stand by and watch his friends and cohort “getting the grades they don’t deserve”. “I saw that classes of more than 15 people would be calculated without any reference to teachers’ predicted grades, and I thought that wasn’t right,” he told the Guardian. “We will end up in the situation where young people are judged by the school’s background and not wholly on their own abilities. It is our contention that that is outside of Ofqual’s jurisdiction. Their job is to assess individual performance. “We hope we won’t have to, but we’re ready to proceed to the high court if we need to.” Parfitt-Ford’s crowdfunding page has amassed more than £17,000 in donations in less than two days and he is being represented by a legal team from Leigh Day and Foxglove. Parfitt-Ford, who received A*A*AA, described the now suspended appeals process as “ridiculous and insane”, but said he was glad it was being reviewed following a late-night decision by Ofqual on Saturday just hours after it published its criteria for appeals based on mock exam results. “It was an interesting thing to witness at 10pm,” he said. “We are obviously slightly confused and I think teachers and students are too. Ofqual can’t make up their own minds, never mind produce a coherent statement. The government is playing politics with our futures.” In a 22-page letter to Ofqual, Parfitt-Ford’s legal team described the model used to determine grades as “irrational, arbitrary, fails to take account of relevant considerations” and claimed it was unlawful. He added that the action sought to “force [Ofqual] to come up with a fairer system”. Data from Ofqual shows that independent schools saw an increase of 4.7% in the number of students securing A or A* grades from 2019, compared with 2% for state schools and just 0.3% for further education colleges. One of the students taking legal action, whose name was given as Michael, saw his grades fall from a predicted BBB to EEE. Dan Rosenberg, an education lawyer at Simpson Millar, who is representing several A-level students, said his firm had been overwhelmed by enquiries from others in a similar position. “All of them speak of the emotional distress and uncertainty that this has caused,” he said. “We would urge the government to act quickly to resolve this matter and to make sure that those who are still awaiting their GCSE results later this week do not have to suffer in the same way.” Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, said: “If you don’t go to a successful school, you don’t deserve to succeed either – strip away all the science, and that’s what’s delivered by the system Ofqual and Gavin Williamson have put in place. “It’s not fair, it’s not good enough, and hard-working students should not have to stand for it.” Ofqual has been contacted for comment.",education
"The late-night suspension of Ofqual’s criteria under which students can challenge their A-level grades, only hours after the policy was published, has left young people hoping to appeal even more confused. Some of them share their stories below. “Government regulators shouldn’t be releasing statements and taking them back all of a sudden. I can’t rescind and review my Ucas statement. The only way forward is to use the centre assessment grades (CAGs). They are facing 280,000 appeals potentially, the manpower that will take is insane – it’s impossible. I’ve spent two days on the phone and emailing my ‘firm’ and ‘insurance’ choice universities back and forth. “I feel intense frustration, anxiety and do not believe that my result, ABB, fairly represents me in comparison to my CAGs or even my mock results. I achieved higher mock grades than my calculated Ofqual grades, which saw me rejected by Bristol and Exeter. This means that it is a possibility that I will not be attending university. I can’t help but think back to the prime minister’s speech in March, when he promised: ‘We will make sure that pupils get the academic qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career.’”  “I have been completely disregarded during this whole process, after taking a year out to improve my grades. It’s so disheartening. I was predicted AAB but received BBD. I think it was all wrong from the beginning, the way they dealt with the whole situation. If you’re from a certain area, you’re more likely to come away with grades you’ve never received in your life. “My school has told everyone they’re going to go for an overall appeal of all subjects; I’m not sure how that is going to pan out and I’m not going to rely on it. I’m planning to resit in the autumn because I don’t think the appeal is going to change much for me. I haven’t got confidence in it. It’s not going to change in time. It just doesn’t make sense to me.” “It’s completely disorganised, and they had prior warning as the same thing happened in Scotland. My grades are not good enough for any courses I deserve to be on, so I have no choice but to appeal once we are able to. But so far I’ve not had any confidence in what the government has proposed regarding A-levels. Still, the initial advice on appeals made no sense, so I’m glad they’re changing it. “I moved from south-west London after my GCSEs to north Devon to complete my A-levels and I have suffered extreme downgrading – likely due to my new postcode. My classmates in London who achieved the same GCSE results as me experienced much less downgrading, while I lost my place at Exeter despite my offer being highly achievable. I feel a huge and very clear injustice has taken place across poorer areas, and this should not be the case. If I had continued my education in London then I would not be in this position.” “My school has recommended I appeal against all my assigned grades. After that, I’m not sure of what to do. I just feel utterly let down and betrayed by the system. If they can use CAGs, that would be the best thing. These announcements have created a great level of uncertainty. My place at Edinburgh hangs in the balance. It’s been incredibly stressful, because this is my future. “As an autistic person with dyspraxia, I have had to fight to succeed at every step of my education. I achieved nine GCSEs and in year 12 I received three As in my end-of-year exams. I was absolutely determined to prove that I was more than capable of succeeding. My centre-based assessment graded me at two As and a B, but Ofqual lowered my results by five grades in total, awarding me three Cs. I feel utterly cheated.”",education
"The government has abandoned the awarding of A-level and GCSE results in England based on computer modelling, in favour of teacher-assessed grades. But the decision may create a new set of problems. A decision to revert to teacher-assessed grades will be welcomed by many, after the manifold injustices of last week’s A-level results, and none more so than the unfortunate teenagers whose lives have been thrown into chaos by the uncertainty triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, many in the sector point out that teacher assessments – or centre assessed grades (CAG) as they have become known – are not a perfect solution and may create their own inequalities. While teachers will have done their best to be fair and accurate, inevitably and unavoidably individual schools will have taken a different approach when drawing up grades for each pupil in each subject. Some will have been more cautious, and their students will unfortunately pay the price for others who have been more optimistic. Some critics also worry about teacher bias affecting assessments, but at this late stage most commentators seem to be converging on the view that while CAGs are not ideal, they are a better option than Ofqual’s deeply flawed algorithm. Covid-19 has already been devastating for universities, like so many other sectors, but with strong domestic numbers holding up they may have dared to think they were finally turning a corner. However, the government’s U-turn in England throws them back into a spin. Students who lost out on their first-choice university because of lower than expected moderated grades will now understandably seek redress, creating problems of capacity, staffing, placements and facilities, particularly with the social distancing requirements that will be in place when students arrive in September. Nick Hillman, the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, warned: “The university admissions round usually last for months. Universities try to look at candidates as individuals and to make careful and considered judgments, just as the government has repeatedly urged them to do. “If you rip up the rules after the results are out and with only a few weeks to go before the academic year starts, it is a major challenge. Institutions will do their best by their applicants but there are always limits, internally imposed and externally imposed, on how much they can expand and that is doubly true when social distancing rules are in force.” The lifting of the emergency cap on student numbers will ease the pressure to a degree. It was introduced earlier in the year to try to prevent the damaging effects of competition for students between institutions seeking to recruit more UK students to replace the international students staying away because of coronavirus. The cap applied in England would be each institution’s previous forecast intake, plus 5%. As Hillman points out, lifting it will not help much if you want to do medicine, because the numbers will still be controlled by the Department for Health and it will not ease the physical capacity constraints at your average Oxbridge college. “But there are, I think, quite a few circumstances where it will genuinely help. For example, you may well have spare places because of a reduction in international students,” he says.  When exams were cancelled, the government asked the exam regulator Ofqual to come up with a standardisation model that would award results to pupils but would avoid inflating grades. Grade inflation has been an obsession for the Conservatives, who – led by Michael Gove as the then education secretary – drew up an entirely new set of qualifications to help put a stop to what they saw as corrosive, year-on-year inflation under previous administrations. The Ofqual algorithm was effective in producing relatively similar national results to previous years – as it was designed to – but with the scrapping of the algorithm, and a return to the use of centre assessed grades there will inevitably be grade inflation. Last month, Ofqual said initial analysis suggested that if all students were given final grades based solely on CAGs, overall A-level results for England would be up compared with 2019 by 6 percentage points at A*, 12 percentage points at A and above, and 13 percentage points at B and above. At GCSE overall results would be up by 6 percentage points at grade 7 and above, and up by 9 percentage points at grade 4 and above.  For students that follow, particularly those now in year 12 due to sit their exams next summer, the fear is that their grades will look inferior and that university places that would have otherwise been available to them may be taken up by students forced to defer this year.

"Gavin Williamson and Ofqual have apologised to students and their parents, as they announced that all A-level and GCSE results in England will be based on teacher-assessed grades. In a spectacular U-turn, the education secretary announced the government would scrap the controversial standardisation model drawn up by the exams regulator to award grades in lieu of exams. Instead, both A-levels and GCSE results will revert to centre-assessed grades, which were submitted by schools earlier this summer. “We worked with Ofqual to construct the fairest possible model, but it is clear that the process of allocating grades has resulted in more significant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process,” Williamson said, in remarks released by his department. “We now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher assessed grades for both A- and AS level and GCSE results. I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents, but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve.” The climbdown comes after days of turmoil triggered by the publication of A-level results last Thursday, when almost 40% of predicted results were downgraded, with some students marked down two or even three grades, which resulted in many losing university places. The move had looked inevitable after Wales said it would revert to teacher assessments for A-levels, and Northern Ireland said it would do so for GCSEs, following a similar U-turn in Scotland last week. Hundreds of pupils took to the streets of London, demonstrating outside the Department for Education to express their anger, while others took to the airwaves and social media to describe their sense of devastation. Lawyers had began to consider taking action on behalf of affected teenagers. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed what he called the “screeching U-turn”, saying: “This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week. However, the Tories’ handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco. “Incompetence has become this government’s watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes. Boris Johnson’s failure to lead is holding Britain back.” Ministers had been under increasing pressure to act with GCSE results due to be published this Thursday for more than 600,000 year 11 pupils in England and 100,000 older students aiming for crucial passes in maths and English to qualify them for further training or study. The algorithm used by Ofqual for both A-levels and GCSEs was mainly based on a school’s past results and individual pupil attainment. Teachers and schools were asked to submit grades, known as centre-assessed grades, but in the end these were influential in only a small number of cases. Ofqual argued that the algorithm was essential to ensure results were standardised across the country and in line with previous years, but hundreds of individual stories documenting disappointment and an overwhelming sense of injustice among those affected proved too much to ignore. Ofqual confirmed its decision to award centre assessment grades (CAG) to A-level, AS-level and GCSE students, adding that where a moderated grade was higher than a CAG, students could keep that grade. Roger Taylor, Ofqual’s chair, acknowledged the standardised system had caused widespread anguish and damaged public confidence, and apologised to those affected. “We understand this has been a distressing time for students, who were awarded exam results last week for exams they never took. The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible, and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks,” he said. “After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS- and A-levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week. “There was no easy solution to the problem of awarding exam results when no exams have taken place. Ofqual was asked by the secretary of state [Gavin Williamson] to develop a system for awarding calculated grades, which maintained standards and ensured that grades were awarded broadly in line with previous years. Our goal has always been to protect the trust that the public rightly has in educational qualifications. “But we recognise that while the approach we adopted attempted to achieve these goals, we also appreciate that it has also caused real anguish and damaged public confidence. Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry. “The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone else affected by this issue.” The Worth Less? campaign group, which represents hundreds of secondary school headteachers, welcomed the U-turn. “It’s a relief that this whole unedifying mess has some form of closure,” said Jules White, a secondary school headteacher and leader of Worth Less? “Students will get a much fairer deal and everyone can be pleased with that. “Major questions remain, though: why has it taken the DfE so long to resolve matters? Why have Ofqual and the DfE just spent time blaming each other rather than acting on behalf of children, their families and schools? “And crucially, how can we move confidently to wider school reopening when our political masters don’t understand how schools actually work?” Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT school leaders’ union, said: “The government has decided to rely on centre assessed grades for A level and GCSE results this year, agreeing that these are the most reliable measure of student performance. “School leaders and teachers worked with professionalism and integrity to submit these grades for all of their students. Having taken so long to make a decision, this was the only option that government had left to deal with the unfairness.“This decision will mean students expecting their GCSE results can have confidence that they will not experience the same unfairness or disadvantage as their older peers.“The big question remains as to why this decision has taken so long to come, as it may already be too late for some A level students who have already missed out on their first choice of university and course. Every day of delay is going to have loaded more and more difficulty onto universities and their capacity to meet all of the demand for places that will now inevitably come their way. For them, the problem is far from over.”",education

"A-level results day is a rollercoaster even in the best of times, but with the summer series of exams cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and pressure on Westminster to address concerns about unfairness in England’s results, it’s likely to be particularly challenging for many of the 250,000 students collecting their results this year. Hopefully this will help you stay calm and consider your options. It’s a rite of passage, turning up at school to collect your results and share the joy/disappointment with your classmates. This year, because of the pandemic, things will be a little different. Check with your school. Some are doing it remotely, via email, others are inviting some – or all – their pupils in, but the usual public health measures will apply to avoid transmission of the virus, so celebratory hugs will not be encouraged. With about 40% of teacher-assessed grades downgraded by the regulator’s standardisation process, there will be lots of upset students and lots to talk about. Teachers will be on hand to give advice. Don’t panic. Talk to your school in the first place, who will be able to tell you your centre-assessed grade (CAG), which is the assessment provided to exam boards by your teachers, so you’ll be able to see if and how far it has been marked down during the moderation process and decide your next steps. Don’t beat yourself up. Bear in mind this is happening to thousands of other students up and down the country, because there were no exams and the alternative system they’ve arrived at is far from ideal. This is proving to be a bit of a moving picture. Up until recently the exams regulator, Ofqual, seemed to be making it as difficult as possible for pupils in England to appeal. Only schools were allowed to lodge appeals, and then only on rather narrow, technical grounds, and there was no opportunity for individual pupils to appeal against their grades on academic grounds. Earlier this week however, following Scotland’s decision to allow students to keep their CAGs in response to public outcry, ministers decided to allow students in England to use their mock exam results as a possible route of appeal. There are lots of doubts about this proposal among the experts, but you don’t have to worry about that. If your result has been downgraded and your mock result was better than the result you receive on Thursday, you can ask to appeal through your school. It’s not an entirely straightforward process – the mock result will need to be validated – but teachers will be keen to help you get the best result possible. Ofqual will outline further details on how the mock route of appeal will work next week. But if that route is not open to you, you still have the option to actually sit your A-levels exams later this year, if you think you can do better than the grade allocated. Ask your school or college to enter you if you want to take an exam, and make sure to take all the papers in your chosen subjects, then use whichever result is higher when applying for university or jobs. Universities have been urged to be as flexible as possible this year. They are also keen to recruit domestic students because they are concerned that their international students might not turn up in such great numbers in September because of the Covid pandemic. Similarly, because there are relatively few 18-year-olds in this cohort, your chances of securing a place at university may be better than in other years. So talk to your university of choice. They may be happy to admit you, even with slightly lower grades, in what everyone recognises is a difficult year, or if not on your first choice of course, they may offer you an alternative course which you might consider. And if you decide to appeal, universities have been asked to hold places open for students in your position so you won’t be at a disadvantage. Failing that, don’t forget clearing. Last year 70,000 students got places through the university admission service Ucas’s clearing system, which matches students with vacancies. With Britain having entered the deepest recession since records began, the job prospects for this year’s school leavers look bleak. Official figures published on Wednesday showed the economy shrank by more than any other major nation during the coronavirus outbreak in the three months to June. A survey by Prospects Luminate in May found that 28% of final-year university students have had job offers withdrawn or deferred since the outbreak of the pandemic. Employment traditionally popular with school leavers and university students, such as hospitality, has been hit particularly hard. Gap years are traditionally a popular option but may not be feasible due to the pandemic, with many students deciding to reconsider travelling this year. There was widespread panic when countries began closing their borders in March, with companies having to assist students to return to the UK. Many students have had to accept refunds for their trips or have decided to defer them until next year. If you do decide to take a gap year, the up side is that you will be given the opportunity to take the A level exams you missed if you want to. The government has said students will be able to take the exams for free in the autumn (October and November), and – if they don’t get the results they want then – they can also pay to have another crack in April 2021. Apprenticeships offer school leavers the opportunity to not only continue their education but also to gain valuable experience within a working environment. But the sharp economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic has also led to a steep decline in the number of people starting apprenticeships. Data published by the Department for Education late last month showed the number of young people starting apprenticeships between 23 March and 30 June fell by just over 73% compared with the same period last year, with 7,740 taking them up. However, the government recently announced incentives worth up to £2,000 for employers who take on apprentices aged under 25, so it is still worth enquiring if you are interested in this option. There are websites and job boards that provide information specifically for young people looking to find an apprenticeship, including the National Apprenticeship Service, Centre of Apprenticeships and Not Going To Uni, which currently has 717 new opportunities.

"There is nowhere better to get started with climate activism than at university, believes Kai Saunders, a Warwick University student and member of the UK Youth Climate Coalition (UKYCC). “The university space is incredible in terms of a lot of people collectivising around these issues they care about,” says the 20-year-old. For that reason when you arrive at uni the chances are that you’ll quickly bump into like-minded people who have already set up active societies and groups you can join. Often these are affiliated with national campaigning organisations such as UKYCC, Extinction Rebellion (XR) and People & Planet. They might also be independent, an option that gives them more freedom on what to focus on with their campaigns. Whichever form they take, they’re always looking for new and enthusiastic members. Through your university network on social media you might spot information about these groups. For example, Saunders noticed the calls for people to join Warwick University’s arm of UKYCC via a shared Facebook post. If not, one failsafe way to find them is by attending the freshers’ fair, where you can chat with existing members and sign up. Put yourself out there, advises Polly Silk, a student at the University of Bristol and a member of its XR group. “The best way to get involved is to speak to other people and find out what’s going on. It can seem cliquey, but climate activism should never be like that. You’ll always be able to find someone friendly to go along with and volunteers are always needed.” And if there aren’t groups already established at your university? Well, then it’s much simpler than you might think to set up your own. When Dominique Palmer arrived at the University of Birmingham last year, she and seven other students created their own branch of XR. To secure funding and book meeting rooms, they had to sign up to the Guild of Societies (an umbrella organisation which has an equivalent at every uni), but by November they were ready to go. Only a few months later and they have 50 members, says the 20-year-old political science and international relations student. She’d encourage any students not to be intimidated by the idea of starting something from scratch too. “Start the process by reaching out to different university groups on social media. Once you have a small group that’s all you need. Don’t think you need a massive organisation set up. Everything starts as a small group of people and expands from there.” A fascination with the environment and his research projects at Loughborough led Simon Alsbury to set up a net-zero consultancy Simon Alsbury has a lot to thank his student activism for. His job as cofounder of net-zero energy consultancy Energise is so connected that his sustainability campaigning at the University of Loughborough resulted in his first two work projects. Having spent many childhood holidays with his grandparents in rural Cumbria, Alsbury says he’d always been fascinated by the environment. By sixth form he’d set up a school recycling scheme and when he joined Loughborough to study ergonomics, he got involved with environmental campaigning. As a result, he was elected ethics and environment officer for the students’ union by the end of his first year and led a series of projects, including a competition between halls of residence to reduce energy use and ensuring Fairtrade chocolate and coffee were on sale at the university’s cafes. Spotting his good work, Loughborough offered him a part-time role improving sustainability at the university, alongside his degree for the final two years of study. Coming up to graduation he was working with the NUS on national research projects, he recalls, and bidding to the likes of Coca Cola to look into energy use at universities. Then, as he finished his degree and was weighing up job opportunities, he was offered one of the projects as a consultancy contract to take on himself. From there he took the leap to set up his own consultancy business. “Those were projects one and two,” he says. “We’re just starting on project 1,920.” Energise now works with firms of all sizes to hit net-zero in their energy use. Alsbury still collaborates with the NUS on sustainability projects. “I am very thankful for the student experience I got,” he says.",education
"Teachers and school leaders in England have reacted with anger to the government’s 11th-hour decision to allow mock exams as a route of appealing against A-level and GCSE grades, describing developments as “a rolling disaster” and “a national outrage”. The fudged announcement was made just hours before this year’s A-level results were delivered to schools. They will be published on Thursday and 250,000 students will find out the grades they have been awarded, based on an algorithm conceived by the regulator Ofqual in the absence of exams. Early feedback from school leaders, anxiously reviewing their results, indicates there is likely to be widespread disappointment and claims of unfairness. One headteacher said in the most extreme case one of her students had been downgraded from a C to a U as a result of the standardisation process. Another said pupils who made progress since GCSE had lost out significantly. One school leader said his pupils’ results confirmed “the intrinsic unfairness in the system” drawn up by Ofqual. Many are finding results have been marked down by one grade. Few – if any – however, thought mocks were the solution. “We’ve had poor sets of results in the past where you feel miserable and you think you’ve let students down. Today the feeling is one of anger,” said Alan Brookes, chair of the Kent Association of Headteachers and the executive head of Fulston Manor school in Sittingbourne. “We are angry because we’ve done everything we think we can. But you can’t look children in the eye tomorrow and say ‘you got what you deserved’. Tomorrow, I fear there will be a lot of students going, ‘I didn’t deserve that. That’s not fair.’ I think they will feel awful.” Brookes, who has been in teaching for 44 years and a headteacher for 24, described developments on exam results as a rolling disaster. “I believe that the results being issued to schools this morning ahead of tomorrow’s publication are demonstrating the intrinsic unfairness in the system that has been devised. “Not only does it penalise individual students who have worked exceptionally hard only to find themselves downgraded by an algorithm constructed to produce a national statistical model that is in some way deemed to be ‘acceptable’, it also demonstrates a continuing lack of trust in the profession and fails to recognise the work that schools have put into moderating their own centre-assessed grades ahead of submission.” On mocks, he said: “The incredibly late announcement of changes to the system given by the secretary of state last night – four days after universities were issued with the results – does little or nothing to address the problems. “The suggestion of using mock grades completely fails to recognise the wide disparity between how such grades are reached – schools complete these at different times, some set whole unseen papers, others certain sections – and also misunderstands that many will use these results as a motivational tool for students, potentially depressing grades to provide a ‘wake-up call’. “Very few students fail to improve their grades between mocks and final exams – that is largely the point of them – so suggesting that this measure provides reassurance is simply wrong.” Richard Sheriff, the executive headteacher of Harrogate grammar school and chief executive of the Red Kite Learning Trust, said: “To wake up to news that the secretary of state has made a decision to change the way grades are awarded is truly shocking. “The fact that the we learnt about this via the media and there has been no consultation, communication or consideration given to the profession feels like a huge blow to the relationship we have with our government. “The use of ‘mock examinations’ to award grades is totally inappropriate. Indeed it is impossible for those subjects and centres who have not had the opportunity to have a ‘mock’ this year. You can imagine the confusion and disappointment for students and parents, let alone the panic at universities as they try and deal with this set of events.” Theo Nickson, co-headteacher of Bishop’s Hatfield girls’ school in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, said the idea of using mock results was ludicrous. “This is an absolutely ridiculous idea. We’ve not received any guidance on this – who will validate the mocks? I can’t for the life of me see how they can make mocks work.” Nickson, who said she understood the need for a standardisation process, said results for her school showed a number of grades had been changed – including one student whose results went down from a C to a U, which will be the subject of an appeal, as well as a number of upgrades. More striking, however, was the difference between awarding bodies. Two made no changes to centre-assessed grades – in other words, teacher assessments – a third made a small number of changes, and a fourth “made a lot”. Nevertheless, as long as there was the scope to appeal where required, Nickson said: “I actually feel relatively confident that students will get what they need to move on.” One media studies teacher at a secondary school in north London, who asked not to be named, said: “We all know that mock exam results tend to be lower than a student’s actual final exam result. Students develop hugely in knowledge and understanding of the topic as a result of these mocks. I feel anxious and concerned that their hard work won’t be fully recognised. These are hard times and they need every support we can give them.” A head of history at a large London comprehensive said in his entire 11-year teaching career he had never encountered a student who performed better in their mocks than the real event in June. “Mock exams are specifically designed to challenge students while they are still part-way through the syllabus, and department heads like me deliberately set tougher grading systems than the ones used by the exam boards in the summer. “It’s impossible for mock exams to be a fair reflection of student ability, and offering students the ‘opportunity’ to use their mock results in place of a computer-generated average result is unfair and inadequate. This glib decision is going to negatively impact tens of thousands of young people. It’s a national outrage.”",education
"School leaving exams were cancelled, postponed or adapted because of the coronavirus crisis in countries across Europe, but most have avoided the rows, recriminations and abrupt about-turns experienced in the UK. In a few countries, school-leaver exams were maintained or only slightly delayed. Germany’s 16 states, which decide education policy, were initially divided over whether the Abitur exams that are required in order to be accepted for university should go ahead. Despite nationwide school closures until Easter and the opposition of some state governments, which had wanted grades to be awarded on coursework and school tests, the 16 states agreed in late March that the exams should take place as planned. Some students protested, pleading health concerns, revision difficulties and undue psychological pressure, but the exams were held – in well-aired classrooms rather than big halls, and with smaller numbers of students sitting at least 1.5 metres apart. In the event, several states reported results that were marginally higher than usual, thanks – educationalists speculate – less to a subconscious “corona-bonus” during marking than to the fact that Germany’s Covid-19 restrictions meant students had fewer distractions and were more focused on their work. In Italy, about 500,000 students took the oral part of their high-school diploma exams in mid-June, the first time they had returned to school since early March. The exam’s written papers were cancelled and students had to wear face masks. The Czech Republic and Slovakia postponed end-of-school exams, but France cancelled its entire baccalauréat exam programme for the first time since its introduction under Napoleon in 1808. The oral component of the exam went ahead even amid the protests and national upheaval of May 1968. The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, announced in April that the country’s 740,000 final-year students would be awarded an average grade for each subject based on coursework and tests during the first two terms. Local juries assessed and – if necessary – adjusted students’ grades according to national averages and on schools’ past examination records. The pass rate for the 2020 bac was over 95%, more than seven percentage points higher than the previous year, forcing the government last month to create about 10,000 extra university places for September in the most popular subject areas. The Netherlands, too, recorded a higher pass rate after its central school leaving exams were cancelled, with schools awarding final marks on the basis of course work and the schools’ own tests, which pupils were also allowed to resit. A survey by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad found almost five times as many high schools as usual reported a 100% pass rate. The education ministry has rejected claims that the high pass rate meant the exams had been devalued. “This group of pupils had to take school exams under unexpected and difficult circumstances,” a spokeswoman told the newspaper, adding that the cancellation of the central exams meant pupils had more time to study for the school exams. Candidates for Spain’s university entrance exam, the selectividad, were allowed this year to choose three out of five questions, and were not examined on anything studied since the country entered lockdown in mid-March. Overall, the Spanish pass rate was within one percentage point of the result for 2019. The only discrepancy was that in Catalonia 67% more scored above 9 – out of a possible 10 – than in the previous year. ",education
"Universities in England needing bailouts to survive the impact of Covid-19 will have to “demonstrate their commitment” to free speech as well as closing courses with low graduate pay, Gavin Williamson has announced. The education secretary laid out stringent conditions for universities facing bankruptcy to receive government loans – including the scrapping of “low-value” courses with high dropout rates or whose graduates did not often end up in skilled employment – and said institutions would close or be taken over if they failed to make a strong business case. “We need a future [higher education] sector which delivers the skills the country needs: universities should ensure courses are consistently high quality and focus more heavily upon subjects which deliver strong graduate employment outcomes in areas of economic and societal importance, such as Stem, nursing and teaching,” Williamson said. It has been forecast that 10 universities in England face long-term financial struggle following the lockdown. University leaders are anxiously looking towards how many students arrive on campus in autumn. The Department for Education’s guidance said it would “require assurance that providers are fully complying with their legal duties to secure freedom of speech” before granting emergency loans. However, the University and College Union (UCU) accused the government of using the pandemic to enforce political objectives taken from the Conservative party’s election manifesto. “Higher education is one of the few things we remain a world leader in, yet the government is prepared to exploit universities’ financial difficulties to impose evidence-free ideology and reduce the diversity and strength in depth of university courses and research,” said Jo Grady, UCU’s general secretary. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “Instead of using this crisis as an excuse to centralise control over universities and force through cuts to courses, the government should pledge that no university will be allowed to go bust.” The DfE’s guidance states that emergency loans would only be considered if there was “a clear economic and value-for-money case” and that closure would “cause significant harm to the national or local economy or society”. While protecting the welfare of current students was listed as a top priority, the DfE said “not all providers will be prevented from exiting the market. Any intervention should be a last-resort measure after all other finance options have been exhausted.” Graham Galbraith, the vice-chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, said the sector would be pleased with any promise of government support but that it needed to define how to assess the value of undergraduate courses. “It will be vital for government to benchmark ‘strong learner outcomes’ data to work out the distance travelled by a university’s students. How much a student improves at university is a proper value-for-money measure. Without this, government risks throwing taxpayers’ money at coasting universities who recruit high-attaining students who would have succeeded anyway,” Galbraith said. Emergency loans would be approved by the education secretary after a recommendation from a newly established higher education restructuring board and an independent business review carried out by DfE-appointed advisers. The review would examine “refocusing provision on high-quality courses” and whether other courses could instead be offered at sub-degree level by further education (FE) colleges. Advisers would look at savings in administration costs – “including but not limited to senior executive pay” – as well as asset sales and the closure of unviable campuses. It would also consider “options for merger, consolidation and service sharing, including with FE”. Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of higher education institutions, said: “We would encourage government to be more ambitious, to go beyond a small number of universities in financial need, and to use this as an opportunity to help universities to undertake innovative changes to maximise their contributions to the economy and meet the needs of students and employers,” said Alistair Jarvis, UUK’s chief executive. Williamson said an institution’s free speech policies would be included in any decision. Student unions would be required to focus on “serving the needs of the wider student population rather than subsidising niche activism and campaigns,” he said. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, the National Union of Students’ vice-president for higher education, said: “It is students’ unions and universities who have stepped up to support their local communities during the pandemic and filled the gaps in support left by government just like our precious public services.”",education
"The children’s commissioner for England has called for a complete overhaul of early years services, plus a government-funded rescue package to prevent mass closures of nurseries and childcare providers that could go under as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The childcare sector has been hit hard by lockdown, with surveys suggesting as many as one in four nurseries and pre-schools could close within the year, rising to one in three in the deprived areas where children benefit most from early intervention. As well as an injection of emergency funding, commissioner Anne Longfield urged ministers to use the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity for a wholesale review of the sector and to make early years a central building block of a national recovery plan. “Nurseries and early years support play a vital role in helping children prepare for school,” said Longfield, “but coronavirus and lockdown have put many at risk of closure. The consequences could be thousands of children missing out on vital support that sets them on a path to a good education and better prospects.” Her report, Best Beginnings, acknowledges that successive governments have invested more in early years in England, but said the system is disjointed and often fails to target disadvantaged children in greatest need of early intervention, undermining their life chances. According to the report, last year 29% of all five-year-olds – and 45% of those eligible for free school meals – were below the expected level of development by the time they go to school. The 13% (82,000) who fail to meet targets in half or more of the 17 early learning goals are five times as likely to end up being excluded by age 10. They are also more likely to struggle with reading and writing at 11, to leave school with no GCSEs and are more likely to suffer some form of mental ill health and be obese. Among her recommendations, Longfield calls on the government to develop “a national infrastructure” of children and family hubs that provide a gateway to wraparound support services. The report also suggested a “family guarantee” of support for under-fives and their families to make sure all children have the help they need to be ready to start school, with more health visitors and increased funding for early help and troubled families services. It also recommends an expanded childcare offer of 30 hours universal free childcare and early education for all two, three and four-year-olds, and 15 free hours for all one-year-olds. “The government must make the early years a priority and drive reforms so that all children start school ready and able to learn and progress,” said Longfield. “Alongside high-quality early education, this means making sure that every family is guaranteed the support they need to help their young child to thrive, and to prevent early challenges turning into serious problems.” Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed the commissioner’s call for an emergency recovery package for the sector, as well as a wholesale review of early years, but urged caution on any extension of the childcare offer that could place more pressure on an already struggling sector. “For years, nurseries, pre-schools and childminders have faced a fight for survival as a result of wholly inadequate funding levels. With the coronavirus pandemic placing even more pressure on provider finances, the fact is that many settings simply won’t survive if the government doesn’t take urgent action.” Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, stressed the role of childcare in economic recovery. “Childcare is absolutely essential for working parents and to our economic recovery from coronavirus. But it has been ignored by the government in this crisis, with the early years sector consistently excluded from support packages. “We were already losing hundreds of nurseries and childminders every month before this crisis hit, due to years of underfunding. It’s time for ministers to get serious about supporting families in this pandemic and step in with a proper plan to save the childcare sector.” The Department for Education insisted the government had protected early years settings throughout the pandemic with significant financial and business support, including through the coronavirus job retention scheme. A spokesman added: “We are investing in early years organisations to help them boost disadvantaged children’s development, with grants targeted at improving outcomes for young children at risk of falling behind by age five, and for those with special educational needs.”",education
"The universities minister has intensified her attack on the higher education sector in England, warning that “true social mobility” is not about increasing the number of disadvantaged students going to university but about their outcomes. Michelle Donelan told MPs on the education select committee “it doesn’t matter about looking at which groups don’t get to university”, and said higher education “is not necessarily the best route to get to where you want to go in life”. She did however highlight some of the government’s future expectations for the sector, calling on universities to offer more degree apprenticeships and invest more in part-time education to help boost skills for the post-Covid economy. Her comments are likely to send a chill through the sector which has prioritised improving access for disadvantaged groups, spending millions of pounds on widening participation schemes to improve social mobility and life chances. As a result there are now record numbers of disadvantaged students going to university, the committee heard. Donelan pointed out however that while 59.1% of black young people under 19 now progress to higher education, there is still a 20% attainment gap between black and white students “which is simply not good enough”. In a speech earlier this month, the minister said young people had been “taken advantage of” and misled by the expansion of university courses with no real demand from the labour market. Donelan told MPs on Wednesday that social mobility was more than just target-driven box-ticking. “I really think we need to move away from this focus on how many students go to university. It’s such a blunt instrument,” she said. “It is not actually very accurate in terms of social mobility. “If a student goes to university and then drops out after year 1 and has a year’s debt, what does that deliver for their social mobility? Nothing. In fact it sets them back in life. It’s about them completing high quality academically rigorous courses that then lead to graduate jobs, and that’s the important measure we should be looking at.” Her comments follow a speech by education secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this month in which he set out plans to promote further education and ditch a long-held target to get 50% of young people in England to go to university. Building on his theme, the universities minister told MPs: “We don’t necessarily want everybody to go to university … Whether you are advantaged or disadvantaged, higher education is not necessarily the best route to get where you want in life.” Responding to Labour MP Ian Mearns, who said it was unlikely someone would become permanent secretary at the Department for Education without a degree, Donelan said she knew lots of people who had been successful in life without a degree, and they should be mentioned to illustrate there are other routes to success. Donelan, a graduate of the University of York, was also asked about the financial crisis facing a number of universities, which are likely to lose considerable income if fewer international students choose to come to study in the UK following the Covid-19 pandemic. A recent report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies said as many as 13 British universities could face financial disaster from the after-effects of the coronavirus. Rather than a bailout, the minister said the government would announce details of a “restructuring regime” as “a last resort”, but warned there would be conditions attached to any additional funding. The minister also addressed high salaries among vice-chancellors and senior university staff, praising those who volunteered for pay cuts of 10-30% during the Covid crisis and said she would like to see that continue.",education
"Soraya Hedges took over her secondary school in the Midlands two years ago. It was almost £1m in debt, employed more than 20 supply teachers and had a terrible reputation among local people. But Hedges (not her real name) has overhauled the school and says students have made considerable progress. Two years on, the entry classes are full and attendance has shot up from 89% to 96%, above the national average. Now, though, Hedges is worried for her students and her school’s reputation, as she awaits GCSE and A-level results that this year, because of the pandemic, will not be based on exams. Instead, the exams regulator, Ofqual, has decided that in England and Wales predicted grades will be “standardised” against a student’s prior attainment and, crucially, their school’s historical performance. “I’m so angry,” says Hedges. “This model means one of my year 11s may have performed exactly the same as another child up the road, but because that more privileged school doesn’t have a history of underperformance, their child doesn’t get penalised, mine does.” She points out that a school whose performance declined this year but which has had historically strong results, such as a grammar school, will be rewarded. The idea, devised by Ofqual after a consultation, is to guard against overenthusiastic grading from staff, keen to give their pupils the best chance. But in schools, the decision has caused almost unanimous angst. Leaders are warning that students in rapidly improving schools – likely to be in the most disadvantaged areas – will be penalised for previously poor results, just when they were on track for breakthrough grades. The consequences of a dropped grade could be life-changing. Jon Coles, chief executive of England’s biggest academy trust, United Learning, has joined the argument. Coles, a former director general for schools at the Department for Education, is not usually found railing against official procedure. But United Learning has taken on numerous ailing schools in recent years and he is worried his students could suffer. “In the most stable schools where results have often been the same, it will be fine. But in the more volatile schools, especially where results have improved strongly, they’re going to be undergraded. That’s my worry.” There has already been uproar around results for the International Baccalaureate, graded using a similar method, with teachers shocked by some students’ lower-than-expected grades.  According to Coles’ analysis, Ofqual’s data shows only one third of schools and colleges get pass grades, or above, that are within 2.5 percentage points of the previous year’s results. In other words, for most schools the previous year’s results can’t accurately predict what this year’s will be. This will be particularly true for improving schools. He is calling on colleges, universities and employers to be flexible with their grade entry requirements this year – and for Ofqual to “build a bit of slack or leniency” into results. “They know perfectly well they can’t get it perfectly right, so what they need to do is make sure they don’t unfairly prejudice some children’s life chances. The cost of undergrading is so much higher than the cost of overgrading.” Hedges, meanwhile, cites the example of one pupil, Mara (not her real name), whom she fears might pay a high cost for this year’s grading system. She says she met the girl wandering round the school, soon after she became head two years ago, and asked why she was not in class. “She told me: ‘There’s no point, it’ll be a supply teacher. Why do you want to be a headteacher here? It’s rubbish’.” The head said she escorted Mara to her lesson, where the surprised girl found the new teacher was a fully qualified scientist, recruited by the head to a permanent post. Hedges continues: “During the course of her year 10, I saw Mara go from being 10 minutes late to every lesson and having an excuse for everything, to someone who wanted to be a paramedic. She talked to all the teachers in lunchtime and after class and when lockdown happened she emailed saying, ‘what else can I do?’” Mara’s story could be that of many pupils in the school, almost a third of whom speak English as a second language and about half of whom are on free school meals. Despite Mara’s unsettled schooling in years 7, 8 and 9, the staff have managed to get her to the cusp of the grade 5s she needs for college. “It was going to be tight to get her on the course, but I genuinely think because of her determination and all our work she’d have pulled it off,” the head says. Mara will be “devastated” if she misses her grades, and retaking exams in the autumn, as also suggested by Ofqual, would come too late for her chosen course. The school’s data, shared with the Guardian, shows that last year it accurately predicted student grades across all subjects, even occasionally underpredicting them by 0.1 point. “Ofqual should have looked at how accurately schools predicted their grades in the past, not at the historical results,” the head says. “This is so far from a fair deal.” The data would appear to support Hedges. A study by SchoolDash, which analyses schools in England, suggests more than 5,000 year 11s in rapidly improving schools face losing out under this year’s temporary model. Rob Campbell, chief executive of the Morris Education Trust, in Cambridgeshire, says it would be simpler just to trust teachers’ grades without Ofqual’s “standardisation”. “I’m one of a dying breed who was working the system pre-1992 and before league tables, and we were trusted to make accurate grade predictions. We were utterly professional in making sure our understanding of a C or a D grade was fairly applied. It’s only when you add in accountability measures like we have now that you get distortions in behaviour.” Campbell is particularly concerned that the hard work of his students at Witchford Village College, a struggling school near Ely that joined his trust three years ago, will not be recognised. “When I first walked in there, I’d never seen anything like it. It was so challenging. But two-and-a-half years down the line, it’s a lovely school. The children have bust a gut and I feel bitterly disappointed for them that they’re going to be judged on how the school used to be.” Last week MPs said they were especially worried that black and minority ethnic pupils, and those with special educational needs, could be disadvantaged by the standardisation process. An Ofqual spokesperson said: “While we recognise that for a small number of centres it would be desirable for calculated grades to reflect recent or expected improvements in results, our research into GCSE grading shows the performance of centres rarely improves (or deteriorates) consistently in the short term. On balance, it is therefore best not to try to predict improvements in performance.” The government has promised its “priority will be making sure no pupil is disadvantaged by the cancellation”. For Mara and others like her, only results day will tell.This article was amended on 16 July 2020. A previous version gave an incorrect attendance figure for the Midlands school.

"The sociologist David Morgan, who has died aged 82 of cancer, transformed the way that the family is understood and researched. His first book, Social Theory and the Family (1975), was important in that, unusually for a male sociologist at the time, he took feminism seriously. He suggested that, in order to understand what happens within families, we must understand gender hierarchy. He examined the once broadly held idea that the roles of men and women were just “naturally” different, alongside the feminist argument that family life was based on the unpaid domestic labour of women, which gave men more power both inside and outside the family, and that this was oppressive to women. From here, he went on to develop the highly influential concept of “family practices”, those relationships and activities that are constructed – perceived by family members and shaped by historical and social processes – as being to do with family matters, wherever these occur, both inside and outside the domestic setting. In Family Connections (1996) and, elaborating on his ideas, in Rethinking Family Practices (2011), David proposed a radical and profound change, shifting the focus from the noun “the family” to the verb “doing family”, and towards the many different possibilities in relation to what and who can constitute a family. Thus a rather staid branch of sociology, concerned with the family as an institution, became a vibrant field exploring the ways people experience, work out and “do” their family lives, in all their diversity. We take it for granted now that families are sometimes blended, sometimes multi-generational, certainly not always heterosexual and may even be based on friendship rather than kinship. The widespread acceptance of these different family forms is recent, and sociological understanding of the changes owes much to David’s work, which continues to form the basis of many empirical projects undertaken by researchers in the UK, across Europe and beyond. From 1997 David was a professor, latterly emeritus, at the University of Manchester, where the Morgan Centre for Research into Everyday Lives was named after him in 2005. He was an active member of the centre until a few weeks before his death, joining lively Zoom meetings with colleagues about the ways Covid-19 was transforming our everyday lives. David was especially valued for his support for those in the early stages of their career. He had a gentle way of offering constructive criticism, encouraging the exercise of sociological imagination and indicating that your research was important to him, but never trying to shape it in his image. I first met David in the late 1970s, later working closely with him at Manchester University and interviewing him, in 2014, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the university’s sociology department. He was one of the first sociologists to develop an analysis of masculinity, editing a collection of essays with Jeff Hearn, Men, Masculinities and Social Theory (1990). He undertook research with Jane Lewis and David Clark on the history of marriage guidance in England, and edited Body Matters (1993) with me, and Gender, Bodies and Work (2005) with Berit Brandth and Elin Kvande.  David also brought his sociological gaze to bear on the relationship between cultural production, social networks and friendship in the work of the Bloomsbury Group. He was interested in the ways in which friendship overlapped with patronage and brokerage and how individuals moved between these roles. He extended this interest in social networks in Acquaintances: The Space Between Intimates and Strangers (2009), assessing the extent to which such relationships can provide a sense of location and security in modern life, which we have seen played out in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. David was interested in all aspects of everyday life and the ways in which social interactions were linked to wider social structures and divisions, and in his last book, Snobbery (2018), described snobbery as “a matter of both public disapproval and private enjoyment” and, as one of the ways through which “class divisions are experienced and reproduced”. David was born in London, the son of Louisa (nee Goodchild), an office clerk, and Maurice Morgan, a customer services supervisor and Methodist lay preacher. He grew up in Hatch End and attended Harrow Weald county grammar school. Following two years of national service with the RAF, he went to the University of Hull in 1957, initially to study economics, but opting instead for sociology, his interest piqued because he “knew nothing” about it. He stayed on to undertake doctoral research into the “social and educational origins of Anglican bishops”, finding that almost all of them came from elite backgrounds, privately and Oxbridge-educated. He then joined a research project, at the University of Manchester, on social relations in a Salford factory, which kindled his interest in the sociology of gender. He found camaraderie and solidarity among the female factory workers and explored the relations between them and the male foremen and management – the men had the power and the women used humour to ensure that they had some control. In 1964, David was appointed to a lectureship in the department of social anthropology and sociology, and in the same year married Rosemary Callan; they divorced in 1984. David’s partner from the 1980s onwards was the sociologist Janet Finch. During her appointment as vice-chancellor at Keele University, from 1995 until 2010, they lived on the university’s campus in Staffordshire, and David became an active visiting professor there. He was a longstanding member of the British Sociological Association, its president, 1997-99, and the recipient of its distinguished service award in 2016.  David is survived by Janet, his children, Julian and Jacqueline, from his marriage to Rosemary, and his grandchildren, Harry, Eleanor, Alicia and John.",education
"My friend and former colleague Brian Lee, who has died aged 87, was a leading figure in the development of American studies in the UK, setting up the American studies department at the University of Nottingham in 1977. His published works included The Novels of Henry James: A Study of Culture and Consciousness (1978), Hollywood (1986) and American Fiction: 1865-1940 (1987). Born in Bispham, near Blackpool, to Leonard, a civil servant, and his wife, Ethel, who ran a B&B, Brian went to the local grammar school. After two years’ national service in Egypt (1951-52) he studied English at Bristol University, graduating in the mid-1950s. He undertook postgraduate research on Henry James and was appointed as a lecturer in English at the University of Nottingham in 1959. From that position, despite much internal opposition, in the 70s he and a small group of colleagues set up a sub-department of American studies. I joined soon after, in 1973, as part of a team that would largely stay together until Brian retired 20 years later, having led the department to fully independent status. He was an excellent head of department. A strong believer in equal opportunities, he adopted a selection process of making E grade offers to promising prospective students. This made for a fascinating and lively group of undergraduates. Brian, too, encouraged an American thought and culture strand within the department’s academic portfolio – an exceptional and successful interdisciplinary innovation. And he encouraged his staff to pursue their own lines of research. He was a major figure in the development of film studies at the university and organised conferences and teaching exchanges with some of the most respected European universities.  He enjoyed socialising and sport in equal measure and was a keen player of squash, tennis and, later, golf.

"The University of Hull has launched an investigation after a disabled student shared a photo on Twitter showing how its lecture theatres are inaccessible for wheelchair users. The photo shows Sarah-Marie Da Silva, a zoology student, sitting in the doorway of a lecture theatre which has no accessible ramp allowing her proper access to the room. She added in another Tweet: “As a wheelchair user, I don’t have any option ... most days I don’t even have a desk.” Da Silva told the Tab that the university has repeatedly failed to accommodate her disability. The incident occurred last Friday, when she ended up stuck in the corner of the stairwell after realising there was no means for her to get down into the room. “I turned and saw the stairs and panicked, I stopped,” she told the Tab. “The next 10 minutes was people arriving, them looking at me and then sometimes asking what was going on. I just told them I can’t get down and to just go past me.” The first-year student said the problems started with her first lecture in September, in a lecture theatre where access to the room was at floor level. “Everyone walked up the stairs to take their seats and I was left with nowhere to go – no desk, no seats next to me for other students and I’m right next to the lecturer. I was made to feel like an ‘other’,” she said. Da Silva told the Tab she had raised the issue “countless times”. But the student added that, while the university had made room changes for some of her lectures, she still repeatedly found they were held in inaccessible spaces. “A lot of the time there are no desks for me. If there are, they’re moveable desks, but the wheels are always locked and I can’t bend down that far to unlock them, so everyone in the theatre looks on at me whilst I struggle to get a desk,” she told the Tab. Dr Anji Gardner, Hull’s Director of Student Services, said: “We’re very sorry that this has happened, clearly it is not acceptable. We take these matters very seriously and are looking into what has happened. “We are committed to working with our students to put in place any additional support or adjustments where needed. Unfortunately, it is clear this hasn’t happened in this case. We will immediately look into this and ensure that we take necessary steps to make sure this does not happen again.” Piers Wilkinson, disabled students’ officer, for the National Union of Students, said: “Universities across the sector are still consistently failing to provide basic access for disabled students. Disabled students deserve inclusive access to the entire university experience, and that starts with being able to get into our lectures.”",education
"Samuel’s favourite Jewish festival is Pesach, or Passover, which commemorates the exodus of Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The 10-year-old enjoys taking part in the seder, or ritual feast, which marks the start of the holiday. “The food is nice, and we sing songs and tell stories,” he said. This is unusual because Samuel comes from a Colombian Christian family. He and dozens of other non-Jewish children attend an orthodox Jewish school in north London, where he wears a kippah, learns Hebrew and says Jewish prayers day. Against a backdrop of increasing antisemitism, with record numbers of hate incidents reported last year, the Simon Marks Jewish primary school in Stoke Newington is proud of its diversity and message of tolerance. “If you teach non-Jewish children about the Jewish faith, they’re likely to have a positive attitude later in life,” headteacher Gulcan Metin-Asdoyuran – who is from a Turkish Muslim background – told the Observer. The school, which is affiliated to the United Synagogue, a union of modern orthodox synagogues in the UK, is split almost equally between Jewish and non-Jewish pupils. Among the non-Jews are Christians, Muslims, Jehovah’s Witnesses and children of no faith. The teaching and support staff are equally diverse. Alongside the national curriculum, the 117 pupils have two hours of Jewish studies each week. They learn about other faiths “through a Jewish lens”, said the head, who is known as Ms Metin. They recently visited a mosque; trips to a Buddhist temple and a Sikh gurdwara are planned. The school uniform includes kippot for boys and modest dress for girls; they eat kosher food; repeat Jewish blessings through the day; celebrate Jewish holidays; and finish early on Fridays ahead of Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath. The school also promotes positive messages about Israel. The JNF UK, a charity that works for a “secure, prosperous future for the land and people of Israel”, supports the school through funding for computers so pupils can Skype with Israeli schoolchildren to improve their Hebrew and learn about life in Israel. Samuel said learning Hebrew “helps us to understand other countries and cultures”. Five-year-old Ela, whose family are British Turkish Muslims, said Hebrew was “really fun”. Lori, nine, who has a Jewish-Christian background, said the best thing about the school was that “everyone is different”. Metin moved to Simon Marks three years ago after a stint as head of a non-faith school. “I never thought I’d be appointed. I’ve always been interested in cultural diversity, but I knew very little about being Jewish, about Judaism,” she said. Now she is a “basic Hebrew speaker”. She recruited a consultant rabbi-in-residence to advise her and other non-Jewish staff, and put in place a leadership team with “respect for all faiths”. The school had been struggling academically for some time, but in 2017 Ofsted rated it “good” and Metin hopes for recognition of further improvement in next year’s inspection. Unlike ultra-orthodox Jewish schools, there is no gender segregation and staff respond openly to questions about different kinds of families. “We have children here with two mums or two dads. We follow the chief rabbi’s guidance,” said Metin. In 2018, Ephraim Mirvis said orthodox Jewish schools should support LGBT+ students and families, and have a a zero tolerance approach to homophobic and transphobic bullying. Staff and parents have welcomed her appointment, but Metin said she struggled to create links with nearby ultra-orthodox Jewish schools and other bodies. “There was some resistance among the wider community; it’s been hard to build relationships. But the more we welcomed them in to have conversations with us, the more they reciprocated. But there is still work to do.” Simon Marks has, however, strong links with an Islamic school opposite. The two schools marked Holocaust Memorial Day last month together. “We interact more with them than with independent [ultra-orthodox Jewish] schools,” said Metin. One of her team is Syed Gilani, a practising Muslim, who faced questions from friends and family when he joined the staff four years ago. “We should celebrate diversity,” he said. “There are lots of values in common between Islam and Judaism. We need to expose children to different viewpoints and beliefs to prepare them to become positive global citizens.” Necibe Ozturk, Ela’s mother, said the school had a powerful energy. Her daughter now sometimes prayed in Hebrew at home. “It’s good to pray –it doesn’t matter how you do it as long as you do it. I’m learning through her. There are so many different ethnicities at the school, but it’s like a family and we all learn about each other.” Like other Jewish schools, Simon Marks is surrounded by a tall fence, and security guards monitor comings and goings. Some parents had raised concerns about the word “Jewish” incorporated into the school logo printed on the uniform, fearing abuse, but Metin argued: “We need to be proud of who we are”. There have been no reported incidents of antisemitism. “Lots of people still have stereotypes – they think all Muslim women wear hijabs and all Jewish men wear black coats and have curly sidelocks. Our work is to break that down,” she said. ",education
"Ministers have said more must be done to improve the attainment of disadvantaged pupils in England, after last summer’s exam results showed the gap between children from poor families and their better-off peers had widened further. A breakdown of GCSE results issued by the Department for Education (DfE) showed the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others increased for the second year in a row. The introduction of tougher exams appear to have halted the improvement seen in previous years. “The attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers remains stable and is down by around 9% since 2011, but we recognise there is more to do,” said Nick Gibb, the school standards minister for England. Just 456 of the 143,000 pupils classed as disadvantaged by the DfE achieved top grade 9s in English and maths last summer, compared with 6,132 out of 398,000 other pupils. The DfE classes about one in four state school pupils as disadvantaged, defined as having been eligible for free school meals within the five years before sitting GCSEs or if they have been in care or adopted from care. While more than two-thirds of non-disadvantaged children achieved grade 4 or higher in maths and English, just 36% of those eligible for free school meals did so. Of boys eligible for free school meals, those from mixed white and black Caribbean backgrounds had the weakest results, along with children from Gypsy or Roma families. Of girls eligible, those from a white British background also ranked lowest for attainment in English and maths among the main ethnic groups. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents many secondary school headteachers, criticised the government’s preferred progress measure, arguing that schools with a high number of disadvantaged pupils were likely to suffer. Schools are given a Progress 8 score – measuring the attainment of their pupils at GCSE against their levels when they left primary. “Some groups of disadvantaged pupils make less progress than others because of challenges in their lives, and this can penalise schools with more disadvantaged pupils,” said Duncan Baldwin, deputy director of policy at the ASCL. “Progress scores are also disproportionately skewed by a very small number of pupils with unusually low results which may be outside the school’s control, such as a pupil who misses exams because of a long-term absence. We would therefore urge extreme caution about ranking schools according to this data.” The DfE also published national data on the performance of schools run by multi-academy trusts (Mats). This showed the Star Academies trust based in Blackburn made the fastest progress for its pupils for a second year in a row. “It has always been our mission to improve the life chances of young people in disadvantaged areas by providing them with an excellent standard of education. Our results demonstrate that non-selective schools can compete with the very best in the country and make a real difference for our pupils,” said Hamid Patel, the trust’s chief executive. But the overall figures suggested some multi-academy trusts were far less effective, with almost 40% reporting progress below the national average. “Multi-academy trusts make a significant contribution in terms of helping disadvantaged pupils with progress rates higher than in other types of school. This is encouraging and shows the benefits that can be achieved under the leadership of a strong trust,” Gibb said. Meanwhile, a survey of the British public commissioned by the DfE found “an overwhelming consensus” among UK adults on the importance of studying foreign languages, with 83% saying they should be studied at GCSE level and 61% agreeing that doing so would become more important in 10 years’ time.",education
"When Cardiff University PhD student Grace Krause began getting headaches and back pain after staring at a computer screen for days on end, she decided to speak out online. “Staff are marking hundreds of essays in an impossibly short time. It is exhausting. Everyone is in crisis mode. Stressed, moody, morose, everyone feels like they’re drowning,” she wrote on Twitter.The tweet came after a colleague had killed himself on campus and the inquest cited workload as a factor. Within days, all PhD students received an email referring to the tweet and asking for online comments about students and their work to be deleted. “It was such an emotional and painful thing for a lot of people,” she says. “They could have reached out to fix the problem. Instead, they shut it down.” Krause is one of a growing number of academics convinced her social media accounts are being monitored by her employer. With universities worried about negative press and the impact it might have on student recruitment, management are said to be closing down discussions on workload, classism and sexual harassment on campus.“There are issues of surveillance,” says Steven Jones, researcher in higher education at Manchester Institute of Education. “With universities now so terrified of reputational damage, you can see why this is happening.”Others agree. “There are huge tensions,” says Mark Carrigan, a sociologist in the faculty of education at the University of Cambridge. “On the one hand unis are pushing their staff to be active online, on the other they are assessing their use of social media. We’re going to see ever-more problems.”Universities increasingly recognise the value in academics having a social media presence – it helps recruit students, disseminate research and increase brand awareness. They also, generally, recognise that you don’t achieve this by tightly controlling what academics say – they need to find their own voice. “But when that individual voice is in conflict with the official brand it creates a tension,” says Martin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University. The recent strikes over pay and pensions brought these tensions into focus. Universities were accused of using ‘intimidatory’ tactics to silence debate and the strikes radicalised people. John Hills*, a lecturer at a London university, got called into a 45-minute meeting after criticising senior management on Twitter. “HR was simply trawling the accounts of employees involved and looking for things to object to. It is naked intimidation,” he says. “They’re constantly watching and trying to drive conversations out of sight.” With another round of strikes on the horizon, academics worry this heavy-handed approach might be replicated.Universities face a difficult task of upholding a powerful right to academic freedom and taking robust action when an individual goes too far, particularly if they indulge in personal attacks. Many are introducing social media guidelines to prevent unacceptable forms of behaviour. But this opens up channels for monitoring. At Exeter University, for instance, the guidelines reserve the right to monitor personal platforms and can include accounts used outside of work hours. At the University of Liverpool, the definition of social media is broad and includes Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn. The University of Strathclyde’s policy leaves open the use of social media monitoring for recruitment in certain cases.Even personal accounts that do not include real names, photos or identify an employer are being treated as an extension of the workplace. “I’m casual staff; I only work here a couple of hours a week and yet they still feel entitled to decide what I can post,” says Hills.According to Imogen Reseigh, an employment lawyer at Trowers & Hamlins, this is not out of step with other industries. She says over the past few years employers in various sectors have been introducing social media policies and there has been a whole host of employment tribunals on the issue.But universities aren’t like other companies. “They’re meant to be bastions of free speech, you’d expect them to be against silencing people,” says a humanities lecturer from a modern university, who did not want to give her name. “It’s down to the corporatisation of higher education. We sit there in our staff meetings talking about degrees as products and students as consumers. Most academics intensely dislike it.”Others agree. “It’s all about brand protection. These institutions are powerful and they close discussions down because they don’t want student numbers dropping,” says Lisa Mckenzie, associate professor at Durham University, who is outspoken online about the hostility towards working-class people in university spaces. “We’re forced to speak out because they ignore us.” Universities, however, say they are doing the opposite and there needs to be professionalism online. According to a spokesperson from Cardiff University, inappropriate public commentary on undergraduate work can “provoke anxiety and demoralisation” if read by the students affected. They say they are in no way silencing critical views or feedback, but there are other ways of raising problems. “Using official university channels – instead of social media – to report concerns means we can deal with any issues promptly.” Both claim to care about students, so why is it going so wrong? In the past, academics were advised not to blog or use social media. It was seen as poor, sloppy content, and a distraction from legitimate academic work. The US Chronicle of Higher Education even published a piece titled ‘Bloggers need not apply’.  But things have changed: academics now benefit from social media visibility through paid talks, new connections and TV appearances. It even feeds into how research is evaluated in the UK. New measures like altmetrics have emerged, which assess the influence of research based on Facebook and Twitter engagement. “[Social media] can be consequential for academics’ careers. Increased hits and downloads of your research is one aspect of this,” says Manuel Souto-Otero, professor in social sciences at Cardiff University. Some say it is causing academics to behave more like celebrities. “It’s certainly not impossible for people to build a large online following while retaining their scholarly integrity. But it is difficult because platforms are engineered to reward statements which generate a reaction, positive or negative, something nuance and caveat will tend to get in the way of,” says Carrigan.While academics can benefit society by bringing expertise outside academic journals and into the public through social media, they need to be careful. As Carrigan says: “In many ways, social media isn’t particularly well suited to the in-depth expertise which academics bring.” * Name has been changed",education
"Students who are the first in their family to go to university should be given a year’s free tuition to allay fears about graduate debt and encourage them to continue into higher education, according to a report. The authors want the government to introduce a “first-in-family allowance” which would cover tuition fees for the first year of an undergraduate degree – which normally costs £9,250 – for any student whose parents have not had tertiary education. Parental education can be a big influence on a young person’s decision about whether to go to university, the report by the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank says, and parents may be more anxious about tuition fees and graduate debt than their child. “By making the first year of post-18 study free for any student who is among the first generation of their family (and applying this to first-born children and their siblings), we are signalling the importance of overcoming this barrier to educational attainment,” it says. It is one of a number of recommendations in the publication Making Universities Matter: how higher education can help to heal a divided Britain. The document aims to address the government’s “levelling up” agenda. It also calls for research funding to be redirected to “left behind” regions and the establishment of a national skills council for England, made up of leaders from colleges, universities and funding agencies, to encourage local collaboration to address skills shortages and educational disadvantage. Rachel Hewitt, Hepi’s director of policy and advocacy, said: “Recent years have shown that some universities are not as closely attuned to their local communities as they thought they were. At the same time they have been subjected to unprecedented levels of policy change by government, which has led to challenging competing priorities. This report provides a road map for universities to get back in touch with the places where they are based.” Meanwhile, the universities regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS), has launched a review of higher education admissions, which could lead to scrapping personal statements and the introduction of post-qualification applications, so students apply to university once they receive their A-level results. Among the areas for consideration is the vastly increased use of unconditional offers, the accuracy of predicted grades, the deployment of incentives by universities trying to market their courses, and the value of using contextual information in admissions for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. One option is to keep the current system with limited reforms to improve fairness. More radically, the OfS is considering a system where students would continue to apply before their exams, but offers would only be made after they received their results, and a third model where students might register their interest in a university but delay their full application until after their results. Sir Michael Barber, chair of the OfS, said: “There is widespread recognition that certain aspects of the current admissions system are not working, and may be especially unfair on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is fundamentally an open consultation and a genuine attempt to seek views from as wide a range of respondents as possible.” The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, said the admissions process should be transparent. “It is clear some practices, such as ‘conditional unconditional offers’, can limit the opportunities and outcomes for some students and changes are needed. The OfS’s admissions review will be instrumental in helping assess how the system can be improved.” The OfS is particularly keen to get the views of past, present and future students, as well as parents, academic staff, higher education leaders, schools and colleges. The consultation ends on 21 May.",education
"It’s a good time to consider an apprenticeship. Private companies are already fully on board, and now the public sector is gearing up for a new chapter. The government announced in 2018 that public bodies with more than 250 employees must ensure 2.3% of staff are apprentices by 2021. From local government to the NHS, it’s about finding the right position for you. Daniel John joined an apprenticeship scheme at South Gloucestershire council: “It was targeted towards people with disabilities, which I thought would meet my needs [John has Asperger’s]. What I enjoy the most is making friends and doing a good job.” You apply for an apprenticeship in the same way you would a job – it’s not the same as a university application. With that in mind, it’s good to start off by doing a decent amount of research. Employers have information about their apprenticeship schemes on their websites, and you can also find roles advertised on the Ucas site. If you have anything to discuss, you can call up employers for an informal chat. Once you’ve narrowed your options down, you can attend apprenticeship open days to get a feel for a place and ask questions. Universities that run degree apprenticeships will often hold events for prospective candidates, as will larger employers and apprenticeship providers. “Open days are a great idea,” says Angel Maynard, an apprentice at research company Leidos. “They can help with networking skills and you can ask those burning questions.” Once you’ve found a scheme, you can send off an application. Most employers will ask for some kind of CV and cover letter. However, some offer alternative ways of applying. For example, Wessex Water allows candidates to apply by sending a short video. Take your time on each individual application. You can talk about your skills, qualities, hobbies and interests, as well as what appeals to you about the role. Don’t send the same cover letter to different employers; instead, tailor every application to match the requirements of each role. “Update your CV with the things you are good at and why you think you would work well at their company,” advises Emily Clark, an apprentice civil engineer at PD Ports. If your application is successful, an employer will invite you in for an interview or assessment. Employers use different tools and techniques to get a sense of your skills. Before an interview, research the company. “Have an idea of the role, benefits and length,” Maynard says. On the day, try and keep calm, she advises: “Take your time to answer questions and be precise, rather than ramble on.” Finally, if all of this makes you nervous, we’ll let you in on a secret: many of the people hiring apprentices say they’re not looking for concrete qualifications or the finished article. “We’re looking for potential, rather than competency,” says Katherine Marshall, apprenticeships lead at Lloyds Bank. According to Clark, the most important thing is to show you’re willing to work hard and that you’re keen to learn: “Demonstrate you’re a team player, you love to learn, and that you want to engage with all aspects of the company.”  A pleasant surprise perks up a week at work for Angel Maynard, 19, an apprentice in the Glasgow offices of a scientific research company. As told to Abby Young-Powell MondayI’m doing an apprenticeship at Leidos, a service management centre in Glasgow that looks into and resolves customer issues. I’ll be here for a year, and during that time I get to work on different projects. First thing on a Monday morning, I check my calendar and see if I’ve got any meetings. My colleagues often ask me to take the minutes, which helps me learn. So far I’ve been to one that was about ethics, another on purchase orders, and one about designing a website. I take notes and listen to what’s going on. TuesdayJo, my sponsor, gives me tasks to do. She gets me to do a lot of things that she doesn’t have time to do herself, but they’re still important. My current project is to build a new website for the service management centre. I have to follow a template, but within that I have control of the design and get to make it look as fancy as I want. When it’s done, I’ll present it to my colleagues to see whether they like it. I get to be hands-on but I also get constructive criticism, which is good. Jo messages me every day to make sure I have got work to do. She’s warm, open and funny. She’s not strict with me and lets me have creative control over my tasks. WednesdayI have lunch with my buddy Vickie, who supports me. She’s 26, still at uni, and a graduate apprentice. She’s lovely. I didn’t think I’d get along as well as I do with somebody who’s nearly 10 years older than me. At lunch, we don’t talk about work, we talk about random things and relax. There’ll always be someone I can sit and have lunch with. It’s good that work is sociable because I relocated from Manchester to Glasgow for the apprenticeship and at the moment, I live by myself. I’m the youngest at work. I am what’s know as a “modern apprentice” (I’m part of a Scottish scheme for over 16s), and above me are the graduate apprentices like Vickie, who are a bit older than me. I wanted to meet people my age so I went on Bumble to look for friends and I made one. Tonight we are going go to a firework display together. ThursdayI’ve won an award from Leidos for some work I did for a client. A colleague recommended me for it and I was rewarded with a bit of money and recognition. After I found out I’d won, I immediately rang my dad and told him. It made me feel proud and valued. This has been the highlight of my apprenticeship so far. FridayAt the end of the week people tend to go out for drinks together after work. I’ve been looking forward to this Friday in particular because we’ve got a special staff social – the company is hiring professional actors to come in and put together a murder mystery, and there will be drinks and pizza. This kind of thing gives you something to look forward to. Overall, I can’t put into words how grateful I am to have this apprenticeship.",education
"Union demands on pensions, pay and conditions are unaffordable and will put vulnerable institutions that are already in deficit at even greater risk, university employers have said. Speaking before strike action planned for this week on 74 campuses across the UK, the employers said many institutions that had already reported shortfalls were being asked to go beyond what they could afford to meet union demands. They appealed to the University and College Union, which represents lecturers, librarians, technicians and other academic staff, to go back to their membership with the latest revised offer in the hope of breaking the deadlock between the two sides. UCU members are due to go out on strike on Thursday for the first of 14 days of industrial action in what is being described as the largest wave of strikes ever seen on UK campuses. It is expected to impact on more than a million students, many of whom are now veterans of university industrial action. It is the third time higher education staff have taken industrial action since 2018, most recently before Christmas when 40,000 staff at 60 universities went out on strike for eight days over the same issues. Staff at a further 14 universities subsequently voted in favour of industrial action after being re-balloted by the UCU, taking the total number of institutions up to 74. Mark E Smith, vice-chancellor of the University of Southampton and chair of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) said employers had moved a long way to meet the demands of union members, particularly on casualisation, gender pay and workload. “We know that in many institutions they are at the edge – or beyond – what they can really afford. If you look at the number of institutions that have reported deficits this year, it’s a very difficult position for them.” Universities pay more than half of their overall income on staff costs. “Therefore if your major cost is inflating further, the logical conclusion is those institutions which are under financial pressure will be under increasing pressure,” said Smith. “I would not want to be as alarmist as to say some will go under, however you can join the dots up and see where the logical conclusion of that lies.” Smith called on the UCU to go back to their members with the detail of the final offer. “The employers have moved a long way on this, but according to the negotiating team of the union it’s not enough, but that’s their view,” he said. “We don’t know what their members think.” Students, meanwhile, are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact on their studies, with many launching petitions urging universities to address what they see as legitimate staff concerns and others demanding compensation for lost tuition. A UCU spokesperson said: “The reason staff are walking out and education is being disrupted from Thursday is because universities have failed to move the conversation forward and address the concerns of staff.”",education
"The number of children who are home-educated in England has gone up almost 13% in the last year, amid concern that many parents are unable to provide a suitable education, according to a report. Official figures published by the government’s school admissions watchdog revealed that more than 60,000 pupils were home-schooled in 2018/19, up from around 52,000 the previous year. A similar survey in 2015-16 estimated that 37,000 school-aged children were registered as home-educated. Because there is currently no requirement for parents to register with local authorities if they elect to home-school their child, the report notes that the official figure is likely to be lower than the actual total. The latest figures, published in the Office of the Schools Adjudicator’s (OSA) annual report and based on information provided by 152 local authorities, will fuel concerns about “off-rolling”, whereby schools remove difficult or low-achieving pupils so that they are not included in their GCSE results. Shan Scott, the chief schools adjudicator, said more than 100 local authorities raised concerns that some parents who opted to educate their child at home will “not actually be able to provide education which fully meets the child’s needs”, echoing similar concerns aired last year. Commenting on the report, Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is important to bear in mind that home education remains rare compared to the 8.8 million pupils in schools in England. “Nevertheless, it is concerning to see that the number of children in home education has risen, because it is our view that young people are best served by attending a school.” In a small number of cases, he said the relationship between parent and school breaks down – a situation that may be exacerbated by budget cuts and recent changes to GCSE qualifications, which have been made significantly more difficult. Last year the government outlined proposals to introduce a register for home-educated children to enable local authorities to see where children are if they are not in school and intervene more effectively if required. Announcing the plans, the then education secretary Damian Hinds said: “As a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain. “That’s why this register of children not in school is so important – not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes, but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar.” Responding to the OSA report, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are looking into ways to make it easier for vulnerable pupils to access a school place when they need one and will use the findings of this report to ensure the school admissions system continues to help deliver good school places for even more pupils and parents.” The OSA annual report also highlights an increase in primary schools seeking to change admissions arrangements because of falling pupil numbers, as a baby boom from the early 2000s moves from primary up to secondary level education. It also highlights the strength of feeling surrounding admissions to grammar schools. Of the 140 objections to admissions arrangements received by the OSA in 2018-19, 58 related to the arrangements of 36 grammar schools.",education
"University College London has become the first Russell Group university to introduce a ban on romantic and sexual relationships between lecturers and their students.UCL said the personal relationships policy would protect against potential abuses of power and conflicts of interest. The policy prohibits “close personal and intimate relationships between staff and students where the staff member has a direct responsibility for, or involvement in, that student’s academic studies and/or personal welfare”. It also obliges staff to declare a close personal or intimate relationship with any other student, who they do not directly supervise, within a month or face disciplinary action. The policy says staff should “maintain an appropriate physical and emotional distance from students”. Staff should try to “avoid creating special friendships with students, as this may be seen as grooming”; should only contact students via official university channels; and should try to avoid giving their personal mobile phone number, or meeting students outside the university. All other staff will also be required to disclose close personal or intimate relationships with other members of staff where the relationship may present a conflict of interest. The policy also prohibits staff from close and intimate relationships with “at risk” adults, which could include people with a disability, whether they are students or other staff, and with students or staff under 18. Kelsey Paske, the behaviour and culture change manager at UCL, said the ban was informed by “the need to recognise positions of power and power imbalances within higher education settings, and to help prevent abuses of power”. Paske added: “The decision to prohibit certain relationships was centred on protecting both students and staff.” Paske said the ban was inspired by those in place at Ivy League universities in the US, such as Princeton, Harvard and Yale. Rachel Watters, the women’s officer for the National Union of Students, said: “Given the public focus on sexual misconduct in higher education and elsewhere, we would hope and expect more universities to revise their policies in similar ways.” Only two other UK universities, Greenwich and Roehampton, have bans on sexual relationships between lecturers and their students, a Guardian investigation has found. It is understood that another university is in the process of implementing a ban. The investigation, in which freedom of information requests were issued to 122 universities, found only seven members of staff had been disciplined by universities for relationships with students in the past five years. Although 97 universities have policies on relationships between staff and students, many only discourage them. Dr Anna Bull of the 1752 Group, which campaigns against sexual misconduct by university staff, said: “UCL’s new policy is the most stringent in the UK. If it is implemented as intended, it will help to enable a safer and more gender equal teaching and learning environment.” She said the lack of similar policies in other universities suggested they were “not taking seriously the risks associated with the power imbalances between staff and students”. Last month, Natasha Caruana, a lecturer at the University of the Arts London, said she had resigned from her previous university, the University for the Creative Arts, owing to concerns about inappropriate relationships between staff and students. “I stood up for what I knew was the correct and ethical way of behaving,” she wrote on Instagram. “There is a rich history of male academics having special friendships with female students … and it won’t change until more of us call it out and put pressure on universities to change their policies.”  A spokesperson for the University for the Creative Arts said: “We wholeheartedly reject the picture as presented in the social media post. UCA has robust policies in place to protect the wellbeing of our students and staff. We have acted – and will continue to act – swiftly and decisively whenever we receive allegations of improper conduct.” A Department for Education spokesman said: “We take any form of harassment in universities extremely seriously, and expect universities to have robust policies and procedures.” A 2018 survey by the 1752 Group and the NUS found that four-fifths of students said they were uncomfortable with staff having relationships with students, which they described as “predatory”.",education
"Schools are cutting back the curriculum and not replacing teachers when they leave because of a growing funding crisis, the chief inspector of schools has said. In an unprecedented step, Ofsted’s Amanda Spielman laid out the impact of cuts in a blogpost that has since been removed because it was published “erroneously”. It will be published again in the coming weeks, along with a more detailed study on school funding. Spielman has previously been criticised after she said it would be “inappropriate” for her to comment on issues on which Ofsted did not have “clear evidence”. But in the blog, posted on Wednesday, she said since 2015 “costs have been rising more rapidly than income”, and accepted that cuts to local authority budgets have had a “significant impact”. However, she was also critical of some schools’ responses, adding that “few school leaders carefully monitor the impacts of their responses to financial pressure”. She said schools were responding to funding pressure by reducing curriculum breadth, with languages, computing, design and technology and music most affected. She added that in some of the secondary schools the inspectorate visited subject specialists were not being replaced when they left and other teachers were teaching outside their specialism. Stephen Rollett, a curriculum and inspection specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed Spielman’s warning but said he was “disappointed that she accuses schools of failing to do enough”. He said: “Let’s be clear that the blame lies with the government, which has caused the crisis by failing to fund schools properly and leaving them with no alternative other than to make cuts.” Spielman said children with special educational needs faced the brunt of cuts, giving the example of one school where a specialist in this area was given a full teaching load. “In another [school], teachers were asked to deal with SEND-S [special educational needs students] by differentiating instruction using a five-side registration sheet recording the needs of every pupil in the class,” she said. The blog reads: “In some schools, experienced teachers were replaced with less-experienced and lower-qualified staff. Schools also reported cutting back continuous professional development and removing teaching and learning responsibility points. “In some schools, higher-level teaching assistants were being used to cover classes when teachers were absent, rather than the school paying for teachers to cover these lessons.” One passage reads: “In some cases, there was insufficient monitoring of the quality of education and support for the most vulnerable pupils, as we saw in the examples given above. This means that some schools are making the situation for pupils with SEND and their parents and carers harder and contributing to the fragmentation of local provision. “Many schools we visited were narrowing their curriculum, to the detriment of the education of all pupils, especially those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds.” Rollett said schools spend most of their budget on staffing so they did not have any option other than to reduce courses and extracurricular provision if they have to make cuts. “It is the last thing they want to do but they have been left with impossible choices, and no amount of monitoring makes that situation any better,” he said. The Department for Education said it would comment on Ofsted’s report when it was published in full. “This government has announced the biggest funding boost for schools in a decade, giving every school more money for every child,” a spokesperson said. Rollett said: “The government has now pledged more money for schools, which is a welcome move, but it is not enough to reverse the cuts.” The blog ended with Spielman saying that Ofsted will be carrying out research to see whether it is helpful for inspectors “to go into schools with some financial indicators”, but said it would need to make sure whatever they do is “does not add an unnecessary layer on top of existing financial accountability measures”. Ofsted’s research, which is yet to be published, involved surveying 201 heads, and research visits to 16 schools. Senior leaders, school business managers, teachers, support staff, governors and trustees were all interviewed. The sample included eight primary and eight secondary schools across England.",education
"Louise Grace’s two children, aged 13 and 11, spent more than a week off school last term suffering from anxiety. Their school, the International Academy of Greenwich (IAG), is earmarked for closure and the worry of watching it happen – friends taking up places elsewhere, teachers leaving – is affecting both children badly, their mother says. “My daughter is so upset by it all: she is losing her friends and she is worried about going to a new school, with her GCSEs about to start. She is despondent about the whole process,” says Grace. “My son seemed to be holding it in,” she adds. “But before Christmas, he said: ‘We were told by the school that it wouldn’t close, and you told me there would be a school for me. You let me down,’ and then he just shut himself in his room.” Now Grace, a single parent, has given up her job, concerned she would otherwise be unable to support her worried children, and fearful about the logistics of trying to find them new school places. Since November, when the IAG became the latest free school to announce its closure, parents of more than 200 pupils have been scrambling for places at other secondaries. One mother says her son sobbed after being told he had to leave, while for another family, the closure has been a key factor in their decision to move from the UK. Many parents now say free schools should never have been allowed to open without planning permission for permanent buildings. The IAG families believe they are at the sharp end of the free school policy, which has been the government’s main vehicle for opening new schools in England since 2011. There have been success stories, such as the Michaela free school in north London, but the failures – of which there have been plenty – are traumatic for those affected. Overall, 27 free schools have had to close or change management. Sometimes children have been left with little or no education for weeks following a school closure while their parents search for a place elsewhere. Since 2016, some 92 schools have opened in temporary accommodation and of these, just 27 have moved into a permanent home. Last year alone, 25 schools opened on a temporary site. Some of the locations have been eyebrow-raising. One free school opened next to an airport runway; another in a building about which officials had expressed multiple safety concerns. Abacus Belsize school, in London, has spent six years in temporary premises while a planning dispute rages over its proposed move into a former police station, bought for £14m and approved by Boris Johnson as mayor of London. A primary free school in Croydon was recently graded “inadequate” by Ofsted, with children being taught in portable buildings since 2014. And Southwark free school, again backed by Johnson, closed in 2017 after five years as it, too, had never managed to find a permanent home. The IAG’s story is the latest example of how the free schools policy can be undermined by poor planning. It was allowed to open in September 2016 in an office building owned by a church while waiting for its new building on playing fields – a location, on protected metropolitan open land prone to flooding, that was highly controversial. Meanwhile, the DfE ploughed money into the school’s temporary premises, paying the church £395,000 in rent each year – £1,500 per pupil. Parents, many of whom were attracted to IAG because it offered the international baccalaureate curriculum, were told not to worry.  A year ago the DfE was still saying it was “anticipating a positive planning decision”, and the council’s secondary schools admissions booklet [pdf] for 2019-20 was suggesting the school would be in its permanent building in 2021. Yet emails released under freedom of information show that by last April, Greenwich planning officials were telling the DfE that they did not think there was a case to open the school. While in 2018 Greenwich had stated that there was a shortage of school places, now it was now saying there was not. Another new free school is due to open in the borough in 2021, run by the Harris Federation. Council documents show  [pdf] that this affected Greenwich’s assessment of the need for school places. This has meant, the IAG parents say, that the provision of places in a not-yet-open free school contributed to the closure of the existing one. This is not disputed by the council. Sure enough, in July last year council planners refused permission for the playing fields site, provoking uproar among the IAG’s parents and pupils. With ministers saying the school could not continue long term in its temporary premises, its closure was announced. The IAG, which as of last term had 267 year 7-10 pupils, will close for years 7-9 this summer, with year 10 pupils, who have started their GCSEs, finishing them at the school next year. Pupils have been given no guarantees of places elsewhere, and some parents have moved their children into private education.  Kate Simpson is emigrating with her family to Toronto, where she grew up, although she had hoped to stay in London until her son, Cameron, 11, had completed high school. “We are devastated that the school is closing. Our decision to leave it is no reflection on its incredible teachers. It’s the system that’s the problem.” Another parent, Michaela Barnes (not her real name), has managed to find her son a place elsewhere, but only after he had started at the IAG and she had bought his uniform. On the evening of his first and last day at IAG he was “curled up on the floor, in the foetal position, sobbing”, she says. Peter Godden, who has moved his son, aged 14, to a private school, says: “The government let these schools open in temporary buildings, then let them fall by the wayside when planning permission was not given. It’s scandalous.” Comments from the DfE and Greenwich council indicate they were at loggerheads. Greenwich says: “This regrettable situation has arisen due to the Department for Education granting permission for a school with no permanent accommodation to open ... the Royal Borough of Greenwich is working closely with Lewisham council to ensure that the pupils, families and staff affected … receive co-ordinated and comprehensive support.” The DfE says: “We have changed our policy to prevent cases like this happening again, only using temporary accommodation where there is a pressing need for places and a permanent site has been secured.” Permission was given on a “case by case” basis, said a spokeswoman. The DfE guidance [pdf] says schools should open in temporary buildings only “in exceptional circumstances”. This will ring hollow for the IAG families. Grace, who has found her children a place at an under-subscribed secondary for September, says: “This has destroyed my faith in the education system. Those in charge genuinely don’t seem to care about the impact on children of schools closing: it is just a political game to them.”",education
"Leading private schools have challenged plans to widen access to the most selective universities in England, warning they could lead to discrimination against young people “on the basis of the class they were born into”. The intervention by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country’s most expensive independent schools, reflects members’ concerns that new measures to improve access for the most disadvantaged students could lead to discrimination against students from elite private schools. The HMC was responding to plans, published on Wednesday by the higher education regulator for England, the Office for Students, that promise to halve the access gap at England’s most selective institutions in the next five years, increasing the number of disadvantaged students by 6,500 each year from 2024-25. HMC’s executive director, Mike Buchanan, said universities should expand to accommodate as many “truly suitable students” as necessary, rather than “rob some students of a future to award it to others”. He also called on universities to review the increasing number of international students, rather than “deny places to UK students based on their class”. Since the lifting of the student admissions cap in 2015, the number of places at many universities has grown exponentially, but undergraduate numbers have remained relatively stable at Oxford and Cambridge, though both claim to have made significant progress in diversifying their student body. The OfS report, Transforming Opportunity in Higher Education, details ambitious commitments by universities to improve equality of opportunity for students. Currently, young people from advantaged areas of England are more than six times as likely to attend selective universities, including Oxford, Cambridge and other members of the Russell Group, as those from disadvantaged areas. Despite the huge expansion in university places, the gap has barely changed. Under new plans drawn up by universities and approved by the OfS, the ratio will be cut to less than 4:1 by 2025, and could be eliminated in 20 years. The OfS is also hoping to reduce the gap between the proportion of white and black students awarded a top degree – a first or a 2:1 – from 22% to 11%. Buchanan said the HMC was confident their students would continue to secure places at prestigious universities at home and overseas, thanks to excellent results and soft skills. “However, care is needed in starting actively to discriminate against individual young people on the basis of the class they were born into. The country needs all its young people to reach their potential if we are to create a bright new future for Britain post-Brexit.” Buchanan said contextual admissions – which allow universities to take into account an applicant’s educational and socio-economic background – were reasonable “if used on a sophisticated, individual basis”, but it should not be about school type. “Independent schools play an important role in getting disadvantaged students into university through offering free and discounted places. Not all state-educated students are disadvantaged and the majority of students from affluent backgrounds are not educated in HMC schools. This is why a sophisticated approach is needed for the country genuinely to level up.” Kalwant Bhopal, a professor of education and justice at Birmingham University, said: “It is clear that those students who attend independent fee-paying schools are more likely to be white and middle-class and are more likely to go on to hold top high-earning jobs. These schools continue to perpetuate privilege. Contextual admissions are one small step to addressing inequalities of opportunity facing children from many working-class, and black and ethnic minority families.” Chris Millward, the OfS director of fair access and participation, said if universities did not increase student numbers, then groups that were currently highly represented would end up being less represented as a result of the new targets. “We expect providers to work towards these targets because they tackle two urgent priorities: the need to open up all of our universities to people from those communities where progress into higher education is lowest, and to ensure that every student has the same chance to succeed once they get there.” The universities minister, Chris Skidmore, said it was damning that such large gaps still remained between disadvantaged students and their peers. “I am pleased to see universities being ambitious in their plans to reach out to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and to support them through their studies. But for universities which do not meet their registration conditions, I fully support the OfS to take appropriate action.”",education
"The days of university initiation ceremonies – at which students are compelled to perform outrageous tasks, usually while extremely drunk, in order to join a sports club or society – are numbered. Amid growing concerns about the rituals, which have been linked to mental health problems and blamed for at least one student death, the body that organises student sport competitions has set up a dedicated service that allows those who have concerns about the ceremonies to report them anonymously. The “problem initiation” area of the British Universities & Colleges Sport website provides information on types of behaviour associated with initiations and gives students and parents the ability to submit a report, either anonymously or by sharing basic contact information. The reports are then made anonymous before being passed to the relevant university to investigate. BUCS will receive a report on the outcome of the investigation and evaluate whether further action needs to be taken. Typical examples that have concerned university authorities down the years include students being forced to swallow goldfish, eat dog food and rub chillies on their genitals, often in various states of undress and usually intoxicated. “Students should understand that problem initiations are not permitted by universities and will not be tolerated by BUCS,” said Vince Mayne, its chief executive. “We want to ensure that sport at university is fully accessible to all and the activities of a few individuals do not stop people playing the sport they love or trying a new sport. “BUCS are determined to address this negative aspect of university sport and promote the incredibly positive contribution that sport makes to the employability, health and wellbeing of thousands of students, as well as the volunteering and community engagement which students carry out.” Professor Bob Allison, the vice-chancellor of Loughborough University, where sport is a large part of campus life, welcomed the move. “Like all institutions, we have our own challenges in this area and understand the importance of students being able to report concerns, where necessary anonymously,” Allison said. “We also recognise the need for robust, firm and fair interventions that leave members of the university community in no doubt that such behaviour is unacceptable and has no place in higher education.” Allison said that initiation ceremonies were putting students off from participating in sport. “Sport is part of Loughborough’s DNA and plays an incredibly important role in the student experience at many different levels – from keeping fit to competing on the world stage. There must be no barriers to sport participation.” In 2016 a Newcastle University student, Ed Farmer, 20, died following an “initiation-style” bar crawl. His father, Jeremy, has called for a “line in the sand” to be drawn, so that “from here on in everybody knows initiations are banned and if you step over that line you will be removed from university”. Mark Saltmarsh, the head of education and age grade rugby at England Rugby, a sport where initiation ceremonies are prevalent, said they threatened to undermine the positive contribution the game made to many people’s lives. “There are hundreds of thousands of people who do a superb job on and off the pitch every week of the season to live out the values of our game for the rugby and wider community. But we still hear examples of poor behaviour in university rugby that conflict with these values and the inclusive foundations of team sport. “While we acknowledge that this is not just a rugby problem or always easy to control, we are determined not to stand by and ignore it.”",education
"Ofsted inspectors raiding suspected illegal schools in England are to be given body-worn cameras for the first time to improve efforts to shut them down, the watchdog has announced. Staff belonging to Ofsted’s illegal schools taskforce will wear digital video recorders similar to those used by police officers. The taskforce was set up to investigate groups operating without registering as a school, which may not be following safeguarding or child protection regulations, and lack oversight of teaching and facilities. Ofsted said it had no plans for its inspectors to use the body cameras during visits to registered state or independent schools. Ofsted wants to beef up its powers to inspect and gain prosecutions of illegal operators. So far it has inspected fewer than 300 unregistered schools operating in England, out of an estimated 640, and there is frustration at the slow pace of prosecutions or closures, with just three convictions to date. It is an offence to operate an unregistered school in England. An updated handbook for inspections of unregistered schools, issued to Ofsted staff this week, said that from February, “inspectors will also record footage of the inspection using body-worn video cameras” as part of a pilot. “They will use these to record footage for the purpose of gathering evidence during inspections. Inspectors will inform individuals that they encounter that they are using body-worn video cameras,” the guidance says. “We will delete body-worn video camera footage 10 working days after the inspection on which it was taken if no warning notice is issued. If a warning notice is issued, we will retain the data until a decision is taken whether or not to institute proceedings against a person for an offence.” Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, recently said the laws against unregistered schools were not strong enough. She said she was shocked to find that “unwitting” local authorities were paying for pupils to attend some of the schools without checking if they were registered. “Our taskforce has now provided the evidence for three sets of convictions of illegal schools and their operators. But there is nothing to stop a convicted operator from continuing to run their school,” Spielman said at the launch of Ofsted’s annual report. “Ironically, the laws designed to close a legal school don’t apply to one that operates outside the law. This is a loophole that has to be closed. “An education system with integrity simply would not tolerate illegal and unregistered schools that cheat children of a decent education. But not enough is happening to tackle unregistered schools.” Despite the issue first being raised by Spielman’s predecessor in 2015, the legal response has been sluggish. The first successful prosecution took place in 2018 after a venue in Southall, west London, was found to be operating as an unregistered school. Last year a further prosecution was obtained involving a school in Streatham, south London, that charged parents more than £5,000 a year. The couple running it were fined £1,100, with one required to perform 120 hours of community service. Sean Harford, Ofsted’s national director of education, complained that the prosecuted schools had reopened shortly afterwards, and that others were prepared for Ofsted’s surprise visits. “I’ve been out on one of these inspections relatively recently, and some of these places have a drill. You knock on the door and they say: ‘I need to speak to my lawyer before you enter the premises,’” Harford told a conference.",education
"My mother-in-law, Margaret Kaye, who has died aged 94, dedicated much of her life to social services, in particular the provision of support to vulnerable young children. She was born in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and her childhood was spent in the shadow of poverty and mass unemployment. Her father, Jack Johnson, was a coalminer and local branch secretary of the Communist party, who was victimised after the general strike of 1926 and took to professional boxing, having been involved in the sport in previous years. Her mother, Hilda (nee Wood), was a housewife. Margaret joined the Young Communist League in her teens and remained committed to the Communist party until its dissolution in 1991. She attended Saddler Street school in Bishop Auckland, leaving at 14 to work in a button factory. After studying at night school, she was taken on as a secretary for the Fire Brigades Union in Newcastle. Her formidable administrative skills marked her out, and towards the end of the second world war she was relocated to London to work for John Horner, then general secretary of the union. There she met Solly Kaye, the charismatic young Communist party organiser for east London. Solly walked her home to her digs five nights in a row, and on the fifth night proposed to her on a park bench. They were married in 1945, settled in Hackney and had three children, Jan, Johnny and Joanna. While raising the family, Margaret supported Solly in his political work. In 1964 she resumed her own career, retraining as a social worker and then working in the children and family departments of Camden and Enfield social services. For 47 years she was friend and protector to countless children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and also to those (usually much younger) colleagues making their careers in social work. So valued was her contribution that she was allowed to work on to the age of 87. After retirement in 2011, she retained her many friendships and a keen interest in the world. Above all, she was the lioness of her large and extended family, a born optimist and ever proud of her Durham roots. Solly died in 2005. Margaret is survived by Jan, Johnny and Joanna, and her grandchildren, Eleanor, Ben, Amy, Charlotte, Millie, Kit and Betsy.",education
"Government plans to introduce Ofsted-style rankings for universities, with courses that produce lower salaries labelled as failing, would punish institutions outside London and threaten arts and humanities courses, worried academics are warning. In November the Conservative manifesto set off alarm bells in universities by promising to tackle “low-quality courses”. Now senior academics close to Westminster say the government is pressing on with this in a plan that could replicate the four Ofsted categories used for schools, flagging up university courses the government considers inadequate. There are already gold, silver and bronze rankings for teaching in universities under the Teaching Excellence Framework. Some of the UK’s leading universities failed to get the top gold rating, with the London School of Economics being awarded only a bronze. Now, one expert says: “They want a fourth category of something like ‘requires improvement’.”  Controversially, graduate earnings are expected to be the bar by which the government will judge courses. Higher education experts warn this would damage the arts and humanities, where starting salaries are typically much lower than in disciplines such as medicine or law. In addition, they warn that universities outside London whose graduates stay on and work locally, rather than moving to the capital for a higher salary, will lose out. Universities fear the government might refuse to provide student loans for “low-quality” courses, threaten universities with removal from the Office for Students’ register if they don’t improve, or shut down courses. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says the government is right to question whether courses are all of a good standard – but says earnings are likely to feature “more than they should” in assessing quality. “When Ofsted goes into a school it judges whether it is a good or bad school based on what is happening there,” he says. “It doesn’t say ‘we think this is a bad school because kids who have been here in the past have got bad jobs’. That is how universities will be judged.” Prof Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor of Aston university, in Birmingham, says: “Salary is evidence of things, including where you live, what sector you’re in, and what sort of job you are pursuing. We should push back against the idea that a good salary is an adequate measure of how much a job matters to society.” Vice-chancellors see the “Ofsted” idea as a government raid on their independence, with the head of a leading research university warning that universities should be in no doubt that the government has “radical” plans, and should prepare for battle. “There are deep issues that we need to confront. Do we really want a world where creative courses have no student loans?” The worry is that courses classed as needing improvement would then struggle. Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford University, says this could push some struggling universities, especially in poorer areas, to the brink. “Would the government really want to jeopardise its position with voters in the north by doing this?” He adds: “What is happening is there is almost a consensus in policy-making that we need to get more people into Stem [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] and vocational disciplines. It should be possible to do that without creating an insidious structure that harms other areas.” The government has been heavily influenced by experimental new official data that tracks graduates to the age of 29 through their tax returns. The “longitudinal educational outcomes” data shows that a 29-year-old male economics graduate, for example, will earn on average 33% more than his peers without a degree, but a male creative arts graduate of the same age will earn 14% less than peers who haven’t been to university. Prof Nigel Carrington, head of the University of the Arts London, says the data “simply isn’t adequate”. He argues it doesn’t properly take into account those who work part-time while they top up their skills, regional differences in pay, or earnings from self-employment. “If a Cambridge graduate in law earns £50,000 and a law graduate of a university in a deprived area earns £19,000, that doesn’t mean the second graduate isn’t productive. They may be using their legal skills doing valuable work in a local authority.” He adds: “Are we educating our students only to earn money, or to do something they love?” Prof Anne Carlisle, vice-chancellor of Falmouth University, says: “The danger is that headline politics is becoming headline economics. To use a single metric like PAYE [to measure] economic value is absurd. When you look at the UK economy we are a land of SMEs.” Falmouth, which has a focus on the creative arts, is encouraging its graduates to stay in Cornwall and set up their own businesses. Carlisle says judging courses on graduate salaries would give universities such as hers a perverse incentive not to help their regional economies, but instead to encourage its students to go to London, where could earn more. When graduates launch startups they rarely pay themselves large salaries, even when they secure investment, instead ploughing money back into the business, she says. “Who is driving this PAYE obsession when everything is shifting towards entrepreneurialism? It’s as if time has stopped still in government while the world is moving on.” Erin Morris, who studied animation and visual effects at Falmouth, has set up a tech business with Tanuvi Thunandan, a Cambridge University economics graduate, at Falmouth’s acclaimed Launchpad postgraduate innovation hub. Their company, Data Duopoly, aims to help attractions such as the Eden Project to manage bottlenecks by offering visitors discounts if they avoid busier areas at key times. Morris and Thunandan wanted to be their own bosses, do something creative and live in “beautiful” Cornwall. Although they have received a grant from the South West Technology Network, it only covers their rent and food and “bare living costs”. Morris says: “It depends what you want out of life. Money wasn’t top of my priority list when I chose my course. I want to do something I’m passionate about.” Thunandan agrees: “It seems wrong to judge our success on salary. They should be judging us 10 years down the line when hopefully we will be selling our successful business and making an exciting exit.” Prof Gail Marshall, head of the school of languages and literature at Reading University, says: “For the government to say to students that the thing they do well and are passionate about doesn’t have value is extremely problematic.” She adds: “It seems foolish to pre-judge which subjects are most valuable when we are facing unprecedented challenges like climate change, which need to be solved by different disciplines working together.” The Department for Education says: “The government subsidises around 50% of the cost of higher education and it is only fair that this funding is used as efficiently as possible, so students can be confident they are getting good value for money.” It adds that the education secretary will back the Office for Students “using its powers” where providers are not offering value for money.",education
"University workers have formed picket lines on campuses across the UK on the first day of the “biggest-ever wave of strikes” over higher education pay, pensions and working conditions. The University and College Union (UCU) reported that support from staff and students remained solid, despite the fact it will be the third time university staff have gone on strike in the last three years – most recently just before Christmas. UCU branches across the country posted pictures of lively picket lines at universities in Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, Essex, Newcastle and Cardiff among others, and there were messages of solidarity from politicians including the Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “Labour stands in solidarity with striking university workers today. They are on strike due to the failed marketised system created under the Tories. “They don’t do so lightly. Reasonable terms and conditions and fair pensions are the minimum they should expect, and their treatment is a stark contrast to the eye-watering pay packets of a few vice-chancellors.” Up to 50,000 lecturers, technicians, librarians and other academic and support staff at 74 universities will take part in a total of 14 days of strike action, staggered through February and March, which will potentially affect about 1.2 million students through lost lectures and tutorials. Many have expressed their support for staff, but are pushing for compensation from university managers. In south London, students sipping cups of “solidaritea” joined staff at Goldsmiths University of London on picket lines outside the Richard Hoggart building. “The workload is simply becoming unsustainable for many in the profession,” said Philippa Burt, a theatre and performance lecturer. Wearing a high-vis vest and brandishing leaflets, Burt said that while there were specific demands from the UCU, many had joined the picket lines because of concern about a general decline in working conditions. She said her timetable, under which she works six days a week but is only paid for four and a half, is typical across the profession. “We’ve seen pay cuts alongside an exponential growth in workload,” added another senior lecturer, who did not want to be named. Many of those on the Goldsmiths picket said the current strike, which follows an eight-day walkout shortly before Christmas, was the result of universities refusing to negotiate with the UCU. Employers, however, insist they have gone a long way to meet union demands. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) said on Thursday that disruption for students would be limited. They claimed that during the pre-Christmas strikes 29% of UCU members took strike action at affected universities, representing just 5% of all staff, and that early reports from this latest action suggested turnout had fallen further. A UCEA spokesperson said: “It will take time for universities to find out exactly how many scheduled classes have not taken place on a given day. Feedback also points to mixed support and impact across the minority of UK universities affected by the strikes, and each university is of course focused on managing this period of disruption as best they can for their students.” One lecturer at Goldsmiths said: “They’ve consistently reneged on their promises and have failed to consult us every step of the way. And we’ll be here again in a few months if we have to be.” A theatre lecturer on the picket line, who did not want to be identified, disputed the employers’ claim earlier this week that pay increases and better working patterns were not financially viable. “The money always seems to be there for capital investment but never for the wellbeing of staff or students.” A fine-art lecturer with 15 years’ experience said she initially supported the protests in December because of the proposed increase in pensions contributions by staff, but that recent cuts and a reorganisation of her department had attracted others to the cause. “This is part of a wider move towards marketisation of higher education,” she said. “They’re taking away our autonomy and the result is that we’re working longer hours for less.” Zoe Sanders, a student in the art department, gave the lecturers her full backing. “Their demands for better working conditions are also demands for better learning conditions.” The UCU is calling on university managers to address excessive workload, pay, a 15% gender pay gap, increased casualisation and changes to pensions for staff in the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Members are being asked to pay 9.6% in pension contributions, up from 8%, and the UCU wants universities to pay the full increase instead. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “We have been receiving news of solid support for the strikes across the UK. That support sends a clear message to universities that, instead of focusing on silly games and spinning in the run up to the walkouts, they should have been working with us to try and sort things out. “We have been clear that we are always ready to seriously discuss all the issues at the heart of the disputes. Students are understandably unimpressed at the intransigence of their university leaders and have made clear demands today that vice-chancellors and principals work harder to try and resolve the disputes.” However, UCEA said the demand for a pay rise of more than 5% was unaffordable, with several universities reporting deficits in their latest accounts. “UCEA has consulted all of its members in presenting new positive proposals addressing the important issues around employment in universities, focusing on casual employment, workload/mental health and gender pay gap/ethnicity pay. UCU is urged to consult all of its members, including the vast majority not taking strike action, and present these positive proposals to them.”",education
"My friend and colleague Colin Howson, who has died aged 74, was an internationally renowned philosopher, logician and expert in probability with a long list of academic papers and influential books to his name. Colin died from an irremediable brain tumour. In his book Objecting to God, he argued passionately and with logical precision against those who, on religious and other grounds, oppose “the principle of self-determination” – the right under certain circumstances to determine one’s own end. This he was able to do as a resident of Canada, where physician-administered euthanasia is legal. He was born in Mill Hill, north-west London, to Harry, a civil servant, and Daisy (nee Maynard), a housewife. The family moved to Devon, where he attended Colyton grammar school, becoming head boy. In 1963 he enrolled at the London School of Economics, initially to study economics, but soon transferred to philosophy. Then, in 1968, shortly after beginning his doctoral studies, he accepted a lectureship in the LSE’s department of philosophy, logic and scientific method. Though a student and a teacher in a department dominated by the philosophy of its founder, Karl Popper, Colin remained his own man and developed a course diametrically opposed to Popperianism. His work focused on the assignment of probabilities to scientific theories via a central theorem of probability proved in the 18th century by Thomas Bayes. Bayesian inductive reasoning, which before the 20th century was fairly standard, had not just dropped out of fashion but had fallen into obloquy. He contributed to a remarkable revival of Bayesianism through his exposition of the axioms of probability as laws of consistency and rational discourse, comparable to the laws of deductive logic. His book Scientific Reasoning: The Bayesian Approach, which I co-authored, went through three editions between 1989 and 2005, and is considered the canonical philosophical defence of Bayesian reasoning. Appointed professor of logic at LSE in 1997, Colin was president of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science from 2003 to 2005. He met the Canadian philosopher Margaret Morrison at an LSE conference and they married in 2003. On retiring from the LSE in 2008, he accepted a position in the department of philosophy at the University of Toronto. Colin was known for his immense charm, razor-sharp mind, exceptional intelligence, open-mindedness and ever-inventive wit. His many successful doctoral students remember him as an encouraging mentor. And he was a good friend to numerous colleagues and collaborators. Margaret survives him.",education
"Hundreds of Cambridge students have accused the university of “a complete failure” to deal with complaints of sexual misconduct after an investigation that raised concerns about a conflict of interest among academics. In a letter signed by more than 500 current and former students, Cambridge University Students’ Union Women’s Campaign has called for colleges to be stripped of their powers to investigate sexual misconduct complaints against their own members. It comes after it emerged that Dr William O’Reilly, the don then in charge of student welfare at Trinity Hall, Cambridge’s fifth oldest college, appointed a panel to investigate rape allegations against a male student, then gave evidence to the panel in support of the accused. On Friday night, Trinity Hall announced that both O’Reilly and the college’s master, the Rev Canon Dr Jeremy Morris, were stepping back from their duties until a separate panel of Cambridge fellows issues a report on 2 March on what the college should do. The letter’s author, Kate Litman, women’s officer at the students’ union, said: “This case is about more than individual failings. It is about an institution-wide failure to protect survivors and tackle sexual violence. That’s why we believe it’s crucial for colleges to commit to a centralised, independent system for handling cases of sexual misconduct.” Trinity Hall, whose alumni include Stephen Hawking, Rachel Weisz and Geoffrey Howe, is part of Cambridge University’s college system and responsible for its own internal affairs. An investigation published last week by the news website Tortoise revealed that three female students told academic staff in February 2018 that they had been raped and sexually assaulted by a male student. He denied the allegations. Two of the women made formal complaints, which were tested at a disciplinary hearing by a panel of dons appointed by O’Reilly, who was Trinity Hall’s acting senior tutor. According to Tortoise, O’Reilly had a close relationship with the accused student, and gave evidence to the panel. The panel cleared the student of wrongdoing but raised concerns that another academic, Dr Nicholas Guyatt, had acted inappropriately by helping the women to draft their complaints. Guyatt was placed under investigation, and ultimately cleared, but did not regain his pastoral role. He later chose to resign and has become a fellow at another Cambridge college. Litman’s letter, which is backed by 18 student groups, said: “We believe that the Trinity Hall case shines a light on a broader issue in the collegiate university, and forces us to seriously question the ability of any college to adequately handle sexual misconduct cases. Even if a college has a policy which represents good practice on paper, when complaints are administered by untrained individuals embedded in a close-knit community, there is no guarantee that the policy will be properly followed.” The row, it added, was not limited to Trinity Hall. “Every college will struggle with conflicts of interest within a relatively small environment, as well as a lack of proper training and expertise. Every year, the Women’s Campaign hears from students who found their case quietly dropped or came up against members of college staff who lacked the knowledge or inclination to support them.” In a measure of how strongly students feel, more than 220 have signed another letter criticising the history faculty for failing to investigate O’Reilly’s conduct. Last year the college was engulfed in a row about Dr Peter Hutchinson, a former fellow, who was the subject of sexual harassment complaints from 10 students in 2015. He was reinstated as a fellow last year, then resigned after an outcry. It emerged last week that in 2015 he had self-published a sexually charged novel under a pseudonym about academics watching students having sex. A Cambridge University spokesman said: “The faculty takes its safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously. It regards the welfare of its students as its highest priority. It also has a duty of care to a member of staff who is not under investigation for any offence and who protests his innocence. At the present time, Dr William O’Reilly has voluntarily and temporarily stepped back from his teaching and supervising.” A spokesperson for O’Reilly said: “Dr O’Reilly believes he acted with integrity and followed appropriate safeguarding advice throughout the various internal processes at Trinity Hall. He rejects any suggestion that he behaved improperly and is appalled that what should have been confidential procedures have been made public.”",education
"OK, so now we are home-schooling. All of the UK’s schools are closed (although they will still cater for vulnerable children and the children of NHS staff and other frontline workers). Exams are cancelled. You may have read about what Isaac Newton discovered while under quarantine, or that Shakespeare wrote King Lear during an outbreak of plague. This may be driving you crazy, as those people did not, history suggests, have sole care of a four-year-old and a six-year-old. You can console yourself, momentarily, with the timetables that parents are drawing up and putting on Twitter: 9am to 11am, Frozen; 11am to 11.05am, pizza; 11.05am to 1pm, fighting; 1pm to 3pm, Frozen II. But this will kill only 30 seconds. Even the most anarchic parent will recognise that they have to find a fruitful way to fill the days, which means trying to replicate the formal education the kids are missing. Education Otherwise, the primary English home-schooling organisation (it has a Welsh arm; Scotland has Schoolhouse), describes parents’ two core approaches: structured or autonomous. Structured learning follows the school day and curriculum; there is a solid argument that, since you intend for your children to go back to school and the school will give you materials (all primary and secondary schools are making plans to this effect), this is the way to go. If you are of an autonomous bent, however – keen to follow the Platonic ideal: “Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds” – that is also legitimate. Your children are unlikely to get hopelessly behind. They might even come out knowing more about creative writing than fronted adverbials. Amanda Grace is the deputy head teacher of Macaulay Church of England primary school in Lambeth, London; she also has two sons at secondary school. She is clear on the structured approach: “Start every morning with a timetable and stick to your timings. Use language such as “now” and “next”. For younger children, you can build in very clear timings such as 10 minutes’ reading followed by 10 minutes’ Lego, role playing, chase games or exercises.” Ben Wilson, 19, was home-schooled between the ages of 12 and 13. While he and his mother, the film-maker Beadie Finzi, describe a lot of creative learning, sometimes only tangentially related to the curriculum, he says: “We put together quite a formal timetable. The routine aspect is important. If you’re just: ‘At some point we’ll do this,’ you’ll fall into the trap of not ever getting anything done.” I just made myself laugh out loud by attempting to start this paragraph with “arguably”. There is no argument: this is the hardest age to do yourself. Whether you have one, two or three under-fives, all those situations are uniquely challenging (loneliness, squabbling or constant squabbling). On the plus side, a lot of the formal learning requirements are things you would do instinctively: communication and language development; fine motor movements; large movements and coordination; reading and writing; counting and adding; shape, space and measures; and expressive arts and design. There is a section on understanding – the world, people and communities, technology – and, sincerely, where would any of us start? The challenges in this age group will be around letting off steam, especially if you can’t leave the house, not being able to socialise, especially for a child without siblings, maintaining concentration, especially your own, and mess. Keep your timetable realistic. You will not conclude a slime-making session in less than an hour; you will probably not spend more than 10 minutes at a go, reading. Make as much use of your garden as you can (for communication, all motor skills, understanding the world). In the pre- or only just-verbal age group, it’s hard to explain what’s going on in a reassuring way; you can download a really good, illustrated booklet here. By this point, you’ll have materials from school, and can base your day around that. Now they’ve got some fine motor skills, you can build in some practical experiments, which can be either directly or indirectly germane to the curriculum. Making sugar crystals, exploding baking powder and vinegar, putting eggs in Coke, dyeing noodles in unicorn colours: all of this will genuinely (I’m not even joking) come up in the science curriculum, and can be spaced out over several days, which will give a sense of the world still turning. Cooking is obviously useful for maths, especially in the earlier years. And kids of this age are still biddable enough to engage in physical enterprise, like home circuits, music and movement. “Anything you can do with physical actions will also enhance their focus,” Grace says. “Getting children to stand behind their chair and make up actions for factual learning also helps break it up and make it more fun. Anything that can be turned into a game or a competition also galvanises focus dramatically.” Some of them will be approaching key stage 1, and the school will certainly have areas that they want you to cover, although these tests were always about measuring schools more than pupils, and it seems likely to me that we’ll find creative ways around the data gap. So don’t pile pressure on them, but likewise, don’t underestimate them. “When children are engaged and active,” Grace says, “their focus can be incredible.” Don’t expect them to listen to you drone on for hours. “When it comes to listening to any sort of teaching input, we have an old adage in the profession that the time in minutes that you talk to your class should never be more than the children’s age in years plus two. The key here is in children being active and unearthing the learning themselves as far as possible.” Sit next to them while you’re actively trying to help them understand. Grace continues: “Questions should be open, such as ‘tell me more about that’, ‘what made you think that, ‘what did you know already that led you to do that question in that way?’ ‘Tell me how you did it’, ‘Did the way you approached that work – why/why not?’ ‘What would you change next time and why?’ Take a little time to look up ‘Bloom’s Taxonomy’ online.” At this, and indeed, all ages, “You cannot over-encourage a child,” Grace says. “Try to give time frames and tangible rewards. Young children love a sticker. A hug and a jump around for completing the task at hand is also highly effective and can be explicitly built into the day’s timetable. Timers work well, as do clear expectations such as: ‘When I check in 10 minutes time, you will have written up to this line.’ They are approaching key stage 2 , but the same rider applies as to key stage 1: really try to minimise stress. There is even more material at this stage, both online and in the meat world, that you’ll be able to access through the school or online. The BBC is putting out its educational content, BBC Bitesize and BBC Teach, on iPlayer, as well as doing two bespoke educational podcasts a day on BBC Sounds. There will upsides. Wilson remembers: “You have to plan quite far ahead, because you’re going to get through an enormous amount of things. What would take a class a week will take you a day, easily, because you’re not waiting for 29 other people to finish.” Beadie Finzi, his mother, recommends bringing in other family members, though obviously for 2020 that depends who is well and how old they are. “While me and Alex [Wilson’s father] had some emotional bandwidth, we would have lost our minds if we’d done it all. And the conversations that Ben had with Uncle Tony about biology, he’ll remember for the rest of his life, because they were wild.” If you can think of people – other parents, family members – who are particularly good at a subject, you can organise group tutorials on platforms like Skype or Zoom. While you probably want to cover off the curriculum, you’ll have time to do other things. Kerstin Rodgers home-schooled her daughter for a year at the end of primary school. “My boyfriend at the time was very interested in self-sufficiency, he was a bit of a prepper. So my daughter was quite adept with an axe at age nine.” If the early years were all about “cooking, designing, problem-solving, experimenting, water play using the bath or sink,” Grace says, at this age you can “make up plays or compose letters and cards for grandparents, Skype the plays, put together Powerpoint presentations to share. Anything with a real-life purpose is far more appealing to children.” OK, deep breath: this might involve some arguing against Fortnite or TikTok. The cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels has left some teens ashen about the loss of their life’s work, others celebrating, some doing both in cycles of five minutes. Emphasise that the learning was and is precious in its own right, and the exams were only ever a pretty random temperature check on the infinitely vast and beautiful ecosystem of their giant brains. Or something. This does mean continuing to take the learning seriously, and trying to match the five hours of learning they would do at school. Most secondary schools will have a homework app and be funnelling through what they consider at least the necessary work, if not more. So apart from having to bend them to your will, the challenge is whether or not you can help if you don’t understand it yourself. “The first port of call is to see if your child can explain it to you,” Grace suggests. “In doing so, their own learning will become far more concrete. When you look things up online, be careful to put in the level of understanding that you need; is it for key stage 2 or GCSE?” Rodgers was actually trying to teach her daughter in French, her own second language, but coped with that better than the maths and science. “They way they teach those things has obviously moved on a lot from when we did them. So you’re having to learn it all again.” Look things up. Consult widely (by which I mean, ask Twitter). Try not come off as interfering. Kids are never too old to be diverted by arts and crafts. Consider a more advanced science kit, so you can blow things up. Let them have some privacy. Encourage them to talk to their friends after school, and especially if you’re self-isolating. Wilson recalls: “When I was 12, I didn’t have a phone. Which meant your friendships were at school, and that was it. I remember being incredibly lonely at points. This is what parents should prioritise. Technology makes it a bit easier. It’s definitely the trickiest aspect to get right.” Play a lot of cards. “If you do have a large family,” Grace says, “maybe there is a small project that a group of the children can work on together, such as a collage or painting while you hear one of them read or tackle the maths problems.” Above all, don’t be too hard on yourself or them; if you need to throw in the towel for the day, do it. Both Finzi and Rodgers dropped the timetable if they had to, and they have magnificent children (Ben Wilson is now in his first year at Sussex University; Kerstin’s daughter is Sienna Rodgers, who was an alternative samba band leader at age 8, and became editor of Labour List at age 23). Sometimes life feels like a marathon done at a sprint, and this is one of those times. We don’t have to win it – we just have to live it.",education
"Overcrowding in libraries and a severe shortage of desks have led to students at the University of Bristol being offered places to study at the SS Great Britain. The university’s history department has told students looking for somewhere quiet to revise during the January exam period that they can reserve desks at the site in Bristol harbour where Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s steamship is housed in a dry dock, more than a mile from their campus across the Avon. The students were told in an email that they would have exclusive use of a reading room at the site, along with discounted rates on food and drink at the attraction’s cafe. Overcrowding at Bristol’s main campus libraries has resulted in students queueing from 7am in order to get desks. Before last summer’s exams, students complained that library study spaces were often all taken shortly after the doors opened at 8am, and that overcrowding had got worse as a result of the university’s rapid expansion. Cameron Scheijde, who graduated from Bristol last summer, said the problem had got much worse during his three years as an undergraduate starting in autumn 2016. “In my first year you could get to the library at 8am in exam season, basically January and May, and find a desk by 8am with no problem, and it would be full by 11am. But this [past] year, by 8.30am every library place was taken,” Scheijde said. A current economics student, who did not wish to be named, said: “The arts and social sciences library is far too small. There are rarely any seats free during normal working hours and they only become free overnight. That encourages people to work late into the night or do all-nighters, which is clearly unhealthy.” It has grown aggressively since the introduction of £9,000 annual tuition fees in 2012 and the removal of the government’s cap on undergraduate numbers. In the 2012-13 academic year Bristol had the equivalent of 18,000 full-time students on undergraduate and postgraduate courses. By 2018-19 it had almost 24,000 – an increase of nearly a third. While the university’s marketing says: “Bristol is small enough to feel warm and friendly”, Scheijde said the effect of the increased student numbers could be felt across the campus. “It wasn’t just libraries; it was in classes as well. In my first year seminars had eight to 10 students; by my third year it was up to 30. When seminars are that big you can’t contribute much. I liked my lecturers, they were good and they knew what they were talking about. But there was definitely less one-to-one [contact] as time went on,” he said. A spokesperson for the university said: “We appreciate that study spaces are always in high demand in the run-up to exams and we encourage our students to make use of all the study spaces available including our libraries which run extended opening hours. “For history students the school has been able to offer additional study space in the Brunel Institute on Bristol Harbourside which is in close proximity to the main campus.” The university is proposing a new library for its central campus, costing £80m and including 2,000 study spaces. But it has not yet applied for planning permission and the building will not open until the end of 2023 at the earliest. Last year the Guardian reported that the university was funding special police patrols in parts of Bristol with large student populations in response to complaints from residents about noisy parties, student drunkenness and antisocial behaviour. At the start of the current academic year Bristol was criticised for offering some first-year undergraduates bedrooms in accommodation as far away as Newport in Wales, 30 miles from its main campus. Despite its growing pains the university intends to keep expanding: it is advancing with plans to build a huge complex near Temple Meads railway station in the city, renovating a derelict industrial site while adding a further 3,000 students.",education
"Universities could face losing their status, including public funding, if they fail to improve how they tackle harassment and sexual misconduct, under proposals from the higher education watchdog for England. New sanctions being put forward by the Office for Students would allow the regulator to explicitly require a university to address harassment and sexual misconduct as a condition of its registration. Any university in breach of that condition would face being deregistered, meaning they would lose state funding, barred from recruiting international students, and potentially could not award degrees, while their students could not apply for loans. The sanction is among a range of new enforcement powers the OfS could bring against universities if they fail to make adequate progress by 2022. The measures are set out in a new consultation, which aims to encourage universities to better protect and support students who experience racial, homophobic, transphobic, religious and ableist harassment and sexual misconduct. Universities will have until this summer to demonstrate to the OfS that they have adequate and effective policies and processes in place, including clear procedures to report incidents, fair, independent and unbiased investigations, and appropriate support for victims. Any university that fails to meet the regulator’s expectations could face sanctions. The regulator will evaluate universities’ progress for another two years and then assess whether its existing powers are sufficient to drive improvement. If universities fail to improve how they handle complaints in this period, the OfS proposes bringing in new sanctions. Other regulations proposed include a duty on universities to have adequate and effective policies on harassment and sexual misconduct. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said: “We continue to hear accounts of students experiencing harassment, sexual assault and other forms of sexual misconduct. Too often students say they are not getting the support they need if they suffer this unacceptable behaviour, and that reporting systems are not clear or effective. “Many institutions are taking concrete steps to address the issue. But we need to do more for the students who are still being let down by ineffective procedures and inadequate support.Where we see evidence of serious failings, we have the regulatory powers to intervene.” But the proposals were criticised by senior law lecturer Rachel Fenton, of Exeter University, who said there was already sufficient evidence that universities were failing to address harassment and sexual misconduct. She said: “This consultation is lightweight and wishy-washy. We know universities’ progress has been piecemeal. The OfS’s expectations are nothing new and too easily met.” Fenton said around half of university staff responsible for tackling harassment and sexual misconduct, surveyed in research published by Exeter University last month, indicated that their university has only begun to address these issues.  Fenton called on the government to impose a mandatory legal duty on universities to prevent and respond effectively to sexual misconduct and harassment. She added: “Universities need to be directly accountable to the government, not to the OfS, which seems reluctant to use its enforcement powers.” Rachel Watters, NUS Women’s Officer, said: “Students expect their universities to support them if they experience sexual violence and harassment. Unless universities can become safe environments to study in further action must be taken.” Universities minister Chris Skidmore said: “I am urging all university leaders to prioritise a zero-tolerance culture to all harassment and sexual assault by doing all they can to support students and improve the systems for reporting incidents.” A spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents 136 higher education institutions, said: “Universities are committed to ensuring students and staff have a safe university experience [and] welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the progress they are making on this important issue.”",education
"Learning a new language should be compulsory for pupils up to the age of 16, according to a new report highlighting the UK’s recent abysmal record in encouraging young people to study languages other than English. The report published by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) cites an EU-wide survey showing that just 32% of young people in the UK say they are able to read or write in more than one language, compared with 79% of their peers in France and more than 90% in Germany. The report calls for the overturning of the government’s 2004 decision to drop compulsory study of languages at key stage four – when pupils take GCSE exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – which has led to a steep decline in the numbers in England going on to study languages at colleges and universities. It also recommends that the government should start subsidising the teaching of languages at universities, “in light of declining enrolments and growing vulnerability for lesser taught languages”, for strategic and cultural reasons. “It was a big mistake to scrap compulsory foreign languages at GCSE,” said Megan Bowler, the report’s author. “Rather than continuing to present languages as not suitable for everyone, we need to include a broader range of pupils learning through a variety of qualifications geared to different needs. “Given the shortage of language skills in the workforce, we should safeguard higher education language courses, particularly those involving less widely-taught languages, and prioritise extra-curricular language learning opportunities.” Fewer than half of all pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland sit a GCSE foreign language exam, compared with three in four in 2002 when study was compulsory. The report notes that GCSE entries in German have fallen by 67% since 2002, while French entries have dropped by 62%. The British Academy said it supported the report’s recommendations, which match many of its own concerns. “With Brexit just around the corner, we need linguists more than ever. Languages are vital for effective trade, diplomacy and soft power, for social cohesion, social mobility, and educational attainment, all of which will be essential to the UK’s future success,” said Neil Kenny, languages lead at the British Academy. Nick Hillman, Hepi’s director, said making foreign languages optional at GCSE was one of the worst education policy blunders in recent memory, and that reinstating them was a “no-brainer”. “In terms of speaking foreign languages [the British] have never been good. But now the level has gone from low to dire,” Hillman said. The report suggests that GCSEs in England be supplemented by less academic alternative qualifications, including one for vocational language use and another for the study of community languages, available up to the end of the sixth form. A symptom of the decline has been a shortage of teachers, with the report recommending that language teachers be added to the Home Office’s shortage occupation list, to help recruit teaching staff from overseas. Currently only Mandarin teachers are on the list. The report notes that the devolved school systems in Wales and Scotland have had more success in encouraging the study of languages than England’s, especially in primary schools.",education
"A generation of south Wales social history formed the background to the life of my wife, Mary Renshaw, who has died aged 83. Born in Newport, south Wales, to Irene (nee Byrne) and Isaac Davies, she grew up in the pit village of Cwm just south of Ebbw Vale in Blaenau Gwent. Her father was a steel worker during a period when the second world war and the postwar economic boom brought prosperity to a region that had earlier felt the scourge of unemployment. Mary spent Sundays playing the organ in the local Presbyterian chapel, and was imbued with a culture that included the miners’ institute, rugby union and the socialism of Aneurin Bevan, the local MP. After attending Ebbw Vale grammar school between 1947 and 1954, she went to Canley teacher training college in Coventry and then taught music at secondary schools in Wiltshire and in West Ham in east London. She and I married in 1959 and, as was common among her generation of educated women, she put the interests of her husband first by helping me through graduate studies at Oxford University and then Northwestern University in Chicago. I began a career in journalism, and wherever we lived Mary took jobs that would fit in with mine, often teaching in further and adult education settings. In 1981 her experience in that field led to her appointment as head of the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit in Sheffield. There Mary did some excellent work in bringing adults, often single mothers, back to education and thence into jobs. Her energy and organisational skills were remarkable, as was her ability to make friends. In retirement she read voraciously, was an enthusiastic bridge player, played the piano, and sang most days for an hour. Mary is survived by me, our son, Donovan, daughter, Rebecca, and granddaughter, Alexandra. Two other sons, Richard and Caradoc, predeceased her.  ",education
"My mother, Olive Keidan, who has died aged 95, was a psychiatric social worker who became a lecturer in social administration at Liverpool and Bangor universities. She was born in Liverpool to Alice Walters and her Scottish husband, Thomas Tulloch, an engineer. After attending Holly Lodge school in Liverpool she trained in social work at Liverpool University (1942-44), then worked for the next two decades as an evacuation welfare officer, maternity and child welfare almoner, tutor, and a psychiatric social worker for United Liverpool hospitals. In 1967 she became a lecturer in social administration at Liverpool University, a post she held for the next 16 years. During that time she worked as an editor of Penelope Hall’s Social Services in England and Wales, a textbook widely read by anyone in social policy, social work or social administration. After taking early retirement from the university in 1983, she accepted an invitation to teach at Bangor University the following year, and when she finally retired from Bangor in 1990 she helped found the Liverpool branch of the University of the Third Age.  Outside social policy Olive was a keen amateur zoologist, botanist, dressmaker, cook, writer and artist. She was also a devotee of the Royal Shakespeare Company, while Liverpool’s Shakespeare Society had brought her together with Saul Keidan, a consultant paediatrician at Alder Hey Children’s hospital, whom she married in 1953. He died in 1966. Olive was eternally optimistic and enthusiastic, and had a lust for life and a joy in all things. Her intellectual curiosity, love of the natural world, boundless hospitality, compassion and sense of fun touched everyone she met.

"The first time Olivia Champion pitched a business idea based on her academic research was so disheartening she nearly gave up. The 10-strong panel she faced were all men, bar a few women responsible for administration and taking minutes. Their first question was: “Why are you here?” “It took the wind out of my sails immediately,” she says. “I thought, ‘Blimey. This is going badly.’” She had been convinced her idea was good, but after that rejection she began to doubt herself. “They were very dismissive,” she says. “And quite rude, to be frank.” After being encouraged by her university, Exeter, to give pitching one more try, Champion went on to secure all the investment she was seeking. Five years on, her company, BioSystems Technology, which sells insect larvae for scientific testing and reduces the need to experiment on mammals, is in profit. But her example is rare. Just 13% of spinout companies based on university research and in which the institution retains some ownership have at least one woman founder, according to a recent report by researchers at Oxford Brookes University. The research, part of a programme funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) looking at barriers to the participation of female scientists in university spinout companies, also found that women in decision-making positions were more likely to work in smaller spinouts – those with fewer than 25 employees – and that the more female founders a spinout company had, the less financial investment it tended to receive. Simonetta Manfredi, who is leading the research and is a professor of equality and diversity at Oxford Brookes, says this matters because university spinouts will soon become increasingly important, due to a government drive to force institutions to demonstrate the real-world impact of their research. “Spinouts produce jobs and can make a significant contribution to their local community,” she says. Politicians are also waking up to the importance of gender equality in this area. Last year, a government-commissioned review of female entrepreneurship found only one in three UK entrepreneurs were women, and argued that addressing this could boost the economy by £250bn,. There is certainly a good business case for diversity. Research carried out by McKinsey & Co in 2017 found companies with the greatest gender diversity on their executive teams were 21% more likely to outperform peers on profitability and 27% more likely to create superior value. But it is also about ensuring a more equal society Ana Avaliani, head of enterprise at the Royal Academy of Engineering, says: “The types of products women bring to tender are informed by their experience and knowledge so it is vital we encourage female entrepreneurs to bring that perspective.”  Robin Mellors-Bourne, research director at Vitae, which supports researchers in their careers and is part of the EPSRC project, says one problem is that so few women study physics and engineering, which reduces the pool of potential founders. Statistics show just 18% of those studying engineering and technology in the UK and 17% of those studying computing in 2017-18 were women.  But the picture is complex. There is much less disparity in the number of women studying physical sciences and more women than men studying biological sciences, yet female spinout representation here is still low. While spinouts are traditionally founded by academics in senior positions, Manfredi says there is no reason they cannot happen at other career stages. “The assumption that there are not enough female professors, so what can we do about it, is not true because there is a bigger pipeline there,” she says. Yet she concedes that the male culture in science can be a barrier, alongside a lack of female entrepreneur role models. Avaliani, who was part of the founding team of a startup company 20 years ago, says being the only female was intimidating. “There were about five men – all engineers, all super high-achievers - in the room for a team meeting, and just me,” she says. “Although I was never made to feel a lesser member of the team it felt weird.” While the founders of her startup were convinced of the benefits of diversity, she suggests this is not often the case and the pressure to make a profit can make managers unwilling to take hiring risks. The academics interviewed by Oxford Brookes’s researchers also saw the dominance of male investors as a problem. The government’s review found that only 13% of senior people on UK investment teams were women, nearly half of investment teams had no women at all, and female entrepreneurs regularly felt investors judged them as less competent. The researchers are also investigating why female-led spinouts tend to receive less money. One suggestion is that it is because they ask for less. Champion says she was conscious that she was pitching for significantly less money than her male counterparts. “I stripped it all back to think, ‘What’s the absolute least I can ask for?’” she says. Another potential barrier is the effect of caring responsibilities, as investors may be deterred by CV gaps. “All of the men [enterpreneurs I interviewed] said”: ‘I couldn’t have done it if my wife or partner hadn’t taken care of the children,’” Manfredi says.  Time out of regular academic jobs to explore an idea would help potential female entrepreneurs, she adds. There is also evidence that women have less time for networking, which is an essential part of entrepreneurial success, so more opportunities for virtual networking could be useful. The next stage of the project, to be published in April, will look at whether men and women have different characteristics that may effect their involvement in spinouts, such as differences in self-confidence or willingness to take risks.  If Champion could go back in time, she says she would tell herself to be more confident – and ask for more money. “The guys all ask for loads of money and get it,” she says. ",education
"The prime minister’s brother, Jo Johnson, has warned against a proposal to cut university tuition fees. The younger, remain-supporting Johnson – who was universities minister until September when he resigned from government citing an “unresolvable tension” between his family loyalty and the national interest – argued that lowering student fees would do “grave damage” to higher education finances. The former Tory MP, who stepped down at the election and is now chairman of the group that owns the Times Educational Supplement, said cutting fees would also be “very bad politics”. The Conservative manifesto pledged to consider a review by former financier Philip Augar last year that recommended reducing fees from £9,250 to £7,500. The report, commissioned by Theresa May, suggested extended payments from 30 to 40 years, as well as reintroducing maintenance grants for poorer students. Meanwhile, Labour said in its own manifesto that it would scrap tuition fees entirely, citing spiralling student debts. Fees were introduced under Tony Blair’s New Labour administration before they were trebled during the coalition government, prompting huge student protests. Government figures highlighted last year showed interest charged on student loans is forecast to rise by £4.2bn to £8.6bn a year by 2024. Speaking on Saturday, Johnson backed the government’s pledged increase in science funding. He also said he wanted universities to remain properly funded, warning against lowering tuition fees. “I think that would do grave damage to our institutions’ financial stability and, also, I think it would be very bad politics as well but that is rather beside the point,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “So we’ve got to continue to fund our universities successfully and build on our research excellence and I think that’s the priority for the government.” Asked if there would be a significant impact if fees were lowered by a third, he replied: “Yes, there would be a substantial impact, particularly if that funding were not made up by the Treasury which, given the current politics, I would have grave doubts that it would be. The priority, where there is discretionary income within the Department of Education, is to put it towards schools and to put it towards further and technological education. We need to level up, rather than level down, university funding to create some sort of false parity.” He added: “I think where there clearly are grounds for concerns about universities are, as the sector has expanded, has quality been maintained? Are there issues around degree inflation? Are there issues around unconditional offers? Which are legitimate areas for criticism and for reform but I think to be vindictive and to be, sort of, punitive about universities because they were on the wrong side of a perceived culture war over Brexit, I think that’s completely the wrong way to go if we want to make a success of global Britain and our future post-Brexit.” Johnson also defended universities after Sir Robbie Gibb, Theresa May’s former director of communications, laid into the the Today programme’s election coverage in a comment piece for the Daily Mail. In a scathing piece, Gibb said the programme had “misread the politics of the election with endless outside broadcasts in universities, full of interviews with left-wing, entitled, virtue-signalling students”. Responding, Johnson said: “Our universities are clearly a great national asset and if we want to make a success of Brexit projects like global Britain, we need our universities to play a very big part in that. We need to be championing them and getting behind them and making the most of them. That means funding them properly and it means we don’t run down institutions like our universities and denigrate their cultures.”",education
"When Nigel Herring received a call at 3.30am from his daughter Lydia, a student at Salford University, he knew something was wrong. She had returned home from a night out with her housemates to find they had been burgled: one bedroom had been ransacked and all their laptops were gone. “Hearing her panicking and crying and knowing we were two hours’ drive away made us feel so helpless,” says Herring, a bus driver and part-time firefighter, who lives near Whitby, North Yorkshire. When Lydia started as a fresher a year ago, Herring says he felt able to relax because she needed to use a key card everywhere on campus, and security guards were very visible. Her second year was different: “When we visited the house to help her move, I did think there were a lot of trees and shrubs round it. But you’ve got to let them make their own decisions,” he says. Now the Complete University Guide, an independent guide to UK universities, is urging the Office for Students (OfS) to consider compelling universities to collect and publish statistics on crimes, including burglary, assault and bike theft, so students and parents can make more informed choices. Salford University is unusual in the sector because it already publishes monthly data on its crime rates – which it says are much lower than most of its competitors. Salford’s chief security officer, Trevor Jones, himself the father of a first-year student, says security doesn’t stop at the campus gate. Students can use the emergency messaging app Callmy if they are scared anywhere in the city, which connects instantly to Jones’s control room. If they are being followed, they can shelter in a number of shops, cafes or pubs under a safe-haven scheme. Jones runs regular sessions teaching students to be streetwise and protect their homes. “When students come back after the holidays we’ll be sending out reminders saying if you’ve got new phones or laptops for Christmas, look after them. We advise students how to look after belongings and to watch out for phone snatchers,” he says. Privately, urban universities say any league table of crime on campus would be unfairly skewed against them. And campus-based universities argue their students are more likely to report crimes to the university in the first place, because they are aware of the security team. The Complete University Guide sent freedom of information (FOI) requests to 143 universities asking about crime rates on campus, and how they monitor them. They found 31 universities did not collect central information about crime on campus, while 77 did – but only four said they made this information public. Dr Bernard Kingston, chair of the CUG guide, who wants to see the OfS intervene, says: “In our discussions with universities there has been a clear view that crime data would not be actively published for fear of reputational damage. However, the same argument could be made for many other types of information about universities.” Dr Dominique Thompson, author of a new parenting guide, How to Grow a Grown Up, and a university GP for nearly 20 years, says students need to learn quickly when they get to university – but not all do.  She points out, for example, that several student burglaries often happen in the same street in one night. “The police say this is because burglars will sit outside watching while everyone is getting ready for a night out, and then go in when they’ve seen all the houses emptying. Obviously, coming home to a door that’s been kicked in can be pretty traumatic, and students then worry the burglars will return.” Thompson denies universities are hotbeds of crime, but says: “Students may not want to talk about security as it’s a bit frightening, but it is a conversation parents need to have.” Although universities compile their crime data in different ways, the new FOI responses suggest real variation in crime levels across the sector. Levels of violence recorded at some universities were higher than elsewhere. For instance, the University of Essex recorded 54 acts of violence in the two years from 2016 to 2018, and both Kingston University and the University of Surrey recorded 43 acts of violence. By contrast, Bournemouth University recorded no acts of violence over those two years; Huddersfield University recorded fewer than five, and Salford recorded four incidents which it categorised as “assaults”. However, what is included may vary, with some universities including threatening behaviour or verbal assault under the category of violence. A spokesperson for Essex says the university is open about student safety and provides support to students as well as working closely with police across its three campuses. But, she says: “We are concerned that any comparison between universities would be misleading. Comparing campus universities, often spanning hundreds of acres with large numbers of residential students, with a city-centre university, is almost meaningless.” Kingston University says the latest police data show Kingston is one of the safest boroughs in London. “The university takes the personal safety of its students and staff very seriously.” This includes police attending the freshers’ fair to advise on safety, a 24-hour security service, and CCTV across all sites. The University of Surrey says the safety of students and staff “is a top priority for us” and crimes are treated “extremely seriously”. “Our highly visible and approachable security team operates 24 hours a day all year, actively encourages reporting of crimes and contributes to us being recognised by students as one of the safest places to study in the UK.” Bike theft is a big issue at many universities, reflecting a wider national problem. According to their FOI responses, Leeds University recorded 257 bike thefts between 2016 and 2018; Nottingham University recorded 242; and the University of Manchester 238. A spokesperson for Nottingham, which publishes all its crime statistics in an annual security report, says: “We meet regularly with the local beat sergeant to discuss how we can assist in the arrest of prolific known offenders, and support the police at a time when it is facing increased pressure on resources.” The university’s security team compiles evidence, including CCTV footage, which has contributed to 36 offenders being dealt with in the courts in the past year. But, they say, the penalties for bike theft are not a sufficient deterrent. Manchester’s spokesperson says: “The university provides a diverse range of crime reduction services, especially in relation to cycle theft. These include a subsidised cycle lock scheme and free bike registration.” Until now the CUG guide and others have used postcode-based police data to form a picture of how safe universities are, but critics say this pulls in unrelated crimes from the local area that have nothing to do with students and staff. Andrew Wootton, director of ProtectEd, which accredits university security and safety services, wants universities to collect statistics on student crime victims so they can understand what is happening. But he feels pressuring them to publish is unnecessary. “The bigger issue is how universities prevent these problems. More than two-thirds of students are under 24, so that means huge numbers of young people away from home for the first time. Universities need to make sure they are giving them the best advice and support.”",education
"I’ve been incredibly lucky to grow up in Cornwall so I feel a strong duty of care towards the ocean. As a child, I started making art out of the plastic I found on beaches and set up my first website when I was 11 to raise awareness and funds for the Marine Conservation Society. While studying marine biology at Plymouth University as an undergraduate, I realised how dire the situation really was and how much needs to be done. In 2017, during my third year, I co-founded a social enterprise called Beach Guardian CIC with my dad. After watching Blue Planet, people wanted to make a change but didn’t know how, so we had the privilege of facilitating local community beach cleans around Padstow – it’s a special thing because everyone feels Beach Guardian belongs to all of us. We’d be nothing without the volunteers who join us on the beach. Since we began, we’ve organised hundreds of outreach events and delivered workshops to more than 12,500 schoolchildren across Cornwall and as far away as Manchester, Kent and Salisbury. For me, it’s been a phenomenal learning curve. I’ve gained experience applying for grants, organising events, and my confidence has grown exponentially through regular public speaking. When someone’s outlook on our throwaway society is changed because of what we do – I feel so inspired. Now as a postgraduate, my peers are so supportive and some are getting involved with Beach Guardian. I know that if I want to see global significant change, I have to start working with policy and legislation – so my master’s in conservation science and policy at Exeter is giving me enormous insight. I want to learn not just from my lectures but from my peers as well – I’m broadening my horizons beyond just marine biology and I’m always eager to learn more. It’s undoubtedly hard work juggling postgraduate studies alongside my activism. I have a great support network, and I plan my school bookings around lectures. This year has been intense but I wouldn’t change it – it’s a stepping stone that will help my career by broadening my knowledge, expanding my profile and developing my network. Volunteering is one of the most important things that anyone can do, especially as a postgraduate student, because it shows potential employers that you have that drive to do something you feel strongly about and put your passion into practice. It opens up doors, too – I’ve made new connections with some amazing people, which empowers me to keep going. This university is a hub for sustainability expertise. So much peer-reviewed research in sustainability comes out of Exeter, there’s the Centre for Circular Economy that collaborates with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, plus the university is a partner in Tevi (Cornish for ‘grow’), an initiative that aims to gear business towards environmental sustainability. There has been a real culture shift in awareness about plastic, the environment and the climate crisis. Sustainable solutions must be part of whatever postgrads do in the future. There’s something every profession can do and university courses must reflect this. Every course needs a module about sustainability but even if they don’t, you can still be proactive and sign up to university societies such as Extinction Rebellion – every student has a voice and the power to make positive change and limit their own environmental impact. Of course, we need top-down help from industry and policymakers but everyone can make a difference.",education
"Six days a week Brendan, 17, leaves at six in the morning for his job on a building site and doesn’t get home until tea time. It’s his first job and he is loving it. “I am very, very proud of him,” says his mother. But it could have turned out very differently. Brendan left his academy trust school in Normanton, West Yorkshire, without any GCSEs, having spent much of his time in an isolation cubicle, banned from talking to other pupils or looking left or right, and with just three toilet breaks in a day to stretch his legs. In his last term, in 2018, his mother finally managed to get him assessed by an educational psychologist. “She said he found it hard to process information unless it was written down and he couldn’t sit in an enclosed space for more than 45 minutes,” his mother says. “He would get up and walk around the school to ‘reset’ himself and that’s why he ended up in isolation. Once in isolation, he kept failing it because he would get up and walk around, so in he went the next day – he was in isolation for six weeks one term – and those in the booths had to stay an extra hour after school as a punishment as well. “I struggled and struggled with the school for years to get him assessed for support because I didn’t want him to lose out on his education as I did. I went back into education and did what I had to at 40 and I hope he will too,” she adds. The school, Freeston academy, has since been taken over by another trust, the Outwood Grange Academies Trust, which says children are put in “reflection classrooms” rather than isolation. Widespread use of isolation has prompted a Lose the Booth conference later this month in Leeds, where teachers, psychologists, children’s rights activists and parents will call for the practice to be banned, or used only as a last resort. And last week a report by the Centre for Mental Health charity said that putting pupils in isolation for long periods could harm their mental health. Behind the issue, however, is the bigger question of how schools should respond to pupils with challenging behaviour. The growing popularity of “zero tolerance”, especially across multi-academy trusts, has led to children with special educational or emotional needs being sent into isolation. In some schools, children are sent into isolation for turning up in the wrong colour shoes or socks. The Ruth Gorse academy, for example, part of the GORSE Academies Trust, which manages 11 schools around Leeds, has a list of rules on its website and warns: “Students with inappropriate hairstyles will be placed in isolation.” One primary headteacher was called by his 11-year-old daughter’s school to say she was in isolation for forgetting to bring in her planner “but if I brought it in she could come out”. He said it was an hour-and-a half round trip to go home to collect it, and he was in a meeting. “The school said bring in £5 for a new planner and she can come out. It’s ridiculous, having to pay a ransom to get your daughter out of ‘prison’ just because she forgot her planner for the first time ever,” the headteacher says. Later, the issue was resolved and the school is now reviewing its isolation policy. Paul Dix, a behaviour consultant, says every day children are being sent to isolation for trivial things – but it doesn’t have to be like that. “There are schools that have calm classrooms without recourse to these ridiculous Victorian punishments. They work with their children and get to know and understand them.”  Yet the zero-tolerance approach, more recently dubbed “warm strict”, is being promoted by schools praised by the government for their performance. Mark Lehain, founder and former headteacher of the Bedford free school, says he used isolation booths, but children were being isolated “from other pupils, not from mankind”. “They were next to the room where the pastoral leaders are based so they could work with them and keep an eye on them,” he says. “Teachers are free to teach and children to learn and we can work with the smaller group of children to sort out their behaviour. The campaigners against the booths are largely driven by [Jean Jacques] Rousseau’s ideology that all children are fundamentally good and if they misbehave, then they have an unmet need. But that is not how children are,” he says. “The ban the booth campaign is another front for the progressive approach to education, which feels it is losing ground. Not only are they wrong but their views are unpopular, because when you talk to parents, students and teachers, they want safe, orderly classrooms.” Tom Bennett, the government-appointed behaviour tsar for England, says “removal rooms” are a common feature in schools so children can learn in safe, calm environments. “They aren’t isolation rooms – I’ve never seen a school leave a child unattended. They’re supervised, and more often than not, accompanied by other students. So claims that these are isolation spaces is nonsense. These are safe spaces, run by adults,” he says. However, headteachers such as Simon Flowers, of Carr Manor Community school in Leeds, take an alternative approach, working with children to help them recognise and understand their feelings and make the right decisions. His school, for pupils aged 4-19, has a high proportion of children with additional needs and challenging behaviour but hasn’t permanently excluded a pupil for 15 years. “We don’t take the quick way out. We don’t have a punitive system with isolation rooms, we resolve things and the children leave us rounded, engaged and self-regulated. If something happens we pull together. Adults model the behaviour that shapes children, they don’t try to control them with laminated sheets of rules and punishments,” he says. Proponents of zero tolerance need to think beyond the school walls, Flowers says. “If I exclude the child who brings a knife into school, I have lost any impact on that child and they can be walking into a shop with the knife, down the street or on to a bus with it.” Children’s names have been changed",education
"Young children sit cross-legged on the mat as their teacher prepares to teach them about the weather, equipped with pictures of clouds. Outside the classroom, lightning forks across a dark sky and thunder rumbles. Curious children call out and point, but the teacher draws their attention back – that is not how the lesson target says they are going to learn about the weather. It could be a scene in almost any school. Children, full of questions about things that interest them, are learning not to ask them at school. Against a background of tests and targets, unscripted queries go mainly unanswered and learning opportunities are lost. Yet the latest American research suggests we should be encouraging questions, because curious children do better. Researchers from the University of Michigan CS Mott Children’s Hospital and the Center for Human Growth and Development investigated curiosity in 6,200 children, part of the US Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. The study is highlighted in a new book by Judith Judd and me, How to Succeed at School. What Every Parent Should Know. The researchers gauged levels of curiosity when the children were babies, toddlers and preschoolers, using parent visits and questionnaires. Reading, maths and behaviour were then checked in kindergarten (the first year of school), where they found that the most curious children performed best. In a finding critical to tackling the stubborn achievement gap between poorer and richer children, disadvantaged children had the strongest connection between curiosity and performance. Further, the researchers found that when it came to good school performance, the ability to stay focused and, for example, not be distracted by a thunderstorm, was less important than curiosity – the questions children might have about that storm. Teachers who concentrate on developing focus and good behaviour because of the links to good academic performance, now need to take on board that developing curiosity could be even more important. The study’s lead researcher, Dr Prachi Shah, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician at Mott and an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan, says: “Promoting curiosity in children, especially those from environments of economic disadvantage, may be an important, under-recognised way to address the achievement gap. Promoting curiosity is a foundation for early learning that we should be emphasising more when we look at academic achievement.” Children are born curious. The number of questions a toddler can ask can seem infinite – it is one of the critical methods humans adopt to learn. In 2007, researchers logging questions asked by children aged 14 months to five years found they asked an average of 107 questions an hour. One child was asking three questions a minute at his peak. But research from Susan Engel, author of The Hungry Mind and a leading international authority on curiosity in children, finds questioning drops like a stone once children start school. When her team logged classroom questions, she found the youngest children in an American suburban elementary school asked between two and five questions in a two-hour period. Even worse, as they got older the children gave up asking altogether. There were two-hour stretches in fifth grade (year 6) where 10 and 11-year-olds failed to ask their teacher a single question. In one lesson she observed, a ninth grader raised her hand to ask if there were any places in the world where no one made art. The teacher stopped her mid-sentence with, “Zoe, no questions now, please; it’s time for learning.” Engel, who is professor of developmental psychology at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, says: “When you visit schools in many parts of the world it can be difficult to remember they are full of active, intellectual children, because no one is talking about their inner mental lives. How well they behave, and how they perform seem much more important to many people in the educational communities. Often educational bureaucracies have shunted curiosity to the side.”  When teachers teach young children not to ask questions, it is not surprising that high-performing students studied by American researchers in 2013 were found to be less curious, because they saw curiosity as a risk to their results. The questions they asked were aimed at improving their results, whereas the questions asked by more curious students were aimed at understanding a topic more deeply. Of course, some teachers do encourage and enhance curiosity – Engel says that in every school she visits there tends to be one teacher who is managing it. But it is usually down to an individual – rather than a systematic approach such as that introduced at Ilminster Avenue nursery school, in Bristol. Last September the nursery took the radical step of permanently removing most of its toys for two-year-olds and replacing them with a range of cardboard boxes, tin cans, pots and pans, old phones, kettles, computers and plumbing supplies – anything with creative possibilities. The children took to the new objects immediately, making slides for building blocks with guttering, dens and spaceships with cardboard boxes and having conversations with imaginary people on old phones. Old keys were used to lock things away or unlock imaginary kingdoms. Most haven’t asked for the toys back.  Matt Caldwell, the headteacher, says sceptical parents and teachers have been convinced by the change because of the rise in creativity and conversation among the children. He says: “What children love is to copy what adults are doing with objects. What people and objects do makes them curious about their world. “School kills curiosity. When do children get to ask questions about things that interest them? As soon as they are at primary school they have to shut up and learn. It’s not the fault of teachers. They have so many targets to meet.” Paul Howard-Jones, professor of neuroscience and education at Bristol University, who has visited to observe the children playing with their new “toys”, says humans learn from novel situations and curiosity is important to that process. “Children should be prompted and encouraged to ask questions even though that can be challenging for the teacher,” he says. “We do need to find some time for questions during the day. There is not enough time in schools for creativity and following up on curiosity.” How to Succeed at School: Separating Fact from Fiction.

"The number of students from China at British universities increased again last year, with the latest figures showing that recruitment of Chinese students outstripped those from other countries. The Higher Education Statistics Agency’s breakdown of students in UK higher education last year showed that the number of students from China rose above 120,000 for the first time, accounting for more than one in every three non-EU students. While the number of new students coming from EU countries rose by 2% - despite the political turmoil over Brexit – the numbers from outside the EU rose by 10%, with those from China alone rising by 13%. The figures underline the sector’s reliance on tuition income from overseas students. Since 2014-15 the number of Chinese students enrolled in the UK has risen from about 89,500 to more than 120,300. Students from India increased from about 18,300 to more than 26,600 in the same period, while Italy, France and Germany each sent more than 13,000 students to the UK in 2018-19. For some of England’s most prestigious institutions, international students have fuelled their expansion. The London School of Economics now has more full-time undergraduates from outside the UK than from inside: 2,380 from the UK, including just 15 from Scotland, and 2,630 from international and EU countries. At University College London (UCL) and Imperial College, undergraduates from the UK make up only a little more than half of the total enrolled. Chris Skidmore, the universities minister for England, said the figures showed that the country’s institutions were able to attract students in a competitive international market. “I am delighted to see a continued increase in both EU and non-EU students, and we want to grow the number of international students to 600,000 by 2030,” Skidmore said. “Our universities thrive on being open, global institutions, which is why we’re allowing international students to remain in the UK for two-years post-graduation.” Non-UK students now account for more than 485,000 of the 2.38 million higher education students at UK universities. The figures also showed that the increase in students awarded top degree classes has come to a halt, following several years of rapid growth at some institutions that raised concerns among policymakers. The HESA statistics found that universities awarded first-class degrees to 28% of graduates in 2019, a figure little changed from 2018. In 2015, universities awarded first-class honours to 22% of graduates. Last year, a further 48% received upper second-class (2:1) classifications, down from 50% in 2015. But Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said universities needed to remain vigilant that they were not succumbing to grade inflation that would harm their international reputation. “It’s something that we’ve had countless conversations about, both with the sector but also with the Office for Students. We are going to reverse that trend. We are not going to tolerate that continuous drift of grade inflation,” Williamson said. Kirsty Williams, the education minister for Wales, applauded the rise in the number of students from Wales in higher education following her government’s overhaul of student support. “I’m particularly pleased with the increase in postgraduates, by more than 1,500, which play an important role in supplying talented researchers and innovators to help grow our economy,” Williams said. The figures also reveal that UCL has finally overtaken the University of Manchester as the UK’s largest mainstream higher education provider, with more than 41,000 students enrolled on degree courses, compared to Manchester’s 40,000. The University of Leeds overtook Birmingham to become the third-largest mainstream provider, while the Open University remains the largest provider of higher education overall, with more than 122,000 students. The figures also showed increasing numbers taking part-time degrees. Although the overall increase was less than 1%, it is the first time numbers have improved since 2009-10. Part-time study has been particularly weakened since the hiking of undergraduate tuition fees in England in 2012.",education
"State school pupils have won nearly 70% of Oxford University’s undergraduate places next year, a record level that represents a remarkable turnaround in the university’s intake over the last five years. Oxford announced that 69% of the offers it made this week were to British students from state schools or colleges for courses starting in October 2020, of a total of 3,909 sent to British and international applicants. Five years ago, state school applicants to Oxford received just 56% of undergraduate offers, while 43% went to those educated at independent schools, despite a substantial imbalance in the numbers applying. The university found itself regularly criticised by MPs and policymakers for ignoring well-qualified state-educated students, especially those from black or disadvantaged backgrounds. But since 2015, the university has overhauled its application system and pressed individual colleges to improve their recruitment and outreach. Those efforts were given a boost by the appointment of Louise Richardson as the university’s first female vice-chancellor in January 2016. Since then the university has expanded its widening participation efforts and outreach to schools with no or few Oxbridge applicants, while individual colleges led by Wadham and Lady Margaret Hall launched more radical schemes. Last year, the university announced a new foundation year scheme, and committed to boosting the proportion of its undergraduate intake coming from under-represented backgrounds from 15% to 25% by 2023. Oxford said that more than 22% of its undergraduates admitted in October 2019 were British students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, increasing from 18% the previous year. The proportion of black students admitted rose from 2.6% in 2018 to 3.1% in 2019. Samina Khan, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Oxford, said: “We are delighted by the record number of offers to state school students, and to students from under-represented backgrounds. This creates a strong foundation for what we aim to achieve. “We know that students from some backgrounds are not as well represented at Oxford as they should be, and we are determined that this should change. Having taught in state schools during my career, I know the wealth of talent that lies there.” Target Oxbridge – a programme created by diversity recruitment specialists Rare that includes the author Zadie Smith among its patrons – announced that it had helped a record number of British students of black heritage gain places at Oxford and Cambridge. Target Oxbridge said it supported students of black African and Caribbean heritage in securing 32 offers from Oxford and 39 from Cambridge for 2020 entry. Naomi Kellman, a founder of the programme, said: “We started with just six students in 2012, and so it is amazing to see the programme now supporting over 70 black British students to secure Oxbridge offers.”",education
"Four out of five children taken into care in England during their school years required support for special educational needs (SEN) at some point between the ages of five and 16, according to research. The study, which examined data on almost half a million children who began school in September 2005, found that of the 6,240 children who entered the care system during their school years, 83% required additional SEN support. Researchers from UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said they were surprised by the scale of special educational need among children in care, adding: “The data shows that a much higher proportion of children who have entered care received in-school prodvision for SEN than would appear to be the case from official annual figures.” Of those in care and requiring SEN provision, almost a quarter received an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) – previously known as a statement – which is a legal document requiring a local authority to provide agreed additional support and is generally for the most high-need pupils. Researchers also found that need for additional provision among children not in care was also comparatively high at 37%. Of the 57,200 children who came into contact with social services but were defined as in need rather than in care, 65% required additional provision for SEN. Last year’s government data – based on just one year of schooling – showed fewer than 15% of all pupils in England received provision for special educational needs and 3.1% had an EHCP. The study, which is published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, comes at a time of continuing concern about cuts to SEN provision. The government has promised to carry out a full review of the SEN system and has invested an additional £780m to help with immediate need, but campaigners say it is not enough and would like to see more long-term strategic action. The report’s lead author, Matthew Jay, said: “These findings highlight just how important provision for special educational needs is for many thousands of children. Special educational needs provision affects a large segment of the population – for some groups, the large majority. “Special educational needs can affect a child’s ability to learn and develop and they may struggle with their reading and writing, making friends and concentrating. This type of support can be very important for vulnerable children in contact with social care services.” Fellow author Ruth Gilbert added: “We know there are strong links between special educational needs, the need for social care support and health but we do not know whether changes in SEN provision in past years have impacted on the NHS or increases in social care referrals.”",education
"An Oxford academic suspected of involvement in the alleged theft of ancient Gospel manuscripts stands to gain from a government appeal to purchase an important artefact for the nation. Dr Dirk Obbink, associate professor in papyrology and Greek at Christ Church, is the owner of the artefact – a unique book dating from around 1414. The arts minister, Helen Whateley, has announced a temporary export bar on the precious Myrowr of Recluses, or “Mirror of Recluses”, a Middle-English volume of advice addressed to female anchorites and religious hermits. Last summer, Obbink put it up for sale at Bloomsbury Auctions in London where, on 2 July, it was sold to an overseas buyer. The temporary export bar has now been placed on the item because of its outstanding importance for British history and culture. It is a measure that gives UK buyers the chance to fundraise to purchase the item. A UK buyer would have to raise £168,750 by 13 April to save it for the nation. The owner, Obbink, a former recipient of a MacArthur “genius” grant, was suspended from duties at Oxford in October pending an investigation into the disappearance of some 100 ancient papyrus fragments from the Oxyrhynchus Collection, cared for in the Sackler Library in Oxford and owned by the Egypt Exploration Society. The matter was reported to Thames Valley police on 12 November. With an item of the quality of The Myrowr of Recluses – the only other known copy belongs to the British Library, and is incomplete – a museum or library would be expected to attempt to acquire the item. That could lead to the unusual scenario of a civic institution raising funds from the public to acquire an item from a person who is suspected of wrongdoing. One senior academic said: “Given that there is a police investigation it seems reasonable to question whether any of the activities Obbink has been involved with should be allowed to proceed. The process should be suspended.” In June last year, what appeared to be purchase agreements for some of the items suspected of having been stolen – four early manuscripts of the Gospels – were circulated online. They apparently bore Obbink’s name and signature. It was shortly after the appearance of these documents in public that The Myrowr of Recluses was auctioned. Obbink had bought it at an auction at Christie’s in London four years earlier, on 16 July 2014. At that time, the hammer price was £182,500. When he sold it in 2019 it fetched just £135,000. If the purchase agreements circulated this summer are genuine, the ancient papyrus Gospel manuscripts were seemingly being sold by Obbink to the Greens, a billionaire American evangelical Christian family that owns Hobby Lobby, a chain of crafting stores. The Greens opened a Museum of the Bible in Washington in 2017. The family is most famous for having secured a supreme court ruling exempting Hobby Lobby from providing morning-after pills to employees under Obamacare, owing to their opposition to abortion. Obbink, who did not respond to request for comment, has denied any wrongdoing. “The allegations made against me that I have stolen, removed or sold items owned by the Egypt Exploration Society collection at the University of Oxford are entirely false,” he has said in a statement. “I would never betray the trust of my colleagues and the values which I have sought to protect and uphold throughout my academic career in the way that has been alleged. I am aware that there are documents being used against me which I believe have been fabricated in a malicious attempt to harm my reputation and career.” The attempted sale of The Myrowr of Recluses sheds light on the commercial activities of Obbink, who has run at least two businesses marketing artefacts, controversially for a figure in academia, where involvement in the market may be regarded as a conflict of interest. In 2016, the Egypt Exploration Society removed Obbink from his role as one of the general editors of the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Series partly “because of concerns”, it has said in a statement, “which he did not allay, about his alleged involvement in the marketing of ancient texts”. Obbink’s businesses, the Castle Folio and Oxford Ancient, have operated in an office above a branch of TK Maxx in Oxford. Aside from the items allegedly wrongfully sold, a number of ancient Greek manuscripts were legally sold to Hobby Lobby from these businesses. Hobby Lobby is also understood to own several items, including manuscripts, dating from between 1100 and 1600, which it purchased from Obbink. A DCMS spokesman said: “We agreed with the advice from the independent committee that The Myrowr of Recluses is a national treasure and an export bar was warranted to try and keep it in the UK. We are not aware of any evidence of wrongdoing in relationship to the manuscript.”",education
"Starting salaries for teachers in England will go up to £26,000 later this year, rising to £30,000 in two years’ time, under government plans aimed at attracting more graduates into the profession. The proposals confirm an earlier pledge by the Conservatives, designed to increase recruitment and improve the status of the profession, which has struggled to recruit in sufficient numbers in recent years. Teaching unions welcomed the pay rise for new teachers as a step in the right direction, but called for similar increases across the entire teaching workforce which has seen a real terms cut in pay over the last decade. According to government plans, wages for new teachers working outside London will rise by 6.7% from September to £26,000, up from £24,373. They will get £30,000 in outer London and £32,000 in inner London where living costs are highest. In contrast, experienced teachers and school leaders will get a more modest pay rise of 2.5% this year, which critics warn will do nothing to stem the exodus of teachers from England’s classrooms, many of whom are taking up jobs overseas. “We are currently haemorrhaging teachers from the profession and we will never solve the teacher supply crisis unless this situation is improved,” warned Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said the 2.5% increase proposed was likely to be barely at the level of RPI inflation according to the latest forecasts. “The government should know from teachers’ reaction to previous differentiated pay increases that this announcement will create widespread dismay. With teacher retention problems worsening, this is a devastating message for experienced and dedicated teachers.” Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers added: “The government’s ambition to raise starting salaries to £30,000, whilst welcome, would be a mistake without also addressing the decade-long real terms reduction to the salaries of leaders.” The government will submit its plans to the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) which reviews teachers’ pay and makes recommendations on pay increases. The unions will make their own recommendations, among them a demand from the NEU for a 7% increase in pay for all members. The STRB will report back later this year. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said the increases marked the biggest reform to teacher pay in a generation. “We want to make teaching attractive to the most talented graduates by recognising the prestige that we as a society place on the profession.” According to the government, the changes represent the biggest sustained pay increase since 2005, which it claims could help retain more than 1,000 extra teachers per year by 2022/23.",education
"My friend David Mitchell, who has died aged 89 of Covid-19, was a music teacher, artist and activist and a champion of LGBTQ rights, disability rights and the rights of older people.  Born in London to Harry Mitchell, a publican, antiques dealer and bit-part actor, and his wife, Edith, David attended King Alfred’s school, Hampstead. During the post-second world war conscription years he became a conscientious objector, working as an orderly at Manor House hospital, Golders Green. He studied anthropology at the London School of Economics and then music at Goldsmiths College. He then worked in bookshops and art galleries before teaching music at London schools. In 1973 he became head of music at St Christopher’s school, Hampstead, where he remained for 22 years. He was greatly admired by his colleagues and loved by the students. When he retired from teaching in 1995, he reinvented himself as an artist printmaker, had several private exhibitions and participated annually in the Small Publishers Fair at Conway Hall, in London, where his delicate, subtle works were greatly appreciated. From an early age, David had campaigned against nuclear weapons and for gay rights - long before it was widely socially acceptable to do so. He was a strong believer in acting on your conscience and did so joyfully and with good humour. Later in life, he was a volunteer for issues related to ageing. He helped organise company for lonely older gay men and lesbians, was a trustee/director of various Age UK Camden initiatives, including supporting those receiving social care, and advised the Royal Free hospital in London about the treatment of older people. David received numerous awards for his volunteer work, including the Age UK Ambassador award in 2015 and the Charity Staff Trustee of the Year award in 2016. David met his life partner, David Hass, a writer and psychotherapist, on an anti-war march during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 – where I met him also, as a 13-year-old demonstrator myself. The Davids shared their interests, curiosity and a generous appreciation of others. Together they demonstrated how vibrant and inclusive a committed relationship can be. He is survived by David and by his nephews and niece, Dan, Michael and Jess. ",education
"School leaders are urging the government to ensure A-level students who have had their exams cancelled this summer because of the Covid-19 crisis do not face further disadvantage by losing university places because of a cap on student numbers. The warning came after the Guardian revealed that strict limits on the number of students each university in England can recruit are likely to be imposed by the government to create more stability and avoid an admissions free-for-all as the sector struggles to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. A government source said each university would face limits on the number of UK and EU undergraduates it could admit for the academic year starting in September – the first such limit since the student numbers cap was scrapped in 2015. However, Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, voiced concern about the potential impact on A-level students who have applied to university and could end up losing a place, having already lost the opportunity to sit their exams. “We are very concerned at the suggestion that some students will not be able to attend universities at which they have been offered a place, and we are seeking more information from higher education representatives,” he said. “We cannot have a situation in which year 13 students are disadvantaged, particularly given that these young people have already faced the uncertainty and anxiety of their exams being cancelled. We understand the pressures on the higher education sector in the current crisis but students should not suffer as a result.” One of the key issues facing the sector as a result of the pandemic is the likely loss of the international student intake on which many of the country’s leading research-based universities have become increasingly dependent in recent years. In 2017-18, of the 12,000 students at the London School of Economics, 8,000 were from overseas. The fear is that those universities who have in the past welcomed large numbers of international students will seek to replace them with UK students, taking them away from other institutions that would in turn face serious financial problems. Though limits to student numbers might protect lower-tariff institutions, the fear is it could then leave research-based institutions – currently involved in the fight against Covid-19 and seen as vital for the future of the UK – vulnerable because of the loss of the international student fee income that subsidises their work. Members of Universities UK, which represents 137 institutions, will meet on Tuesday to discuss options, including the possibility of seeking additional support for research-intensive universities via “quality-related” research funding. “Whatever we do, we must make sure that student choice is preserved and students who have not had their A-levels, do not lose out,” said Sir Steve Smith, the vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter. David Willetts removed student number controls from 2015 when he was minister for universities and science. Writing for the Higher Education Policy Institute in a blog due to be published on Tuesday, he said: “University is a safe haven for young people in these tough times. “We can expect many more 18-year-olds to try to get to university now as the alternatives are so poor at the moment. If the government does reintroduce number controls (which I would regret), it must not do so in a way that reduces opportunities for young people to go to university.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting our world-class higher education institutions, and will continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus.“We recognise the challenges universities are facing, but are impressed by their resilience and efforts to tackle the virus, through the use of labs, accommodation and community support.”",education
"For many of us in self-isolation, it can feel like the coronavirus has put the world on hold as we wait for release from our temporary imprisonment. But increasing numbers of people are using the time to build their skillset, with an upsurge in enrolments on online learning platforms such as edX, FutureLearn and Coursera, which offer “massive open online courses” – or Moocs. Coursera, for instance, has seen an eightfold increase in enrolments for social science, personal development, arts and humanities courses since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. “It’s unprecedented,” says the company’s chief product officer, Shravan Goli. (In late March, its Science of Well Being course saw 500,000 new enrolments in a single weekend.) Devoting some of our quarantine time to self-education makes sense. Besides helping to bolster your career during this economic uncertainty, learning a new skill can give you a sense of control that will help cope with anxiety engendered by the epidemic. As James Wallman says in his book Time and How to Spend It, personal growth is central to many psychological theories of long-term happiness. So although an hour listening to a lecture may not be as enticing as the instant gratification of reality TV or social media, it will lead to greater life-satisfaction in the long term. “You could say that humans are like bicycles: if you’re not heading towards something you fall over,” Wallman says. And when we are social distancing, online courses are one of the best ways to do that. The specifics vary from platform to platform, though many follow the same basic model. With the larger platforms such as edX, Coursera, and FutureLearn, you can choose university-affiliated courses – so you know you are being taught by experts in the field. The courses are of varying lengths – from a few hours to a regular, weekly commitment over several months – and typically involve video lectures, reading texts and regular tests to check your memory and understanding of the syllabus. In many cases enrolment is free, but may have to pay to get a certificate verifying that you have completed the course. You might be tempted to sign up to the courses with the most prestigious instructors, but that would be a mistake, says James Murphy, who used Moocs to prepare a master’s degree while he was housebound with an illness. “Institutional affiliations aren’t always a good guide to quality,” he says. Many of the platforms offer user reviews where you can gauge other learners’ enjoyment and satisfaction with the course, but nothing beats trying it for yourself, says Murphy, who is now an associate lecturer at the Open University. “I think the best advice is to sign up and see if you like it – there’s no reason to stick with one you dislike if the delivery isn’t engaging. You can usually tell in the first hour if you’ll enjoy the course or not.” If you are hoping for professional development and considering the cost of the certificate, you might want to check whether employers recognise the qualification. Coursera’s Goli points out that about 30 companies now accept the Google-affiliated course on IT management, for instance. The reviews can guide you on this, as can the course descriptions, which sometimes include statistics from student surveys about the professional benefits that came from the experience. It’s also important to pick a course of the right difficulty – something just beyond your comfort-zone – engaging enough to occupy your mind, but not so ambitious that it’s frustrating. That way, you’ll achieve the “flow state”. “You’ll lose track of time,” says Wallman – and the deep concentration will feel much more rewarding than simply scrolling through social media. Even if you have chosen a course that is perfectly suited to your goals, you may find your initial enthusiasm evaporates and your discipline trails off. “Lack of routine and time is often the biggest hurdle,” says writer and regular Mooc user Bianca Barratt. Her advice is to try to set up a schedule and “treat it like a physical class you’ve signed up for. Show up when you say you will, make an effort with the class exercises and homework and complete the course in full.” Another good strategy, according to Anant Agarwal, the founder and CEO of edX, is to find a “study buddy or form a bigger learning group, so that they can motivate each other and enjoy the course together”. You might make a pact with people you already know, or you could connect with people from the discussion forums that accompany the course. Like your classmates at a traditional school or university, you can help each other to understand the difficult material, and the feeling of accountability might spur you on when you find distractions drawing you away from your goal. For some, this may be just the start of the journey – furnishing you with a greater confidence to learn and the motivation to take it further. If you find that you’re hooked, many of the platforms also provide accredited bachelors and master’s degrees from selected universities, though this will be more expensive. For others, the completion of a single course will be enough. But whatever your goals, the quest to learn a new skill or discipline may be the perfect distraction from the frustrations of self-isolation – allowing you to connect with new people and transforming this period into a time of enlightenment and self-discovery.

"When it looked like the UK would go on lockdown, final year student Jia Wei Lee knew she had to stay in her student house in Wales, away from her home country of Malaysia. It was a difficult decision, but with a dissertation to write and a student visa to worry about, Lee decided to isolate in Treforest, where she studies biology and conservation at the University of Wales. “It feels like we’re a community but we are separated by walls. I realised that I didn’t want to dwell on suffering,” she says. “I want to bring this community closer together – breaking the virtual barriers between everyone.” Lee started posting videos on social media to share life hacks – some useful (like tips for folding clothes in three seconds) and some not so conventionally helpful (how to make a slingshot from a rubber band). It’s one of the ways Lee has learned to cope on lockdown, as just one of thousands of students in the UK who are now isolating in university halls and student accommodation. With around one in seven people experiencing distress associated with lockdown, we asked students and psychologists for their tips on how to get through this difficult period. Setting a routine is vital for your wellbeing. Professor Kevin Morgan, sleep expert at Loughborough University, warns that you shouldn’t use sleep “as a counter-product to boredom”. He says it’s critical to get out of bed at a normal time in the morning.  Although all the usual life cues are gone – like lectures, or meeting friends – we need to keep the things that synchronise our body clocks, Morgan says, such as meal times, recreation, and winding down in the evening. Keeping a routine not only helps with sleep but will keep you motivated, says survival psychologist Dr Sarita Robinson, from the University of Central Lancashire. “People in extreme environments can survive and come out mentally intact because they have appropriate coping mechanisms. A structured plan can be really helpful in keeping you motivated, so you don’t just fall away into feeling listless and depressed.” Build studying into your routine. Mike Leaf, a final year geoscience student at Keele University, advises giving yourself deadlines. Setting yourself a goal of finishing a chapter of a project by the weekend, for example, will “keep you focused without guidance from supervisors.” Lee says she checks in with friends to keep on task. She calls them her accountability buddies. “We motivate each other to finish our aims for the day.” Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to achieve. This is an unprecedented time, and “it’s absolutely OK to not be OK at the moment,” Robinson says. It’s good to have goals, she adds – “but my goals aren’t things like I’m going to write a high-impact journal. My goals are finishing that jigsaw, or spending an hour learning how to dance the Charleston. Low-level goals keep you motivated.” See what support is on offer at your university or students’ union. Robinson says: “It’s about reassuring students that we’re here for them. There is a lot of support, especially for international students unable to travel home, or students estranged from families.” Call your friends and family, and arrange virtual pub quizzes or games. “If you’re a person who enjoys social contact, then it’s about trying to find a new way to connect,” she adds. Morgan says the key is to get outside to exercise. “Get out and do a sensible amount of exercise when the sun is bright. Tell your physiology that it’s daylight. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you can exercise yourself to sleep – you can’t, but what you can do is relieve some of the stresses that would otherwise accumulate through a confined environment.” Exercise doesn’t have to be a workout. “It can mean moderate walking. It can simply mean being outdoors, raising your heart rate at about 50%,” he says. Lee adds: “Whenever I feel anxious, I make sure to get out of the house and take my one hour of exercise. I can take a breather. It’s about listening to your body.” The mental health benefits from interacting with green space are huge. If you can, go for a walk in a park or garden. But if that’s not possible, bring the garden inside instead. “Try virtual tours,” suggests Robinson. ”Just looking at green scenery has been shown to be beneficial. Growing things is also very therapeutic.” Extensive research suggests gardening helps reduce anxiety and stress-related symptoms. You can still grow plants if you’re living in one room in block halls. Herbs such as coriander or rosemary are good for windowsills, and you can even get a (free) houseplant after eating an avocado. Fill a glass with water, and put toothpicks in the avocado stone to suspend it on the rim, so the bottom half rests in water. Make sure it has sunlight, and when the stone sprouts, pot some compost and watch it grow. “If you start thinking that you’re stuck in your room, that can be quite demoralising. Rephrase it to ‘I’m safe in my room, I’ve got opportunities to do things that I can concentrate on,’” Robinson says. Many exercise classes, social activities, concerts, and theatre shows are taking place online, so there will always be something to keep you busy. See if your favourite artist or comedian is livestreaming a gig. Or use this time to discover new experiences, whether it’s cooking, gaming, or going to the theatre (virtually). There are resources to help you find these new and mostly free experiences. For example, Cheapskate newsletter, which normally lists affordable things to do in London, is now collating the week’s best free indoor activities, from digital art tours to “e-life drawing” workshops.",education
"The University and College Union (UCU) has condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The union’s general secretary Jo Grady called on the university to halt proposals to cut “live” teaching by 25% as part of a radical shift towards providing online learning, which she described as “destructive” and “an attack on staff”. The radical redesign of the university’s curriculum, revealed by student newspaper Palatinate, would “invert Durham’s traditional educational model”, based on residential study, with one that places “online resources at the core enabling us to provide education at a distance”. The proposals, drawn up by deputy vice-chancellor Antony Long and vice-provost for education Alan Houston, warned that Durham has been slow to develop online education compared to its competitors, which posed “a very significant financial and reputational risk” to the university. Under the plans, seen by the Guardian, some students would only study online, some would be taught on campus, and others would do both. The proposals, drawn up without consulting staff or students, would reduce the number of modules taught in person by a quarter in the next academic year, with the goal of providing at least 500 of them completely online by the summer of 2021. An anthropology and archaeology student said she feared the plans would devalue her degree. She added: “This is clearly to increase the number of students on the books paying full fees, whilst maintaining existing staff levels. I feel like [a] cash cow and fear more strike action while I’m out of pocket and have very little to show for it in terms of education.” The document, due to be considered by the university’s senate later this month, also proposes contracting a private education firm, Cambridge Education Group Digital, to develop a business case to implement the plans. The UCU said that universities “should not see the global pandemic as an opportunity to try and drastically alter their different business models”, and urged Durham to consult properly with staff and students over any changes. Grady added: “This looks like an attack on the livelihoods and the professional expertise of hard-working staff – all to line the pockets of private providers who don’t have the same track record of providing high standards of education. “Durham needs to halt these plans. The fact there has been no consultation with staff or students is unacceptable and we will continue to defend the quality of education staff provide and our members’ jobs. “Changes to our higher education system should be led by staff from the ground up, whether they are necessitated by Covid-19 or not. We will do everything we can to challenge this and any other similarly destructive proposals.” The Durham plans revealed that a third of its undergraduate and half of postgraduate modules currently lack any online learning, noting: “In the short-term, we risk being unable to provide even a basic ‘minimum viable product’ online for our [academic year] 2020/21 intake.” The university aims to provide its key postgraduate and first-year undergraduate degrees online by October 2020, with a focus on delivering those with the most “international market potential”. Durham UCU branch held a virtual emergency general meeting this week where members “voted to firmly oppose rushed long-term changes taken without proper consultation”. More than 300 Durham academics have also signed a letter to vice-chancellor Stuart Corbridge, describing the proposals as “highly concerning … cynical and reckless”. Prof Antony Long, the university’s deputy vice-chancellor, said: “None of us yet know what the 2020-21 academic year will look like, but we must plan now so that when we do, we have options properly developed and ready to implement. “Anticipating that some and perhaps a significant number of students will not be able to travel to and live in Durham [then], we are preparing an online, distance learning programme that is both inclusive and high-quality.”",education
"Schools across the UK will not reopen after the Easter holidays, after national governments insisted they would only do so when scientific advice said it was safe to proceed. Teaching unions said their members were alarmed by a newspaper report that schools could reopen after the holidays and a review from University College London that cast doubt on the effectiveness of school closures in limiting the spread of disease. But Whitehall sources said no date had been set to reopen schools in England, and that a date would only emerge once scientific advice concluded it was safe for them to do so. The Welsh government also rejected any suggestion that reopening was imminent, with a spokesperson saying: “The Welsh education minister does not plan to reopen schools more generally in the immediate period following Monday 20 April. “Many schools across Wales are providing support to children of critical workers and the most vulnerable and they will continue to play this crucial role given the current public health emergency.” Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that Scottish schools were “not about to open imminently” at her Wednesday coronavirus briefing, saying that while she wanted to see children’s lives returning to normal it would be “wrong to give false expectations”. Education policy is one of the most devolved areas within UK government, but ministers and officials from the four national executives have been regularly coordinating and discussing strategy. Schools across the UK were closed indefinitely from 20 March but remain open for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. At the lobby briefing, No 10 also played down the idea that schools could reopen, pointing to government advisers who said it was too early to talk about any lockdown measures being eased. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told members he had received questions about the UCL review and responded in an email: “The government has not indicated to us that it plans to make any immediate changes to its policy based on the study.” He added: “There will be many views within the medical and academic communities on the effectiveness of the government response to the crisis and sometimes these views will contradict and be in conflict with one another. What remains important at this time is that the public, parents and professionals continue to follow official government advice to keep safe.” An article in the Times on Wednesday quoted an unnamed senior minister as saying: “We need to be led by the science, of course. But if we can reopen schools after the Easter holidays things could begin to get back to normal.” The UCL survey claimed school closures had only a limited impact on the spread of previous infections. But it was criticised by some experts in infectious epidemiology as “cherry picking” and for relying on data from influenza outbreaks and brief school closures. Neil Ferguson, a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London and the author of influential research informing government policy, said school closures played an important role in severing contacts between households when combined with “intense social distancing”. Jules White, the head of a state secondary school in West Sussex, said many school leaders were worried about how the UCL paper was interpreted, with many missing staff through illness or family commitments. “Schools will do everything to support the national effort. But it’s simply not sensible or safe to ask schools to open more fully unless coherent plans are in place to ensure that students, their families and staff will be safe,” White said. “A safe, wider phased return would be positive but only when the time is right and transparent plans are agreed by those who are charged to actually deliver them in our schools.”",education
"Universities are right on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus. They’re loaning the NHS vital medical equipment and facilities, using 3D printers to produce personal protective equipment, researching potential vaccines, and boosting the NHS workforce with fast-tracked medical students and healthcare academics. But these aren’t the only ways they’re contributing. Here are a few of the unexpected ways in which universities are using their research and resources to improve people’s lives. The lack of ventilators is one of the biggest challenges facing the health system during the coronavirus epidemic. But not all patients need a ventilator – some can be treated with a breathing aid. University College London’s (UCL) engineering academics have collaborated with Formula One to rapidly develop a device that means ventilators can be saved for those who need them most. A University of Cambridge team has developed a new test which can diagnose coronavirus in under 90 minutes by identifying traces of the virus’ genetic material. As well as enabling patients to be quickly triaged, the test can determine which healthcare workers have already been infected. It’s currently being rolled out at hospitals in Cambridge before it is launched across the UK. Worried that you’ve got coronavirus? There’s an app for that. Developed by researchers at King’s College London, the app asks participants to fill in some of their personal and medical data, then take one minute a day to report on whether they feel healthy – and, if not, to answer questions on a wide range of symptoms, from coughs and fever to fatigue, diarrhoea and confusion. The goal is to inform the public as well as provide real-time information on the spread of the illness across the UK. The coronavirus crisis is likely to put considerable strain on everyone’s mental health, but the pressure will be even more severe on frontline NHS workers. To tackle this, psychologists at the University of Liverpool have developed targeted mental health resources based on their work with people who have worked in high-stakes situations such as earthquakes, terror attacks and war zones. The newly created hospital, NHS Nightingale, is located out in east London’s docklands, right next to a University of East London campus. That’s why the university is making its student halls available free of charge to healthcare workers deployed there. Bristol Robotics Laboratory, the UK’s biggest robotics centre, is usually the place scientists go to ponder the complex questions behind bioengineering. But it’s now deploying its two-wheeled video-conferencing robot to give people real-time art exhibition tours at Hastings Contemporary, an art gallery that’s been closed due to coronavirus. While the public health emergency is what matters most, coronavirus will also have a serious impact on businesses. Teesside University has collaborated with the Tees Valley mayor and the local authority to shore up businesses and help them survive the crisis. The university is helping local businesses shift online as well as providing support to budding digital entrepreneurs. The lack of protective gear for NHS staff has been widely reported. That’s why staff at the Sir John Cass School of Art, Architecture and Design at London Met have sewn nearly 500 face masks over the past week to be used wherever they’re needed most, from maternity wards in hospitals to homeless shelters. The masks are made following NHS guidelines, and the staff plan to tap into the local sewing community to make hundreds more. Sitting at home isn’t where you’d expect to enjoy world-class performing arts, but the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS) is aiming to shift people stuck at home away from Netflix and towards something more highbrow. Digital platform RCSatHome is offering lunchtime concerts, talks and performances from its staff, students and alumni on demand. The platform will also shortly host a new original musical written and produced by RCS students. Two vertical farms experimenting with producing bigger, higher quality crops have been based in converted shipping containers at Nottingham Trent University for the past year. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, they’ve had a new purpose: the university is boxing up pak choi, spinach, Swiss chard, lettuce, coriander and basil to provide to homeless people.",education
"The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, has ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two. In a letter, sent to the Independent Schools Council of Australia and peak bodies in each state and territory on Thursday, Tehan stated he will use Australian Education Act powers to impose a new condition on independent schools, in effect requiring them to make classroom learning available or risk losing federal funding. Independent Schools Victoria chief executive, Michelle Green, said the demand put its schools in an “impossible situation … caught between conflicting advice from state and federal authorities”. It comes as the national cabinet meets on Thursday, a further opportunity for the Morrison government to push for schools to be reopened as early as term two, which begins on Tuesday in some states. Federal, state and territory leaders discussed how to develop a consistent national approach to which students should attend schools after the Easter holidays although no decisions were made. Tehan’s order represents a shift away from online learning at home to classroom attendance, a move likely to spark tension with Victoria, which favoured early closure of schools to contain Covid-19. Despite rising community concern the Morrison government opposed school closures all through March on the basis of medical advice, and even used the threat of withdrawing funding from independent and Catholic schools in a bid to force them to remain open. Closures were eventually triggered by Victoria’s decision to bring forward school holidays, and the use of pupil-free days in other states to prepare for online learning. In-person attendance at New South Wales state schools dwindled to as low as 5%. In the letter, seen by Guardian Australia, Tehan said he was aware “a small number of independent schools have chosen to stand down all physical classroom delivery and move to alternative, or online classroom delivery”. “While I appreciate that a number of jurisdictions are moving towards this form of service delivery, I am asking schools to retain a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who may not have a choice of keeping children at home,” he said. “These might be the children of essential front line workers such as paramedics, nurses, doctors and police officers who, in the absence of a classroom option, are forced to make the decision to stop working in our essential services.” Tehan added that students should “not be refused physical classroom access based on their parent’s employment”. Tehan noted his power in the act to impose conditions on schools’ funding whether he believes them to be in the public interest. “Therefore I am advising you that I will be varying the approval of all independent approved authorities to include a condition from the commencement of term two, requiring schools to provide a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who choose to access it,” he said. Despite the order, Tehan also recognised the need for schools to follow “the advice of the health or education authorities of the commonwealth or the state or territory in which the school is located, including any directions they may issue in regard to school shut downs”. The condition provides an exception for schools following local health or education authorities’ direction if the authority “has acted genuinely and in good faith in discharge of its duties of care to students, employees and others”. Green noted the Victorian chief health officer had advised all schools to move to remote learning, and that “all children who can learn at home must learn from home – with exceptions only in extremely limited circumstances”. Green said Tehan’s warning about funding “left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students, confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress”. “I have alerted the federal minister to the practical implications of his announcement and pressed him for urgent clarification.” On Thursday the Northern Territory government announced that school attendance will be compulsory from day one of term two, 20 April. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said her government was in talks with education experts about how to educate children and would use the Easter break to “consider our options about what term two for schools will look like”. “But again it will be based on health advice and in consultation with all of our stakeholders, including of course principals and teachers and parent groups as well,” she said. State by state guide: Term two dates: 14 April–26 June  The first day of term two is a student-free day. Students are still expected to start from Wednesday 15 April. Position on schools: Most students will be educated from home when term two starts to ensure physical distancing helps slow the spread of coronavirus. Free internet access and laptop will be provided for students who need them. Onsite learning will only be available for children whose parents can’t work from home and vulnerable students without access to a suitable learning environment. Term two dates: 27 April–3 July Position on schools: State schools have remained open but in-person attendance fell to 5% in the first week of April. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said to expect a further announcement about term two after the Easter break. Term two dates: 20 April–26 June Position on schools: Schools remained open for children of essential service workers, with pupil-free todays used to plan for online education. Announcement on term two expected on Tuesday. Term two dates: 28 April–3 July Position on schools: Teachers are preparing to continue delivering learning from home for their students, but parents are advised that “if you have to send your children to school, we will continue to provide a safe environment for them and support their learning”. Term 2 dates: 28 April–3 July Position on schools: ACT public schools will move to remote learning in term two. Most public school students will undertake their learning from home. For parents and carers who cannot keep their children at home, due to work or additional needs, the ACT government will provide supervision at a reduced number of public school sites. Term two dates: 27 April–3 July Position on schools: In South Australia, the advice of the chief public health officer is that schools, preschools and early childhood services should remain open. Parents can choose to keep their children at home. Term 2 dates: 28 April–3 July Position on schools: From 26 March, families were encouraged to keep children at home, if they could access the online or other resources for their education to continue. Term two dates: Begins 20 April. Position on schools: Unless a school contacts parents directly with alternative arrangements, children are to physically attend school. Exceptions can be made for parents who have informed the school their child will be learning from home.",education
"British universities have made a plea for billions of pounds’ worth of research and bailout funding to survive the coronavirus crisis, offering to slash budgets and cap student recruitment in return. The Guardian has learned that the University of St Andrews – one of the UK’s leading higher education institutions – is among those facing a black hole in its accounts due to the pandemic. In response to the crisis, Universities UK (UUK) has proposed a series of measures to the government that would double research funding and offer emergency loans to troubled institutions, as well as placing a cap on the number of undergraduates many institution can recruit in 2020-21. The government will embrace UUK’s public support for limiting student recruitment, which would reduce its losses from unpaid student loans. The Guardian revealed last month that ministers were pushing universities to consider a cap. The proposal would result in universities in England and Wales temporarily capping their UK and EU undergraduate intake at the forecasts that they have already submitted, plus a maximum increase of 5%. Students already holding firm conditional offers will be guaranteed their places if they meet their grade requirements. Sources at several leading universities say they expect the falls in international student numbers and research grants next year alone to cost them hundreds of millions of pounds, while lost income from conferences, accommodation and catering will drain £790m from the sector by the end of summer. St Andrews’ principal, Sally Mapstone, warned her staff on Thursday that the university had already lost £25m as a direct result of the coronavirus crisis, which would force it into significant cost-cutting. “It is as serious a financial crisis as our university has faced in modern times, and it will mean that we cannot do everything you want or expect us to, and that we have to take some very difficult decisions about our future,” Mapstone said. The proposal by UUK, representing 137 institutions, gives dire warnings of the financial difficulties in which many universities find themselves, with campuses shut and students abruptly leaving. “Without government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision. Some will be in places where they are the only local higher education provider with damaging impact on the local community and economy,” states the document agreed by vice-chancellors on Wednesday. Alistair Jarvis, UUK’s chief executive, said it was without question that British universities were likely to go bankrupt without further support: “There is a very significant chance of some institutions going bust – and part of this proposal is to prevent that from happening.” But its plans were attacked by the University and College Union as “piecemeal” measures that fail to fix the sector’s weaknesses. “Universities need to step back from the dog-eat-dog approach of recent times and come together properly in the wider interest. We fear these proposals risk leaving many universities vulnerable,” said Jo Grady, UCU’s general secretary. The UUK scheme also offers to “reduce costs, increase efficiency and moderate certain behaviours” such as curbing unconditional offers, as well delaying capital spending and freezing recruitment. It also calls for a “transformation fund” to “reshape and consolidate” the sector through mergers. Its requests include doubling quality-related government research funding from £2bn to £4bn a year, as well as assistance for universities relying on “very high numbers” of international students. Others include giving universities unrestricted access to the UK government’s coronavirus business support programmes. Vice-chancellors also want the government to make a multi-year commitment to offering loans and financial support for institutions “suffering significant income losses”. UUK warned that the loss of valuable international student fees would end the ability of universities to cross-subsidise expensive science and technology research. Jarvis said losses would hamper their ability to conduct research into pandemics in the long term. Scottish university sources said their crisis was more acute because of Scotland’s government not fully funding the costs of teaching local students, despite its policy of not charging tuition fees. That increased their dependency on overseas student income. University leaders say privately that they do not expect the governments to agree to all the proposals, with some fearing that ministers will “cherry-pick” the least expensive options.",education
"While not all students are happy about the shift to online learning this year, it’s widely seen as good news for the nearly 100,000 disabled students studying at English unis. “We’ve been asking universities for years to study online,” says Aleksandra Mroczek, a disabled second-year journalist student at Newcastle University. Sana Ali, wellbeing officer at the University of Leicester’s students’ union, says that although the opportunity to study online will be welcomed, this means that students will be more reliant on tech than before. Universities will need to provide access to reliable hardware for those who can’t afford it. Mroczek, who uses specialist software such as Adobe Premiere, has already invested in a new laptop that can run the programs, but this won’t be possible for all students. If you have a disability, rest assured that all universities will put a support plan in place. This will include letting the relevant school know about requirements that need to be met to ensure you’re given the same tuition. This includes establishing deadlines for assessed work, and the possibility of extensions based on your needs. The uni will also check in regularly with you to make sure you’re being given all the support you need. At Ali’s university, Leicester, there’s a specialist accessibility centre, which runs meetings with new students to identify their needs, whether that includes a support worker, or extra programs installed on their computers such as screen readers. At Newcastle, Mroczek received an email before arriving on campus from a student disability adviser. Some unis will contact you first, but if you don’t hear from them make sure you reach out. “Disabled students should do the best they can to understand the support that they require and be clear to institutions on this,” advises a spokesperson for the National Union of Students. “We would advise any disabled student who doesn’t feel that they are getting the support they require to contact their students’ union.” When it comes to socialising during the pandemic, there are silver linings for disabled students. Despite big advances in recent years, a lot of traditional student activities haven’t always been as inclusive as they should be. The move online may allow students to participate more frequently and readily in events and socials held over Zoom or Teams. “It’s important, now we’ve explored the digital realm, we should continue for our disabled students,” says Ali. “When we get back on to campus, people will forget that it’s a necessity for some.”",education
"My mother, Carol Morgan, who has died aged 78 from cancer, was a headteacher and a believer in the transformative power of education. Born to Rose (nee Wood) and Harold Hayes, a pattern maker, in Salford, Carol excelled academically and passed her 11-plus with the second highest marks in the city. Her teachers at Pendleton high school, where she became head girl and a top hockey player, identified her as “university material” – almost unimaginable for someone from her background. But she gained a place to study history at St Hugh’s College, Oxford, in 1960, armed with a collection of Elvis records. It was at Oxford that she met my father, Andy Morgan, a fellow student whom she first saw playing rugby for the university and who went on to play for Wales. They married in 1967 in his college chapel, and set off on a six-week honeymoon driving their new VW Beetle down the length of Europe to Greece, returning via the then Yugoslavia, where they drank Riesling in a state hotel with no running water. Teaching was Carol’s vocation. After Oxford she went to King’s College London to do her training, then taught in Banbury, Oxfordshire, and London before she and Andy moved to Cornwall in 1970. Andy worked in local government, eventually becoming assistant chief executive of Cornwall county council, while Carol, after various teaching jobs and a break to have her three daughters, in 1985 joined Truro high school.  In the 1990s she became a formidable headteacher of its prep school. She was an inspirational teacher – knowledgable, funny and irreverent. Carol became an unofficial mentor, tutor, “bonus great-aunt”, and surrogate mother and grandmother to so many young people, shepherding them through crises and guiding them towards what and who they could become. In retirement, among many other interests, she volunteered at the St Agnes museum, where she ran its Twitter account in the persona of the star exhibit – a stuffed leatherback turtle. Carol was a natural at social media. She was a lifelong Manchester City fan, and lived to see their glory days return, although she was too nervous to watch their matches live. Carol is survived by Andy, her daughters, Emily and Jessica and me, her grandchildren, Rosa and Dylan, and her brother, Harold.",education
"Schools in England and Wales are braced for a fierce backlash from students and their parents this week, amid fears that A-level results to be published on Thursday will unfairly penalise disadvantaged students. Since pupils were unable to sit their exams, their grades will be calculated on the basis of teachers’ estimates, combined with a statistical model based on past results at the school and the student’s prior attainment. In Scotland last week thousands of students received poorer results than they expected when a similar system was used. Although an appeals process was belatedly announced last week by the exam watchdog Ofqual, parents say it is not fit for purpose. Pupils will not be allowed to appeal individually and schools will have to pay a fee to challenge grades. Critics of the standardised system say that bright but disadvantaged students at poor-performing or improving state schools may have their grades unfairly downgraded. Southend sixth-former Lexie Bell has been predicted an A* and two A grades. But because no candidate at her school has achieved above a C grade in the last three years in her A-level subjects, her father, Michael, fears her results will be downgraded by Ofqual’s statistical model. “Ofqual is effectively tying in students to the performance of previous students at their school, which is in no way representative of an individual’s ability to do well,” he said, adding that the appeals process, which can take up to 84 days, was far too drawn out. “It will take too long. By the time their appeals have been decided, pupils will already have lost their places at university. And like in Scotland, it should be free and you shouldn’t have to go through the school to appeal. Because if your face doesn’t fit and the school doesn’t like you, they can just say no.” Bell is currently crowdfunding to mount a judicial review against Ofqual. “I can’t tell you how stressed my daughter is about this. She’s worked very hard and if her grades get marked down, because of the grades the school has achieved previously, the sense of injustice will be huge.” The Social Mobility Commission said Ofqual has “a moral imperative to address any injustices that occur”. Commissioner Sammy Wright, a deputy headteacher, said: “Overwhelmingly, disadvantaged students attend poorly performing schools. My biggest concern is not for the kids who want to appeal, but for the kids who don’t even think to appeal. There are a lot of students who, if they get lower grades than they expect, will just simply take that as a knock to their sense of self.” Ofqual has admitted that a substantial number of students will receive at least one exam grade that has been adjusted from their teacher’s assessment as a result of the moderation process. The watchdog said that if it had stuck with all the teacher-assessed grades, results would have gone up by 12% at A-level and 9% at GCSE. Instead, it has only allowed grades to increase by around 2% at A-level and up to 1% at GCSE. Many students will assume it was their teacher who was responsible for pushing down their grades, Wright said. “They will change their life choices on the basis of these results. It will have a huge impact on their lives, but unlike in normal years, they don’t have the security of knowing there is some kind of relationship with something they’ve actually done. Psychologically, that is a very difficult situation to put students in.” The Sutton Trust, an educational charity that champions social mobility, said it was vital that a robust appeals process, which balances fairness with practicality, is put in place. It added that universities should take the exceptional factors affecting applicants this year into account. “We are really keen that universities give poorer kids, particularly, a bit of leeway on these exam results,” said CEO James Turner. “This has been an exceptional year and the pandemic has affected the poorest the most.”  An Ofqual spokesperson said: “In designing the statistical model we took a number of decisions that work in students’ favour and mean that results overall will be no worse than previous years – and indeed slightly better. We are confident the model is the best possible under the circumstances. Following an early review of the data we expect the vast majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, or within one grade. “Students can appeal, through their school or college, if they believe an error has been made or that something has gone wrong in their case.”",education
"Ministers are facing fresh pressure to help schools in England limit the spread of coronavirus when they reopen fully in September after rejecting a call for teachers and pupils to undergo routine testing. Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said the government would not go along with a demand from the children’s commissioner for England to bring in routine coronavirus testing, and would only test those who showed symptoms. Scotland, where schools start to reopen from Tuesday, plans to bring in an enhanced Covid-19 testing and surveillance regime, though it will not be ready in time for the start of term. Schools and ministers are scrambling to make classrooms as safe as possible in the four weeks before they are due to reopen fully to all pupils, something Boris Johnson said on Sunday was a moral duty. However, there are concerns from unions that there is no “plan B” for schools if cases do start rising rapidly. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the Telegraph that part-time teaching such as “week-on, week-off” rotas could be needed in some instances.  The government’s medical advisers have warned that the return of schools could mean other areas of society need to be closed down again to avoid another uncontrolled spread of Covid-19, and ministers are also being urged to get the test-and-trace system fully operational. Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner, said she had been dismayed by the way English schools stayed closed to most pupils before the summer break while businesses such as theme parks reopened, saying test and trace must improve. “It has to be fit for purpose, and government has to make this happen,” she told Times Radio. She said regular testing in schools should be a part of measures to keep schools safe. “I’m not an expert in testing, but I would say that regular means weekly,” she said. “It needs to be as regular as it needs to be to ensure the infection is caught and identified as soon as possible, and then the tracking system can move on from that.” Gibb, however, said: “Anybody that shows symptoms in schools, teachers and pupils, will be tested … Not routine testing without symptoms. The advice that we have is that it’s better to test when people actually show symptoms.” He said schools would definitely open “to the extent you can guarantee anything in the midst of this very serious pandemic”, but that teachers and pupils in England would be reliant primarily on hygiene and distancing measures to control the virus. New swab tests to confirm within 90 minutes if someone has Covid-19, as well as testing for flu, will be rolled out in the coming week, but Gibb said these would not yet be used in schools. “The priority for the new 90-minute tests has to be the hospitals, the care homes and the laboratories,” he said. “But all the advice we have had is that the measures we are putting in place, the sort of hierarchy of controls about hygiene and so on, and bubbles within schools, is the most effective method of reducing the risk of transmission of the virus.” Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the prime minister said it was the national priority to get all English pupils back into classrooms in September. “This pandemic isn’t over, and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent,” the prime minister wrote. “But now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely, we have a moral duty to do so.” Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, also speaking on Times Radio, said it was essential that all English schools reopen in September, and that the government should provide extra resources in areas such as cleaning and the costs of staggering school opening times. She also stressed the need for the effective tracing of Covid-19 cases. “Without robust testing and tracing in place, schools can’t do all this on their own, and that is a really crucial element,” she said. “The government has a window between now and the end of September to get that right, and it absolutely must do so.” If, as expected, there is an increase in coronavirus cases in autumn and winter, ministers are likely to have to decide whether to restrict access to schools or potentially risk even more unemployment by closing parts of the economy. Longfield said she was “pleased that the government is now putting schools as a number one priority”. “I was dismayed when the government prioritised opening shops, theme parks and even zoos rather than schools,” she said. “I don’t want to close any of those, but there may need to be choices.”",education
"Scientists have called for routine Covid testing of teachers and pupils alongside a robust test-and-trace system, amid a debate over how to safely reopen schools in England. On Sunday, the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said teachers and pupils should have weekly tests, but Nick Gibb, the schools minister, ruled out the idea, saying instead that those who are symptomatic should be tested. Now researchers behind a report from Delve, a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society, have said routine testing will be necessary when the majority of children return to school. Dr Ines Hassan, a researcher in the global health governance programme at the University of Edinburgh and a lead author of the report, said the group were recommending the widespread and regular screening of all staff in schools, including those who are asymptomatic. “The cost-benefit analysis for the screening of asymptomatic pupils is more complicated, but on balance we recommend this also,” she said. “We recognise that the health risks to pupils themselves from Covid-19 infection are very low. However, the risks to school staff, parents [or] carers and the wider community are clear, and it is also very important to prevent full or partial school closures or widespread absences arising from transmission within schools, as these will cause further losses of learning, with its associated long-term social and economic effects.” She said routine testing was important as asymptomatic Covid transmission is estimated to account for 40% of community transmission, and potentially more among school-age children. Young people with coronavirus often have very mild symptoms. The Delve report also stresses the need for stringent hygiene measures, social distancing and clear guidance for parents on when to keep their child home from school. A robust test-and-trace system and investigation of outbreaks is deemed essential. However, Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said there remained debate among experts over whether testing should be widely used in schools, citing the risk of limited testing capacity, a very low coronavirus prevalence and false positives. The government says daily testing capacity is at nearly 340,000, and 166,000 tests were processed on the latest day for which data was available. “If you have an area [like the] south-west, where numbers are really low, then I don’t know how much you’ll gain from routine testing,” Sridhar said. “There are other places where you are having substantial transmission – I am thinking the north-west – and so I think there if you want to open schools, you pretty much want to have regular testing in place to catch cases.”  Hassan said work from other countries had shown that group testing – where individuals’ samples are pooled to check for any sign of Covid-19 within a group, followed by tests for each member in the event of a positive result – could provide for regular screening despite supply constraints, though false positives could remain a problem. “For example, provided the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in the general community in England does not rise too high above the current levels,[group testing algorithms] would enable the testing of all schoolchildren in England once per week, using only approximately 50,000 PCR tests per day, which is well within the UK’s current testing capacity.” She said a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out.  The approach would work well only if there was a low level of spread of Covid-19 in the community. “This [reducing transmission] will be especially important in the winter when, as the children’s commissioner and others have pointed out, flu symptoms can be mistaken for Covid-19 without testing,” she said. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has said a yet-to-be-published study found little transmission of Covid-19 in schools – apparently a reference to a forthcoming report from Public Health England. A PHE spokesperson said the analysis “appears to show that Sars-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the first month after the easing of national lockdown in England.” However, some scientists, including Dr William Hanage, a professor of evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard University, have said outbreaks or spread in schools could simply be going under the radar. “When there are statements that there are not outbreaks among schoolchildren, you self-evidently don’t find them if you don’t look for them,” Hanage said, although he said that unlike with flu, younger children might not make a disproportionate contribution to transmission of Covid-19.",education
"Nearly 40% of A-level grades submitted by teachers are set to be downgraded when exam results in England are published next week, the Guardian has learned, as criticism intensifies of this year’s makeshift results. Analysis of the algorithm and data used by the exam regulator Ofqual to distribute grades after the cancellation of exams amid the coronavirus pandemic found that a net 39% of assessments of A-level grades by teachers are likely to be adjusted down before students receive their results. That would mean nearly 300,000 A-levels issued are lower than the teacher assessment of the more than 730,000 A-level entries in England this summer. Including GCSEs, which are expected to have a similar downgrade rate, close to a net 2m teacher assessments will be adjusted downwards and in many cases ignored completely. There was uproar in Scotland this week when the exams authority rejected nearly 124,000 grade recommendations from teachers – a quarter of the total – but unlike in Scotland, English pupils are barred from appealing against their results on academic grounds. Grades will instead be issued according to Ofqual’s statistical model, relying on a school’s recent exam history and each pupil’s previous exam results, to replace the exams scrapped by the government after schools were closed because of the coronavirus lockdown. Those most at risk of receiving revised grades appear to be students on the border between B and C grades, and between C and D grades, and pupils at comprehensive schools with wide variations in attainment or patchy outcomes in courses over the three previous years of data that Ofqual is using to cap individual school results. Teachers will still have a significant influence on how grades are distributed in each school, having compiled the rankings that will determine which pupils receive the final grades allocated by Ofqual for their course. Headteachers and exam officials in England say they fear a storm of controversy even worse than that which has engulfed Scotland, where a quarter of teacher predictions were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Experts say that as Ofqual has barred individual pupils from appealing against their grades on academic grounds, families should not waste time complaining but instead contact college or university admissions offices to confirm their places in the event of unexpectedly poor grades. Tim Oates, group director of research and development at the exam board Cambridge Assessment, said: “Grades have been awarded this year by combining lots of data, including the rank order and the grades submitted by teachers. We have seen from Scotland’s press coverage that it’s all too easy to fixate on the difference between the teacher-assessed grades and the final grades. But it’s a misleading distraction and misinforms the public. The teacher grades were an important part of the process but always only going to be a part. “On results day, energy should be channelled into how each young person can progress swiftly with what they have been awarded, rather than time lost on agonising over an apparently controversial but fundamentally misleading difference between teacher grades and final grades.” Statisticians have criticised Ofqual’s algorithm, saying it does not have sufficient data to award grades fairly to most state schools in England, because of wide variations in results within schools and between years. The Royal Statistical Society has called for an urgent review of the statistical procedures used in England and Scotland, to be carried out by the UK Statistics Authority. “This should consider both the substantive issues of the data used and the adjustment algorithms of the various nations, but also whether greater transparency would have been possible and beneficial,” the society said. Huy Duong, the parent of an A-level candidate and a former medical statistician, said he has analysed Ofqual’s published data and comments to calculate that 39% of grades between A* and D will be lower than the teacher assessments. Duong’s findings were privately confirmed to the Guardian by exam officials. Duong’s analysis is based on Ofqual’s statement that A-level grades overall will improve by 2% this summer, and that the submitted teacher assessments, known as centre-assessed grades, would have resulted in 12% inflation in higher grades. “It gives the public the impression that in most cases the grades the student receive would still be the predicted grades. However, closer analysis shows that this is not true,” Duong said. In response, a spokesperson for Ofqual said: “From the data that we have reviewed we expect the majority of grades students receive will be the same as their centre assessment grades, and almost all grades students receive will be the same as the centre assessment grades or within one grade. The exact proportions vary by subject and we will publish the figures on results day.” But Duong also found that a comprehensive secondary school can have a huge annual variation in results for individual courses, with the small numbers of entries involved suggesting that Ofqual’s decisions are statistically invalid. For instance at Matthew Arnold school in west Oxford, a comprehensive academy, the proportion of A* grades achieved by pupils in a popular subject such as English literature varied from one in 19 to three in 10, or from 5% to 30%, between 2017 and 2019. Duong said: “These fluctuations mean that Ofqual’s statistical modelling cannot make sense. The problem is that any statistical model is only as good as the data you feed it, and for a typical comprehensive school, there simply isn’t enough A-level data from 2017 to 2019 for any statistical modelling.” In response, Ofqual said: “For A-level, three years of historical results inform the standardisation of grades. You can think of this as an averaging across the years of data.” Uncertainty over the grades being awarded has led universities to say they will relax offers to prospective students and make use of other data. Admissions officers for Peterhouse College, Cambridge, said during a Q&A on the Student Room website: “We are looking into which schools (from among our offer holders) are most likely to be adversely affected by the system of awarded grades so we are in a better position to make nuanced decisions when we get the results.” In a significant sign that it recognised the controversy likely to erupt on Thursday when students receive A-level results, Ofqual this week changed its position and said schools would be able to appeal if they expected “a very different pattern of grades to results in previous years”. But Ofqual will not allow individual students to appeal against their grades on academic grounds, as they can in Scotland. For A-level pupils, teacher assessments will only be used to help set grades on small courses, with five or fewer candidates. On larger courses, teacher assessment will play little or no role, with grades being awarded instead based on a school’s recent exam history and each pupil’s previous exam results. The pupils most likely to benefit from teacher assessments will be those taking courses with very small entries of five pupils or less, such as German or music. Those taking popular subjects such as maths or biology, with more than 15 pupils, will be exposed to Ofqual’s algorithm and the teacher assessment will be ignored. Kate Green, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “The government should have ensured that Ofqual had a robust appeals system in place from the beginning, instead of announcing one a matter of days before A-level results. They must do far more to ensure the system is genuinely fair.” Students unhappy with their results have the option of sitting exams in autumn. But with students entering university or college, few are expected to do so.",education
"The government cancelled GCSE and A-level exams in England in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland did the same with their exams. Grades in England will be “standardised”, taking into account teachers’ assessments and class rankings, a student’s prior attainment (GCSE results for those taking A-levels, and Sats for those taking GCSEs), and their school’s performance in recent years. The influence of teacher assessments will vary depending on the numbers taking a school’s courses: a course with five or fewer candidates will use the assessments in deciding grades, but larger courses with more than 15 candidates will ignore assessments and rely on prior attainment and a school’s previous results. Teachers will still have a major say by creating the class rankings that will distribute grades. A pupil put at the top of the ranking will receive the highest grade allotted to that school by Ofqual. Because “standardisation” seems to largely mean “adjusted downwards by an algorithm” compared with teacher assessments submitted earlier in the summer. Analysis of the statements and data published so far by Ofqual, the exams regulator in England, suggests 39% of grades will be downgraded. Ofqual says its system is designed to ensure this year’s results are in line with those of previous years. But last week’s exam results day in Scotland was described as a “shambles” after close to 125,000 predicted grades – a quarter of the total – were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Only about 9,000 went up during the process. Now all eyes are on England because the statistical model being used to predict English exam results shares basic principles with the Scottish one. Education experts in England warn that students in rapidly improving schools – likely to be in the most disadvantaged areas – may be penalised for previous poor results.  Jon Coles, the head of the biggest academy trust in England and a former official at the Department for Education, has said Ofqual’s data shows the previous years’ results cannot accurately predict this year’s for most schools. That will be particularly true for rapidly improving schools. MPs have said they are especially worried about black, Asian and minority ethnic pupils, and those with special educational needs. Yes. They can argue on a number of grounds, including if the school has been through a major change of leadership that has turned around its teaching record. Schools can also challenge results if they were expecting “exceptional” results compared with previous years, or if past results were distorted by a “monumental event” such as a flood or fire, or the school has undergone substantial demographic change, such as from being a single-sex school to a mixed one. Not on academic grounds. They can appeal through their school or college, but only on the grounds that the process was not followed correctly. If they suspect their grade was influenced by bias or discrimination, they can appeal against malpractice through their school or exam centre. Yes. They can sit A-level exams in October or GCSE exams in November. But the offer is unpopular with headteachers, who fear that revising for GCSE “retakes” will cut into teaching time for pupils in the first year of their A-level course. Ofqual revealed that predicted grades submitted by schools and colleges were about 12 percentage points higher than last year’s outcomes at A-level, and nine percentage points higher at GCSE – with peaks at key grades such as 4 at GCSE, which is a pass, and B at A-level, which can be required for university entrance. “Improvement on such a scale in a single year has never occurred, and to allow it would significantly undermine the value of these grades for students,” the regulator said.",education

"Ministers plan to drop restrictions on classroom “bubbles” to let all pupils attend school full-time in England from September, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said lifting the 15-pupil cap and expanding the size of protective bubbles would enable whole classes of 30 to be taught together, overcoming the lack of space that has resulted in schools having to rotate year groups. “We’ve been creating bubbles of children in the classroom, creating a protective environment for those children. Currently that is at 15 – what we would be looking at doing is expanding those bubbles to include the whole class,” Williamson told the Downing Street coronavirus press briefing on Friday. He said further guidance on safety would be issued in the next two weeks. The UK coronavirus alert level was lowered from 4 to 3 on Friday, meaning transmission is no longer judged to be “high or exponentially rising”. Williamson’s comments echoed earlier remarks by Boris Johnson, who said “watch this space” when asked about the physical distancing requirement for schools being cut from 2 metres to 1 metre, “if the science allows”. “I want every child, every pupil, every student, back in September. I’m sure it can be done,” the prime minister said during a visit to a school in Hertfordshire to publicise the government’s £1bn catch-up plan for schools in England announced on Friday. The plan was quickly criticised for ignoring the needs of 1 million young people aged 16-18, and for being an inadequate response to “the biggest challenge facing schools” in generations. Under the plan, state schools in England would be given £650m to fund efforts to help pupils affected by the coronavirus lockdown, under which nurseries, schools and colleges have been closed to most children since mid-March. While schools have made major efforts to provide remote learning, there are fears that pupils lacking parental support or internet access are in danger of falling behind their peers. But the extra funding is only to be applied to pupils aged between five and 16, provoking complaints from the heads of sixth form and further education colleges. Some of their students will have only seven months in the classroom until they sit exams next spring. David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the funding proposals would fail to cover two-thirds of young people aged 16-18. “It is indefensible to overlook the needs of the 700,000 in colleges,” he said. “I expect their exclusion from this announcement to be followed rapidly by clarification on the funding and support for college students. We are in contact with the Department for Education and hope to have this rectified as soon as possible.” Matthew O’Leary, a professor of education at Birmingham City University, said: “Yet again, the government has ignored the needs of students in further education colleges. Despite having previously promised to make funds available to support 16-19 provision, further education has once again been left out, reinforcing how the sector seems to be invisible to this government.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimated that the £650m amounted to £80 per pupil, a 1% increase on current spending that still leaves spending per pupil 3% lower than in 2010. Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS, said that due to the exclusion of nursery and sixth-form pupils, the amount would rise to £88 per head. The IFS said: “The loss of learning and the likely widening of educational inequalities since lockdown is the biggest challenge facing schools in generations. The £650m to be provided direct to schools this year … is modest relative to the scale of this challenge.” The £1bn package will include a £350m subsidy for a national tutoring programme, to be established by a partnership including the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF). The funds are to provide 75% of the cost of providing one-to-one or small-group tuition, which the EEF recommends as the most effective form of remedial teaching. Several headteachers who spoke to the Guardian expressed scepticism that such a programme could be up and running by the start of the next school year, in September, with its scope potentially including 1 million pupils receiving free school meals. The EEF’s guidance states that a well-structured tutoring programme would cost around £700 per pupil for 12 weeks, and include 30-minute sessions five times a week. But it also states that “the evidence suggests that impacts are generally higher when delivered by teachers”. The EEF is piloting a national tutoring programme involving four external agencies, including two that pay tutors and two that use unpaid volunteers. A volunteer who signed up to one of the agencies involved said she was dismayed to discover her unpaid work to help disadvantaged children would be used by the government to claim it was funding efforts to repair the education lost during the lockdown. She said she had no teaching experience and would only receive two hours of training before tutoring children, although the agency had given her a disclosure and barring service (DBS) criminal records check. The main requirement for volunteer tutors was that they have a degree and an A-level in the subject they were to teach, and a minimum commitment of one hour a week. “It seems like the government is trying to give the impression that they are budgeting for professional teachers, and that feels like a trick,” she said. Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said the government was working with experts on how best to support under-fives and those aged 16-18, and “we’ll have more to say on that soon”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of Schools and College Leaders, said: “It is very important that this guidance is supplied to schools and colleges as soon as possible. They are doing their best to put in place plans for September but they have so far had to do this in the dark without any input from the government.”",education
"A national fight to restore the balance between rival academic disciplines and give back lost weight to subjects such as history, foreign languages, geography and English literature, is to start this week with the unveiling of Shape, a “re-branding” drive to promote the humanities and social sciences. The plan, shared with the Observer, is to emulate the success of the educational term Stem – which stands for science, technology, engineering and maths – in emphasising the importance of the core subjects it represents. By contrast, Shape, or social sciences, humanities & the arts for people & the economy, is designed to encourage schoolchildren and undergraduates to view these subjects as positive steps towards a high-status career. The campaigners also aim to ensure that grant applications for research funding will be given equal priority. They argue that at the moment those subjects that enable pupils and students to develop verbal reasoning, alongside an understanding of society, the environment and culture, are dangerously undervalued. “This is about levelling up the agenda. It is a way of establishing equality,” said one of the architects of the plan, Julia Black, professor of law at the London School of Economics (LSE) and fellow of the British Academy which, alongside the LSE and Arts Council England (ACE), are backing the campaign. “We are not setting up Shape in opposition to Stem, and in fact many scientists and engineers would agree it is wrong to deny that the sort of articulacy and reasoning skills developed by studying history, or theatre, or by learning a foreign language, have the same value as a scientific or mathematical training. But the humanities can sometimes be dismissed as ‘soft subjects’ and not given the same credit, which matters when it comes to basic education and to funding research. They can be a bit of a blind spot and that is damaging.” The gulf between the stereotypes of “rigorous scientific thinking” and the more expressive and empathetic abilities that characterise the humanities has been controversial since CP Snow’s influential lecture on “the two cultures” at Cambridge University in 1959. As a result the letter “A”, for the arts, has sometimes been added to Stem to make Steam, but this is not enough for those behind the new promotional push. Writing in the Observer online, Sir Peter Bazalgette, a former chairman of ACE, criticised “a growing trend in government to judge the success of a course by the salaries earned on graduation. On this measure many of the courses our creative industries rely on would be discontinued. Many of these jobs at trainee level are undertaken for love, not money.” Bazalgette, now chair of ITV, added that this lower-paid work goes on to feed Britain’s large creative economy. When Stem and Shape come together in good governments and commercial ventures, he wrote, “we find a healthy symbiosis that would astonish Snow”. The term Stem has been widely used in Britain from 2001 as a tool to promote national competitiveness in these areas and to encourage schools and colleges to prioritise these subjects. Black said that while the significance of education should not be reduced to a consideration of its impact on the economy, it will be crucial for the future of Britain to begin to value those subjects where human behaviour takes centre stage, as well as those in which numbers and scientific properties are studied. “I see it as broadening the score card. We know that if we are going to build a better country, or develop a former industrial region, you can’t do that just by building science parks,” she said. The new acronym Shape, Black added, will now allow those disciplines it represents to cluster together to gain greater public status and to challenge a harmful academic narrative.",education
"The parents of a student with severe social anxiety who took her own life on the day she was scheduled to face “the ordeal” of an important oral test have launched legal proceedings against her university, claiming she was the victim of negligence and disability discrimination. Natasha Abrahart, a student at University of Bristol, was found dead at the age of 20 in her flat after she failed to attend a “laboratory conference” involving a presentation to almost 50 fellow students and staff in a 329-seat lecture theatre. Her parents, Robert and Margaret Abrahart, have filed a county court claim alleging the university fell short in its duty to “to take reasonable care” of their daughter’s “wellbeing, health and safety”. They argue the university did not do enough to support Abrahart when staff had known for six months that she suffered from panic attacks and was struggling. Robert Abrahart, from Nottingham, told the Guardian: “Natasha was bright and academically able. Her self-esteem was rooted in her academic ability and achievement. However, because of the discrimination that we believe she suffered, Natasha became acutely and increasingly distressed. The fear of failing, not performing, or not progressing on the course affected her deeply and she became pre-occupied by feelings of worthlessness. “We believe that the university should have done more to support Natasha throughout her second year. The pain of losing Natasha is something that will never leave us.” In the claim, Abrahart’s parents say she had three suicidal episodes before she died and feared losing her place on the course if she could not complete the laboratory conference. Abrahart’s parents believe the university is in denial over their daughter’s death and taking legal action is the only way they can get to the truth of what happened. She is one of 11 Bristol university students who have taken their own lives in the last four years. Abrahart added: “We know nothing will bring her back but we feel the University of Bristol should at least acknowledge what happened in the lead-up to Natasha’s death, show some remorse or regret, and apologise. Until that happens how will the university prevent the same mistakes that we believe occurred from happening again? We will continue to campaign to ensure that other students don’t endure the suffering Natasha did.” Their claim is for disability discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 and negligence. The family’s lawyer, Gus Silverman, of Irwin Mitchell, said: “The university owed Natasha legal duties not to cause her psychological harm and to ensure its assessment regime didn’t discriminate against her as a disabled student. Natasha’s parents are firmly of the view that the university didn’t meet these legal duties. “Natasha’s parents have had to turn to the civil courts to seek justice for their daughter. They are determined to try to improve the standard of care provided to vulnerable students around the country.” A university spokesperson said Abrahart’s death in April 2018 “deeply affected” everyone but particularly her family and friends, as well as the staff and students who knew her best. The spokesperson said: “Legal proceedings regarding Natasha’s death are now under way, and so it would be inappropriate for the university to comment further at the present time. “We recognise mental health as one of the biggest public health issues, which is why we have adopted an institute-wide approach to foster an inclusive and safe environment for all students and staff. We are also committed to reducing the stigma around mental health and creating space for it to permeate through every aspect of the university’s culture and experience.” The university argues that staff repeatedly tried to help Abrahart and measures were in place to help her to continue on her course. It points out that at the conclusion of the student’s inquest last year the coroner did not criticise the university but flagged up concerns over the role of the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust (AWP), whose care she was under, for not putting in place a management plan that would have given her hope and managed her risk. In the county court claim, Abrahart’s parents say the coroner ruled the adequacy of support provided by the university to be outside the scope of the hearing.",education
"School leavers may feel that, with A-level exams cancelled, they have lost control over their future. But experts say they have never had more power to talk their way into their first-choice university, even if they miss their grades. As sixth-formers nervously await next month’s teacher-assessed results from the exams regulator, Ofqual, research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that in the aftermath of coronavirus, the UK higher education sector is facing losses of between £3bn and £19bn in the new academic year, depending on how many students enrol. Many universities expect to lose 50-100% of their lucrative international student intake, a blow that will hit the most selective institutions hardest. While they have agreed to a government cap on student numbers to maintain stability, it was set with enough room for successful universities to increase UK student numbers to make up some of the shortfall. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “The way they are grading A-levels this year gives [young people] much more room to negotiate. You can easily ring and make a case for being let in based on your grades being wrong.” He says that if universities have lots of empty seats this year they will be “in compulsory redundancy territory”. Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford University, agrees school leavers have “an unusual level of power this time”. In ordinary years universities, particularly the elite ones, have been wary of letting in too many applicants with lower grades for fear it could affect their position in the all-important league tables. Marginson predicts this year could be different. “No one loses competitive position if everyone shifts the same way at the same time, as seems likely. The name of the game is organisational survival and everyone knows that.” However, many academics are concerned that more disadvantaged candidates might be less likely to negotiate offers and hunt down good places in clearing. Barnaby Lenon, former head of Harrow public school and chair of the Independent Schools Council, has urged university admission authorities to look beyond “dodgy” A-level grades, which “could be wrong”, when deciding who to admit. Everyone has heard tales of middle-class parents picking up the phone to Oxford or Cambridge to argue for their child’s place. Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, says: “Never underestimate the adeptness of the sharp-elbowed middle classes at exploiting opportunities. And no opportunity is more prized than a place at a prestigious university.” Elliot Major worries that next month’s frantic last-minute market for places may further skew the playing field against poorer young people. “There is a genuine fear that many disadvantaged pupils who would have excelled in their A-levels this year will be penalised with lower scores by the system of calculated grades, which estimates grades on the basis of historical averages of schools,” he says. Some believe Ucas, the admissions service, is not helping. Mark Corver, former director of analysis and research at Ucas and now founder of dataHE consultancy, has warned the government there is not enough detailed data publicly available to allow students and teachers to prove if the Ofqual grading process has gone wrong for them. “We’ve asked Ucas repeatedly to release some simple tables showing the typical exam grades that applicants with different predicted grades get in a normal year. They have steadfastly refused,” he says. “We’ve found them reluctant and obstructive. Given they are a charity and not a commercial organisation, it’s very disappointing.” However, Richard O’Kelly, head of analytical data at Ucas, denies the organisation is being obstructive. He says it cannot publish the data set, which breaks down results by factors including gender, ethnicity and social background, because it creates an “unacceptable risk” of individual applicants being identifiable. He adds: “We have published more data during this year than ever before to promote confidence amongst students and universities.” Sophie Hatton, an 18-year-old school leaver from Birmingham, says she is feeling “increasingly anxious” waiting for her A-level grades. “At first I thought it was great having all my exams cancelled. Then it hit me how terrifying it is that two years of work could account for nothing as I have no full way of showing my potential.” Hatton is hoping to study sociology at Nottingham Trent University, but she says that if she doesn’t get the grades she needs she will get on the phone and try to negotiate, “to prove I am a determined, hard-working student”. Kate Spalding, another 18-year-old waiting for her results, in Southampton, says she was upset for days after hearing she could not sit her exams: “I felt all my work had gone to waste.” Now, she says, she has decided to trust her teachers and is feeling more confident. She is planning a gap year, but if she does not get the grades she needs to study drama at Manchester or Leeds, she intends to retake her A-levels later in the year. Despite the government’s cap on student numbers this year, with financial penalties for those that exceed it, many selective institutions are planning for expansion, within the boundary of an extra 5% on last year’s enrolment forecasts. Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, a member of the Russell Group, says his university is anticipating a 2% growth in UK student numbers this year. “Given the way the cap has been set, it is conceivable that quite a few selective universities will take marginally more students than last year, and altogether that could be quite a lot,” he says. Yet Riordan admits that for institutions such as his, international students and not UK ones make the real financial difference – and their numbers will be unclear until October or November. “Really we won’t know how many international students we will get until they actually turn up – or don’t,” he says. Vice-chancellors say the way A-levels are being calculated this year is making them nervous. Another Russell Group head, who asked not to be named, says: “We have thousands of students who have put us as first choice and accepted our offer. Usually we can be pretty accurate on what percentage will achieve the grades. But this year if there is even 10% inflation on that, that’s a big difference.” The government has confirmed, in new guidance issued earlier this month, that it will not penalise universities for going over their cap because a larger number of students than expected meet their offer grades. But the vice-chancellor says that, in a Covid-19 world, a big increase would put pressure on facilities. “There are two nightmares: one where no one turns up, and one where everyone turns up while we are trying to do social distancing,” he says. If prestigious institutions expand, they could suck up some students who might have chosen mid-ranking universities, leaving some of those institutions without enough undergraduates – and their £9,250 a year fees. Marginson says this would leave universities at the bottom of the sector “facing very difficult times”. Dean Machin, head of policy at the University of Portsmouth, agrees. “We have potentially got the worst of both worlds. For sector stability we enabled government to control the number of people who go to university – and unfortunately it is unlikely to provide all universities the protection they were seeking.” The Office for Students regulator is consulting on new powers to intervene faster to protect students in case any universities or colleges are at risk of closure.",education
"A university is offering a financial sweetener to persuade students to defer their studies, as it emerged that 15,000 applicants who lost out on their first-choice places due to downgraded A-levels now have the results to meet their original offer.  Amid growing fears about the impact of deferrals on the 2021 university intake, Durham University is offering bursaries to make the prospect of waiting a year more palatable. It has promised to honour all offers that are successfully met but says some students “will have to defer entry” because of capacity issues. An email to students said those who deferred would be guaranteed college accommodation – which is always in high demand – “and will be provided with a bursary by Durham University to help with their transition to university life”. Durham was unable to say how much a bursary would be worth. Meanwhile, a thinktank condemned the exams fiasco as “entirely avoidable” and warned it would affect universities for years to come, with top tier institutions awash with students at the expense of those lower down the rankings who could face “financially crippling” losses. Figures published by the university admissions service Ucas show 15,000 students who were originally rejected by their firm choice university based on their moderated grades now meet the required A-level conditions of their offer with their teacher-assessed grades. Nine out of 10 of these cases related to higher tariff universities, piling pressure on admissions at top institutions. A further 100,000 students who had their results upgraded have already been placed at their first choice university, Ucas said. Amid concerns about the disproportionate impact of the exams fiasco on disadvantaged pupils, Ucas said 7% of the 15,000 who now meet the requirements for their course are from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Russell Group of 24 leading universities, meanwhile, called for additional government support and funding, warning of an unprecedented rise in numbers and possible deferrals.  Staff at one leading university said they were overwhelmed with students – the psychology department had an original target of 190 students, but up to 230 additional students could now be eligible following the government U-turn on A-levels. The government is to provide extra funding for more places in medical schools to allow more students to train as doctors, and help absorb some of the extra applications from those who now had higher grades. Because of the high competition for places medical schools demand high grades, and offer places on the assumption that a many applicants will fail to achieve them. Ministers are said to be authorising the release of funds and dropping limits on the number of medical school places. The Medical Schools Council said it was “delighted” but was still awaiting details and warned some students may still not get a place this year. Katie Petty-Saphon, the council’s chief executive, told the Financial Times – which first reported the news – that her members would “do everything possible to facilitate the increased number of students now eligible to study medicine, but until the precise numbers are known it is impossible to say how many will have to defer.”  It came as the Institute for Fiscal Studies branded the government’s handling of the crisis “a clear fail”. In a briefing note, the IFS said the government’s U-turn on Monday – scrapping A-level and GCSE results in England, which were moderated by an algorithm, and replacing them with teachers’ recommended grades, known as centre-assessed grades – was “entirely avoidable” and had left universities across the sector “in the lurch”. As a result, this year’s A-level cohort has better grades than its predecessors. Thousands of students who are now qualified to study at some of the country’s top universities are being told they will have to defer as there are not enough places to go around and insufficient space on campuses. The IFS warned that while the top universities would struggle to accommodate so many additional students – possibly resulting in more online teaching than anticipated – those lower down the rankings risked losing a substantial share of their intake, which could be “financially crippling”. “These problems were entirely avoidable,” the IFS said. “A-level results should never have been released before being subject to scrutiny beyond Ofqual. The government should not have had to rely on shocked 18-year-olds on results day to realise there was a problem. “Allocating A-level grades to students who did not sit exams was never going to be easy. But the government’s solution is a clear fail. This will have repercussions for universities and students, now and in the coming years.”",education
"Universities, unions and professional bodies are all asking the government for clarity and help following the U-turns on exam grade awards to school-leavers across the UK.  Universities UK, the sector’s representative body, has written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to request “significant financial support from government to stabilise their finances”. In the letter, the organisation said the decision to use centre-assessed grades (a teacher’s professional judgment of the most likely grade their student would have achieved had exams gone ahead) would “result in significant overall grade inflation”. This, they said, would lead to an imbalance in the higher education intake this year, with some institutions having much bigger intakes than planned. The result would be increased costs, especially given social distancing measures  on campus for in-person teaching. Just as importantly, they said, some universities would now have lower student numbers than they had budgeted for, because more of their potential attendees would this year qualify for higher-ranking institutions. Earlier this year the UK government set a cap on the number of university students in England, in an attempt to mitigate the financial impact of fewer international students – whose tuition fees subsidise places for domestic attendees – as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The cap was partially dropped on Monday. The Scottish government has already said it would meet “in full” the costs of providing additional places above the Scottish student cap of about 108,000 each year. Universities have warned that students who, following the U-turn on centre-assessed grades, now have higher grades and have met their entry requirements, may be forced to defer entry, as there is no capacity for them. Courses such as medicine and dentistry are particularly affected, owing to the laboratory and equipment requirements of the courses. The Royal College of GPs estimates the UK needs 20% more undergraduate medical places to serve the growing population, and wants caps on student numbers lifted, as well as extra funding for universities to help meet demand. Universities UK has also called for “increasing flexibilities within the medical student numbers cap”. They will also, more broadly, be seeking clarification from the government on student numbers and funding for the next academic year, when the 2021 A-level cohort may find there are fewer university places available than usual because of the knock-on effect of more 2020 students deferring.  Higher education has long been seen as an engine of social mobility in the UK, and it is poorer and more disadvantaged groups who have suffered twice-over during this crisis, first by being awarded downgraded exam results, then again by potentially missing out on oversubscribed courses that they now have the grades for. The University and College Union (UCU) and National Union of Students (NUS) have written to Williamson to warn that lifting the student cap, flooding some courses with more students, “will likely lead to expanded recruitment at high-tariff institutions at the expense of lower-tariff universities, shifting the financial pain from the Covid crisis on to many of the institutions that play a vital role in widening participation and social mobility”. While the government plans for schools and universities to be open throughout the next academic year, universities will want reassurance that if there is a return to a national lockdown, or a large number of local lockdowns that disrupt the exam season next year, the fiasco won’t be repeated. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), has written to the education secretary demanding a review to rebuild trust because “public confidence has been badly shaken”. “It seems to be clear that the statistical model for moderating centre-assessed grades was flawed and that it produced many anomalous results. But how did this happen, why were the problems not foreseen, and why were ministers not on top of this? Most importantly, what lessons can we learn for the future?” he asked.

"Students in England hoping to appeal their A-level and GCSE exam results based on their mock grades will need to meet a set of eight criteria to be considered “valid”, the exams regulator Ofqual has revealed. Ofqual on Saturday confirmed that a route of appeal will be offered to students whose mock grade was higher than their calculated one, with exam boards ready to process applications from Monday. Students who were unable to take a written mock exam before schools and colleges closed on 20 March will also be able to appeal on the basis of non-exam assessment marks, the regulator added. It comes after thousands of A-level students received lower grades than expected on Thursday, after 39% of results were downgraded by Ofqual’s algorithm. Among the criteria for what constitutes a valid mock grade are the conditions of the assessment, including whether there was appropriate invigilation and no possibility of corrections and revisions. It also specifies mock exams must have ensured “substantial coverage of the content normally assessed” and have been taken under timed conditions which align with those in normal assessment. Schools, colleges and other learning centres will need to complete and send a form to the exam board to confirm the criteria has been met, as well as providing a mock exam grade and signed form. Patrick Sturgis, a professor of quantitive sociology at the London School of Economics, highlighted that the criteria outlined by Ofqual appears to “overrule” the triple lock promised by the education secretary on Wednesday. In a statement, Williamson had promised that students would be able to accept their teacher-predicted “centre assessment grade” (CAG), appeal to receive a valid mock result or sit autumn exams. But Ofqual’s announcement says that “in circumstances where the [CAG] was lower than the mock grade, the student will receive the [CAG].” This suggests students who scored higher in mock exams than in teacher-predicted CAGs will not be able to use this route of appeal. Meanwhile, Qualifications Wales has announced that it will also accept appeals “on the grounds that there is evidence of internal assessment that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the calculated grade awarded”. The body said that these internal assessments will also need to meet specific criteria, “which are being finalised and will be published shortly”. It added: “If the appeal is successful, the learner’s grade will be revised to be the same as their internal assessment grade, but no higher than the centre assessment grade submitted by the centre.” It also promised that no students included in an appeal will be at risk of having their grades lowered as a result. “Grades will only go up or remain the same as part of the appeals process,” it added.",education
"An Oxford academic handed out a “meaningless” university qualification to a Hong Kong businessman with ties to the Chinese authorities at a high-profile ceremony in Shanghai last year, in the latest incident to raise concerns about Chinese influence on UK higher education. Alan Hudson awarded the title “Belt and Road Academician from Oxford University” to Chan King Wai, who is a member of an advisory body to China’s rubber-stamp parliament, at a ceremony attended by an official from the British consulate and dozens of other people. The belt and road initiative is a major foreign and economic policy project which has been at the heart of China’s increasingly assertive international presence under its president, Xi Jinping. Oxford University only gives a handful of honorary degrees at the Encaenia ceremony each year. Hudson, who has now retired from his position at Oxford, confirmed he had created the title given to Chan, and that it did not carry any official weight. “I looked up the meaning of ‘academician’ and it is absolutely meaningless, it means anybody involved with the university, of any description. So I said there you go, we can put that on the certificate. In recognition of his contributions to the programme. “The incentive for this was a potential donation to the university or the department, and for a number of programmes.” Hudson said. He added that he did not plan the lavish ceremony that was captured on camera, and was surprised it was such a big event. Hudson has deep ties with China and Shanghai in particular. He was awarded the Magnolia Gold Award for contributions to the city in 2013, and at the same time was made a visiting professor of the Chinese Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong, a Communist party school focused on “international exchange and cooperation”. At Oxford, in his role as director of programmes in leadership and public policy, Hudson organised short courses, usually a couple of weeks, for officials from countries including China, where the university’s brand is widely recognised. Participants received a certificate of attendance, rather than an academic qualification; one of the attendees had suggested giving an honour to Chan, although Hudson said the businessman had not attended a course in Oxford. The university’s regional office for Hong Kong knew about the honour and hoped to use his contacts for fundraising, Hudson added: “I was contacted by the Hong Kong development office [of Oxford University] who wanted to approach Chan King Wai ... from the point of view of a substantial donation to the university.”  Neither Oxford University nor the Oxford Chinese studies department responded to requests for comment about the award, or whether Chan had made a donation. Hudson, who retired last year, said discussions about a donation had continued but he did not believe one had been made yet. Chan was born in mainland China before moving to Hong Kong in 1979 where he built his fortune. He now presides over a conglomerate with interests in areas from real estate to insurance. He has extensive ties to institutions on the mainland. In addition to his role advising the National People’s Congress, Chan is also vice-chairman of a commerce industry body with ties to the Chinese Communist party, sits on the council of several Chinese universities and holds a string of other official posts. Neil O’Brien, MP for Harborough and a founding member of the China Research Group, which brings together Conservative politicians who are critical of Beijing, said British universities needed to be more careful about fundraising in China. “Universities need to fundraise but the fear is that if academics are prepared to hand out fake academic qualifications to chase money what worse are they prepared to do? There have been a number of concerning cases of UK universities being easily politically influenced for a bit of cash,” O’Brien said. “I’d welcome a deep look by the Department of Education at where corporate and individual donations are from, and what political impact that is having,” he added. The award to Chan King Wai was also condemned by Benedict Rogers, co-founder and chairn of the campaign group Hong Kong Watch. “This sorry episode is yet another example of the growing influence the Chinese Communist party has in our leading academic institutions, which remains largely uncontested and free from scrutiny,” he said. Last month students at Jesus College, Cambridge, called for it to cut ties with China, after the Times revealed that it had accepted £200,000 from a Chinese government agency and £155,000 from the telecommunications giant Huawei. In a letter, the student union accused the college of failing to be “fully financially transparent”, warning that it “would always have been at risk from the CCP’s [Chinese Communist party’s] soft power information and influence campaigns”. Another Cambridge college, Wolfson, has also come under fire over the honorary fellowship it granted to Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam in 2017. She has presided over a crackdown on free speech and political opposition in the city, and this month was put on a US sanctions list for her role in suppressing dissent. The college’s governing body had said it was reconsidering the award, even before the sanctions were announced. There is also growing concern in the US about the Chinese government’s influence on its educational institutions, as relations between the two countries deteriorate. This week the US State Department designated “Confucius Institutes”, government sponsored centres which host Chinese culture and language teachers, as foreign missions, saying they were part of “Beijing’s multifaceted propaganda efforts”.",education
"Schools in England will be able to appeal against A-level and GCSE grades free of charge, in a climbdown by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. He said it would be a “shocking injustice” if cost stopped appeals being made on behalf of pupils with a “strong and legitimate” case. Pressure has been mounting on the education secretary to resign after thousands of students were given lower grades than expected on Thursday and rejected from their first-choice universities. About 39% of A-level results were downgraded by the exam regulator Ofqual’s algorithm, with disadvantaged pupils worst affected. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had called for appeals to be made free more than 24 hours previously. She said: “But once again, this government have been far too slow to act and have failed young people.” Green urged Williamson to follow the example of the Scottish government, by replacing the results with teacher assessments “to ensure they can get the results they deserve”. Appeals against grades vary between exam boards, with charges of up to £150 for an independent review, and costs are refunded if the appeal is upheld. Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, is understood to be setting up a taskforce to ensure that appeals over A-level grades will be heard by 7 September, before the start of the university year. The taskforce will include members of Ofqual and the examination boards, as well as the DfE. There were 3,205 appeals against grades granted for GCSEs, AS and A-levels for exams sat in summer 2019, equivalent to 0.05% of all entries, and 16% – of 516 grades – were changed, according to figures from Ofqual. Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project, which is threatening legal action against Williamson and Ofqual, has said that the appeals process was “pretty much pointless”. This, he says, is because the system set out by Ofqual is “so narrowly drawn that, the correction of administrative errors aside, it is perfectly possible that it won’t change one single grade”. “You can’t challenge your school/college on the grades or rank order it submitted,” he tweeted. “The system does allow for appeals in respect of administrative errors – similarly named students, using the wrong data sets for similarly named schools, and so on.” He added: “Beyond that you are in a world where you have to show exceptional circumstances.” Those pleading exceptional circumstances would need to show why a school or college’s previous year groups are not representative of the 2020 cohort. Ofqual’s “not necessarily” exhaustive list of examples of exceptional circumstances includes where single-sex schools have become mixed and where there is evidence a change in leadership at a school or college led to improved exam results. Nina Bunting-Mitcham, an A-level student from Peterborough who missed out on her offer from the Royal Veterinary College, attacked the schools minister for “ruining my life” during BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions? She told Gibb she was distraught after being predicted to achieve ABB, and scoring As and Bs in her mock exams, but was handed three D grades. The New College Stamford student said: “I have no idea how this has happened. It’s got to be a mistake, I have never been a D-grade student. “I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life. I would like to know how this has happened.” She said she was going to appeal and that she felt cheated. Bunting-Mitcham said: “I feel like there has been a huge error.” Asked if any of her peers were in the same situation, Bunting-Mitcham said that it seemed to only be her at the college to whom this had happened. Gibb said it was “rare” for students to be downgraded three grades from their predicted grades and added that 60% of grades awarded had been what the teachers predicted. “You have ruined my life,” the student said, in an extraordinary moment of live broadcasting. However, Gibb pledged: “It won’t ruin your life. It will be sorted, I can assure you.” He continued: “The trouble with these models, when you standardise grades across the country, there will be imperfections in it. That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals systems that the schools will trigger for students like Nina.” He promised a “robust” and “swift” appeal system, telling her: “The universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now to make sure those appeals happen very quickly.” Oxford and Cambridge became the first universities to reject the government’s call to hold open places for A-level student appealing against their grades, the Times reported. Students holding offers to attend most Oxbridge colleges will have to instead defer a year if their college has filled up. However Worcester College has said it will honour all offers “irrespective of their A-level results”. “It’s the morally right thing to do,” the college’s admissions tutor, Laura Ashe, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.",education
"Two million GCSE grades recommended by teachers are to be downgraded next week, with disadvantaged pupils even worse hit than those affected by the A-levels debacle, according to analysis from leading researchers. Thousands of headteachers have called for urgent action to avoid “serious injustices” that could blight the life chances of their pupils, after exams were cancelled because of coronavirus and the results consequently being decided by an algorithm that has been condemned as unfair. Experts at the FFT Education Datalab research unit told the Guardian they expected the proportion of grades assessed by teachers likely to be forced down by Ofqual’s statistical mechanism to be 35-40%. As revealed by the Guardian last week, 39% of teacher-assessed A-levels were downgraded on Thursday. Amid the outcry, the Department for Education has said it will pay any appeal fees so English schools are not left out of pocket. Exam boards charge schools to challenge grades, sometimes over £100 in complex cases. These fees are usually refunded if an appeal is successful. Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, is also understood to be setting up a taskforce to ensure that appeals over A-level grades will be heard by 7 September, before the start of the university year. The taskforce will include members of Ofqual and the examination boards, as well as the DfE. The Datalab warned that teachers’ assessments for disadvantaged students’ GCSEs were likely to be the most over-optimistic, so schools and regions with higher proportions will see the biggest negative impact of Ofqual’s moderation. A greater slice of those taking GCSEs are from disadvantaged backgrounds when compared to A-levels. It comes amid a row between Ofqual, the exam regulator, and the Royal Statistical Society, after it claimed to have offered independent external advisers to help oversee the algorithm – but was told this would only be accepted if it signed a non-disclosure agreement. Despite being higher overall than last year, Thursday’s A-level results left students and teachers in shock at a slew of unexpectedly poor grades issued by Ofqual. Students reported being downgraded from an A to an E and a C to a U. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he was considering legal action against Ofqual. A repeat of tearful scenes would increase pressure on the education secretary, Gavin Williams, who faced a call to resign from the Liberal Democrats and angry rumblings from Conservative backbenchers over his handling of the controversy. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, proposed that the government in England should follow Scotland by reinstating the grades recommended by teachers before they were moderated down by an algorithm designed to control grade inflation. GCSEs are taken by around 700,000 schoolchildren in England, who in a normal year would sit 5m individual exams. This year Williamson ordered exams to be cancelled after schools closed in March due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Ofqual’s model uses the recent historical performance of a school and the academic track record of each pupil to distribute the grades set by its national formula. Teachers were asked to assess and rank their pupils and submit the results to Ofqual, but the assessments are often overruled. Philip Nye, a researcher at the Datalab, said: “We found that schools that were lower-attaining and with more disadvantaged intakes were submitting higher grades, so we think that GCSE results will see more disadvantaged pupils have their results lowered through the moderation process. “There are more disadvantaged pupils taking GCSEs than there are at A-levels, so potentially downgrades could be more widespread.” Jon Coles, chief executive of the United Learning schools group and a former senior official at the DfE, said Ofqual’s analysis suggested results in the two biggest GCSE subjects, English and maths, were likely to be more accurate. But most other GCSE courses would see more erratic results. Coles said next week could see more turbulent results because of the wider spread of abilities and weaker data available. For disadvantaged pupils the biggest danger point was getting a 4 or above in England and maths, which the DfE counts as a pass. “For comprehensives schools that’s the key measure of success, especially for disadvantaged pupils,” he said. Thousands of headteachers have backed a plea by the Worth Less? campaign group of school leaders for Williamson to explain how he intends to avoid a repeat of “serious injustices”. “We fear that such injustices will occur on a massive scale when GCSE grades are published next week. That’s why thousands of responsible headteachers are demanding that the secretary of state make an urgent public statement explaining to pupils and their families how and why the standardisation process has failed so many and confirming exactly what the DfE will do to put things right and avoid a ‘GCSE debacle’ next week,” the group said. “Through no fault of their own, pupils have suffered enough disruption to their school lives. They have the unassailable right to successfully and fairly proceed with their future plans for university, A-level, vocational and other vital future educational courses. This is currently in serious doubt unless decisive new action is taken.” Simon Burgess, a professor of economics at the University of Bristol who specialises in education and school attainment, said the major issue would be how many pupils are marked down at crucial grade boundaries, such as 4 and 5 in subjects like English and maths. “These matter most for lower ability students. The key thing for GCSEs is getting at least a 5 in English and maths – let’s hope we will not be looking at many students predicted to get that but denied. That would seriously worsen their chances in an already dreadful labour market,” Burgess said. Controversy continued to rage over A-level results on Friday, as more scrutiny was applied to Ofqual’s algorithm and how it appears to favour pupils in small classes taking less popular courses such as Latin, which are more common in private schools. The Royal Statistical Society repeated a call for the Office for Statistics Regulation to conduct a formal review of the statistical models adopted by Ofqual and other UK exam regulators, and revealed that Ofqual snubbed repeated offers of advice and help. The society said it offered its fellows to act as independent external advisers on Ofqual’s technical advisory group during the construction of its algorithm. “We eventually heard from Ofqual that they could consider these two fellows, but only with a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that gave us real concern,” the society said. “The proposed confidentiality agreement would, on our reading, have precluded these fellows … from commenting in any way on the final choice of the model for some years after this year’s results were released. “In the end, we did not get an official response to those questions, and our offer to help was not taken up.” Ofqual did not respond to a request for comment about the offer. The turbulent results and likely wave of appeals by disappointed students appears to have slowed down applications for university places. Ucas, the universities admissions body, said that the number of applicants going through clearing to find places was down by 24% compared with previous years. One reason, Ucas said, was that “students face a more complex set of choices around appeals”. Universities told the Guardian that their staff were having to spend longer with individual applicants. “For the University of Greenwich, this has meant that we have had to adapt and spend more time reassuring and supporting our prospective students than ever before,” said Chris Shelley, director of student and academic services at Greenwich. Tracey Lancaster, deputy vice-chancellor at Leeds Beckett University, said: “We’ve had a number of calls from students who are disappointed with their grades. We’ve also noticed fewer celebratory posts on social media this year – the general atmosphere has been more subdued.”",education
"In the small sports hall of Wales high school in Rotherham, confusion turned to frustration and anger as students and staff, many in tears, struggled to make sense of grades produced by an obscure computer model for exams that never took place. “In years to come we’re always going to be the year that didn’t count. The pandemic year,” said Anna Hogarth, 18, sitting despondent after trying for hours to get through to Nottingham University where she hopes to study chemistry and molecular physics. She needed an A in maths, and Bs in chemistry and in physics, which her teachers had assessed her as being able to achieve. The grades assigned to her by the exam regulator’s algorithm were ACD, a two-grade downgrade in physics, leaving her future uncertain. “I’m disappointed, confused. The idea that we’d just be given grades, I didn’t think it was real. I wanted to be able to prove myself. Something so simple for the government, that they will never think about again, will affect the rest of my life,” she said. Eighty-four per cent of Wales high school’s 130-plus A-level students had at least one grade moderated down by the regulator Ofqual. The comprehensive of nearly 1,200 pupils has a relatively large sixth form. It sits south-east of Rotherham, in one of Yorkshire’s less affluent boroughs. Pepe Di’lasio, the headteacher, said there was “an injustice and unfairness that is clinically cold” in the government’s “absolutely chaotic” handling of this year’s A-levels. His students had been disproportionately affected, he said, because of where the school is, its larger class sizes, and because its results last year were only average. A private school a stone’s throw away would be less affected by the algorithm’s grading, he said. “As someone who went into teaching to make a difference for young people and for those students from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is heart-wrenching. You feel like you’re fighting against a tide. It can’t be justified that our most disadvantaged are the ones hurt most by this algorithm.” On a table bearing tissues as well as Covid-compliant hand sanitiser and disinfectant, Abigail Camber, 18, was using two phones to try get through to Leeds and Manchester universities. She had been rejected from philosophy courses at both after receiving Bs in French and maths and a D in religious education, significantly below her teacher-assessed grades of ABB. “When they said in March that I couldn’t do my exams, I just burst out crying,” she said. “It’s been a really long wait, five months, to find out. This last week was very stressful. It’s just filled my head the whole week.” Kieran Street, 18, was predicted an AAB in economics, maths and physics, which would have met the requirement to study economics at Newcastle University. Instead he received an ACB. “The most frustrating thing is the fact it’s just been given to me – ‘you are an ACB student’ – but I haven’t had chance to prove myself,” he said, checking his phone for any messages from the university. “I feel puzzled, a bit cheated, obviously disappointed, but I’ve not given up yet. If it goes south, it’s going to change my whole path in the next few years.” Teachers said their assessed grades for students in smaller subjects such as theatre studies, music and computer science were mostly accepted or even upgraded. But in bigger subjects such as English, maths and sociology, students were more likely to have been marked down. That quirk of the algorithm was welcome news for James Clark, 17, who had been predicted an A*, two As and a B across history, theatre, an extended project qualification (EPQ) and film. Ofqual gave him three A*s and an A. “It’s ludicrous, I’m ecstatic,” he laughed. “I feel like I’m about to fall over.” Having turned down an offer from Oxford – “I looked at it and it wasn’t for me” – Clark will be starting an art history and curating degree at York University on 1 October. “One of the advantages for me was that we were small cohorts. Anything under 15 students is being biased more towards teachers’ evaluations. If I was in a class of over 30, I might not have got the grades that I got.” The school’s head of sixth-form, Charlotte Cooper, was trying to help students speak to their universities and access the Ucas website, which temporarily went offline. “It feels like they’ve had nothing but barriers to overcome in the last few months and this has compounded the situation that they’re in,” she said. “They’re just being treated as faceless students, not individuals. And you can’t even put your arms around them.”",education
"The blame game for England’s exams fiasco has been raging across Whitehall since the government’s U-turn on Monday. So who is responsible? And what grades should they be awarded for their efforts? The education secretary took the heat for schools’ failure to all reopen before the summer, but even amid those difficulties, Williamson should have seen this disaster coming weeks ago, warned by evidence to the education select committee in July. The list goes on about the pitfalls he should have spotted, including widening grounds for appeal and preparing universities for flexibility, but Williamson’s grade suffers most for his insistence there would be “no U-turn, no change” for a system that was clearly untenable. Gibb is a long-serving minister in the Department for Education (DfE), starting under David Cameron. Colleagues see him as diligent and committed to education, especially in his campaign on phonics teaching. Gibb is said to have privately warned about an impending row over the standardisation process but never actually saw the algorithm, which was not shared with DfE. However, he is known within the department as having an “obsession” with “grade inflation” and has been privately fingered by some colleagues as being a force behind ministerial pressure on the standardisation system. The regulator, target of much public anger and blamed by ministers for an algorithm that came close to wrecking the futures of thousands of young people, was just following government orders. Avoid grade inflation, said the DfE, giving Ofqual the impossible task of distributing the results fairly. Where it failed was in not creating routes for individuals to appeal. But it was Ofqual’s refusal to swallow Williamson’s last-minute mock exam substitution that brought the crisis to a head. If the past few weeks had been an exam, the prime minister would not have sat it. Johnson was holidaying in Scotland during the furore, though he spoke to Williamson shortly before the U-turn. The prime minister last appeared on the BBC a week ago, saying he was confident the system was robust and dependable – but then left ministers to deal with the fallout. It is likely he will also swerve a decision on whether to sack his education secretary, but Tory colleagues are now urging Johnson to take the helm of the back-to-school campaign to restore parents’ confidence.",education
"The footballer Marcus Rashford has called on ministers to offer a guaranteed “meal a day” to all school pupils in England in financially struggling families as he warned that his campaign to end child food poverty still had a “million miles to go”. In a recorded video hearing with the Commons petitions committee, the Manchester United and England striker repeated his call for a review of the free school meals system, saying the government was too slow to put measures in place when coronavirus hit, with the result that too many families were “left with nothing”. “The main point is children and families … need assurances that when they fall, they are going to have someone to lean on, they’re going to be protected,” he said. “They [ministers] should have had things in place to assure people they’re not going to hit rock bottom and have no help. Because too many people that I’ve spoken to and the families and their children, they hit that point and they’ve had to build themselves back up on their own. And for me, that’s not fair.” Rashford has achieved two of his original demands – the provision of meals and activities to low-income families during school holidays and the expansion of the healthy start voucher scheme – but has also called for a full-scale review of the free school meals system. “It seems like we have taken steps forward but in my mind we’ve got a million miles still to go,” he said. He called on the government to lower the threshold for free school meals eligibility so that a further 1.7 million children from low-income families on universal credit are able to claim school meal support. The Child Poverty Action Group has estimated that two in five children living below the poverty line are not entitled to free school meals. The footballer was questioned by the chair of the commons petitions committee, the Labour MP Catherine McKinnell. Rashford’s petition last year gathered more than 1.1m signatures from the public, triggering the hearing. Rashford said he was optimistic the government would recognise the need to change the free school meals system. “I think once they do review it they’re going to see for themselves, and the more they have closer contact to the people that they are helping, I think the more likely they are to make change…” He added: “I believe that if the government had the information that I have, and they spoke to the people that I have spoken to, from all different areas of the country, they would want to review it and change it themselves.” The live hearing of the committee takes place on Thursday, with evidence from poverty charities and the head of the government-commissioned national food strategy, Henry Dimbleby. McKinnell called on the government to outline any plans it had to bring forward a long-term strategy to tackle food insecurity and child food poverty.",education
"My mother, Mavis Johns, who has died aged 95, was a teacher who brought her passion for music-making to her community in north Wales. Mavis was born in Battersea, south London, to Dorothy (nee Chainey) and her husband, Harry Bedingfield, who worked in the building trade. Her older sister, Kathleen, died as a teenager, and she had a younger sister, June. Mavis’s Roman Catholic upbringing in Essex informed her long life and work. At St Angela’s school in Forest Gate and then the Dominican Convent school in Chingford, she was talented and adventurous, enlisting friends in escapades that got them into frequent trouble with the nuns. After leaving school she trained as a teacher at St Charles College (later Digby Stuart) in London; her first job was teaching infants at the Grange Ursuline school in Brentwood, Essex. Outside school she ran Brownie packs and adored country dancing, dressmaking, poetry and drama. She met Paul Johns at a folk dance at Cecil Sharp House in London; he was a recent Oxford graduate and keen amateur musician, working in a boys’ remand hostel while he decided what to do with his life. Mavis soon became part of this decision, and she and Paul married in 1954. My sister Nicky and I were born in rural Yorkshire, where Paul was teaching. Later, in Stamford in Lincolnshire, Paul taught at Blackfriars school, while Mavis returned to infant teaching at St Augustine’s RC school. Her mother helped with the five children, who now included Julia, Patrick and Elisabeth. Paul’s teaching took us to Coventry, where Mavis taught at St John Vianney RC school, and then to Sutton Coldfield. Mavis, who had an amazing zest for living and always said she would bloom wherever she was planted, made family life into an extraordinarily creative project ­– sewing our clothes, devising games and jamborees in the school holidays and organising us into a family recorder consort that toured the music festivals of the Midlands. In 1974 the family began a new shared enterprise in the tiny community of Gwyddelwern, north Wales, running the village post office. Mavis and Paul learned Welsh, made friends quickly and soon had so many requests to teach music that they abandoned shop life, never really being business-minded, and moved into the house next door, installing pianos upstairs and downstairs.  They were much loved as musical ambassadors, helping many grateful children and adults with exams and Eisteddfodau performances, organising recorder groups and performing locally. They were also enthusiastic participants in Lancaster University’s summer schools and many recorder gatherings around the country. After Paul died in 2012 Mavis moved to Ruthin in north Wales, teaching music into her 90s, making new friends, reading voraciously, playing Scrabble and reciting poetry by heart. She spent her last year in a care home in Llangollen, missing her cherished family and friends because of Covid restrictions. She is survived by her five children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, and by her sister June.",education
"Children have suffered “an epidemic” of demotivation while out of the classroom during coronavirus lockdowns, according to the chief inspector of schools in England, who warned against punishing children by shortening their holidays in an attempt to help them catch up. Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, told headteachers that a “significant minority of children just haven’t been engaging” when their teaching moved online as schools remained closed to most children from the start of the year. “With the best will in the world, schools haven’t been able to avert an epidemic of demotivated children. Heads have told us that even the hardest-working pupils lost enthusiasm as time went on. “Remote education requires great self-discipline – and that’s something that home-working adults struggle with, let alone children,” Spielman said. Speaking to the national conference of the Association of School and College Leaders, Spielman cast doubt on extending schooling into the weekends or summer holidays to allow pupils to catch up on lost learning, saying that such extensions risked making matters worse. She said she believed that “extensions to schooling will work well only if they’re supported by families so that they don’t feel like a punishment” for both children and parents. Ministers, including the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, have said they are looking at a wide range of proposals in the wake of the Covid closures, including a five-term school year and changes to summer holidays. But Spielman said: “Parents know that after a year of heavy restrictions children need time with their grandparents, with their friends, to get out of the house and enjoy themselves again. These are things that will help them learn well in school.“So we really need to work with the grain. Without parental support the children who most need help may simply not turn up. Or if they have to stay longer in the classroom they may switch off and then the extra time could be wasted. That risks widening gaps, not closing them.” Spielman said that while accelerating children’s progress was “a national priority,” it was clear “that for most children, getting back on track will happen through lessons in their normal classrooms, with their normal teachers”. Schools will need to make “tough decisions” about what to prioritise and what to leave out of the curriculum. “Pupils and learners won’t benefit from racing through subjects at pace, so that everything is covered to some degree but little is covered well,” Spielman said. “This really is about schools and colleges making intelligent choices, not just cramming everything in.”",education
"My friend David Raeburn, who has died aged 93, led a distinguished career as a headteacher, university classics tutor, translator and director of Greek drama. Boundlessly enthusiastic and cheerful, David delighted in sharing the fruits of his erudition and kept working as long as he could, translating and directing Greek plays into his 90s. Born in Hampstead, north London, David was the eldest of seven children of Walter Raeburn, a barrister and judge, and Dora (nee Williams), an artist. He attended Charterhouse school, in Godalming, Surrey, and then studied classics at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1949. It was here that he directed his first Greek play, Aeschylus’ Agamemnon in Louis MacNeice’s translation. Following national service in the Royal Army Educational Corps, he began teaching at Bristol grammar school. After spells at Bradfield college, Berkshire, and Alleyn’s, in south London, he became the headteacher of Beckenham and Penge grammar school in 1963, and in 1968 co-founded the Greek summer school, intended to offer classes to pupils who could not take up Greek at school. It still takes place every year at Bryanston school, Dorset. In 1970 he was appointed as the headteacher of Whitgift, an independent boys’ school in Croydon, south London. A natural liberal, he oversaw the end of corporal punishment, while his most tangible legacy was an ambitious building programme including a science and technology block. Benevolent and humane, he was revered by former pupils and staff. After his retirement in 1991, he embarked on a new career at Oxford University. For five years he was the classics faculty’s Grocyn lecturer, responsible for undergraduate language teaching, and later taught at New College. But his most striking achievements lay in drama and translation. He had put on many productions during his school teaching years, including some performances in the original Greek. From the age of 80 onwards, he enjoyed a remarkable late run at New College, directing 10 Greek plays with student casts, often using his own translations. His last production came in 2019, with Agamemnon – the same play (and in the same translation) with which he had started his directorial career 72 years earlier. He also co-authored (with Oliver Thomas) a scholarly commentary on Aeschylus’ timeless masterpiece. David distilled a lifetime’s thinking about Greek theatre into his book Greek Tragedies As Plays for Performance (2016), in which he employed his scholarship and practical experience to discuss 10 of the 33 tragedies to have survived from ancient Athens. His efforts as a translator were crucial to his project of revealing the meaning of ancient texts. Four of his translations of Sophocles’ plays were published in 2008 by Penguin Classics as Electra and Other Plays. He also made a verse translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses (2004) for Penguin. In 1961 David married Mary Faith Hubbard. She died in 2013. He is survived by their sons, Mark and Martin, a daughter, Fiona, eight grandchildren and a great-grandchild.",education
"Children with special needs in England are less likely to receive support if they are in disadvantaged areas or attend academy schools, according to a study that warns of a “postcode lottery”. The study of primary schoolchildren who reached year six found that the main barrier to support was inconsistent approaches among schools and regions in how they identify children as having special education needs and disabilities (Send). The children least likely to be identified were among the most vulnerable, including those who had suffered abuse or neglect, who were frequently absent from school or who had moved around a lot, the researchers from the Education Policy Institute (EPI) observed. “This report exposes the erratic and unequal way in which support for pupils with special educational needs is provided,” said David Laws, a former schools minister and executive chairman of the EPI. “With the pandemic acting as a further barrier to assessing children’s needs, the government must drastically improve its efforts to ensure that it is reaching the most vulnerable children in society.” The report calls for reforms to improve the way Send is assessed within schools, including specialist training for teachers and school leaders, a national standards framework, a stronger funding system and targeting of less visible children. The research found that children with severe needs living in areas in England with few academy schools were 10 times more likely to be identified with Send by their local authority than similar children living in areas with many academy schools. The report – which is the first to quantify national variation in Send support – found that local authorities tended to identify children as Send based on their personal, social and emotional development, an approach which the authors recommended that schools adopt rather than focusing on communication and literacy skills. “For many years families have highlighted flaws and inconsistencies in the system of identifying children with special educational needs,” said Jo Hutchinson, the report’s author. Hutchinson said it was unclear why Send identification rates differed in academies, though possible reasons may include “highly variable” Send training for teachers as well as a funding system that is “complex and often difficult to navigate”. More than one million children are registered with special needs or disabilities in England, encompassing four in 10 of all pupils during their time at school. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the report raised questions around the government’s plans to foster more competition between schools and to expand the role of multiacademy trusts in local Send support. “It is an impact of the systemic cuts to Send funding that local authorities in the most disadvantaged areas are found in the report to have been forced to ration support for the children with greatest need. This report reminds us we need a properly funded Send system,” he said. Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said: “Councils are struggling to meet the ever-increasing demand for Send support and are building up deficits in their high needs budgets. This is not sustainable and will ultimately impact on other services. “The government needs to urgently complete its positive ongoing review of the Send system. This needs to set out reforms that increase mainstream inclusion, provide councils with long-term certainty of funding to meet immense demand for Send support, and give councils the power to hold academies to account if their provision for identifying and supporting children with Send is not adequate.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Despite the important reforms introduced to improve support for young people with special educational needs and disabilities, the system is not working for every pupil – that’s why our Send review is looking at how to make sure it is consistent all over the country, high quality, and integrated across education, health and care.”",education

"A school that had threatened the parents of a Muslim schoolgirl with legal action after she wore a skirt that was deemed “too long” has dropped its legal challenge and apologised. Siham Hamud, 12, had described being bullied for her religious beliefs after being sent home every day in December from Uxbridge high school in Hillingdon, west London, and told to only come back when she wore a shorter skirt. The school had threatened the family with legal action over their daughter’s alleged unauthorised absences. But Siham’s parents had always maintained that shorter skirts contravened the family’s religious beliefs. Three months after first issuing the family with the legal threat, the school has now reversed its decision. Describing it as a difficult period, Siham’s father, Idris Hamud, 55, said the family were relieved. In a statement released by the family lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, Hamud said he was pleased that the school had listened to the family’s concerns and concluded that they were justified in raising the issue. “We are very happy that Siham has been able to resume her schooling, with her right to practice her faith by wearing an ankle-length skirt in the same style as the school uniform skirt now accommodated by the school,” he said. The statement revealed that the school had sent the family a letter of apology and had now confirmed that it would not be taking legal action for the time Siham was unable to attend school. “We thank the school for its willingness to work towards a fair and positive outcome,” Hamud said. “This has been a difficult period and we are relieved to now have the matter concluded. We are grateful for the support we have received from the wider community.” Siham had been wearing an ankle-length skirt to school for years, but said she was shocked when teachers told her last year that her attire was incorrect uniform. The school says girls should wear black trousers or a black pleated skirt from official uniform suppliers. She previously described feeling bullied for her beliefs. “It makes me feel left out, because I can’t see my friends. They aren’t accepting me for my religion and that’s wrong,” she said. “I feel confused and annoyed that I can’t wear what I want for my religion. I hope they’ll change their rules so that girls like me wear skirts to school.” A new school rule about the length of skirts was introduced two years ago, stating shorter branded skirts had to be worn. But the family claim they only recently became aware of this change, and Siham continued wearing her longer skirt, unaware she was breaking any rules, until she was spoken to by teachers on 1 December. On that day she was sent home to change, but did not return to school. The same thing happened each day for the three weeks of term in December, her family said. Siham’s older sisters, Sumayyah, 19, and Ilham, 17, both wore longer skirts to school without issue. Hamud, an athletics coach, previously said his daughter was being denied an education because of her religious beliefs. The school sent the parents a letter on 9 December threatening action. The school has been contacted for a comment.",education
"The government has stepped in at the 11th hour with an additional £250m in funding to help pay for the UK’s association with Horizon Europe, the European Union’s funding programme for research and innovation. Universities welcomed the move as “a significant affirmation of the government’s belief in research” which would avert the immediate threat to UK science. A statement from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, announcing the additional funding, said: “This investment reinforces the government’s commitment to putting research and development at the heart of plans to build back better from the pandemic. “It will support vital and pioneering research while enabling the UK’s brilliant scientists, researchers and businesses to access and benefit from the world’s largest collaborative research programme, Horizon Europe – worth about €95bn (£80bn) over the next decade.” The UK retained participation in Horizon Europe as part of its trade deal with the EU, but university leaders feared the government would not contribute the cost of taking part and would instead seek to fund it from existing research budgets. The cost of participation was previously part of the UK’s EU membership fees. University leaders warned such a move would amount to an effective cut in excess of £1bn, equivalent to cutting more than 18,000 full-time academic research posts and weakening the UK’s appeal as a destination for talented researchers and private and foreign investment. Welcoming the additional funding, Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK which represents university leaders, said: “We are very pleased that the government has averted threats to UK science and research by allocating additional funding to support the UK’s association to Horizon Europe and welcome their commitment to increase investment in R&D to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. “Given current pressures on public finances, this is a significant affirmation of the government’s belief in research, recognising the pivotal role it plays in the UK’s current and future prosperity, and ensuring UK universities will remain at the forefront of efforts to address the most pressing global challenges.” Dr Tim Bradshaw, CEO of the Russell Group of universities, said: “Providing additional funding for Horizon Europe to protect core R&D budgets is a good move by government and underlines its determination to establish Britain as a global science superpower. “Scientists and researchers have been a vital part in the emergency response to Covid-19 and this continued investment in UK science will pay dividends as we work to deliver our joint ambitions for the country – high-value jobs and growth and a greener, healthier economy.”",education
"Attaining – and maintaining – a state of joy or even simple contentment can be challenging, especially in these most difficult of times. But data from a course pioneered at the University of Bristol has suggested that actually taking time to study happiness may be a good way of achieving it. First year students who have been completed a “science of happiness” course – the first of its kind in the UK – have been found to be more upbeat than counterparts who have not taken it. The three-month course has two strands – one academic, one practical. Students are lectured about the psychology and the neuroscience of happiness. What it is, why it happens. They also have to carry out practical tasks such as performing an act of kindness, chatting to a stranger, taking time to savour an experience, exercising, sleeping well, even writing a thank you letter. During sessions in “happiness hubs” led by senior students they are asked to think about the impact of social media on happiness, about how loneliness can impair immune systems and how optimism can increase life expectancy. Students are also expected to write entries in an online journal each week to help them reflect on their mental wellbeing. There are no exams but students who complete the course receive the nice boost of 20 academic credits – a sixth of what they need to pass their first year. But, more importantly, many of the 1,000 students who have so far taken the course have said they feel happier. Prof Bruce Hood, who runs the course, said: “I knew the students would enjoy the lectures as the content is so fascinating, but I was truly astounded to discover the positive impact on their mental wellbeing.” The course was launched in response to a worrying increase in student mental health problems across the UK. Based on a successful course run at Yale University in the US, the idea of the course was to combine cutting-edge research with practical advice. Sarah Purdy, the University of Bristol’s pro vice-chancellor for student experience, said: “Offering students a course that was not examined or graded was a new approach for us. It was a recognition that equipping students with the skills they need to stay mentally resilient is at least as important as giving them the knowledge they need for their future careers. An academic study of the course has found that the first cohort, who took it at the end of 2019, had significantly higher mental wellbeing than a control group. A second cohort, who were on the course during the early part of the Covid crisis, did not feel happier but were judged more resilient than a control group. The third course was an online one because of lockdown restrictions and, though there was no control group, participants reported that their sense of wellbeing had increased. The study accepted there were caveats – most of those who took part were white and female and some students could not take part because of timetabling issues. But Lara Czernecki, a first year film and television student who has completed the course, said it had helped her feel more content and she continues to use the meditation techniques she learned. “It’s made me feel more conscious of my happiness. I’ve thought a lot about success and happiness. Lots of people think they will be happy if they are successful. We can turn it around – if we are happy we are more likely to be successful.”",education

"Excluded from birthday parties and falsely accused of being dirty and a thief, at her UK secondary school Sherrie Smith finally gave up trying to fit in. Instead of seeking acceptance, she began to act up and within weeks she was permanently excluded. Though her family was settled and she was being brought up in a house, she was proud of her Romany Gypsy heritage, and the constant calls of “pikey” and “dirty gypo” were too much to bear. History started to repeat itself when her younger daughter, Ruby Leigh-Smith, began secondary school. “Because she was open about her background she was regularly called pikey and gypo, and even physically attacked three times. You hold a birthday party and no one turns up. That’s the way it was for us and the way it still is, even if we live in a house or flat like everyone else. Her school was wonderful and worked with me to try to tackle the racism, but nowhere was safe, not even her home, because she got hate messages on social media,” says Smith. It was heartbreaking to watch Ruby’s growing realisation that the family she loved was the subject of such scorn and hatred, but Smith was able to keep her daughter focused on a long-term goal: higher education. For Smith is one of a tiny minority of UK Gypsies and Travellers with a university degree and her daughter, now 18, is holding two university offers to study journalism in September. Smith, having broken the mould (she went to Goldsmiths, University of London as a mature student and gained a degree in community development and youth work), is now doing a master’s in education at Bucks New University. She is also working as a research assistant and helping to promote The Pledge – the campaign the university has initiated to reach out to Gypsy, Traveller, Roma, Showman and Boater communities. Other universities to sign the GTRSB-into-higher-education pledge include Winchester, Hull, Strathclyde and Sunderland, and more plan to join. The universities promise to make it easier for the communities to access courses, through wider participation outreach, year-round accommodation, bursaries, and mentoring and study support, among other initiatives. It is a scheme that is well overdue. Research in 2019 found only 3-4% of Gypsies, Roma and Travellers aged 18-30 accessed higher education, compared with 43% of other people in that age group. Only 184 Gypsy and Traveller students were registered in higher education in 2018-19, according to the Office for Students. A report earlier this month by the Traveller Movement found children from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller groups most likely to be excluded or “off-rolled”, and least likely to achieve formal qualifications. It said the children experienced “high levels of bullying based on their ethnicity that largely goes unaddressed in schools” and called for the Department for Education formally to adopt the term “anti-Gypsyism” as a form of racism. Even before the pandemic, a report from the Education Policy Institute said Gypsy and Roma pupils were 34 months behind their peers by the end of secondary school, and Irish Traveller pupils 28.9 months behind, compared with 9.3 months for black Caribbean students. The Roma Support group, in a letter to Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, on 11 March, said Roma children had fallen even further behind and asked for targeted catch-up help and the reinstatement of those taken off the roll before the Covid crisis. Beyond education, the traditionally itinerant communities now face a new threat. The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill going through parliament makes residing on land with a vehicle without consent a criminal offence, punishable by three months in prison or a fine of up to £2,500. It also gives police the right to seize vehicles, trailers or caravans, even if they lack wheels or are otherwise un-roadworthy. But, Smith says, it does not matter whether you are living in a house or a trailer, people will brand you. “Our tradition is not to be uneducated. Our tradition is to value family and being together. The racism in schools, from pupils and teachers, is the biggest reason why so many of us leave without qualifications,” she says. “I’m a Gypsy, I’ve got a caravan outside my house, I’ve got a degree, I’m doing a postgraduate qualification, I am a community volunteer, but it doesn’t matter what I do or what I’m paid or where I go, I will still be a Gypsy. The minute I open my mouth I’m immediately labelled and suffer prejudice. The media puts out a stereotype that we are uneducated and wear big earrings, travel around and have gold false teeth. I have a house, dishwasher and a hot tub and I’ve never actually owned a horse, but that doesn’t change who I am. I am proud of my culture, my history, my family and yet for the last 10 years we have had to combat the outrageous stereotypes of the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding,” she says. Circus families say they, too, are suffering. Donna*, a circus ring mistress says her experience has been “absolutely unbelievable”. “When I was 12 I was made to stand on a chair in front of the class so they could see what a thief looks like. That was in the 70s, but just a few years ago my son’s new headteacher banned me from the building saying she didn’t want to be alone in a room with me and I had to ask permission to go to the village hall to watch him in a school play. I was told I had no right to complain because I didn’t hide who I was.” She says at that point she was living in south Angus, in Scotland. While ethnic groups are protected by human rights legislation, most recently the Equality Act 2010, Martin Gallagher, an Irish Traveller, says racism against people from itinerant communities is not recognised. As is usual practice for young Traveller boys, Gallagher, who was brought up in a caravan, started work with his father, but went back to education in his 20s and is now a PhD student at Northumbria University. He says low expectations and racism from students and teachers are the biggest reasons for the low university take-up. “I used to try to change my accent so I wouldn’t be stereotyped and unfortunately, 20 years later, I see two of my young cousins still doing that – they speak normally to their mother and change their voices as they walk into school. The Pledge is a massive deal because it says we are welcome at this institution, where we haven’t felt that way before.”  Gallagher did well at primary school, scored highly in his Sats and was told he had the ability to study law, but when he reached secondary school, he says teachers put him in a room with other Travellers “colouring in and joining up dots”. “It instantly highlighted that we were different to our classmates and made us feel like we were a hindrance to everybody else,” he says. “I remember a teacher stating I had no excuse not doing my homework, as ‘Travellers didn’t have lives and didn’t do anything’. I was confused and angry as this came from a black teacher, who I thought fully understood racism, yet was publicly stating false racial stereotypes about my family and community. Fortunately, there were four teachers who believed in me and pushed me to do my best when the other 90% did not bother – they just cared about getting results and assumed as I was a Traveller, I wouldn’t turn up or would fail,” he says. Meanwhile, Ruby Leigh-Smith is now in the sixth form and is even friends with one of her former tormentors. She hopes the GRTSB Pledge will persuade more people to choose higher education like she has: “Young people like me can face discouragement at school and feel that university is out of bounds. When we see people in our communities being successful, they are role models that inspire us, and hopefully help to bring about change.” *Name has been changed as her son is still in school",education
"The British education system’s inconsistent approach towards racist incidents within schools is potentially putting children of colour at a disadvantage for the rest of their lives, the former children’s commissioner for England has warned. Anne Longfield also called on the government to review its education policies, with a particular focus on children who are excluded from schools. Through interviews, freedom of information requests and extensive research, the Guardian found huge disparities between how schools dealt with and recorded racist incidents, due to a failure by central government to issue proper guidance. Longfield urged ministers to give schools increased clarity on how to tackle racist incidents, and in some cases systemic racism within their institutions. “The response from schools is very inconsistent, some will feel much more confident about it than others, and I think what this comes down to at the end is about a system,” she said. “So some of it, of course, is about schools policy, but it might also be about policy from the Department for Education [DfE]. It’s all about joined-up thinking. “I don’t have any reassurance that there’s consistency in dealing with [racism] and what we see happening in terms of the level of exclusions in some schools.” In May 2019 the then education secretary, Damian Hinds, called on headteachers in England to expel fewer pupils, as an independent study – the Timpson review – revealed almost eight out of 10 permanently excluded children came from vulnerable backgrounds. The long-awaited analysis of exclusions in England, carried out by Edward Timpson, a former minister for children and families at the DfE, found 78% of expelled pupils either had special educational needs (SEN), were eligible for free school meals (FSM) or were “in need”. The Guardian has since found that exclusion rates for black Caribbean students in British schools are up to six times higher than those of their white peers in some local authorities. Longfield said this highlighted that some schools were more capable of meeting the behavioural needs of certain children, while others were consistently failing due to their rigid school structure. She said the Timpson review “highlighted that there were two aspects of a child being excluded. One was the child and how the child was behaving and the other was the characteristics of the school. What became clear was that about 90% of the exclusions were actually taking place in 10% of schools.” But Longfield said that despite ministers accepting there was an urgent need for reform, with Hinds confirming the government would act on the review’s recommendation that schools should be made accountable for the pupils they permanently exclude, in reality little had changed. “So I’ve been disappointed it hasn’t been followed up,” she said. “The government is continuing with its expansion of alternative provision and I accept that there are times when children have to be out of school but I would like that alternative provision to be focused on how you keep children in school.” In September an Institute of Race Relations (IRR) report focusing on London said government responses to inner-city youth rebellions and moral panics over serious youth violence and knife crime had led to black pupils disproportionately being sent to pupil referral units (PRU) and alternative provision (AP). The IRR report noted that 89% of children in detention in 2017-18 reported having been excluded from school, according to the HM chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales. Last June the government announced an additional £750 per pupil to support students leaving AP to transition into education or training, but even with the extra funding school leaders said one in four students would still not have anywhere to go in September. Longfield said the situation with exclusions and APs was just one example of how BAME children were being put at a disadvantage. She also cited the disproportional number of black children in custody and also on remand, with the proportion of children who received a youth caution or sentence who were BAME almost doubling since 2010, from 14% to 27% in 2018. “Certainly there are inequalities within the school system, and there’s a school system that isn’t yet geared up to be able to either reflect the lives of those children, or indeed support those children,” she said. “If you ask any of those kids [in custody] about their schooling, they will nearly all tell you they were excluded from school. After they’ve been excluded the first time, put a whole package of support around that child. It’s just obvious.” Longfield also called for data on racist incidents within schools to be routinely collected, allowing public bodies and ministers to get a clear picture of what is happening within the UK education system. Without central data collection, she said, it would remain a challenge to tackle systemic racism due to a lack of understanding. “We need to ensure that all children when they’re in the classroom feel safe, that they feeling that supportive environment, and that they know others have got their back- that it will be taken seriously,” she said.",education
"Hundreds of schools across England are reforming their curriculum to reflect the achievements of black and minority ethnic people and address the harmful legacy of colonialism after a groundswell of demand from young people. In the absence of government-led change to the national curriculum, grassroots groups have offered schemes to help schools improve. More than 660 schools in England have signed up to a diverse and anti-racist curriculum developed by teachers and council staff in the London borough of Hackney, for example. Titled the Diverse Curriculum – the Black Contribution, it provides pupils aged five to 14 with nine weeks of lessons on subjects including the Windrush generation, activism, British identity, and diversity in the arts and science. Orlene Badu of Hackney Education, who led the development of the project, said calls for change intensified during lockdown when children were studying from home and parents suddenly realised how un-diverse the curriculum was. The former primary school headteacher said a subsequent survey found that many pupils felt uncomfortable that representations of the black community in history lessons were dominated by narratives of oppression and powerlessness. “A curriculum that references you does engender a stronger sense of belonging and commitment, which would hopefully lead to improved educational outcomes and lived experiences,” Badu said. Meanwhile, the educational group the Black Curriculum has partnered with Camden council in north London, the mayor of London and a Manchester MP in three schemes that aim to diversify the curriculum of more than 1,000 schools. Natalie Russell, the organisation’s head of delivery and development, said many teachers lacked the confidence to provide a diverse curriculum because they had not been taught about black history. “Young people say they are taught about the slave trade in a very insensitive way. A lot of the time, teachers do not understand why it is negative to identify somebody as a slave,” she said. “Teachers need to be trained to understand the impact that has on young people and why it is important to make sure that slavery is not the only narrative being told.” The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, the chair of parliament’s petitions committee, which has conducted hearings on black history and cultural diversity in the national curriculum, said: “One of the messages that came across clearly was that because teaching black history is not mandatory and merely a choice, it creates the impression that it is less important than other aspects of our history.” Among those who gave evidence to MPs were the university students Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson and Nell Bevan, whose survey of 56,000 current and former pupils and teachers found significant gaps in the British history syllabus. More than 86% of respondents said they learned about the Tudors, while 72% were taught about the Battle of Hastings and the Great Fire of London. But just under 37% learned about the transatlantic slave trade, less than 10% about the role of slavery in the British Industrial Revolution and less than 8% about the British colonisation of Africa. Jikiemi-Pearson, who studied history A-level, said: “No link was made between the long-lasting effects of colonialism and why some countries are still really struggling to find their feet again. It emphasised the divide between me and my white peers,” she said. In contrast to England, the devolved Welsh government announced last week that learning about the contributions of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities would be mandatory under a new curriculum to be introduced next year.  The Scottish government has committed to a review of its curriculum after the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. John Swinney, the deputy first minister and cabinet secretary for education and skills, said: “The challenge was put to us: ‘Do you think you’re doing enough in the Scottish curriculum to address the nation’s relationship with slavery? I felt it was important that we confronted that and addressed it.” Claire Alexander, a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, said while efforts to diversify the curriculum dated back more than 50 years in the UK, there was now unprecedented recognition that change was required. Alexander, who set up the Our Migration Story website in response to demand from pupils for more diverse histories, added: “What we have found in all the schools we work with – in Cardiff, Leicester, Sheffield, London and Manchester – is that taking a different approach to history can engage all young people, no matter what their background is. It does provide a sense of shared belonging and understanding.” In collaboration with the Black Curriculum, the Manchester Gorton MP, Afzal Khan, announced a diverse curriculum charter for schools in his constituency. Khan said he was compelled to act after the murder of George Floyd in the US, the eruption of global BLM protests, and the disproportionate Covid-19 mortality rate in BAME communities, which had shown that racism was still affecting many people in the UK. Khan, who is of Pakistani heritage, said he hoped all schools across Greater Manchester would sign up to the charter. “The current curriculum is no longer fit for purpose,” he added. “It no longer truly reflects the makeup of British society today.” The contributions of the Indian continent and its people to world conflicts as well as Muslim innovations in science and art are just two examples of history that often get overlooked, he added. Sam Offord, a headteacher who signed up to Khan’s charter, said her school, Birchfields primary in the Fallowfield area of Manchester, where the vast majority of pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds, had already been working on diversifying its curriculum in light of the new Ofsted framework. Offord, the north-west regional secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, urged others to sign up to the charter. “I began to realise, that even though I thought we had been addressing diversity in our curriculum, we really weren’t,” she said. Another initiative is being led by Thinking Black, a volunteer-run student organisation founded in 2017 at the University of Oxford, which works with school pupils to help “facilitate critical black thoughts among young people”. Hope Oloye, a 24-year-old PhD student, founded the organisation to incorporate the thoughts and contributions of black people in the curriculum. “A massive goal of ours is to recentre the contributions of black people within the curriculum,” she said. “Because if you don’t see yourself in any part of your curriculum, how can you feel passionate towards it or personally tied to it?”  Since then, Thinking Black has worked with 215 black students from across the country aged 16 and 17, and has trained 156 to facilitate the programme. For the upcoming year, the organisation is planning a programme for year 8 students on black art history, as well as a creative writing and public speaking workshop. Michael Lawson-Falomo, a 16-year-old student from east London, has been taking part in the programme since September. “It gives you a great insight into what your blackness really means, especially being in the UK and being surrounded by such an ethnocentric curriculum,” he said. “The things we have covered, such as healthcare inequality and how climate change affects black people, isn’t something you learn in mainstream education.” A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “The knowledge-rich curriculum in our schools already offers pupils the opportunity to study significant figures from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and the contributions they have made to the nation, as well as helping them understand our shared history with countries from across the world.”",education
"Talented black graduates are being shut out of academic careers in science and technology, according to the president of the Royal Society, who appealed to the scientific community to improve access. White students were twice as likely as black students to graduate from degrees in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem subjects) with first-class honours in 2018-19, whereas black students were three times more likely to leave with a third. Black students also had higher dropout rates (4.7% for black undergraduates compared with 2.7% for their white peers). This contributes to underrepresentation in academic careers, with just 1.7% of academic staff identifying as black compared with 13.2% as Asian and 81.3% as white. Just 3.5% of black academic staff are professors, compared with 11.9% of white staff, according to Higher Education Statistics Agency data. Sir Adrian Smith, the president of the Royal Society, which commissioned the report, said: “Talented black people are not finding science careers in UK academia and that is unacceptable. Our reports show that black people are more likely to drop out of science at all points of the career path. It is time that the whole science community comes together to find out why and put it right.” Dr Mark Richards, a senior lecturer in physics at Imperial College London and member of the Royal Society’s diversity committee, said the worse outcomes for black undergraduates may result from a lack of academic and pastoral support from universities. Black graduates may be deterred from academic careers due to “opaque” structures that make them appear riskier than alternatives in industry, he added. The Royal Society also found that of the 5,070 eligible UK nationals for its early career fellowship grants, just 12% are from any ethnic minority background, and 1% are black. One fellowship scheme has received no applications from black British researchers over the past three years. To remedy this, the Royal Society is planning a programme of networking events and mentorship schemes for early career researchers from ethnic minority backgrounds. Meanwhile, new research commissioned by the Department for Education found that black students had the lowest returns from attending university out of any ethnic group. Their lifetime gains averaged at £50,000 compared with £100,000 for white graduates and £200,000 for South Asian men, with more of them studying financially lucrative subjects such as business, pharmacology and law. Graduates of Pakistani heritage had the largest percentage returns from attending university out of any ethnic group. These graduates earned on average £23,000 at age 30 for men and £19,000 for women, nearly double the £13,000 and £11,000 salaries of nongraduates. Considerable gains were also observed among students from the poorest 20% of families, who earned £25,000 for men and £21,000 for women at 30 compared with salaries of £20,000 and £11,000 respectively for their peers without graduate degrees. Overall, the report estimated that two-thirds of all graduates are better off as a result of going to university, with all socio-economic and ethnic groups benefiting on average.Jack Britton, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which produced the report, said: “Among students from the poorest families, few get rich as a result of getting a degree. However, going to university is still an especially good financial decision for these students. One reason – regrettably – is that earnings prospects for this group are otherwise quite low.”",education
"A protest at Dulwich College over the “rape culture” row has been cancelled after students were threatened with disciplinary action by the school and a fine from police. An organiser of Friday’s protest said he was bitterly disappointed it had been scrapped. He said he “woke up every day feeling shit about going to Dulwich College because it’s not a place that attracts or makes good people”. A former student of James Allen’s Girls’ school, who also asked to remain anonymous, criticised the pressure students had been put under not to attend the planned protest. “Dulwich College has for years totally ignored, dismissed and condoned by turning a blind eye, this predatory behaviour by students,” she said. “A protest was students’ only way to pressure the headmaster to actually tackle the sexual violence at his school.” The march by pupils of several schools was advertised on social media as “a demonstration against the predatory culture of Dulwich College and the school management [which] condones it”. In an email sent to parents on Thursday, Dr Joe Spence, the head of the £21,246-a-year independent school, said he had told pupils that anyone who attended the march would be fined by the police for breaching lockdown restrictions. “I made clear [to the children that I] understood that a number of Dulwich pupils wished to express their support for the cause of gender equality and to show solidarity with victims of sexual abuse and harassment,” Spence wrote. “However, I encouraged them to play their part in addressing these issues by engaging in dialogue with the college leadership team here and through local schools rather than by participating in a protest likely to bring on to the campus and the streets around the college pupils from other schools over whom we have no jurisdiction, with all the health, safety and public order risks that such an event would bring. “It is also the case that demonstrations of this nature are unlawful whilst social restrictions are in place and the police have told us they will ticket and fine protesters. In a message to parents earlier this week, Spence told parents he had reported some Dulwich pupils to the police after receiving allegations of sexual harassment after the publication last weekend of an open letter that branded the school “a breeding ground for sexual predators”. The original letter, published by the Sunday Times, was written by Samuel Schulenburg, 19, and included about 100 anonymous stories from girls who went to schools nearby such as James Allen’s girls’ school (Jags). The allegations included assault, revenge porn, sexual violence, “slut shaming” and claims that the school has an “established rape culture”. Public accusations of sexual violence by fellow pupils have also recently been levelled at Westminster, Latymer Upper, King’s College, London Oratory and Highgate schools. At Highgate, pupils walked out of classes on Thursday after the publication of accounts of alleged abuse. The BBC claims to have seen a dossier of allegations made by more than 200 current and former pupils at Highgate school. The document includes first-hand accounts of alleged abuse as well as claims that rape was “tolerated” by staff. The anonymous testimonies made in the document were written by pupils in response to the question: “What is your experience of rape culture at Highgate school?” England’s new children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, has said the accusations are “alarming” and schools have clear advice to follow. “It’s really distressing, and we get lots of testimony like this,” she said. “There is very clear advice on sexual violence and harassment” for schools. “When it is serious it must be escalated to both social care and to the police, and schools need to follow that.”",education
"Many parents struggled through home schooling and felt relieved when their children returned to school. But for others, the experience was an inspiration – and the incentive for a career move into childcare, early years education and teaching. Applications to tiney, a new initiative focused on early years education that was created by the founder of Teach First, soared during the pandemic. The company, which started accepting applications in May 2019, received 4,672 inquiries in the 10 months before lockdown – but 12,345 applications were made in the 12 months from March 2020. What was even more surprising than the exponential rise, said its founder, Brett Wigdortz, was that 35% of applications came from people who had been working in white-collar industries – up from 16% in the previous 10 months. More than half the applications came from people with no previous experience of working in childcare or education, compared with 35% before lockdown. “We have seen a big uplift in people switching from corporate careers to train with us since March 2020: we’ve had applications from a diamond dealer, dentists, corporate secretaries and a founder of a City tech start-up,” Wigdortz said. “Lockdown has definitely played a role. People discovered how much they enjoyed spending time at home or were prompted to re-evaluate their career goals. Many applicants over the past year have told us that the idea of going back to their ‘old’ life, complete with commute and office politics, had lost its appeal.” Now Teach, a charity that helps experienced professionals retrain as teachers, reported a 70% rise in applications a month between March and May 2020. It received three times as many applications in October and November 2020 compared with the previous year. Katie Waldegrave, the co-founder of Now Teach, said: “The pandemic has prompted people to ask themselves what happens when the busy distractions of people and office disappear? The people we are recruiting now are the ones for whom the pandemic has highlighted a real need and desire to engage with their community, give back and be useful.” Sandrine Finel swapped her job as an assistant finance director in a City-based firm to train and register as a childminder after home schooling her 10-year-old son during lockdown. “Working with children is so much more positive than working for a big company, with my only target being the increase of someone else’s profit,” Finel said. “I’m loving my new career. I wake up smiling, knowing I’m going to have a tiring but completely rewarding and really important day.” Bronte Scott, from Huddersfield, enjoyed teaching her five- and seven-year-olds so much during lockdown that she left her corporate job in learning and development to embark on an accelerated degree in primary education. It will lead to a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) next year. “I’ve got a lot to thank lockdown for,” she said. “Home schooling made me realise that helping my children to learn was way more fulfilling than adults who really didn’t want to.” Bronte wants to be a primary school teacher with a focus on early years education. “It’s a big step,” she said. “My previous job was very secure and of growing importance within the company. But lockdown made me realise it just wasn’t fulfilling.” Frances Vulliamy decided to give up her job as an executive coach in the City to become a childminder after looking after her baby during lockdown. “It was a particularly intense maternity leave because there weren’t any baby classes to go to or other distractions,” she said. “But I found that while others were struggling, I loved generating all the ideas for my daughter.” Vulliamy completed a three-month online course with tiney before setting up her own childcare business, which is now so successful that she has taken on an assistant. “Prior to lockdown, I never thought I’d want to work in childcare,” she said. “It’s not seen as an aspirational career for intelligent, skilled people, which I’ve realised is just so wrong. This is one of the most important periods in a child’s life and it takes a lot of skill to look after them well.” Casmira Nan, whose child is 18 months old, worked with diamond dealers in the jewellery trade before lockdown. During the pandemic, however, she retrained as a childminder. “This career change has changed my life in a positive way. It’s hard work but very rewarding; children’s development is truly a wonder,” she said. Dr Stephen Kennedy, from Cambridge, has two daughters aged seven and five, and has spent more than 12 years in investment banking in London and Hong Kong. “Home schooling wasn’t something I would have chosen to do, but on a good day it was great to see my daughters making progress, to see that something they had been stuck on had suddenly stopped being a problem,” he said. “Those victories gave me a buzz.” What made Kennedy think seriously about switching to teaching was when a science video he made with his daughters, showing how to use a glass bowl to make rainbows on the floor, inspired their classmates to do the same. “I had got children exploring for themselves,” he said. “That was pretty magical and I thought, ‘Hey, maybe I could do this!’.” During the first lockdown, Kennedy got a scholarship from the Institute of Physics to study for a the PGCE course at the University of Cambridge.  “I’ll be teaching physics in secondary schools and I’m feeling really good about the change,” he said. “I hope I can do my bit to help children catch up on what they missed out over the past year.”",education
"With the season of university offers well under way, some institutions are wooing school leavers with promises of a “totally open campus”, or at least that student life will be “much more like usual”. But academics and students are calling for frankness about the likelihood that disruption to classes and social lives will continue.  Universities are braced for a fierce competition to attract new students this summer, and expect a second chaotic year dealing with A-level results. Many fear that the more elite institutions will take advantage to expand for the second year in a row, which could leave others struggling to recruit enough students at a time they need their £9,250 fees more than ever. Some universities, including University College London, Sheffield University, Ulster University and Edinburgh University are clear on their websites that new students should expect the “blended” learning that had become standard practice before lockdown, with lectures online and as many smaller seminars or workshops as possible given in person. However, many university websites do not mention Covid in information for prospective students, and some are overtly upbeat. Solent University Southampton’s website tells new students it hopes that “if lockdown measures continue to be lifted successfully over the summer, the next academic year will look much more like our usual offer”. Prof Karen Stanton, Solent’s vice-chancellor, says: “We have exciting plans in place to bring all our students back to campus in the ‘new normal’ we’ll be facing.” She said this included working with the student union on transition and induction events as well as a freshers’ fair, adding: “We also know things may change and if that’s the case, we’re fully prepared to implement all our experience from the past year.” Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, says struggling institutions could be tempted to tell students what they think they want to hear. “They will pitch it as normal or near normal higher education in term 1 of 2021-22,” he says. “After the experience of the current academic year, we know this is unfair to students.” Marginson says it is highly likely that universities will have to offer both online and face-to-face learning this autumn and winter because of social distancing restrictions, and that they cannot rule out students having to study wholly in their bedrooms again if there is another lockdown. He believes the government’s Office for Students should be “reining institutions in” that are overpromising. However, he also thinks the government should guarantee some support for struggling universities “if recruitment drops through the floor” because of crisis conditions. “It might never be needed, but the basic security would make a difference. It would allow institutions to use their marketing departments as servant and not master, and would protect students and their families from bad marketing,” he says. Prof Quintin McKellar, vice-chancellor of the University of Hertfordshire, says that the success of the national vaccination programme means he is expecting to run a “completely open university” in September. “We hope to have a normal freshers’ week, sports facilities open and clubs and societies operating,” he says. “Although we absolutely expect that there will be a need for masks and social distancing.” McKellar says blended learning, with students able to access lectures online whenever they choose, has been so popular that “even if we didn’t still have Covid we would be changing our teaching and offering that in the future”. But with thousands of students still studying alone at home and angry about paying rent for rooms they cannot use, Hertfordshire is promising a 50% refund on rent in university-owned halls for up to six weeks in the event of another national lockdown. Prof Anthony Smith, vice-provost for education and student affairs at University College London, says UCL is not assuming it will be back to normal in September. “It’s great to hear that we might have young people vaccinated by August, but it won’t be everybody, and of course we have international students coming.” UCL is assuming that social distancing will be necessary for a significant part of the next year – possibly all of it – which will limit how students can use the campus. However, it is still aiming to increase the number of in-person seminars and workshops, which Smith says students have “really missed”. “One of our students said to me the other day ‘We’re fed up and we’re fed up with being fed up’. They want things to be better. But there is a real duty on us to be realistic,” he says. “The scenario could well be that we have a third wave and a strict lockdown. We intend to give them the best possible experience, but we have to be careful not to overpromise.” Oxford University, too, is cautious, telling prospective students on its website that it is committed to delivering an “outstanding experience” and focusing on “personalised teaching” but “it is too early to say exactly what the situation will be in September”. Levi Pay, a former head of student services who advises universities on the student experience, recommends school leavers accept their social lives will probably still be “extremely lacking” this autumn, for reasons their university cannot control. “Universities would be sensible to be honest about the fact that the broader student experience remains unlikely to be normal next year,” he says. “If they had been more open about how different this aspect was inevitably going to be this year, they would have helped minimise complaints from students feeling misled.” He says during a recession university will still be the best option for most students, but he advises them to be honest about their motivation. “If the broader student experience is your main reason for going to university, put it off and find other ways to spend the next year or two – working, volunteering, any way that helps you make ends meet while treading water for a bit,” he says. Hugh Wylie, who decided to accept a deferred place to study chemistry at Edinburgh University after his A-levels were marked up in last year’s exams fiasco, says that although he has been doing 5am shifts at Tesco this year, he is relieved he put off going to university. “My friends who did go and are now back at home definitely aren’t happy,” he says. “They are sitting in their rooms working alone. Even the ones who are really passionate about what they are doing are getting discouraged, and it shows.” Wylie understands that his experience this autumn is unlikely to be normal, but thinks that as long as he can be on campus it will be OK. “Obviously it’s going to be different, but I just really hope I can still meet people,” he says. Aidan Taylor, a first-year architecture student at Leeds Beckett University, says: “I think students should definitely be told the truth about what to expect, even if that’s difficult.” Taylor decided to continue living at home for his first year because of the pandemic, and is glad he did. But, he says: “I’ve struggled most with having no social life. I was able to make a few friends at the start of term in face-to-face sessions, but I haven’t seen them for months so I do feel disconnected.” He says his university has been supportive, “but this year has been tough”.",education
"The chief inspector of schools in England asked for greater powers to monitor independent schools over “potential safeguarding issues”, but was ignored by ministers, the Guardian can reveal.  Despite concerns raised by Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s chief inspector, the body was later stripped of its role in overseeing the inspections of private schools now engulfed by a wave of sexual assault allegations. Documents seen by the Guardian show Spielman complained to the Department for Education in 2018 and 2019 that her organisation was unable to monitor the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI), to which the DfE delegates inspections of elite private schools such as Westminster and Dulwich College. They are among schools involved in a growing scandal over complaints by pupils of rape, harassment and assault at private and state institutions, documented on the Everyone’s Invited website. Conservative MP Maria Miller has called for Ofsted to investigate why “nothing has changed in the last five years”. In 2018 Spielman told the DfE that Ofsted had been unable to adequately monitor the ISI’s inspections of private schools because of DfE restrictions over the previous three years. The dispute continued until late 2019, with the then schools minister Lord Agnew telling Spielman that Ofsted’s oversight role would be instead taken over by the DfE. The controversy has shone a light on the role of the ISI, which in England is authorised by the education secretary to carry out regulatory inspections of “association” independent schools – schools that are members of groups such as the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference or the Girls’ Schools Association, including the likes of Harrow and St Paul’s Girls’ School, about 1,250 in total. The ISI’s previous chief inspector, Christine Ryan, was named as the chair of Ofsted by Gavin Williamson in July 2020. In November 2018 Spielman told the DfE it was failing to commission Ofsted to oversee ISI’s work by carrying out its own inspections, leaving Ofsted without enough evidence to assess the ISI’s performance. “I am therefore concerned that, while many inspections are doubtless carried out to a high standard, the system is not currently configured so that any problems can be spotted and tackled, for example regarding potential safeguarding issues in the schools,” Spielman wrote to the then education secretary, Damien Hinds. The chief inspector asked for greatly increased powers over independent schools, telling Hinds: “These new arrangements should have ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all children educated in the independent sector as their focus.” Spielman said “as a minimum” Ofsted should be allowed to conduct “unannounced on-site monitoring visits” and “carry out termly safeguarding-focused checks, to verify that any safeguarding issues were followed up and reported on appropriately”. The failure to monitor independent schools was raised again in June 2019, at an Ofsted board meeting. Sean Harford, Ofsted’s director for education, reported to the board: “The current arrangements do not enable us to provide assurance on the inspection activities of ISI, and our preference is to increase our monitoring activity.” Spielman also wrote to the education secretary later in 2019, to report that Ofsted was again unable to report on ISI’s effectiveness because the DfE had failed to authorise Ofsted to undertake any monitoring at all. “Ofsted does not have the necessary evidence to be able to make any comment, in this report, to the secretary of state on ISI’s suitability as an independent inspectorate,” Spielman wrote to the DfE in July 2019. But in November 2019, Agnew wrote to Spielman to make clear that Ofsted would have only an academic part in overseeing ISI. “I expect that the Department of Education’s own monitoring of ISI’s reports and information provided directly by ISI, should allow the secretary of state to fulfil this role,” Agnew wrote. Agnew also told Spielman that Ofsted should no longer report on the “robustness” of of ISI’s judgments or on its agreements with the DfE. Ofsted declined to comment, but pointed to remarks by Victor Shafiee, Ofsted’s deputy director of independent schools, to the education committee last week. Shafiee told MPs: “The allegations [of sexual abuse] that you have noted, which we all care about and we are all concerned about, do not, on the whole, involve independent schools that we inspect.” Ofsted inspects around 1,100 independent schools that are not covered by ISI. Shafiee also told MPs: “We stand ready to support the government in any way we can to strengthen safeguarding across the independent school sector.” The DfE said “Ofsted continued to support the monitoring of ISI as required,” under the directions issued in 2019. The DfE also said that if a school was reported to have safeguarding failings, “we will immediately ask Ofsted or the Independent Schools Inspectorate to conduct an inspection”. Meanwhile, a new survey of young women aged between 14 and 21 found more than half had suffered sexual harassment while at school, college or university. The poll by Plan International UK, the children’s rights charity, found 58% of those who took part in the survey said they had been publicly sexually harassed in their learning environment and of those, 66% were targeted by someone from the same institution. One in five said they had been on the receiving end of unwanted sexual comments, more than a quarter had been catcalled or wolf-whistled, one in 10 had been grabbed, and similar proportions had been followed, groped or touched sexually while in a public place. Fourteen interviewees said they had been “upskirted” using a mobile phone or camera to take illicit images. Rose Caldwell, the head of of Plan International UK, said: “School, college and university should be a safe space for girls to learn. Instead, just like in high streets, parks and bus stops, they are facing relentless harassment every day and they want it to stop. It is vital that schools recognise and tackle this if we’re to end public sexual harassment in the UK.”",education
"Nearly 200,000 more children were registered for free school meals in England as the early economic fallout from the pandemic hit household incomes, figures published by the government show. In the 10 months between January and October last year, the proportion of children on free school meals in England shot up from 17% to nearly 20%, meaning that 1.63 million out of 8.2 million state school pupils are now in receipt of free lunches. In January 2020 the total was 1.44 million.The highest rates were in the north-east, where more than 26% were eligible, and 23% in the West Midlands. In contrast, only 15% of pupils in the south-east of England were eligible. Some of the worst-hit areas included Wolverhampton, where the proportion of pupils on FSM went up from 27% to 32%, Blackpool, where the proportion rose from 32% to 37%, and Manchester, where it rose from 31.5% to 36%. In Birmingham, the country’s largest local authority, the proportion rose to 33% – one in three state school pupils. While 37% of all pupils in Knowsley, Merseyside were on free school meals, Wokingham in leafy Berkshire had just 8% of pupils on FSM, and a fraction under 10% of pupils in Windsor and Maidenhead were registered. More than 300,000 pupils now able to have free school meals became eligible after 23 March 2020, when the first national lockdown was announced. The total number is expected to increase when the results for the January 2021 school census are published. Children in state-funded schools are entitled to free school meals if the parent or carer they live with is on benefits, including income support, or receiving universal credit with household income of less than £7,400 a year. Campaigners believe the figures do not reflect the scale of food insecurity, and there are hundreds of thousands of children in families who struggle to afford to put food on the table who are not eligible for free school meals. The Food Foundation thinktank estimates 2.3 million children experienced food insecurity over the past six months. Labour said the rise in eligibility for school meals showed how devastating the pandemic had been for family budgets. Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children and early years, said: “Four in five schools were using the national free school meal voucher scheme at the start of the month. Yet ministers are scrapping this in favour of a scheme that will provide food support for just four days over Easter and create a postcode lottery in provision. “The government should be guaranteeing free school meals support to all who need it including through cash payments, rather than allowing children to go hungry over another school holiday.  The footballer Marcus Rashford wrote to the government in January calling for a review of school meals policy, and urging eligibility rules to be changed to allow 1.5 million extra children whose parents are on universal credit to get free school dinners, in line with the recommendations of Henry Dimbleby’s national food strategy. Stephanie Slater of the charity School Food Matters, which ran a Breakfast Box food aid programme in south London throughout the pandemic, said: “One in four of the families we have supported are not eligible for free schools meals so we wholeheartedly support the recommendations from the national food strategy to expand entitlement to free school meals.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “It was always likely that more pupils would become eligible for free school meals during the pandemic. That’s why we have ensured that throughout this period, schools have continued to accept applications for free school meals, providing meals to anyone who becomes newly eligible, including while pupils were learning remotely. “We have also committed to extending the breakfast clubs programme for disadvantaged pupils over the next two years. Outside term-time, we have expanded our holiday activities and food programme to every local authority across the country this year, and the Covid winter grant scheme has also been extended over Easter, to further support vulnerable families.” Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Boris Johnson has persistently failed to deliver for the young people in poverty whose families need real support and action. The experience of the last year has shown just how vital this is to children’s education. Today’s figures are truly shocking and confirm the experience of NEU members.”",education
"My mother, Joan Fratter, who has died aged 77, was a pioneering social worker and, in retirement, a tireless champion of environmental, ethical and social justice causes. Born in Chingford, Essex, she was the daughter of Lillian (nee Coulson) and Albert Lotts. Along with her twin sister, Joyce, she was born during the height of the second world war to hardworking parents who ran a business supplying electrical parts to help the war effort. She attended Walthamstow girls’ grammar school, then studied English and Latin at the University of Reading, where she met David Fratter. They married in 1964 and moved to Liverpool, where they had two children, Paul and me. Joan studied to become a social worker focusing on fostering and adoption. Separating from David in 1973, she juggled a passion and dedication for her work with the challenges of raising two young children as a single parent. She began what would become a lifelong pattern of affecting positive change when she successfully argued for extended visiting hours for parents of hospitalised children when I was admitted as a two-year-old to Alder Hey children’s hospital. In 1978 Joan and her children moved back to Chingford. She continued fostering and adoption work with the children’s charity Barnardo’s, pioneering many changes in policy and practice. Recognising a lack of diversity both in the families applying to foster or adopt and in the social workers helping to match families with children, she actively sought to recruit workers and families from ethnic groups that aligned with the ethnicities of the children waiting for placement, appreciating and celebrating the importance of ethnic identity. In the early 1990s, Joan resumed the research she began in 1985 into open adoption. One of the earliest proponents of open placement, where the birth and adoptive families remain in contact, she completed her PhD in 1992. Never shying away from a challenge, Joan helped to launch Barnardo’s Positive Options, providing services for families affected by HIV/Aids. Compassionate and uncomplaining, she tackled the harrowing work of future planning for children whose parents had what was then a terminal illness and created memory books and boxes capturing details of their family origins, traditions and beliefs. After retiring at 67 she did not slow down, volunteering her time with adoption panels, conservation groups and NHS campaigns as well as enjoying the theatre, museums, her allotment and time with her grandchildren. She was a devoted grandmother, parent and friend, and whether marching to save bees, caring for a friend in need or baking for her neighbours she always had a warm smile and open heart. Joan is survived by Paul and me, her grandchildren, Avery, Isabel, Dominic, Lauren and Melissa, and her siblings, Joyce and Alan.",education
"Schools in England are to receive extra funding to open their sports facilities outside school hours in light of mounting concern over lack of provision for young people during lockdown. On Friday morning, the Department of Education announced that £10m to “encourage pupils to be more physically active” would be included as part of a £1bn programme of school building. The funding will be distributed by Sport England through its Active Partnerships county-level networks, which will work with local schools to identify those most in need. The government provides £320m to primary schools for sporting provision under its “PE premium”, a figure that was only confirmed for the current school year last July. The £10m is additional to that sum but will not only be expected to help disadvantaged pupils but increase accessibility to sports for disabled children and improve facilities, including swimming pools. On Thursday, the Guardian reported concerns over a lack of opportunities for children in the forthcoming half-term and an ongoing shortage of guidance on how schools – and associated providers in the leisure sector – could offer sport and exercise opportunities safely once lockdown measures are eased. Alison Oliver, the chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, welcomed the announcement but called for a “national guarantee” on after-school sport. “It is really encouraging that this school capital investment will include funding to help improve young people’s access to sport,” she said. “We particularly welcome the opportunity for schools to invest in equipment to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. “The additional support to open up school sport facilities outside the school day is a welcome step towards what should become a national guarantee of after-school sport for every child. It is absolutely right that areas of deprivation and where levels of physical activity are lowest should be prioritised. “To truly help a generation in need of our support, we believe there needs to be a long-term national plan to tackle inactivity and recover young people’s wellbeing.” Oliver’s sentiments were echoed by the leisure industry body UK Active. Its director of children and young people, Jack Shakespeare, said: “We know that 39% of community sports facilities are locked behind school gates over the holidays, while children are losing up to 74% of their cardio-respiratory fitness over the summer holiday period. “Opening up school gates can reshape school holiday experiences for those children and young people that really need it. It is vital that progress on this initiative from the government builds on the lessons learned from our members and partners that are already activating school facilities and engaging their local communities year-round.”",education
"A fifth of all nursery and early years staff are considering leaving the sector amid warnings that many childcare workers are struggling to deal with the stresses placed on them by the pandemic. In addition more than a third of workers say they do not feel able to cope with additional pressures, while around 10% said they had taken time off because of stress linked to the Covid crisis. A comprehensive online survey carried out between December 2020 and January 2021 by the Early Years Alliance had nearly 3,800 responses from childminders and those working in nurseries and pre-schools in England. Unlike schools, nurseries have remained open under the current lockdown. Nursery owners and staff said the sector, already affected by low pay and financial peril before the pandemic hit, had been largely forgotten in the country’s Covid response. One respondent said: “I feel workers have been put at increased risk during the pandemic with little support and acknowledgment of [our] feelings and welfare. My intention is to look for another form of employment and leave the sector.” Another said: “I have always loved my job, but I’m about to resign this week as I don’t feel safe at work. It’s causing terrible stress and anxiety, and arguments at home.”While 72% of those replying to the survey said they had experienced fatigue and tiredness related to the impact of the pandemic on their early years role over the past six months, 70% had experienced anxiety and 59% had experienced insomnia. Workers have complained of having to travel long distances on public transport to keep working, while some childcare settings say they have set up their own regular testing regime in-house to reassure staff and parents. The Early Years Alliance said stress had been caused by the need to keep up with the latest government guidance on Covid, ensuring the safety of children and staff and ongoing concerns about financial viability.  “This is a sector at breaking point,” said Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance. “Those working in nurseries, pre-schools and childminding settings have been asked to put their own safety – and that of their loved ones – at risk with little support and even less recognition, so it is no surprise that this has taken such a toll on their mental health and wellbeing. “Those in government should take a moment to reflect on how it feels to listen to ministers tell everyone how vital it is to stay at home, and to watch as hospitalisation and death rates continue to rise, and then to be asked to keep working in a close-contact environment with no PPE support, no testing and no vaccinations. Is it any wonder that such a significant proportion of the early years workforce are considering simply walking away?” Many children have left early years care since March and not returned. There are already signs that closures have had an impact on child development. Research has suggested that the number of children starting school without basic skills such as going to the toilet unaided, putting on a coat or responding to questions is at record levels. Meanwhile, Ofsted research has highlighted lapses in children’s personal, social and emotional development. The lower attendance has heaped further financial pressure on a sector that was already under stress. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said early years workers were being prioritised for asymptomatic testing. “We know early years professionals are working hard to deliver crucial care and education to our youngest children, which cannot be done remotely, and we are working closely with the sector to ensure timely guidance and support. Current evidence suggests that children under the age of 5 are less susceptible to infection and are unlikely to be playing a driving role in transmission. “We are funding nurseries as usual and where nurseries do see a drop in income from either parent-paid fees or income from DfE, they are able to use the furlough scheme.”",education
"My father, Graham Salmon, who has died aged 88, was a warm-hearted and genuine man with a gentle sense of humour. In 1962, with his wife, Brenda, he founded the Old Rectory in Fittleworth, West Sussex, initially as a place where youth groups from inner London could come for weekends. This widened to include other organisations, and then over the years into a thriving adult education college. Run as a family business, it was unusual in being privately owned. Courses ranged across a wide spectrum from painting and crafts to natural history and birdwatching and Graham often led walking groups across the South Downs. That many guests were retired, sometimes into their 90s, left me with an enduring legacy that learning can be lifelong. Graham was born in Addiscombe, south London, the third of four children of Gertrude (nee Thorpe) and Reginald Salmon. His father was a senior engineer at Creeds, the manufacturer of teleprinter and Typex machines in Croydon. The family, with Baptist and Methodist missionaries among the wider family, often hosted foreign visitors, and, in his teens, Graham was involved in the Crusader Movement and went every summer to Benllech Boys’ Camp in Anglesey. Graham’s Christian faith was lived out in his approach to life, a key part of which was a genuine openness and acceptance for people from all backgrounds. He attended Caterham school, then gained a degree in electronic engineering at Imperial College London, and did national service as an electronic sub lieutenant in the Royal Navy, an experience he seems to have enjoyed, though it was not necessarily a natural fit for his character. Once, while on manoeuvres and in charge of communication with the engine room, he had to be reminded that “not wanting to bother the engineers too often” might well result in a collision. In 1956 Graham joined Ferranti in Bracknell, as an electronic engineer in early computer development. He and my mother were cousins, and their courting was often done on family holidays in Sussex. They married in 1956 and moved to Ascot, Berkshire, renovating an old stable block as our first family home. After the move to Sussex, and as the Old Rectory business grew, he gave up engineering to devote himself to it full-time. Graham’s concern for humanity and the environment led him to get involved in many local projects, from activities to raise awareness of and reduce poverty to setting up an early recycling scheme in Fittleworth in the 1970s. Retirement to Cornwall in 1994 enabled him to develop his childhood interest in astronomy unhindered by urban light pollution. He set up a telescope at the top of the house, created a slide-away roof and developed automatic systems for clear sky detection and night-time photography. Studying variable stars, he became an “observer”, contributing to international research. When my parents moved to Gloucestershire in 2010, where dark skies were limited, he joined a group of astronomers studying meteors. After a back injury in 2015, he developed hydrocephalus, which affected his mobility and speech. He nonetheless retained his good nature and humour and continued to enjoy the company of his family. Graham is survived by Brenda, his six children, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren (with another expected soon).",education
"Daniel SamuelsSchool leavers apprenticeship with Ernst & Young You know when they say: ‘It’s not rocket science?’ Well I was studying rocket science quite literally, at the University of Manchester, when the pandemic started. As a first-year I was living in halls back in March and suddenly we were given two weeks to get our stuff and get out. I wasn’t really enjoying university, and the pandemic put things into perspective: life’s too short! Then, this August, I realised I can’t go back to university – paying £9,000 a year for Zoom calls is mad. I decided to look into doing a school leaver apprenticeship with Ernst & Young, a company I’ve always aimed to work for. As a uni graduate I might not have stood out to them, but as a year 13 graduate I stand out. I was involved in loads of extra curricular projects and my CV looks strong. I’m interested in trading and cryptocurrency so I spoke about that in my interview with EY. The manager interviewing me asked where I see myself in the future and I told her: EY board of directors. I’m going straight to the top. Samuel FoxwellLevel 3 apprenticeship with Pinnacle Housing Association I was going to Middlesex University to do a business course, but then I thought: “Is this what I really want to be doing?” University is not the same this year as people are just locked in their rooms. With an apprenticeship I’d be getting paid and learning workplace skills at the same time, so it seemed like the way to go. Now I’m actually working in housing, I have customer service skills that I can take into future jobs. I’m training to become an income officer, helping people manage their rent and I’m on the phone all day, it’s great. I’m starting my CIH (Chartered Institute of Housing) qualification next year. It’s an 18-month course that I’ll get one day a week off my job to complete. Our office is only allowed eight people in at any time – but they accommodated me every day when I first started so I was in the office five days a week, with the support I needed. They’ve been brilliant, to be honest, giving me everything that I needed. I couldn’t have made a better decision. I can see the future and I’m working towards something, so it’s all good. Yasin UsmanDegree apprenticeship in digital and technology solutions with Vodaphone I confirmed a place at Queen Mary University of London to be close to my family during Covid-19. Grades are crucial to getting into uni, so when I heard that the A-level exams were cancelled I started looking into degree apprenticeships, which seemed like a great option. I decided to go into IT because there are lots of jobs in the field. My apprenticeship is run by Blackpool & Fylde College and accredited by Lancaster University, so I’ll graduate from there. I’ve been working from home since I started, which has been great, as it cuts out the commute and I can use the hours productively. I am missing the human interaction – however, many of my colleagues are all over Europe, so we’d be working online even if I was in the office. I work in a team called Network as a Platform within network architecture, focusing on new technologies, so the experience I’ll gain from this role will be invaluable. Megan LightfootDegree apprenticeship in quantity surveying with Tom Willowby Ltd. I’d originally planned to go to Northumbria Uni, where I’d applied for a quantity surveying degree, but when I heard that A-level grades would be based on mocks I thought I should have a back-up plan. I started to look into apprenticeships and I found one at Tom Willowby Ltd. They hadn’t advertised when I applied, I just emailed them on the off chance and they offered me an interview. I thought it would be a lot more valuable than going to uni, especially at this current time. I don’t think I would have enjoyed university this year. My friends at uni say it’s hard doing courses online, while I can work in the office or on site, as construction is a key-worker industry. I’m starting my degree apprenticeship next September, but until then the company has taken me on in an admin role. It’ll take me five years to finish the course, but I have no regrets; I’ll have a job and a degree, so it’s the best of both worlds.",education
"One of Britain’s most prestigious universities is being formally investigated by the universities watchdog as result of the controversy over bullying of staff by two leaders of the institution. Two of Imperial College London’s most senior executives, its president, Alice Gast, and its chief financial officer, Muir Sanderson, have admitted they bullied colleagues, as the university bowed to pressure in December and published parts of a report into the scandal. The investigation is only the second to have been launched into a university by the Office for Students (OfS), which has powers to scrutinise whether members of senior university management meet a test for being “fit and proper” to exercise their roles. Gast and Sanderson have remained in their posts despite coming under continuing pressure from staff, students and others. A motion of no confidence in both was passed last month by members of the University and College Union (UCU), which represents academic staff. “Those of us who think this has gone on far too long and that they should have stood down when it was the decent thing to do are very hopeful about this OfS intervention,” the Guardian was told by a source close to one of the whistleblowers whose original allegations of bullying led to a lawyer being brought in to investigate. “It’s clearly very serous for an institution as prestigious as Imperial to have this hanging over it and we think that all aspects should now be looked at.” A spokesperson for the OfS confirmed an investigation was ongoing. “We are looking into regulatory matters relating to Imperial College. While this work continues, it would be inappropriate to comment further,” they said. Members of Imperial’s governing council, who are expected to meet again as early as Monday, are understood to be divided on how to proceed and have been discussing whether to issue a statement in relation to Gast and Sanderson. The university blamed a “clerical error” after the Guardian reported in December that its longstanding policy on bullying was altered days before staff were told of a completed investigation into bullying allegations against the president and CFO. Gast, Sanderson and other senior figures were to undergo bullying and harassment training in line with the recommendations of a review conducted last year by Jane McNeill QC, who was called in to investigate. “I am very sorry that I bullied someone,” Gast, Imperial’s self-described “CEO”, said in December, while Sanderson said he had bullied two colleagues. The report by McNeill – who was called in by the chair of Imperial’s governing council, the Tesco non-executive chairman, John Allan – led to a disciplinary hearing for both Gast and Sanderson. McNeill found Gast had bullied one senior colleague while Sanderson was found to have bullied two colleagues between late February and mid-March. The OfS, which was established in 2018 and comes under the auspices of the Department for Education, has previously investigated De Montfort University. Its then vice-chancellor, Dominic Shellard, resigned in 2019 in advance of the investigation, which went on to identify “significant and systemic” failings in governance. A spokesperson for Imperial College London said: “We fully support OfS undertaking this investigation and have provided all relevant information as requested. We are confident in our process and its outcomes and we await the OfS findings.”",education
"The government is to appoint a “free-speech champion” and warn heritage bodies against taking significant steps in reevaluating British history, as part of an intensification of its culture war agenda.  In a sign that ministers believe that a battle against “woke” culture plays well with voters, the Department for Education will appoint a “free-speech champion” for higher education, with changes to the law to guarantee the preservation of free speech in universities. Government sources confirmed the plan, first detailed in the Sunday Telegraph, which will see the new post based within the Office for Students, the regulator which represents students’ interests. Due to be announced next week, the role will involve powers to fine universities or student unions that wrongly restrict free speech, and order action if people are sacked or otherwise disciplined for their views. A Department for Education source told the Telegraph that “unacceptable silencing and censoring on campuses is having a chilling effect”. While there has been much media reporting on people with rightwing views being barred from speaking on campuses, and about academics being made uncomfortable for holding conservative views, there is little evidence this is a significant problem. A 2018 report by the parliamentary human rights committee found that while some worrying examples could be cited, “we did not find the wholesale censorship of debate in universities which media coverage has suggested”. The cross-party group noted that student groups were not obliged to invite particular speakers, or to never cancel previously planned events, and that speakers were free to decide they did not want to share a platform with others. “None of these is an interference on free speech rights.” The government’s initiative around heritage bodies, also first briefed to the Sunday Telegraph, comes from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and marks another front in the government’s pushback against the Black Lives Matter movement, and the subsequent reevaluation of the UK’s colonial history – especially slavery – and statues and monuments that celebrate it. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is to lead a roundtable discussion with two dozen heritage and culture bodies, including the National Trust, Historic England, the British Museum and other museums and galleries to discuss the issue. According to the Telegraph, Dowden has sent the institutions a letter saying countries should not “run from or airbrush the history upon which they are founded”. A source from his department told the paper Dowden was trying to “defend our culture and history from the noisy minority of activists constantly trying to do Britain down”. DCMS sources say the meeting, to take place on 22 February, will be less confrontational, and is intended as a forum to discuss controversial heritage issues and talk about the government’s ambition to “retain and explain” statues with chequered histories. Ministers have been reportedly angered by projects such as the National Trust’s Colonial Countryside scheme, a children’s education project looking at how some historic properties are connected to empire and slavery. However, there is as yet little evidence of a mass move to remove statues or monuments. In June last year, amid a wave of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis, a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down by protesters and thrown in Bristol harbour. It was later retrieved, and four people will face trial for alleged criminal damage. Other debates over removing statues, such as that of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes from Oxford University’s Oriel College, have predominantly been about monuments in the hands of private institutions or councils, rather than cultural institutions.",education
"Pubs may not open until April, nightclubs until June, but for millions of frazzled parents across England, Monday will be the most eagerly awaited landmark on the long road back to normal life, when schools reopen their doors to all pupils. However, for Boris Johnson it will be the start of an anxious few weeks as the government’s health experts monitor the impact of the “big bang” reopening on Covid infection rates. In an open letter in January, the prime minister declared himself “in awe” of parents juggling home schooling with jobs and household chores. That is why No 10 made a deliberate decision to put the return to school at the top of the list of priorities for reopening, amid intense pressure from Tory backbenchers concerned about the impact on children’s education and wellbeing, as well as parents’ ability to work. Johnson rejected calls from ministers including the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to send pupils back after the February half-term and instead set the date of 8 March – three weeks after the top four priority groups had received their first vaccine dose. The speed and scale of the inoculations – more than 20 million people have had their first jab so far – has given ministers more political wriggle room than they might have hoped for. And during the extra fortnight of Zoom lessons around the kitchen table the number of new cases dropped further – there were 6,573 new case on Thursday, fewer than half the number two weeks ago.  But some experts are still wary about the “big bang” reopening, and government insiders remain acutely conscious that the return to school will mean a big change in the number of social connections made by many households. “We feel like we’re definitely confident on going ahead: infections are now at a lower rate and we’ve vaccinated a lot more people – but of course we acknowledge that there’s likely to be some impact on cases: our challenge is to manage that,” said a No 10 source. At its 11 February meeting, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) reaffirmed its expectation that schools reopening would increase the reproduction number of the disease, known as R, by 10%-50% – not just because of children mixing, but parents meeting at the school gates. The Department for Education hopes that the regular testing of teachers, school support staff and secondary school pupils, as well as the availability of at-home kits for the parents of school-age children, will help to reduce the risk of large-scale outbreaks by identifying asymptomatic cases. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is also more confident that with the virus less prevalent it will be easier to track and control fresh outbreaks, in a way that became all but impossible as the second wave took hold in the winter. “We have very, very detailed, quite granular levels of data – and because the prevalence is lower, there is less noise,” said a Department of Health and Social Care source. Labour has also backed the wider reopening. “We have always said that the best place for children to be is in schools: best for their learning and best for their social and emotional wellbeing,” said the shadow education secretary, Kate Green. But she said she would still like to see more support given to schools to make the changes necessary to create a Covid-safe environment, such as testing, spacing pupils out and improving ventilation. “Teachers and heads are still saying the government are not being forthcoming with help,” she said, reiterating Labour’s call for “Nightingale classrooms” to allow children to be taught safely without crowding. Unions representing teachers and other education staff issued a joint statement on Friday urging the government to review the impact of reopening over the Easter break. “The timing of the current reopening offers an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the early data findings during the Easter holidays and to act on this decisively if there are any indications of a spike in infections in any part of the country,” they said. Johnson has promised to wait five weeks before proceeding to the next stage of his roadmap – four weeks to review the data, plus a week’s notice to announce any changes to the plan. The Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the education select committee, has been among the backbenchers pressing Johnson to open schools as soon as possible. “I’m very happy that the kids are going back,” he said. His main concern is that the testing regime is made to work properly – and that the thinking behind new guidance on mask-wearing in secondary schools is made clear to parents and students. “I think the mask policy has got to be clarified,” he said. “I think what parents want is an open letter from the chief medical officer, saying why he thinks masks are necessary in the classroom, and how long they’re going to be needed.” He warned of “mask anarchy” if the policy was not made clear. Williamson, widely tipped for the chop in a summer reshuffle, has been visiting schools this week highlighting the intensive preparations taking place, and the apparent enthusiasm of teachers to welcome their pupils back. If the return goes without a hitch, the political credit will be banked not by Williamson but by Johnson, already basking in the glow of the successful vaccine deployment, which helped him extend his lead over Labour to 13 points in a YouGov opinion poll this week. But every step in the roadmap is an epidemiological gamble – and this one is the riskiest of all.",education

"Teaching assistants have emerged as the “unsung heroes” of the pandemic with more than half stepping up to take classes in schools during lockdown while teachers delivered remote learning to children at home, a study shows. Researchers at UCL Institute for Education found nearly nine out of 10 (88%) TAs supported vulnerable and key worker children in school during lockdown, with 51% managing a whole class or bubble on their own, as teachers prepared and delivered remote lessons, often from home. The report, published this week, is based on analysis of data from more than 9,000 teaching and classroom assistants in schools across the UK and shows for the first time the pivotal role they played in keeping schools open and children learning amid the disruption caused by Covid. Almost half (49%) covered staff absences, enabling schools to stay open to vulnerable and key worker children, leading some to observe that the “lowest-paid TAs are in school doing the dangerous face-to-face work”. Those working in early years and special schools, who were in close contact with children without personal protective equipment, felt particularly vulnerable. As one TA put it: “We have put our lives at risk more than any school staff during the pandemic.” TAs are among the lowest paid workers in the UK, with a median income of less than £14,000. As well as managing larger groups on school premises, the UCL survey said TAs were vital in helping children to carry on learning at home, providing targeted support and picking up on the needs of individual children. “TAs have been absolutely key in allowing schools to keep functioning during the pandemic,” said Dr Rob Webster, one of the authors of the report which was funded by Unison. “Our report highlights that in many ways teaching assistants have been the ‘unsung heroes’ of the pandemic and it is hard to see how schools could have managed without them. Some respondents described themselves as working ‘on the frontline’ and shouldering much of the responsibility for keeping schools open.” Nearly one in four TAs said they had taken on new responsibilities without any additional training and 44% said they had picked up new digital skills during the pandemic. “They really have gone above and beyond,” said Jill Roseblade, executive headteacher of Alver Valley nursery, infant and junior schools in Gosport, Hampshire. Another of the report’s authors, Prof Gemma Moss said the work required to keep schools functioning had intensified during the winter 2021 lockdown as a result of a new legal requirement to supply remote education to all children learning at home. There were also far greater numbers of pupils in schools in England than during previous lockdowns, after the government extended the list of parents who qualified as critical or key workers. “This increased workload for teachers and TAs who had to find ways of managing children in school and providing lesson content for those at home and our findings suggest this may have led to increased anxiety as TAs juggled many different tasks.” Unison head of education Jon Richards said: “Teaching and classroom assistants were crucial to the smooth running of schools before the pandemic. Schools have relied upon them even more so this past year. This research proves that. “However, staffing ratios have been increasing and many higher-level posts cut. This has piled the pressure on, and increased the workload of poorly paid lower grade employees, who are frequently asked to cover work they’re not trained to do. “Teaching and classroom assistants have a vital role in helping pupils catch up on their lost learning post-pandemic. But to do this they need proper training and a decent wage.” The Department for Education has been approached for comment. ",education
"The switch to remote learning during lockdown left teachers on the receiving end of verbal abuse and “parent bombing” as well as taunts on social media, with little support or training to deal with the issue, a teaching union conference heard. While teachers said they still faced physical threats in the classroom, the NASUWT annual conference heard that the prolonged period of online teaching had brought a new dimension to pupil behaviour – and reports of parents intervening to berate school staff. Patrick Roach, the union’s general secretary, said some parents thought they could intervene during live online lessons – which he described as “parent bombing” – to comment on what was being taught, and urged schools to take a tough line to stop the behaviour. “Schools need to be absolutely clear about the kind of behaviour expectations that they have both for pupils, and also for parents,” Roach said. “One of the things that concerns us is, we’ve had members who’ve reported, for example, abusive ‘parent bombing’ during online lessons, and they’ve been told: ‘You’re just going to have to work your way through it, you’re just going to have to get on with it.’ “Well, frankly, that’s not good enough. You know if a parent were to arrive onsite in a school and was to be verbally or physically abusing a member of staff, schools have powers and there is a duty on schools in relation to health, safety, and welfare in terms of their duty of care.” More than a quarter of members who responded to an NASUWT appeal said they had been criticised by their pupils’ parents or carers over the last year, including by parents intervening during online lessons. Nearly a fifth said they had been subjected to verbal abuse from parents in the same period. While the majority of parents were supportive of teachers and remote learning during lockdown, when schools were closed to most pupils, Roach said: “There are some parents who feel that it’s their right to interfere.” Delegates to the NASUWT conference, being held virtually over Easter, voted overwhelmingly to back a motion supporting industrial action in cases where “serious pupil indiscipline or abuse” was going unchecked by individual schools and managers. “Why should a teacher, or a group of teachers, feel they can only feel safe at work, or make a difference in their workplace, by using grievance procedures, or having to resort to collective industrial action to stop the threats or aggression that occurs for some on a daily basis?” said Rosemary Carabine, an NASUWT executive member. Wendy Exton, also member of the union’s executive, told delegates that the behaviour directed at teachers included “not only vile language, but derogatory sexualised terms, threats to ourselves and our families, and indeed, violence itself”. One in four teachers told the union they had been subjected to verbal abuse from their pupils or students, while one in 10 said they had received threats of physical violence. But few said their school had dealt with the abuse satisfactorily, leading the union to call for improved training for school and college leaders. The conference also heard a prerecorded address from Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, who showered teachers with praise and promised more opportunities for professional development during his seven-minute-long video. “I want to thank you for the inspiring way you switched to remote learning. And I want to thank you for the huge lengths you have gone to, to keep everyone in your school and wider community safe,” Williamson said. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, also appeared at the conference and told members: “We have to recognise that schools and the professional skill of talented teachers alone cannot fully compensate for the deeply damaging harm done to children by the cruel and devastating effect of child poverty.”",education
"Parents and play experts are turning to crowdfunding to rebuild and maintain playgrounds as cash-strapped local authorities cut their budgets across England. Despite calls by child development experts for a “summer of play” for children as the pandemic ends, there is a funding crisis across all parts of the play sector – from park playgrounds to new spaces built by housing developers. In Coggeshall, Essex, Jemma Green and her neighbours got the idea for crowdfunding their playground from others. “It’s incredibly common now. We have got £110,000 and nearly all of that has come from fundraising. The parish council saved for two years to give us £30,000 – we are lucky they could do that. And we had £25,000 from Enovert, a local landfill company. But all our other grant applications were turned down – National Lottery, things like that. “It’s very expensive work. Our playground was over 30 years old and it was half-empty most of the time – but without this fundraising we just wouldn’t have been able to do anything.” The Association of Play Industries (API) has warned of a continued decline in the funding of park playgrounds. Using freedom of information requests it found that since 2014 347 playgrounds have been shut down across England. For those that survive, the API estimates there will be a decrease in spending of over £13m a year on average. Mark Hardy, who chairs the API, says: “The steady decline in funding started during austerity but what is worrying now is that in the last 18 months or so funding is not going back to normal. Play is not a statutory provision and local authorities have a lot of priorities.” He says that while larger “destination” playgrounds do sometimes still get funding, many local spaces are in effect abandoned. “Neighbourhood playgrounds are becoming rather sad things. We need doorstep play, particularly in deprived areas. “The issue is far more acute at parish council level. Unitary authorities or towns might have funding but it doesn’t reach the very local level. We lose pocket parks, swings, sandpits. And it’s not just capital. The big issue is often maintenance.” Another pressing issue in many communities is the need to update playgrounds that go unused because of what locals say are unappealing designs. Louise Whitley and Sarina da Silva made headlines two years ago when they spoke out against a segregated playground at the Baylis Old School development in south London. Now they are campaigning again, this time for funding for the play area built next to the social housing on the site. “The playground is poor quality. Nobody has used it much since the development was built. It’s always empty,” says Da Silva. “It has a very dirty flooring that you wouldn’t want a toddler on, and basic equipment that would not entertain any child for even a few minutes.” The original developers, Henley Homes, say the upkeep is now the responsibility of Guinness, which manages the social housing. Guinness says it is willing to help maintain the playground or support efforts by the community to fundraise for structural changes. But Whitley says the quality of play areas should be more of a priority when they are built.  “Developers are building huge amounts of housing and community space with it across the country. They build sites with promises of being family friendly but despite lovely artists’ impressions the reality after planning permission is given is very different. “We are left looking for ways to replace them with equipment children actually want to use.” Many of her local playspaces need help. Just across the road is the Lollard Street adventure playground, built in 1955 on the philosophy of risky play. On a sunny day as the Easter holidays start, director Adrian Voce is welcoming back children from nearby tower blocks after the long lockdown. There is a happy buzz in the air as children leap across the site on ropes and clamber up huge wooden structures. But this much-loved space is at risk of closing. “It’s pretty bleak. We have enough money left for a year, digging into reserves,” Voce says. “After that, if more money doesn’t start coming in, we will have to close. I’ve been turned down for seven grants in a row in the past few weeks, including the mayor of London’s Covid recovery fund. In all the years I’ve worked in play it’s never been this bad. “People think, ‘Oh play, that happens anywhere,’ but actually it’s about the space. Children need space where they aren’t in the way of cars or adults.” Some adventure play sites have turned to crowdfunding, but Voce says this isn’t always ideal. “What we really need is long-term investment for staff and maintenance.” Over lockdown people have used parks and local spaces more than ever. But the need for play investment comes at a time when parks are struggling for funds more widely. In parliament last month, the housing minister Luke Hall confirmed parks and green spaces received £16m between 2017 and 2019.  Anita Grant, head of the charity Play England, points out how little this is. “£16m over three years on 27,000 parks is £200 per park. The abysmal funding of parks right now means the degradation of the play areas will continue and get worse.” Grant manages adventure play spaces in Islington, north London, that have been promised 15 years of funding in what she says is an “amazing” commitment from the council. But she worries that in this atmosphere children are not going to be prioritised. “What children need and benefit from is often inconvenient to adults. It’s messy, noisy, they want to take risks, but even when there is money it goes on railings and pathways, not children and their play.”",education
"My mother, Trixie Chandler, who has died aged 93, was a psychiatric nurse who became a vicar’s wife and then, after our father’s untimely death, retrained to become a teacher. Born in Camberwell, south London, Trixie (born Beatrice) was the second of four children to May (nee White) and her husband, Alfred Kilsby, who were school caretakers. She was educated at St Saviour’s and St Olave’s grammar school, where she met her lifelong friend Joy Evans. When the two teenage girls were evacuated to Sussex during the second world war, Joy’s family were killed in a bomb raid in London, and Trixie supported Joy through that difficult time. After leaving school Trixie trained to be a psychiatric nurse, and then worked at the Maudsley psychiatric hospital in Camberwell. At her local church, St George’s in Camberwell, she met Ernest Chandler, an ordained priest, and they married in 1951. Thereafter Trixie fulfilled the role of a curate and vicar’s wife, first at St Wulfram’s Church in Grantham, Lincolnshire, then in 1955 at St Dunstan’s Church in Cheam, Surrey (where she ran the Young Wives’ group as well as looking after her two young daughters), and in 1958 at St Luke’s Church in Whyteleafe, Surrey, where she established a successful Mother’s Union. However, that part of her life came to an abrupt end in 1962 when Ernest died of a heart attack at the age of 38. Showing great strength of character, Trixie not only continued to look after her family but learned to drive, bought a house in Caterham, Surrey, and trained to become a teacher at Sydney Webb college in London, working first at a private school before moving to teach religious education at Purley grammar school for girls. She later became an education welfare officer for Surrey county council until her retirement in 1983, after which she spent three years travelling regularly to visit my sister, Ruth, in the US. In 1986 Trixie moved to Canterbury, where she volunteered at Kent and Canterbury hospital, working with the chaplaincy team. She also took a degree in arts and humanities with the Open University, and then another, in French, at the University of Kent. After that she joined the University of the Third Age and studied French, Latin, Hebrew, German, and the works of Charles Dickens. She began learning Italian in her 70s and was still going in her 80s. Trixie had supported her brother, David, throughout his life, and she joined him in her final years at the Methodist care home in Whitstable, Kent, where she did crosswords, played scrabble, played the piano and advised the chaplain on his Hebrew. She was a kind, loving, patient and calm person. Fiercely independent, she was always someone her family could go to for sympathy and support. She is survived by Ruth and me, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",education
"Every Monday, after a long day of college, Fardowsa Ahmed logged on to her computer to take a night class in GCSE biology. She was exhausted, but she needed the qualification to start her nursing degree in the autumn. In two hours, her teacher covered material that GCSE pupils spend four to five classes on, with no time for questions. Ahmed quickly found herself struggling to cope, but paying £25 an hour for private tutoring was out of the question. Then she found the Coronavirus Tutoring Initiative (CTI), a network of 4,000 university student volunteers across the UK who collectively have given up 35,000 hours of their time since the beginning of the pandemic to tutor 2,000 school pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds for free, despite experiencing their own anxieties over missed teaching, financial pressures and Covid outbreaks on campus. Ahmed was paired with Hasan al-Habib, who is completing his PhD in oncology at the University of Cambridge. Once a week, he logs on to the tutoring platform to teach biology to Ahmed, who before lockdown decamped to a cafe to escape her crowded household and poor wifi connection. “I’d heard on the news about the chaos students were facing with exams, which I know would have stressed me out a lot,” says Habib. “I thought: given how lucky you are to be here, you should probably do something for someone else who didn’t have the same opportunities. I go through Fardowsa’s presentations from her evening classes and I think they’re not easy to understand.” Ahmed says the one-to-one support has “really made a difference” to her understanding of the key concepts in biology. “He’s giving his time to me, that’s the amazing thing, and I need to use that wisely and get the grade I want.” The scheme is unconnected to the government’s national tutoring programme (NTP), which is aimed at helping pupils catch up with lost learning but has recently been criticised for employing underage tutors in Sri Lanka who are paid as little as £1.57 an hour. Instead, it is the brainchild of Jacob Kelly, a final year philosophy, politics and economics student at Oxford University, who launched a call for tutors on social media when the first lockdown began last March. “It struck me quickly when the government announced school closures that something needed to happen because there would be a lot of kids missing out on the face-to-face teaching they sorely needed, and we knew the attainment gap [between richer and poorer pupils] in the UK was pretty huge,” he says. Kelly thinks the demand from parents and pupils is evidence of just how much extra tuition is needed as a result of the pandemic. But he has been equally surprised by the enthusiasm of his fellow students: within 24 hours, 3,000 volunteers had signed up. He says their passion for their subjects has proven invaluable in preventing pupils drifting away from education over successive lockdowns. CTI teamed up with the international non-profit group Project Access for help with its infrastructure and funding, although it remains a grassroots organisation run by 60 volunteers who regularly work for up to 20 hours a week unpaid. Kelly has since stepped away to focus on his finals and begin a graduate job with the charity Tutor the Nation, but the remaining team of volunteers plan for CTI to continue after the pandemic. Laura Prince, one of the organisers, says students have not lost their enthusiasm despite lockdown being eased. She received about 1,000 responses to a recent callout asking for tutors to spend five hours delivering subject-specific Q&As over Easter, when many have exams and dissertations to prepare. She attributes this to how visibly effective tutoring is. “I’ve seen how much it brought up the grades of students I was working with, we’re talking more difference than I really realised. But you associate tutoring with a level of privilege. By offering one-to-one tuition my perspective was we could do something to help pupils keep up and bridge that gap.” The student volunteers consider their sacrifices worth it – and many feel they have benefited equally. Alec Morley, a second year medicine student at Cambridge University, has been shielding since last March and has appreciated the opportunity for human connection. “I could see all my colleagues working on the frontline, friends volunteering to give vaccinations and I felt, what can I give back?” he says. “The thing that’s allowed me to do that is the CTI so I’m actually really thankful it was set up.”",education
"UK schools recorded more than 60,000 racist incidents in the past five years, the Guardian has found, as experts accused the government of failing to meet “basic safeguarding” measures by hiding the true scale of the problem. Freedom of information (FoI) requests sent to 201 councils and about a fifth of England’s multi-academy trusts uncovered a total of 60,177 racist incidents – a racist incident being defined as any situation perceived to be racist by the alleged victim or any other person, including unintentional racism. The true scale is thought to be far higher, because in 2012 the government advised schools that they had no legal duty to report racist incidents to local authorities. Further guidance issued in 2017 added that schools were not obliged to record any form of bullying. Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner for England, described the new figures as worrying. “They’re very high and given that there isn’t a requirement to report, it feels that this could be just the tip of the iceberg. The response [to racism] needs to be much more informed by data,” she said. Lady Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “Schools should be mandated to collect and monitor school bullying incidents and to specifically record incidents of prejudice-based bullying. This should also be reported to local authorities, so that these can target resources to areas [with] high rates of bullying.” Through FoIs 94 councils disclosed 31,653 racist incidents between 2016-17 and the current school year: 25,714 in England, 3,966 in Scotland and 1,966 in Wales. Two hundred and twenty-six multi-academy trusts in England disclosed 36,063 racist incidents over the same period, of which at least 28,524 were not reported to councils. For context, there are 1,199 multi-academy trusts and 1,419 single-academy trusts in England. One hundred and nine local education authorities in England and two councils in Wales said they no longer collate the data. These included the majority of the most ethnically diverse local authorities in the UK, such as Manchester, Bristol and all bar two London boroughs. School records usually contain details of these incidents – for example, whether it involved physical or verbal abuse; whether the alleged victims and perpetrators were pupils, teachers or other adults – along with any action taken, such as whether the matter was reported to the police or another agency. David Gillborn, a professor of critical race studies at the University of Birmingham, said: “If the evidence that we can get points to there being an epidemic of racism in schools and yet there is no reliable data at a national level, then the government can’t guarantee that they’re meeting basic safeguarding let alone producing a world-class education system. It suggests that the government’s attitude is, at best, one of ignorance and disinterest.” Of those councils that collate racist incidents, Hampshire disclosed the highest number, with 3,728 reported by local schools from 2016-17 to 2018-19, followed by Kent with 2,319 for the same period. Both councils have yet to collate figures for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic.  The multi-academy trust that disclosed the highest number of reported racist incidents – 1,657 over five years – was United Learning Trust, which operates 76 academies. Ormiston Academies Trust, which operates 40 schools, disclosed the second highest number: 1,138 over five years. Not all schools in each multi-academy trust reported racist incidents. For example, only 27 out of 58 schools in Academies Enterprise Trust did so in 2020-21. All the councils mentioned said the figures were high because they still encouraged schools to report the data. The trusts mentioned are among the largest in England. Politicians, academics and anti-racism campaigners said the findings showed the government should collate a nationwide picture. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “The lack of clarity from government about reporting [racist] incidents makes it harder to understand its prevalence and therefore tackle the issue. It’s important that the government sends a clear message by requiring all schools, regardless of their status, to report incidents to their local authority.” The situation is starkly different in Scotland, where the devolved government expects local authorities to monitor incidents of racist bullying in schools. A new system for recording all types of bullying has also led to significant rises in the number of racist incidents reported in recent years. For example, Edinburgh city council recorded 199 racist incidents in 2018-19 but after the introduction of the new procedures it recorded 245 incidents in just the first term of the current school year. John Swinney, the deputy first minister of Scotland and cabinet secretary for education and skills, said the reforms were intended to better gauge the prevalence of racism and other prejudice related-bullying in schools. He added: “If it really matters to you to eradicate this, you’ve got to know what the extent of your problem is.” Alison Dickie, a Scottish National party councillor and vice-convener of the education, children and families committee at Edinburgh council, said the rise in reports of racist incidents under the new system reflected that previously “underreporting was a major issue”. Dr Christine Callender, faculty lead for the BME Awarding Gap Project at University College London’s Institute of Education, said many schools were reluctant to record racist incidents. “What happens is schools will find ways of not acknowledging it as a racist incident. They say the child didn’t understand how that term might have been offensive, especially if they are young. But they know about it as young as three or four years old.” Councillor Hannah Clare, deputy leader of Brighton and Hove council and chair of the children, young people & skills committee, said it planned to train school staff to address the historic under-reporting of racist incidents. “There’s an element of bias in terms of reporting racist incidents,” she said. “Staff think that a racist incident is where a racial slur has been thrown at someone, but there can be incidents where there are undertones that mean it is still racist.” Roz Chadd, a councillor who is Hampshire county council’s executive member for education and skills, said its high figures reflected the fact it requested data from all local schools, including academies. She added: “Over the last three years we have had a 100% submission rate. The data is valuable for ensuring that we provide appropriate and effective support to our family of schools.” David Adams, Kent county council’s interim director of education, said it continued to urge schools to report racist incidents to the local authority so they could identify patterns in discriminatory behaviour and how they could be better addressed. A spokesperson for United Learning Trust said: “Unsurprisingly, given we are the largest MAT [multi-academy trust] in the country, our figures will be higher than others. The data alone is meaningless, however, without an understanding of how schools respond to incidents and how students and staff are treated when incidents are reported. “Our commitment as a trust to promoting diversity and to tackling discrimination wherever it occurs is sincere across all our schools.” A spokesperson for Ormiston Academies Trust said it unequivocally condemned racism. She added: “The number of racist incidents in our schools last year equated to an average of 0.007% per pupil. Fewer than one in six of these incidents warranted a short-term exclusion and none a permanent exclusion. However, we take any incident of this nature extremely seriously and will continue to do so.” A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “There is no legal requirement on schools to report racist incidents to their local authority but some schools and local authorities may have their own arrangements in place.”",education
"Female teachers as well as pupils are victims of a toxic culture of sexual abuse within schools, according to a teaching union leader who said harassment by boys is “the tip of the iceberg” of behaviour that some schools are failing to confront. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of NASUWT, said his members had made it clear that female teachers face patterns of abuse and harassment similar to those revealed by pupils and students in harrowing detail on the Everyone’s Invited website in recent weeks. “If there is a toxic culture in any school, it’s not just toxic for students, it’s toxic as well for teachers, for our members,” Roach said. He said schools’ tolerance of sexist harassment and abuse was likely to affect all women, whether staff or students, and leave them afraid of walking alone in corridors. “Misogyny and sexism is all too real, all too apparent, whether it’s on the streets and whether women can walk safely at night, or in our schools and whether female teachers and students can feel that they are safe to walk along the corridors without having to think about how they’re dressed, whether they’re walking alone and how they’re going to be treated by pupils, or indeed by colleagues and parents,” Roach said during the union’s annual conference. He said no women should feel unsafe inside a school, but such experiences were “part and parcel” of the casework his union had to deal with. Last week the Department for Education initiated a review to be carried out by Ofsted inspectors looking into how schools handle allegations of sexual abuse or harassment, after thousands of complaints aired on Everyone’s Invited of schools taking little or no action. Roach said that while he didn’t want to “demonise” boys, “there is definitely a situation in which some boys are engaging in practices which, frankly, are not acceptable. And it’s also the case that some schools, some employers, are not doing enough to counteract that” by tackling sexism and misogyny. “We are seeing, whether it’s so-called banter, sexist name-calling, the use of derogatory terms both in class and online to talk about your teachers, the posting of sexist comments on social media, the belittling of teachers because of their sex or gender,” Roach said. “We’re seeing this also with regards to our trans members – female trans members – who are particularly experiencing problems around discriminatory behaviour and unacceptable comments. Through to some of the extremes that we’ve pointed to before – cases of upskirting, down-blousing, inappropriate touching, and we fear that’s probably representing, to some degree, the tip of the iceberg. “So it is very concerning, and certainly we are committed to working with the government, with Ofsted, the NSPCC and with others to address those issues.” NASUWT members passed a motion at the conference deploring bullying aimed at teachers, and another backing industrial action in schools unwilling to tackle serious pupil indiscipline or abuse. In his speech, Roach listed what he called “a catalogue of government failures” and U-turns, including the chaos over last summer’s exams, inadequate funding and a “wanton disregard” for measures to keep staff safe working in schools during the pandemic. Roach also revealed that some school managers were refusing to give staff time off to receive their Covid vaccinations. The union said it had heard of so many teachers being denied leave that it had approached Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, for help. “I wish it was only a one-off but the number of times that’s come across my desk I cannot begin to tell you. It has been pretty widespread,” said Roach. He said teachers should not be coerced into working during the summer holidays as part of the government’s catch-up plans for pupils. “The term catch-up is not helpful. As if somehow the 850m days of learning that’s been lost to pupils in England is going to be made good as a result of two weeks in the summer holiday to catch up? That, frankly, is fanciful,” he said. “But what we do need to do is to assess the learning needs of pupils, and teachers need to be given the time and the support to be able to do that.”",education
"At last, Josiah Elleston-Burrell’s last day at school. It was 13 August 2020, a Thursday in the middle of a dismal pandemic-struck summer, and Elleston-Burrell had returned to St Joseph’s College in Croydon for one final visit, to collect his A-level grades. Tall and serene, well known on campus for wearing clothes of his own design, Elleston-Burrell had on a pale grey top that he’d customised with flecks of green and pink dye, his Nikes tactfully coordinated. At 19, he was one of the oldest pupils enrolled at St Joseph’s, such a veteran of this south London state school that younger kids sometimes swerved towards him in the corridors to reach out their fists in mute respect. Today, he took a shortcut into school, avoiding the crowds and walking up a service road that snaked between the chapel and a sports pitch. He was eager to be in and out quickly, the sooner to end a stalled career as a schoolboy and get under way on everything else – his uni years, job years, whatever life held next. It was an odd time for young people coming to the end of their secondary-school educations. Exams had been cancelled because of Covid-19. All across England, a new scheme of judging, grading and sorting 2020’s school leavers had been rigged up in replacement. Details of the scheme were opaque. All Elleston-Burrell knew was that he had to go to an upstairs corridor in the maths department to collect an envelope containing his grades. He hurried across the playground. After eight years, the campus was as familiar to him as any place on Earth; on just about every inch of the Clarks- and Kickers-scuffed floors was some echo or reminder of his halting coming of age. He passed a patch of yard where he’d once lined up as an 11-year-old newbie, a quick study when it came to the codes and fashions of his new school, its break-time blackjack, the BlackBerry flirting with girls met at bus stops (there being none at St Joseph’s till the sixth form). Elleston-Burrell was 12 or 13, he remembered, when he developed an eye for fashion, Windsor-knotting his burgundy tie and turning out for PE with one of his trouser legs rolled up, “to stand out, y’know?” He was 14 and spending a lot of time in the art block when he decided with all the casual abruptness of a young person sensing their own potential that he would become an architect one day. At 15, flourishing academically as well as artistically, his face was enlarged to the size of a bin lid and used in a poster ad for St Joseph’s. He still received messages from friends saying they’d seen him smiling on the sides of buses in Streatham or Tooting. Off the playground, Elleston-Burrell entered the maths department, clattering in through a fire door and climbing a musty stairwell towards the second floor. He was 17, he remembered, when he found out that his teachers reckoned him capable of high grades in his final exams – three As, they predicted, one each in art, Mandarin and maths. A top university in London, UCL, offered him a place to study architecture as long as he could finish school with at least three Bs. But when those final exams came, in summer 2019, Elleston-Burrell had a disaster, panicking over the phrasing of some of the questions. Though he was later diagnosed with dyslexia, which may have added to his confusion, it was too late to do anything about his grades that year. He got the expected A in art, but a disappointing B in Mandarin and a shattering U – an outright fail – in maths. His place at university went to somebody else in 2019. In this way, thoroughly and brutally, end-of-school exams have returned the supreme judgment on a young person’s education for at least a century. Exams are our attempt to sum up whole teenagehoods and render them as manageable labels – AAA, ACE, AAC. After the 2019 exams, Elleston-Burrell had been labelled ABU. He was certain he could still be AAA. And so, taking a breath, taking his smart St Joseph’s trousers back out of the cupboard come September, he had tried again – returning to the school he’d just left, repeating parts of his final year, coolly explaining to any younger pupils who drifted towards him, “I’m here. I’m back. I’m just redoing some exams.” Those exams never took place. Schools were shut in March 2020, the announcement made hours before Elleston-Burrell’s 19th birthday. It was a crappy gift, because he’d been flying through practice papers and was relishing the prospect of another shot at his maths and his Mandarin. Again, in 2020, he had an offer of a place at UCL. Again it was conditional on him getting at least three Bs. Elleston-Burrell presumed that whatever had been rigged up in replacement for 2020’s exams – people were talking about an algorithm – would see the specifics of his case, register his efforts and sacrifices, judge him as a capable young man and an architect-to-be. Now he hustled along the upstairs corridor and received his envelope from a school administrator. Ducking into a doorway for privacy, he tore at the seal. I first met Elleston-Burrell two years earlier, when he was 17. At the time I was researching a story about young men and masculinity, and he stood out a mile because he was the only boy to answer my questions about gender equality with a female perspective in mind. “I see my mum work extremely hard,” he told me. “I’ve got two younger sisters, I see what they go through … Personally? I feel if you work hard, if you’re deserving, there shouldn’t be a cap. Nothing should be limited.” Intuitively, he seemed to see through my personal questions to address a larger picture. “I live in Croydon,” he said at one point, laughing quietly, “so that probably says a lot to you.” Croydon was often in the news at the time because of rates in youth violence there. “I’m Black British. Christian. I paint. I draw. I’m into architecture. Just trying to succeed.” The bit about architecture turned out to be an understatement. Elleston-Burrell had completed an out-of-hours course for teenagers at UCL’s architecture school, and it had convinced him beyond a doubt that he had a calling in life. He knew exactly where he wanted to train, too. When he had his admissions interview at UCL in late 2018 he was nervous, but afterwards one of the tutors helped carry out his portfolio of artwork, and this was interpreted as a good omen. He could hardly bring himself to open the email from UCL’s admissions office when it came in May 2019. He was on the sofa at home. His mother, Rhianne, was there, too. “Mum? I bet it’s a no.” “Why are you being negative? Be positive.” “Mum? I got an offer.” “I told you. I told you.” We stayed in touch after that. I was curious what would happen to this ambitious, dead-set young man, and we met up several times in 2019, usually before he began a shift at the Waitrose supermarket where he worked. One day, just off the Croydon train, Elleston-Burrell confessed to a daydream: switching platforms instead and carrying on into London in the direction of UCL’s architecture building. He could see the backpack he would carry. His outfit. The dangling lanyard with his shiny undergraduate ID. On results day in August 2019 – “crunch time”, he had been calling it – he woke early, logged on to a special admissions page online, and learned about his great failure in maths. He recognised that the architecture dream was over, at least for a year, and his despair was so acute that, finally down for breakfast that morning, he couldn’t find the words to tell his mum. So he faked ignorance instead, going through the whole agonising performance of logging on and finding out another time. There would be intervals of speechless despair throughout the Groundhog Year that followed. Upbeat periods, too. Sometimes, when I met up with Elleston-Burrell, he was optimistic about his decision to put adulthood on hold to chase his dream. Other times, after he’d been with friends who were out in the world, off studying in party towns or already with full-time jobs and salaries, he second-guessed himself. In December 2019, he invited me to St Joseph’s, leading me on a tour of the campus he’d got to know so well since he was 11 years old. He pointed out the sites of general interest, like the exact spot in the canteen queue where younger students were most vulnerable to “olders” pushing in, or the big bins that people used to climb over direct from the car showroom next door whenever they were running late. He showed me a few more personal landmarks, too. The steel locker out of which he’d once had a beloved jacket stolen. The square of asphalt where he’d had his first-ever (and last-ever) fist fight. The staff meeting room where there was an enlarged photograph of him, aged 13, a model student with waves in his hair, smiling warmly at a textbook. Our tour ended in the art department – Elleston-Burrell’s most treasured place, he said. On the walls there were several of his paintings, including a portrait of his mum, and a self-portrait in which he had his eyes squeezed shut with pleasure as he ate a piece of mango. There was also a third painting, an obscure work in black and red that he had made in tribute to an older cousin called Miguel. When we turned through the pages of an accompanying sketchbook we came across a note that said: “During the course of this book my cousin was robbed and killed.” Elleston-Burrell rubbed his head. It had been hard, he said, hearing the news in the middle of a school term. He hadn’t wanted to do much after the funeral except sit and paint. Even so, he didn’t want to offer excuses for his poor showing in the 2019 exams. He was similarly loth to dwell on his dyslexia diagnosis. “Sit down, be humble” – that was his way. He had written it in his sketchbook along with other scribbled maxims and notes-to-self: “Build accurately”, “No success without failure”. In a bid to bring up his maths grade to at least a B, crucial to his goal of studying architecture at UCL, Elleston-Burrell had hired an expensive private tutor that year. Relatives and elders from his church were clubbing together to cover half the cost. He paid his share by taking on extra supermarket work. When exams were scrapped in March 2020, he was already on the hook for about a grand; so he put down his textbooks and accepted any overtime shifts he was offered, covering for colleagues too ill or anxious to attend during the pandemic’s first wave. This was a time when the public stood to attention on Thursday nights to applaud frontline workers. Vogue put a teenage Waitrose employee on its cover. There was a feeling in the air that young people Elleston-Burrell’s age, with looks and stories and postcodes similar to his, were not to be reflexively patronised or demonised, instead maybe celebrated. Maybe rewarded. Kids he knew were nervous about a government algorithm that would mysteriously decide everybody’s grades in lieu of exams, but Elleston-Burrell told himself not to worry. He reckoned he had done right by the world, in a difficult 2020, and he had reasonable hopes the world would do right by him. On the morning of 13 August, he woke early again, prayed, and told the mirror: “I’ll get into my uni today ’cos I worked for it.” He imagined this algorithm would pick him out as an A student, though he could live with Bs, as long as he still got on to his architecture course. When he got to school, and got upstairs, he opened his envelope and shook out a page of grades. He stared for a while and then he folded up the page. A for art, C for Mandarin, E for maths, the algorithm reckoned. It was not enough. Not even close. The algorithm was conceived 100 miles north-west of Croydon, at the Coventry headquarters of Ofqual, the English exam regulator. Ofqual is an organisation made up of politically neutral civil servants who are empowered, encouraged and often as not hobbled in their work by government ministers. Staff there, including the chief, a floppy-haired executive called Roger Taylor, were initially queasy about using an algorithm on such a grand scale. Could they really try to simulate make-or-break grades for students who’d been pulled out of school without warning, two-thirds through an academic year? At first Taylor suggested other choices, including some sort of certificate to replace traditional grades, but ministers in Boris Johnson’s government ignored the idea. The algorithm plan was announced by Johnson’s education minister, Gavin Williamson, on 18 March. Ofqual spent the next two months toying with possibilities. It came up with 11 candidate algorithms, labelled Approach-1 through Approach-11, ranged next to each other for consideration like prototype rockets. Approach-10 fell away first. Approach-3 had a genuine shot, as did Approach-1. These algorithms were intelligent guessers, the gist of their work familiar to racetrack patrons, as past form, judgment by eye and other looser assumptions were blended and sieved for insight. Approach-1 was reckoned the most accurate of the lot. By the end of May it had the nod. In order for Approach-1 to function, it needed to be fed data. Some of this data could be drawn from Ofqual’s own historical records – for instance, how well a school had performed in exams in previous years – and some data would have to be generated more speculatively. Teachers around the country were asked to predict what grades their students might have secured if exams had gone ahead. They were also asked to make lists that ranked students against each other by subject. The projected grades and rankings reached Ofqual in mid-June. Because most teachers were expected to be generous, and a minority to be Scroogier than the rest, a failsafe was built into Approach-1 that would adjust the incoming grades up or down based on historical precedent. For instance, did a school tend to get about 10 As in maths a year? And had its teachers projected 12 As for 2020? Well, Approach-1 might suggest, the school’s 10 highest-ranked students in maths could have their As. But students number 11 and 12 would find they were Bs. They might even find they were Cs, if their school by some historical quirk did not typically secure Bs. If this seems worrisome written down, it perhaps inspired more confidence when accompanied by reassuring graphs, hundreds of which were produced by Ofqual in its planning and testing phase: bell curves, spiky histograms, constellation-like scatter plots veined with blue and orange lines. Ofqual already employed statisticians and data scientists because, even in non-pandemic years, it used algorithms to regulate exam grades. Algorithms helped knock out regional inconsistencies. They helped flatten year-on-year inflation. In all sectors, in all parts of life, such problem-solving computer models steer important human matters, influencing what interest rates we’re offered, how long we’ll wait for hip surgery, when’s ideal for the next Justin Bieber album to drop. Before 2020, Ofqual’s algorithms did not draw much public curiosity, let alone criticism. In the summer of 2020, Approach-1 had the support of teaching unions. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, plotting with their own national exam regulators, had come up with roughly similar algorithms. By the middle of June, with two months to go until grades were due in students’ hands, all the necessary data was in. At Ofqual, Roger Taylor and his staff studied the grades the algorithm spat out. It seemed as if fairness was being maintained. The grades were not unduly high or low compared with other years. Considered broadly, students from disadvantaged backgrounds were on course to do slightly better in 2020 than they had in 2019. Approach-1 did create a small proportion of anomalous results, less than a quarter of 1%, which gave Ofqual pause. Bright students in historically low-achieving schools were tumbling, sometimes in great, cliff-edge drops of two or three grades, because of institutional records they had nothing to do with. As documents released by the organisation show, Ofqual discussed the problem but were unable to find a solution. (Roger Taylor did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story.) As late as 7 August, Ofqual was concerned enough about the anomalies to send a memo to Boris Johnson’s office, noting “the risks of disadvantage to outlier students”. The public was not informed of this risk and in fact, when Ofqual published a summary of its efforts the following week, to accompany the public release of the Approach-1 grades, Taylor struck a tough, even bolshie note: “Some students may think that, had they taken their exams, they would have achieved higher grades. We will never know.” Come the morning of 13 August, there were students, thousands, disinclined to leave the matter as vague as all that. The collapse of confidence in what Ofqual and the government had done was instant. At Southmoor Academy in Sunderland, vice-principal Sammy Wright moved between students who were trading pages of grades, stunned. “I tend to be quite positive about things,” said Wright, “but this was a shitshow. All the teachers I know were off-the-map angry, furious on behalf of the kids.” At Spires Academy in Oxford, not historically a high-performer in exams, teachers said they found it especially difficult to console the “outliers” in the school. Kate Clanchy, on the English staff, told me about her best student, projected to receive the highest possible grade, an A*, but knocked down by algorithm to a C. “She deeply believed she was rubbish,” said Clanchy. “We had tried all year to demonstrate to her she was not rubbish. Yet here was the system insisting: ‘We know what you are.’” There would be postmortem disagreements as to whether the algorithm helped or hindered students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Because of a limitation in Approach-1, niche subjects studied by smaller groups of students tended to be spared downward adjustment; and on the whole these subjects were more likely to be offered in private, fee-paying schools. While wealthier kids fared better in pockets, Ofqual continued to insist that poorer kids had done better overall. How much consolation this was to devastated individuals can probably be guessed. Exams rank. Exams sort. In any given year, they pull aside a large number of ambitious kids and bluntly check their ambitions. Exams are cruel like this, but for all the many ways in which they are unfair, they do allow for something useful, which is a sense of agency. You go in clutching your biro – and your fate – in hand. You sit down and maybe you ask one of the patrolling teachers for a folded piece of paper to correct the desk’s distracting wobble. You turn over your page, and now it’s all on you, shit, shit, shit … ! Taylor and Ofqual would quickly admit that Approach-1 contained an awesome flaw. It allowed for no real agency. It did not give individuals, in Taylor’s words, “the ability to affect their fate”. After March, when schools had been closed and exams cancelled, nothing was on the kids. They were hardly involved till they ripped open their envelopes. In the upstairs corridor at St Joseph’s, Elleston-Burrell put his page of grades in his pocket and thought, fleetingly, I won’t go to uni after all. I’ll be an artist. I’ll be a musician. For years, he hadn’t deviated from his plan to become an architect, though there were moments when he had felt frustrated at how much patience it was asking of him. He often thought about a time, about halfway through his school career, when a boy he knew walked out of the gates to pursue a longshot career in football – and the next time Elleston-Burrell saw that boy, he was back on a drive-by visit, contracted to a professional team, sitting behind the wheel of a Mercedes, most-way a man. Stuck as a schoolboy, Elleston-Burrell often did the sums, adding up the time until he graduated St Joseph’s, then the seven more years it would take to get through any architecture programme. Always he had stuck to the plan. Now, on his last day at school, and really for the first time in his life, he gave serious thought to abandoning architecture altogether. I’ll be a graphic designer, he thought. I’ll make clothes. That morning, three options existed for students like him who questioned their computer-generated grades. They could accept what they’d been given and move on. They could rush home and open their textbooks, to study up in their subjects before a series of prove-us-wrong exams that Ofqual had scheduled for autumn. (These exams would take place after universities were already full, which as Ofqual later acknowledged, rendered the option null for anybody who did not wish to sit out for a gap year.) Third option? Students could appeal, or try to. Elleston-Burrell took his page of grades to a teacher at St Joseph’s he trusted. “Miss? It doesn’t seem right.” He explained the situation. A year earlier, in the 2019 exams, he had got a B in Mandarin. In fact, there had been no need for him to retake the exam at all, except to challenge himself. After a year of additional study, more fluent not less, he had been awarded a C. And the maths grade broke his heart. “An E, miss? It’s one up from a fail. It’s like saying I sat down for an exam, wrote my name, did a couple of questions, and closed the book.” The teacher suggested he appeal, sending Elleston-Burrell back down the corridor to the maths department to ask what the next steps were. He passed a computer room full of shellshocked peers, already logging on to admissions pages to see about second-choice universities, third choices, openings they hadn’t considered before this morning. Universities around the country were starting to fill. Soon more than 400,000 places would be gone. When Elleston-Burrell got to the maths department he was met by teachers who were flustered and uncertain about the appeals process. “We don’t know what the government’s saying yet,” Elleston-Burrell was told. He tried not to panic. He wanted to make an appeal before his spot on UCL’s architecture programme went to someone else – again. But nobody, not his teachers, not Ofqual, not government ministers, would have been able to say in this moment what counted as admissible evidence for him to mount a protest. He had been told what he was worth and given no means to disagree. Many of those I spoke to in the worlds of education and politics insisted that if Johnson’s government had betrayed the country’s youth that August morning, it was not with the algorithm. It was with the mess made of appeals. Ofqual had known since the spring that the Approach-1 algorithm would spit out anomalies. It knew these blips would have to be corrected by human intervention – appeals – if they were to be corrected at all. How something as necessary as a process for making those appeals was missing on 13 August is a story typical of Johnson-era governance. His is a campaigning government, brought to power on one-sentence promises, with bold raspberries blown at detail. Far too late, Johnson’s ministers sought to fiddle with aspects of the appeals process that Ofqual had spent a summer planning. Details were rushed or skimped. Nothing was firmly in place when it mattered, and students like Elleston-Burrell were left in limbo over a long weekend, watching as half a million university places went to other people. On 16 August, after Roger Taylor acknowledged “a situation that was rapidly getting out of control”, a decision was made that the Approach-1 algorithm was by now so tarnished it would be better if they abandoned it. Elleston-Burrell was at work the next day, on 17 August, when he heard. Ofqual and the government had decided that every student in England would now receive the grades that were predicted by their teachers back in June. For some, this was good news. (In Oxford, that talented young English student got her A* after all.) Others were left stranded, their grades a lot better, but their places at university gone. When I got through to Elleston-Burrell that day, he was trying to brave it out, but he sounded glum. He kept repeating, dazedly, “I don’t even know, man.” His grades had been adjusted up, the Mandarin from a C to an A, the maths from an E to a C. He was now an AAC student. Still it was not quite enough to get him over the line and on to his course, which required at least a B in maths. University terms were due to start in a month. Many admissions offices had agreed to hold places as long as they could, so that students could get as much clarity on their grades as possible. If Elleston-Burrell had any hope, he needed to nudge up his maths grade from a C to a B. For that to happen, he would have to take the fight to St Joseph’s, the school that had helped shape him since he was 11, the school where they still used a picture of his face in ads and had his paintings on the walls. Most of us will reach our last days at school with a mixed parcel of knowledge, a few facts, a few equations, the reasons why Hitler rose and Hamlet dithered, as well as those other proficiencies that cannot be graded A to U, like how fantastic it feels to make a fierce teacher drop their guard and grin, or when to stick in blackjack, when to twist. I doubt very many of us finish school with the knowledge of who we really are or what we’re really capable of. It seems so strange to choose this moment – potential at a peak, hunger cresting – to insist on limits. We issue a string of letter-grades to determine the worth and potential of a person when they are only at the start of personhood. Elleston-Burrell had been told at different times since he was 17 that he was an AAA kid, an ACU kid, an ABC kid, an AAC kid. Now, at 19, he was racing against the clock to prove he was as capable as any AAB kid before an elite university shut its doors to him. “What’s bizarre to me is that we’ve created a system where so much rests on something that’s so inaccurate,” Sam Freedman told me. Freedman is an education executive who during a crammed career has run schools, overseen teacher training, and worked as an adviser inside David Cameron’s government. “Even in a normal year,” Freedman said, “you’ve got people’s lives being decided on a few grades, when those grades have a 50% chance of being wrong.” By Ofqual’s own admission, about half the grades issued to school leavers in any given year were in some way aberrant or off. Levels of strictness, pedantry and pity varied from teacher to teacher, marker to marker, region to region. Essay-based subjects in particular were a nightmare for Ofqual to standardise. Such kinks and irregularities as there were got targeted by the algorithms that Ofqual made use of even in non-pandemic years. These algorithms were a bit like desperate duvet-shakes, to try to get the edges square on a nation’s grades – and even then, when all was said and done, lumps remained. “So forget Covid,” Freedman said. Every year, school leavers were sent scuttering off this way or that way, dodging life’s queues or joining life’s bottlenecks and jams, based on a filtering system that was appallingly flawed. Freedman could only think we’d stuck by this flawed system so long because no one had come up with anything better. “Because no one’s been prepared to acknowledge what it would mean to dismantle it all.” In August 2020, as Elleston-Burrell’s options dwindled, he turned to his teachers at St Joseph’s. He reckoned that if he submitted enough evidence about his standard in maths they might somehow bump up that grade, and in doing so clear his path to university. Over a fortnight in late August and early September, difficult emails went back and forth between Elleston-Burrell and his mother on one side, and St Joseph’s and its headteacher, David Garrido, on the other. Would the school consider changing the grade? Why not? Part of the deadlock seemed to be that while Elleston-Burrell had spent some of the Covid-disrupted year in class, he had spent more of it with his private tutor. As an “adult learner”, retaking the year by choice, he was free to study as he chose. He had simply judged he was making better progress one-on-one. Ofqual later said that adult learners were at a particular disadvantage in 2020, because their relationships with schools were likely to be more distant or tenuous than in-house students; and in the end, schools chose the grades. During his final year at St Joseph’s, Elleston-Burrell had often worn a special uniform of his own devising – smart trousers and shirt, brightly coloured coat, a gesture to his midway status, half enrolled and half graduated. It was his bad luck to occupy this middle ground in 2020 when everything was such a mess. The deliberations between Elleston-Burrell and St Joseph’s over his maths grade were tortured and sometimes bitter. Garrido, the headteacher, declined to answer my specific questions, except to say that this was probably the most complicated case he had to deal with all year. On 10 September, with seven days to go until admissions closed at UCL, St Joseph’s confirmed it was reviewing the disputed grade. Quickly, after that, a decision reached Elleston-Burrell by email. The school could not budge, it said. The C stood. He was AAC, immutably, and he would have to start figuring out what sort of future could be fashioned from that. Rhianne Elleston Pascall flinched when she heard the school’s final verdict. She was close to her son. He had been born when Rhianne was quite young herself, coming along premature, she told me, “this little 4lb 3oz boy we weren’t sure was going to make it. Now he’s this big, deep-voiced, muscular young man who’s able to tell us where he wants to go. I’ve grown up with Josiah. I’ve openly told him I can get things wrong, too. There’s no handbook. We can work it out together and crack on. That has kind of forged our closeness.” As he grew older, he came to her less and less with his problems. But when he did come, Rhianne was used to being able to fix things, or at least buck him up and restore some of his fight so that he might find a fix himself. Something about these weeks in August and September felt different to her, as if this time there might not be any fix. It concerned her, too, how many other young people – young men, young Black men – might have been set adrift like her son. Rhianne worked for Croydon council and she knew very well the compromised dynamics in the borough and the risks for its youths who became discouraged. She told me she was worried about “those students with parents who don’t have English as their native language. Those parents who don’t understand what is happening with these grades and are sitting at home accepting them. They may lose their child in a couple of years. They may not know what the driving force behind that even was.” In August, she had written to her local councillor. She left a message after the beep for their local MP. Now that it was September, Rhianne called her pastor for advice, and she turned to colleagues at Croydon council, encouraging her son to do the same whenever he went in for shifts at Waitrose. “Son?” she said to him, even as the UCL deadline got closer. “It’s not over.” On 14 September, mother and son sat down on her bed and composed a long email to the director of architecture at UCL, “the last attempt to secure my place”, Elleston-Burrell wrote. People from church had fed in with suggestions all month. Mates at Waitrose offered encouragement, and one of Rhianne’s colleagues at Croydon council agreed to proofread the email before they sent it. A community who could see the person behind the AAC, who knew his million qualities that could not be graded A to U, came together to help him make a final push. It was a blockbuster email: Elleston-Burrell read it to me on a rackety train out of Croydon that was taking him to work. The journey was interrupted by a faulty door alarm, and an unexplained stop between stations, but even then it took him the whole trip to read it through. He had included everything. Hopes. Near misses. He explained who he was at 19, and who he might become given the chance. As the train pulled into central London, he read me the final passages: “My head and heart are already at UCL. I will do whatever it takes.” That same month there was a long, salty meeting between Ofqual’s leadership and the UK parliament’s education committee, broadcast online, which picked over the events of the summer and sometimes felt like a criminal trial in which Taylor, his colleagues, even the Approach-1 algorithm, were codefendants. Approach-1 was already a famous failure. Perhaps it was the first algorithm in the history of computer science to be condemned on the front page of every major British newspaper. During the parliamentary meeting, Taylor was urged to publicly disown his co-creation. It would have been easy for him to blame the crisis on a rogue, out-of-control algorithm. With his usual craven briskness, Johnson had done exactly this, muttering about a “mutant” strain of code. Taylor could not bring himself to denounce Approach-1 in such terms. The algorithm did what it was supposed to do. Humans, in the end, had no stomach for what it was supposed to do. Algorithms don’t go rogue, they don’t go on mutant rampages, they only sometimes reveal and amplify the cruddy human biases that underpin them. Ofqual’s mistake was to think this exercise – which made plain our usual tricks for filtering and limiting young lives – would be morally tolerable as it played out in public view. Taylor apologised to everyone who had been hurt by Approach-1 and later resigned his position as chair of Ofqual. The news passed Elleston-Burrell by, focused as he was on his own battle. The last-chance email he’d written to UCL was sent on the evening of 14 September, with less than two days to go until the deadline for admissions. He was amazed to receive a reply within hours. His email, “eloquent and powerful”, had caused “a great deal of activity”, he read. In fact it had been kicked up to the top decision-makers at UCL and he was told he could expect more news soon. But how soon was soon, Elleston-Burrell began to wonder, as 15 September turned to 16 September – deadline day. Tense with waiting, he snapped at his mum. Rhianne had glimpsed the state of his email inbox and she lectured him about staying on top of his correspondence at such a critical time. They squabbled. They prayed it out. Elleston-Burrell sat on the sofa at home where, brusquely, grumpily, still after all a teenager, he began to delete spam emails. “Wait,” he muttered. His nan was there, too. “Wait.” They had been expecting more news from UCL’s director of architecture and somehow Elleston-Burrell had missed a separate thread of emails from the admissions office. They’d written to say – “Wait!” – that he had a place on the course after all. He only had to reply by 5pm. Everybody looked at the clock: 2.15pm. The family allowed themselves a minute to scream. “Hyenas,” Rhianne described it. Then a few minutes to cry. At 2.21pm, Elleston-Burrell wrote to accept. I met him a couple of hours later at East Croydon station, where he kept glancing at the platform clock, blinking, shaking his head, staggered at how fine the margins had been till the end. His phone rang and rang as people heard the news and he spoke to them all in the hoarse, disbelieving tones of someone who’d been lucky to walk away from an accident with only scratches. “Thank you. I know. Thank you.” Together we watched the 5pm deadline come around, as though this somehow made everything more official, less stealable, and afterwards Elleston-Burrell tapped on his phone, answering well-done messages, researching course materials, timetables, the right textbooks. After such a wait, the new term, life’s next bit, would start in one week. At last, Elleston-Burrell’s last day at school. It was November, cold out, and he pulled up the hood of his coat to walk in from the usual bus stop. He went past St Joseph’s sports pitch, its medical centre, that staff room where they had a mounted photograph of him (beaming, 13, no real clue) gazing down benevolently on every teachers’ meeting. Whenever the wind blew open the flaps of his coat, you could see a dangling lanyard and a shiny student ID. He had been an architecture undergrad for six weeks. Already he was tired, stressed by coursework, and thrilled to be these things. He’d come back to St Joseph’s to retrieve some of those paintings of his that still hung on the walls. It was early when he got inside the school, about an hour before morning bell. Elleston-Burrell crossed the empty playground and entered a building by one of the common rooms. The few teachers he passed wore face masks, difficult to recognise as they hurried into morning meetings. Educators everywhere were girding themselves for another academic year that was about to be heavily disrupted by Covid. Just a few weeks after Elleston-Burrell’s final visit to St Joseph’s, the education minister, Gavin Williamson, would announce, again, that exams were off in 2021. Puffing himself up, for all the world as if he hadn’t been the one to initiate Approach-1 in the first place, Williamson would go on to make a flashy promise that “this year, we will put our trust in teachers rather than algorithms”. At the time of writing, precise details of the 2021 plan have yet to be finalised. Elleston-Burrell felt bad for the kids about to leave St Joseph’s without the opportunity to prove themselves in pen-and-paper exams. At the same time, he was relieved not to have to worry about predictions, approaches, AACs or AABs, any of it. He was finished as a schoolboy. When he climbed the stairs to the art department there was no one around, and he stood for a moment, staring at his paintings. First the tribute to his late cousin, Miguel. Then the portrait of his mother. Then the one of himself, eating fruit. He’d forgotten that these paintings were once done on thick wooden boards so heavy and unwieldy that they were nailed directly to the school brick. He dragged over a chair and began pulling and scrabbling. Plaster flakes got under his fingernails. Finally, he wrenched the portraits free. ",education
"My father, Jak Kissell, who has died aged 80, trained more than 5,000 teachers over the course of a 40-year career in education. His passion for teaching English was fired by his love of literature, linguistics and languages. He had a good knowledge of French, Italian, German, Ancient Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon (Old English), and a smattering of Old Norse. He was born James Kissell in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, the son of George Kissell, a lab technician who had made gyroscopes for Spitfire planes in the second world war, and his wife, Elizabeth (nee Anderson). After leaving St Ignatius College, Enfield, Jak joined the Royal Air Force reserve. He received his pilot officer commission in 1964 and intended a career in the cockpit, but government cutbacks meant he would not be able to fly, so he chose university instead, and went to Queen Mary College, University of London, to study English. Graduating with a first in 1961, he went on to take his BLitt from Pembroke College, Oxford, and in 1968 became a lecturer at La Sainte Union College of Higher Education (now part of the University of Southampton). While there, he took an MSc in linguistics from Reading, which proved a tipping point for his career and led him to focus on language as well as literature.  Jak married Roslyn Keller in 1965, and they had two sons. They moved a short way east in 1972 when Jak joined West Sussex Institute of Higher Education, now the University of Chichester. As a senior lecturer in English language, literature and drama, he shaped courses that built its reputation, attracting students from Saudi Arabia and China. He also taught extensively at Open University summer schools and was an invigilator and marker for the Cambridge examination board. He retired in 2004 but continued to lecture part-time for the Open University and the University of Portsmouth until 2012. Outside classroom and lecture hall, Jak was a patron and performer in the arts scene of West Sussex, directing and acting in summer Shakespeare productions at Chichester’s West Dean Gardens, playing his violin in the Hayling Island orchestra and singing with Felpham community singers. His appetite for life and language was arrested only by the onset of dementia and supranuclear palsy in 2019. Even after moving into a nursing home, he still enjoyed having Proust read to him by his carers. He is survived by Ros, Robert and me, and his grandchildren, Matthew, Alex and Alexa.",education
"My father John Carr, who has died aged 85, was an inspirational teacher, gold-winning sportsman, superb home brewer, tireless campaigner and a cheerful and entertaining friend. He was a lecturer at Middlesex University for 37 years, joining Enfield College of Technology in 1963 as a member of the team that transformed the college as it became part of Middlesex Polytechnic in 1973 and then Middlesex University in 1992. During that time he championed efforts to widen access to education, and contributed to innovations in teaching, course development and exam standards through his work as chair of the Council for National Academic Award’s Geography Board. He retired from Middlesex University in 2000 as principal lecturer and university orator. John was born in Derby to Merry (nee Jelley), a teacher, and Billy, a right-back with Derby County football club, who had met at the Derby Socialist Club. It is therefore not surprising that teaching, sport and practical socialism became the cornerstones of his life. Although he later moved away from the county, Derbyshire inspired some of John’s abiding enthusiasms, including Burton-brewed beer, the geology and geography of the Peak District, and rowing. At the age of 19 he endured a testing time as a national service infantry subaltern, serving in the Royal Norfolk Regiment in Cyprus at the height of the EOKA terror campaign in the mid-1950s. His vivid adventures were collected by the Imperial War Museum’s oral history programme and can be found in their sound archive. Once demobbed, he attained a BA and MA in geography from Reading University, where he was known as “the Old Man” for his wisdom, authority and pipe-smoking. He was popular on campus, participating in student politics, setting up a Socialist Society, taking a play to the Edinburgh festival, and rowing. Later he maintained close links with the university, always turning out in his boat club blazer to support its crews at Henley regatta and representing the alumni Ortner Boat Club in rowing competitions.  After retirement he characteristically set himself new targets, refining his home-brewing techniques and campaigning for causes he felt passionate about. After decades away from rowing he devoted his famed teeth-gritted determination to winning a gold medal in the 2000m “masters” event at the British Indoor Rowing Championships, where he won a gold medal in 2016 and a silver medal the following year.  He suffered a stroke in 2018, but remained stoic, charming, and nattily dressed until the end. In 1964 he married Jean Sommerville, with whom he had three children before the marriage ended in 1984. John’s subsequent partner, Vicki Scarlett, died in 2011. He is survived by his children, Andrea, Harriet and Oliver, and a grandson, Arlo. ",education
"My good friend William Harkness, who has died aged 66 of lymphoma cancer, was one of the leading paediatric neurosurgeons of his generation. A caring clinician and gifted surgeon, he was also enormous fun and a great friend.  William was born in Aldershot, the son of Jack and June (nee Pearce) Harkness. His father was a land agent and his parents ran a hotel in Anglesey, which he described as being like Fawlty Towers. William was educated at Eton and qualified in medicine at the University of Birmingham in 1979. He did neurosurgical training at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, completing in 1989.  He was then on rotation between Atkinson Morley hospital in Wimbledon and Great Ormond Street and the National Hospital for Neurosurgery and Neurology. He spent six months at UCLA in Los Angeles in 1991, returning to specialise in epilepsy surgery at Great Ormond Street and the National. It was an operation he performed on an epileptic young man that led to our meeting. The parents had organised a trek to raise money for the National Hospital for Neurology and Neuroscience, where William worked at the time, as a thank you for making their son well. I met William in a tent in Nepal. We were both more than 6ft tall and neither of us was slight. The nights were uncomfortable, but we stayed friends and went on two further treks to that beautiful country. He became dedicated to Nepal and its people, giving generously of his time and money, particularly in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake. William retired from clinical practice in 2014 but continued to be an inspiring speaker. In 2016 he become president of the International Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons. In 2018 he co-founded InterSurgeon, a charity promoting international collaboration and linking surgeons across the world online so skills and knowledge can be fairly shared. InterSurgeon will be a lasting memorial to a great man. He married Philippa Lubomirski in 1982.

"Campaigners and politicians have condemned the University of Oxford for backtracking on its previous decision to remove a statue of the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes and ignore the views of an independent commission. Oriel College, Oxford said on Thursday it would not “begin the legal process” of moving the statue at this stage owing to “regulatory and financial challenges” presented by its removal, despite a vote by the independent commission supporting its removal. Anti-racism campaigners said it was a cynical betrayal and exposed the “insincerity” of the college’s stated commitment to change. The campaign group Rhodes Must Fall demanded “full transparency” on any communications from politicians and government officials from the college and whether the withdrawal of funding from alumni played a role in the latest decision. But the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, welcomed the move, tweeting: “Sensible & balanced decision not to remove the Rhodes statue from Oriel College, Oxford – because we should learn from our past, rather than censoring history, and continue focusing on reducing inequality.”  The commission was set up last June after the governing body of the college voted in favour of removing the statue. The commission was asked to look into the issue after a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol at the height of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests in the UK. A majority of the commission’s members supported the expressed wish of the governing body to remove the statue. The commission also urged Oriel’s governing body to publish a definitive statement of its view concerning its association with Rhodes, and that the college revise materials to ensure they are consistent with the statement, in a report that was leaked to the Guardian on Wednesday. In response, the college said it would not be moving the statue, stating that its removal would be subject to difficult legal and planning processes involving the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, who said in January that he would introduce changes to the law to protect statues from what he called “baying mobs”. The college said a majority of the submissions to the commission backed the retention of the statue. Susan Brown, Oxford city council’s leader, said: “I am personally deeply disappointed that Oriel College have chosen today to backtrack on their previous decision to remove the Rhodes statue and ignore the views of the commission on this crucial part of their work. For people in our city this was the most important action that Oriel College could have taken to show an acknowledgment of the discrimination of the past and they have failed to act.” Simukai Chigudu, an associate professor of African politics at Oxford, described the governing body’s decision as chilling. “The statement from Oriel College is shocking and, quite frankly, embarrassing. It exposes the insincerity of the college’s stated commitment to change, which was made last summer during the anti-racism protests,” he said. “Most chilling, however, is the waffle and obfuscation in the college’s statement. The statement claims that the process of removing the statue would be too expensive and would yield no certain outcome. What does that mean? As an alternative to taking down the statue, Oriel says they will increase provisions for BAME students. But framing this as a binary choice is both false and insulting.” Maya, a 20-year-old student who is part of the campaign group Common Ground Oxford, called it “a betrayal of the campaigning work that has been done by community activists and students”.  She said: “There is no way of making the statue neutral in its current position, looking down on passersby on the high street. Every day, black and minority ethnic students and workers have to walk beneath Rhodes’ stone feet.” Shaista Aziz, the Oxford city council member for inclusive communities and a member of the independent commission, said the report reflected on issues around race, class and representation at Oriel College, the wider university and, crucially, the city of Oxford, a diverse and multiracial city. “The commission’s recommendations on the future of the statue are clearly laid out in the report; it’s up to the college’s governing body to decide how it wants to move forward with the recommendations. The commission maintains its independence and has shown it’s listened to a wide group of people with a range of views,” she said. The college has agreed to a number of other recommendations made by the commission, including developing a strategic plan for improving educational equality, diversity and inclusion and fundraising for scholarships to support students from southern Africa. Dr Samir Shah, the vice-chair of the Policy Exchange’s History Matters project, said Oriel had chosen to “focus its efforts on making Oxford a more diverse and open institution. In short, Oriel has rightly decided not to spend time on a fruitless effort to change the past, but to plough resources into trying to change the future, especially for ethnic minority young people.” Neil Mendoza, the provost of Oriel College, said: “It has been a careful, finely balanced debate and we are fully aware of the impact our decision is likely to have in the UK and further afield. We understand this nuanced conclusion will be disappointing to some, but we are now focused on the delivery of practical actions aimed at improving outreach and the day-to-day experience of BME students. We are looking forward to working with Oxford city council on a range of options for contextualisation.” A spokesperson for Rhodes Must Fall demanded Oriel maintain the original decision it made last year. “No amount of diversity and inclusion initiatives will suffice in lieu of the removal of the physical images which glorify white supremacy,” it said.",education
"An independent commission set up to examine the future of Oxford University’s controversial statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes has recommended its removal. The commission was set up last June after Oxford University’s Oriel College voted in favour of removing its statue. The commission was asked to look into the issue after a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was torn down in Bristol at the height of last summer’s Black Lives Matter protest. The decision had been delayed owing to a “considerable volume of submissions” that the commission received and the coronavirus pandemic. In the report, seen by the Guardian, the commission recommended that the statue be taken down and that the King Edward Street plaque be removed. A majority of commission members supported the expressed wish of the governing body to remove the statue. The commission also urged Oriel College’s governing body to publish a definitive statement of its view concerning its association with Rhodes and that the college revise materials to ensure they are consistent with the statement. The commission noted that it was unanimous in its support for all the recommendations in its report, which also calls on the college to fund two new fellowships in fields related to its Rhodes legacy; to provide for scholarships for students from southern Africa and graduate students undertaking relevant research; and to introduce an annual lecture and other outreach initiatives concerned with issues related to Rhodes’ legacy, race and colonialism. The commission’s report is advisory and the decisions on the recommendations it made are the responsibility of the college’s governing body. The commission said the governing body should take further proactive measures to encourage applications from black and minority ethnic (BAME) applicants, and to improve the offer and acceptance rates for BAME students. The commission’s recommendation follows the removal of nearly 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists since last summer’s anti-racist protests, according to Guardian analysis. In what was described by historians as an “unprecedented” public reckoning with Britain’s slavery and colonial past, an estimated 39 names – including streets, buildings and schools – and 30 statues, plaques and other memorials have been or are undergoing changes or removal since last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests. Rhodes Must Fall Oxford, a student group that has been campaigning for the statue’s removal, welcomed the commission’s recommendation, saying: “We’re pleased that the commission came to a decision that recognises the brutality of Cecil Rhodes, and that of the colonial systems of extraction and oppression with which Oxford University’s legacy is tied. “Crucially, the college must now follow through on the recommendation of its independent inquiry, and remove the statue once and for all.”  Oriel College and Oxford University have been contacted for comment.",education
"The press release that accompanies Prof Kathleen Stock’s new book says she wants to see a future in which trans rights activists and gender-critical feminists collaborate to achieve some of their political aims. But she concedes that this currently seems fanciful. As far as she is concerned, the book, Material Girls, sets out her stall – and she knows a lot of people will find it distasteful. Stock, a professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex, says the key question she addresses – itself offensive to many – is this: do trans women count as women? Whatever else about her views is controversial, she is surely on firm ground when she writes that this question has become surrounded by toxicity. But the problem for her is, at least partly, that many people do anything they can to avoid answering it. “Very few people who are sceptical talk about it directly, because they’re frightened,” she says. “It’s so hard psychologically to say, in reply: ‘I’m afraid not.’” Stock is at pains to say she is not a transphobe, and also that she is sympathetic to the idea that many people feel they are not in the “right” body. What she says she opposes, though, is the institutionalisation of the idea that gender identity is all that matters – that how you identify automatically confers all the entitlements of that sex. And she believes that increasingly in universities and the wider world, that is a view that cannot be challenged. “There’s a taboo against saying this, but it’s what I believe,” she says. “It’s fair enough if people want to disagree with me, but this is what I think.” That last statement is loaded, too, because the gender identity row is closely linked, especially on university campuses, with freedom of speech. Campuses are a minefield for those wanting to discuss these issues, she says, and she has faced calls for her university to sack her. So she is supportive of the government’s controversial plans for a free speech bill, which critics including English PEN, Article 19 and Index on Censorship have argued will have the opposite effect. In a joint letter, they argued that the legislation “may have the inverse effect of further limiting what is deemed ‘acceptable’ speech on campus and introducing a chilling effect both on the content of what is taught and the scope of academic research exploration”. But Stock backs the bill: “I think vice-chancellors and university management groups have shown that they can’t manage the modern problems around suppression of academic freedom. I think there are some genuine instances of unfair treatment of controversial academics, and those academics should be able to seek meaningful redress.” This week the University of Essex apologised to two professors, Jo Phoenix and Rosa Freedman, after an independent inquiry found the university had breached its free speech duties when their invitations or talks were cancelled after student complaints. Stock grew up in Montrose, Scotland, the daughter of a philosophy lecturer and a newspaper proofreader, and studied for her degree at Exeter College, Oxford, going on to do an MA at the University of St Andrews and a PhD at Leeds. Having come out as gay relatively late in life, she now lives in Sussex with her partner and two sons from her previous marriage. She regards her OBE, awarded earlier this year for services to higher education, as a signal that her views have at least some backing in the establishment. “Academics being online, students being online – it’s introduced a whole new landscape for dealing with controversial ideas, especially when those ideas are controversial within your peer group or a student body. Threats to academic freedom don’t just come from China, or millionaires trying to buy a library wing for your college; they also come from students whipping up a petition within seconds of you saying something and trying to get you fired.” Sometimes, she claims, it is more insidious than sackings: “For academics [the gender identity debate] has a chilling effect, because academics believe their careers may suffer in ways that are less visible: they don’t get promoted, or they’re removed from an editorial board.” The net result of all this, she says, is an impoverishment of ideas and knowledge, and damage to the dissemination of information. Because another of Stock’s key arguments in her book is that her own profession, academia, has failed to look in detail at some claims made by trans activists. She questions some of the data that gets shared regarding violence against trans people, saying that a lot of it is produced by groups that adhere to a particular narrative.  “I don’t doubt that transphobic crime occurs, but I want to know to what extent it occurs in a way that could help the trans community better understand the problem it faces.” She’s disappointed, she says, in some fellow academics for not rising above the fray. “I thought the point of philosophy was that you would be able to argue things without resorting to ad hominem attacks – I thought that was the point of our training.” How, then, in her view, have we got to where we are? Stock takes issue with Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, which campaigns for trans inclusion and opposes the views of gender-critical feminists. The charity’s Diversity Champions programme is very popular on campuses, and Stock believes this has in part “turned universities into trans activist organisations” through their equality, diversity and inclusion departments. Beyond this, the introduction of student fees has played its part in the current situation, Stock believes. “As soon as students started to pay, they became customers, and universities became much more deferential. They started talking about coproduction of knowledge, giving them much more choice over the whole experience.” The problem with that, she believes, is that “some young people come along with fixed ideas about gender identity theory, and it’s awkward – especially when universities are branding themselves as LGBT-friendly and queer-friendly.” Philosophy is a vast space, most of it without risk of abuse. So what keeps her in this particular arena? “I was bullied as a child and I think that gave me experience of social ostracisation and toughened me up,” she says. “I’ve also got amazing support. Sure, some philosophers and colleagues are against my views, but others are very supportive. “Plus it’s personal for me: I’ve struggled with my body in terms of femininity. I could easily aged 15 have decided I was non-binary or even a boy. And I feel very worried for teenagers who are now foreclosing reproductive possibilities and their future, or damaging their bodily tissues in irreversible ways, based on an idea that they may come to relinquish at a later date.” One tragedy of the gender identity debate is how hate-filled and polarised it has become. Stock says she has suffered online abuse, but makes it clear that she is going to continue to state her case. ",education
"The Delta Covid-19 variant has begun spreading in schools and colleges throughout England, it has been revealed, after Public Health England published new data, demanded by teachers and staff unions, on outbreaks of the variant. The new data, covering 26 April to 30 May, showed the number of Delta variant infections in schools or other educational settings rising rapidly throughout the period, with a total of 140 incidents. Prof Christina Pagel, director of University College London’s clinical operational research unit, said the figures were evidence that schools were now “a major source” of transmission, after the government last month dropped its requirement for secondary school pupils to wear masks in classrooms. Dr William Welfare, deputy director of health protection at Public Health England (PHE), said that while outbreaks in schools are still at low levels, “we have seen a slight increase over recent weeks”, in line with the higher levels of variants being detected in the community. “The latest PHE data suggest that there have been 97 confirmed Covid-19 outbreaks in primary and secondary schools that have had at least one variant case linked to them over the most recent four-week period. This represents around one in 250 schools. “Public Health England’s health protection teams continue to work with local authorities and schools to carry out surveillance of Covid-19 cases in schools to understand and reduce transmission in these settings,” Dr Welfare said. Of the Delta variant, the number of confirmed outbreaks or clusters found in primary and secondary schools has risen from just three at the end of April to 39 in the final week of May. The combined number of outbreaks and clusters of all variants has also grown at pace, from 24 at the end of April to 93 by the end of last month. Pagel said: “It is clear that schools are a major source of transmission and that outbreaks in primary and secondary schools have been growing a lot, week on week. “Meanwhile, the government removed the mask mandate on 17 May and the PHE surveillance report this week shows that the number of tests being done in secondary schools – the government’s main mitigation now for schools – is decreasing all the time. The government needs to get serious about reducing cases in schools.” Last week the leaders of eight trade unions representing school staff, including the four main teaching unions, wrote to the Department for Education asking that the data on variants in schools and colleges be released.",education
"Former students have complained of sexism and racism at University College London’s leading architecture school going back a decade, alleging inappropriate comments were made about appearance and race and female students were sometimes brought to tears. In a dossier shared with the Guardian, compiled by a former student, Eleni Kyriacou, and including testimonials from 21 people, they claimed there were “systemic” problems at the Bartlett, the academic centre for the study of the built environment at UCL. The university said it had been “aware of issues” in the Bartlett school and was working to address them. It is launching an investigation into the student complaints. In 2007 an investigation by the equality, diversity and inclusion team at UCL, which monitors grades, picked up issues with women being given different marks than men. The team subsequently monitored teaching and concluded female students were being treated differently. The institution worked to address this, making improvements in recent years, but did not contact Bartlett alumni to inform them. The Guardian spoke to a number of students who have graduated in the last couple of years, who all asked to remain anonymous. One former student, of south Asian descent claimed staff were “damaging primarily female students”. She claimed a staff member had told a student he could not tell she was “brown”, as “‘she acted and spoke like a white person”. She felt her grades were affected by sexism and said: “I am still struggling with self-belief.” One student claimed they made a serious complaint to Bartlett about a unit brief, which was published last year, that they had seen in text and video format. The video, which the student said caused hurt to many black and minority ethnic alumni, has since been removed by the university. “The brief had created a connection between hesitancy in the use of colour in architecture and race and the Black Lives Matter movement. I found it absurd, ignorant, and offensive,” she said. She said the video showed images of the Black Lives Matter movement. “So it used a lot of violent imagery and then with that, the voiceover was discussing chromophobia,” she said. Chromophobia is a persistent, irrational fear of, or aversion to, colours and is usually a conditioned response. She said the video appeared to say that “if there are colourful buildings in the new world of joy then racism or sexism would be negated”. She said it was “sloppy” and when she spoke to the director of the school he said he recognised the video as “awkward”, which was followed by its removal. “I was shocked at the insensitivity and the violence of the images combined with the message of ‘chromophobia’. Having been a victim of racist teasing by my peers at the Bartlett, I felt very let down as the video and brief showed that there were tutors at the school who did not seem to understand the nuances of being black and an architectural student, and don’t seem to honestly address the idea that to some ignorant people being black, working-class, and an architect are all things that are not compatible. “Students at the Bartlett, who came from all-boys public schools in London, called me the ‘whitest’ black person they had met. To them, studying architecture at a top school like UCL was a white and middle-class thing, not a place for a mixed-race, British, Black Caribbean woman with a working-class heritage. “Rather than just take down that unit’s video and change the conflation of ‘chromophobia’ and the BLM movement in the unit’s brief, all unit intro videos were taken down and the brief was never changed.” Students reported seeing other female students cry. Another claimed: “I agree that the Bartlett has a sexist culture.” Kyriacou said she compiled the report after experiencing sexism while studying at the institution in 2000. She said: “I fear these findings implicate widespread misconduct that may have had a detrimental effect on hundreds of alumni, predominantly female. “I urge UCL to investigate and to take bold action with regards to accountability for the misconduct that has occurred regarding staff members, but also to consider offering female alumni grade changes and being offered their RIBA part I [qualification] to those who need it so they can still become architects.” Prof Sasha Roseneil, a pro-provost (equity and inclusion) at UCL, said: “We have been aware of issues in the Bartlett school of architecture and have been working hard to address them for some time. We are deeply concerned to learn about these incidents, and we will investigate these, and any others that are brought to our attention.” In 2020, 40.5% of women at the Bartlett gained a first-class degree, compared with 39.5% of men. The Bartlett faculty of the built environment introduced a scholarship scheme last year to attract students from a broader range of backgrounds and to tackle the lack of diversity among the built environment professions. Roseneil said: “We want to understand the wider and deeper issues raised by these reports, and so we will conduct a review into culture and behaviours in the school, as well as looking at the historical data. “We are all too aware that sexist and racist behaviour takes place at UCL, and we are committed to tackling inequalities and to ensuring that our university is an environment in which students and staff can thrive in their diversity.”",education
"The UK’s position as a cultural leader is at risk if proposed 50% cuts to arts subjects at universities go ahead, arts sector leaders have told the government in an open letter opposing the move. The letter – organised by the Contemporary Visual Arts Network and signed by 300 art world figures, including Sonia Boyce and the directors of all four Tate locations – said the plan to halve the amount spent on some arts subjects was a “strategic misstep”. The current plan would affect courses – including music, dance, drama and performing arts; art and design; media studies; and archaeology – that were deemed to not be “strategic priorities” after a consultation by the Office for Students (OfS) and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. “The current proposal may limit the availability and accessibility of places on arts courses and result in fewer courses being offered,” the letter reads. “This will have a detrimental impact on our ability to retain our world leading position, attract inward investment through our cultural capital and our share of the global art market.” The letter added that the plan was a “strategic misstep” and contradicted the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport’s strategy laid out in its Here for Culture campaign. Signatories included Maria Balshaw, the director of Tate, Ralph Rugoff, the director of the Hayward Gallery, and dozens of academics and artists from around the UK, including Boyce, who will represent Britain at next year’s Venice Biennale. The letter asked that the policy is revoked in order to ensure the continuation of “a UK success story”. “If you believe that innovation is a strategic priority, you will not cut higher education funding to the arts – but better recognise our value as integral to the fourth Industrial Revolution,” it stated. The cuts will come from an overall teaching budget of £1.47bn, with a student on an affected course seeing their funding fall from £243 to £121.50. Signatories of the letter and other opponents of the proposal, including musician Jarvis Cocker, have said that will deter those from lower socio-economic backgrounds and leave arts subjects as the preserve of wealthy students. An OfS spokesperson said: “The proposed changes relate to a small fraction of how these courses are funded, equating to a reduction of £120 per student, or 1% of overall funding. Alongside this we plan to maintain funds to support disadvantaged students, and to boost funding for specialist institutions by £10m. “The OfS has a fixed funding budget that is set by government. This will have to stretch further in the coming years with significant growth forecast in student numbers – particularly for courses that are expensive to teach like medicine and nursing. In this context we need to make difficult decisions about how to prioritise our increasingly constrained budget. We will carefully consider all responses to our consultation before making any final decisions on changes to our funding.”",education
"Schools in England face a repair bill of more than £11bn, nearly double some previous estimates, according to a long-awaited national survey completed by the government. The survey confirmed years of complaints by teachers and parents of crumbling buildings and leaking facilities, in some cases riddled with asbestos, and of “temporary” cabins that remain in use despite exceeding their lifespan. The DfE also opened a consultation on fire safety in school buildings but was criticised for recommending that sprinklers should only be installed in any newbuilds over 11 metres tall, effectively four storeys or higher. The repairs survey, which involved visits to 22,000 state schools starting in 2017, has been repeatedly delayed. Its final publication may be part of an effort by the DfE to wring more funding for repairs from the Treasury in the comprehensive spending review later this year. The report stated that “remedial work to repair or replace all defective elements” will cost £11.4bn, while a report by the National Audit Office in 2017 estimated that it would cost £6.7bn to return all school buildings to satisfactory condition. “While this was calculated on a slightly different basis, this does demonstrate that the overall condition need in the estate has grown over the last six years,” the report said in comparing the NAO’s results with its own findings. The new survey found that £2.5bn was needed for electrical and IT repairs alone, while repairs to boilers and air-conditioning was £2bn and mending roofs, windows and walls was £1.5bn. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a former secondary school head, said he was “horrified” to see the size of the repair bill. “The fact that this appears to have significantly increased over the past few years tends to suggest the government has utterly failed to get to grips with the problem,” Barton said. “The trouble is that the funding system for capital projects is extraordinarily complicated and relies on schools bidding for pots of money. There appears to be no real strategic oversight going on at government level.” A DfE spokesperson said: “Our new 10-year school rebuilding programme, which will transform 500 schools, is under way and will improve the education of tens of thousands of children. We have invested £11.3bn since 2015 in refurbishing school buildings, including £1.8bn in 2021-22 alone.” But Paul Whiteman of the National Association of Head Teachers said the government’s capital spending on schools had declined by 44% between 2009-10 and 2019-20. “The government has stated that it wants every pupil to receive a superb education – a key part of this should be a schools estate that is fit for purpose,” Whiteman said. Following the survey, England’s schools will receive individual reports on the repairs identified. The study found that the total school estate covers more than 500 square kilometres in buildings and school land – bigger than most UK cities. The DfE also announced revisions to its fire safety design guidance, which currently has only an “expectation” that new buildings have sprinklers installed. In recent years only one in three new school builds have included sprinklers. The new rules would “give clear guidance” that sprinklers should be installed in new special schools and boarding accommodation, as well as school buildings with floors higher than 11 metres above ground. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “These proposals are a step in the right direction but why doesn’t the government go further and take the opportunity to protect all new and refurbished school buildings from the avoidable devastation and huge repair costs of a fire?” Tilden Watson, head of education at Zurich Municipal, which specialises in school insurance, said: “By limiting sprinklers to schools above 11 metres, the government is effectively writing off a significant proportion of the school estate. This will create a two-tier system of safety, which is arbitrary and ill-thought-through. “As predominantly single-storey buildings, primary schools will be hardest hit, especially as they already suffer nearly twice the rate of blazes as secondary schools.”",education
"Unions representing teachers and other school staff have called on the government to reinstate masks in classrooms across England in response to a growing number of Covid outbreaks, particularly among secondary pupils. With infections on the rise and new figures showing Covid-related absence up among schoolchildren in England, four unions have issued a joint statement urging ministers to adopt a range of safety measures to limit transmission and reduce the risk of further closures. The statement, signed by the National Education Union, Unison, the GMB and Unite, demands the immediate reintroduction of face coverings for students and staff in all areas of secondary schools, including classrooms. They also want to see a rapid rollout of vaccinations for ​pupils, following confirmation from the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) that they are safe for children aged 12 ​and over, to inhibit the spread of the new Delta variant first identified in India. The government has so far ruled out a nationwide reintroduction of masks in schools, putting its faith instead in testing, but public health directors in Covid hotspots have the powers to reintroduce face coverings in schools if they feel it is necessary. The joint union call came as official school attendance figures showed one in every 50 secondary school students in England was absent for Covid-related reasons before the half-term break with a huge rise in children self-isolating, according to the latest figures compiled by the Department for Education. The DfE said there were 4,000 children in state schools with confirmed cases of Covid-19 on 27 May, the same as the previous week, but the number off school with suspected cases rose to 19,000, while the number self-isolating because of contacts within their school rocketed from 60,000 to 90,000, a 50% increase in seven days. Schools in the north-west were particularly hard hit. In Bolton, 21% of primary and 31% of secondary pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons, among high rates of absence overall. In Blackburn with Darwen 15% of primary and 13% of secondary pupils were absent. The union statement said: “Education unions are deeply concerned that secondary school age students now have the highest rates of Covid-19 infection of all age groups, according to Public Health England (PHE) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, and those rates are rising.“At the weekend, the health secretary acknowledged that ‘a huge proportion of the latest cases are in children’, that they pass on the virus to the local community and face risks from long Covid. Action must be taken now to make face-to-face learning safer over the remain​der of ​the school term.” The NEU, which is the UK’s biggest education union with 450,000 members, opposed the government’s decision to lift the mask requirement in schools from 17 May. “We advised the government it was premature to be taking the masks away,” said Mary Bousted, NEU joint general secretary. “It was one of the few safety measures the government insisted on. We will be arguing yet again that removing the requirement to wear masks was incomprehensible and it should be reinstated.” According to a PHE report released on Friday, about one in 250 schools – 97 primary and secondaries – have had outbreaks with at least one variant case linked to them in the last four weeks. The cohort worst affected by the Delta variant in Blackburn with Darwen, currently the UK’s top Covid hotspot, is 12- to 18-year-olds, a pattern reflected in many areas with high rates. Many schools in areas in the north-west including Tameside, Cheshire and Oldham, as well as Bedford, Kent and Staffordshire, reintroduced mask-wearing this week to try to stem the spread of the virus. Other schools in the north-west, including in Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton and Bury, had already asked students to keep their masks on last month. A government spokesperson said: “Attendance in schools remains high, and the data shows the steps we are taking to keep outbreaks of the Delta variant under control in schools are working. “On top of robust measures in place across the country, such as increased ventilation in classrooms and keeping to small group bubbles, we have increased the availability of testing for staff and pupils in families in areas of high prevalence of the variant.”",education
"The president of Magdalen College, Oxford, has strongly defended her graduate students’ right to remove a photograph of the Queen from their common room after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, called the move “absurd”. Members of the college’s middle common room (MCR), which is restricted to students taking postgraduate degrees, voted to take down the print, with minutes of the meeting noting that “for some students depictions of the monarch and the British monarchy represent recent colonial history”. Williamson tweeted: “Oxford university students removing a picture of the Queen is simply absurd. She is the head of state and a symbol of what is best about the UK. During her long reign she has worked tirelessly to promote British values of tolerance, inclusivity and respect around the world.” But Dinah Rose, the president of Magdalen College, swiftly responded: “Here are some facts about Magdalen College and HM the Queen. The Middle Common Room is an organisation of graduate students. They don’t represent the College. A few years ago, in about 2013, they bought a print of a photo of the Queen to decorate their common room. “They recently voted to take it down. Both of these decisions are their own to take, not the College’s. Magdalen strongly supports free speech and political debate, and the MCR’S right to autonomy. Maybe they’ll vote to put it up again, maybe they won’t. Meanwhile, the photo will be safely stored.” Rose added: “Being a student is about more than studying. It’s about exploring and debating ideas. It’s sometimes about provoking the older generation. Looks like that isn’t so hard to do these days.” Williamson’s intervention comes as the government has put pressure on universities to defend access to campuses for controversial speakers. Last month it proposed new freedom of speech legislation that would bring student unions under the surveillance of the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, and appoint a “free speech champion” to its board. The bill would allow academics, students or visiting speakers to seek compensation through the courts if they suffered loss from a university’s policies. Matthew Katzman, Magdalen’s MCR president, told the Daily Telegraph: “It has been taken down. It was decided to leave the common room neutral. That was what this was about. The college will have plenty of depictions of various things, but the common room is meant to be a space for all to feel welcome.”",education
"About 150 Oxford lecturers have announced they will refuse to teach students at Oriel College over its contentious decision not to remove a statue of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes. The college was accused of “institutional racism” last month after its governing body said it would not seek to move the monument from its position outside the building. The academics have now announced a boycott of tutorials to Oriel’s undergraduate students and will refuse to take part in any outreach and access work including undergraduate admissions interviewing. They have also pledged to not participate in recruitment and assessment processes for fellowships at Oriel and other Oriel College appointments, along with boycotting talks, seminars and conferences. One of the signatories to the petition said the boycott was of “discretionary” activities rather than any formal organised teaching or lecturing. In a statement, the academics said: “The collegiate university can only effectively and credibly work to eradicate racism and address the ongoing effects of colonialism today if all the colleges do so. Oriel College’s decision not to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes undermines us all. “Despite votes in favour from its student common rooms and despite an earlier vote of the governing body expressing their wish to remove it, Oriel has now decided not to. “Faced with Oriel’s stubborn attachment to a statue that glorifies colonialism and the wealth it produced for the college, we feel we have no choice but to withdraw all discretionary work and goodwill collaborations.” The statement adds that their decision does not extend to graduate supervision of Oriel students at master’s or DPhil level, delivering lectures at which Oriel students may be present, nor “examination of candidates who are Oriel students for university degrees” and “any duties specified in your contract with your employer”. In June last year, an independent inquiry to examine Rhodes’ legacy was initiated after the governing body of Oriel College “expressed their wish” to remove the statue. Announcing its decision three weeks ago, the college decided against removal, arguing the time frame and cost were “considerable obstacles”. A statement from the Rhodes Must Fall campaign in response described the decision as “an act of institutional racism”. It comes amid a dispute that emerged on Tuesday over a decision to remove the Queen’s portrait at Magdalen College due to concerns over its “colonial links”. Members of the Magdalen College Middle Common Room (MCR), which is made up of graduate students, overwhelmingly voted to remove the picture from their common room. Barrister Dinah Rose, the president of the college, said staff had received “threatening messages” over the controversy and she defended students’ right to “free speech and political debate”. Boris Johnson is said to back Gavin Williamson’s criticism of the students, according to Downing Street, after the education secretary said the was decision “simply absurd”. He has since faced criticism from the University and College Union, which said the comments were a “distraction from the disastrous, systemic failings this government has presided over in higher education”.",education
"Increasing the amount that graduates in England repay on their student loans could save the government close to £4bn each year and avoid universities having their income slashed, according to a report by the architect of the current system of student finance. Nick Hillman, who was special adviser to the universities minister in 2012 when tuition fees in England were raised to £9,000, said lowering the income levels at which students made loan repayments was the fairest and most effective way to keep higher education funded at current levels. Using modelling done for the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), Hillman found that cutting the graduate repayment threshold from £26,000 to £19,000 would result in many more graduates making higher contributions over the 30 years before their loans are written off. The proposal comes as the Treasury is examining how to reduce the cost of the student loan system in England, with outstanding loans reaching £140bn last year. Among the changes mooted include cutting annual tuition fees to £7,500, which many vice-chancellors say would cause severe funding difficulties. Hillman said other alternatives designed to save the government money – such as reducing student numbers or spending less on each student – were less effective and likely to be less politically palatable. “Cutting places at a time of rising demand is particularly unwise, as is giving institutions less for teaching when their finances are already so squeezed,” Hillman said. “Our modelling shows some of the changes to loans that might be made instead. For example, it is possible to reduce the write-off costs by reducing the repayment threshold or extending the repayment period. Such tweaks might not be popular but they could deliver savings if politicians are determined to find them. “Reducing the repayment threshold to under £20,000 raises so much it might even enable new initiatives, such as the return of maintenance grants, alongside saving money.” Under the current system, graduates repay 9% of their income over the first £26,575. Interest is charged on the outstanding amount but the total remaining including interest is wiped off by the government 30 years after graduation. Hepi commissioned modelling by the consultancy London Economics, which estimated that without any changes the direct cost to the government of the 2020-21 cohort of undergraduates was more than £9bn in written off loans for tuition and maintenance. London Economics calculated that the average student debt on leaving would be £47,000, with 54% written off after 30 years. Less than one in eight students would pay off their loans in full, while one in three wouldn’t pay back a penny. Cutting the threshold to £19,300 – the same as it was before 2012 – would mean the write-off would shrink from £9bn to more than £5bn, while the proportion of students paying off their all their loans would double. However, average repayment rates would rise by £10,000. The modelling found that the other proposals were far less effective. Cutting the interest rate charged to that of inflation – a popular proposal for many years – would in fact increase the write-offs as high income graduates made lower total repayments. Extending the repayment window from 30 to 35 years would make only a minimal difference. Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said the proposed changes were regressive, with the biggest impact on low earners. “Ministers, and those in thinktanks, would do well to remember that even lower-earning graduates already spend most of their 30s and 40s paying effective tax rates of over 40%. A threshold reduction to well below the average worker’s salary would make that a reality for many graduates fresh out of university too, making it harder for them to plan and save for the future,” Grady said. Hillman said: “Different changes have different impacts on different groups and we urge policymakers who want to save money by tweaking student loans to use the next few months wisely to ensure the impact is as fair as possible.”",education
"Headteachers in England are calling for examination fee rebates of at least 75% to reflect the additional workload teachers have taken on this year as a result of the cancellation of A-level and GCSE exams for the second year running. With the responsibility for assessing students having largely shifted from exam boards to schools and colleges this summer, nearly two-thirds of school leaders want at least a 75% rebate of exam fees for GCSEs, A-levels and other qualifications, which cost close to £117,000 a year in an average secondary school with a sixth form. A survey of 457 members of the Association of School and College Leaders found that 45% of respondents were in favour of a 75% rebate from exam boards and a further 20% of headteachers thought it should be even more. Less than 2% thought a 25% rebate was adequate. While the exam boards are sympathetic to the additional demands on teachers, there is likely to be dispute over the scale of any rebates, with boards insisting they still face significant costs, including the publication of extensive guidance and materials to support teachers and preparations for a full suite of exams to be run in autumn for the small number of students who wish to take them. It is the second year that public examinations in England have had to be cancelled because of the Covid pandemic. Last year, the exam boards agreed to rebates of about 25%, but according to the ASCL general secretary, Geoff Barton, headteachers feel they are entitled to considerably more this year given the enormous workload that schools and colleges have taken on, at a time when school finances have been further stretched by the pandemic. “Last year, schools and colleges were asked to assess students on the basis of the work that had been completed prior to the lockdown in March, but this year they have been asked to carry out an entire assessment process from scratch in the summer term,” said Barton. Teachers have had to do all the marking, grading and quality assurance that would normally be carried out by exam boards, “so it seems pretty reasonable that they should receive a rebate that is commensurate with this massive task”, said Barton. “We understand that the exam boards have incurred costs such as managing an external quality assurance process but it will be crucial that they set out very clearly and publicly an itemised list of their costs together with the resulting rebate that will be paid to centres, and that they do this as soon as possible.” All three of the leading exam boards said any savings from the changes to exams would be passed back to schools. Pearson warned, however, that a 75% rebate was unrealistic. “Exam fees don’t just cover exams – they cover the delivery of each qualification over a two-year period from first teaching to successful completion of the course and assessment,” a Pearson spokesperson said. A spokesperson for OCR added: “We’ll confirm any savings we can pass on in the form of a rebate as soon as we finalise the costs involved and we hope to do this in July.” AQA confirmed that money normally spent on marking will be given back to schools and colleges, which have also been given the option to pay just half their fees upfront, and the rest once final costs are known.",education
"The Conservative MP Maria Miller has accused Ofsted of a “massive safeguarding failure” after a report by the schools inspectorate showed that sexual harassment and abuse in schools is so commonplace that pupils don’t bother to report it. Miller was chair of the Commons women and equalities select committee five years ago when it published a landmark report that exposed for the first time the scale of sexual harassment, abuse and violence, endured primarily by girls, in England’s schools. “This is not new news,” she said on Twitter, later telling the Guardian that Ofsted should have done more in the interim to ensure that children and young people were listened to and protected from the sexual misconduct revealed so comprehensively in 2016. According to Miller, the government at the time was so shocked by the evidence gathered by the committee that it amended guidance to schools on dealing with sexual harassment before the report was even complete, then went on to issue new guidance. “Most importantly of all, they demanded that Ofsted put into their school inspection framework a specific requirement to look at the reporting and recording of sexual harassment. This was 2016. Ofsted did not bother to change the inspection handbook … until 2019, which I find extraordinary.” Then when inspection data from the revised framework finally showed that just 6% of schools had recorded sexual harassment allegations – despite clear evidence from her report of the true scale of the crisis in schools – Ofsted failed to act, said Miller. “This is a massive safeguarding failure by Ofsted,” she told the Guardian. “I find it extraordinary that Ofsted did not have alarm bells ringing, that this [the 6% finding] demonstrated that schools were not accurately recording or reporting sexual harassment that occurred within their four walls.” She said she was surprised that Ofsted had not apologised. “What’s so shocking [is that] as an inspectorate they are responsible for monitoring safeguarding in our schools. We wouldn’t expect as adults to have our workplaces dominated by people asking us for nude images of ourselves or receiving ‘dick pics’. Yet we are expecting young women in our schools to endure that sort of pressure.” Responding to Miller’s criticism, an Ofsted spokesperson said: “We took the committee’s findings very seriously; our new inspections, in place since 2019, specifically ask schools to provide inspectors with their reports of sexual harassment and violence. “However, our review concluded that underreporting is a real problem. Children are often reluctant to tell teachers, and school leaders have underestimated the prevalence of sexual harassment and online sexual abuse. “Our review found that inspectors have not always been rigorous enough in questioning of schools that claimed to have no recorded incidents of sexual abuse or harassment. In the review, we committed to strengthening our inspections, to be more challenging on these issues.” Ofsted’s report published on Thursday was based on visits to 32 schools, and interviews with more than 900 pupils, and concluded that sexual harassment had become “normalised” for young people, in school, online and in other unsupervised spaces including parks and house parties. It found that teachers “consistently underestimate” the scale of the problem and that sex education in schools was so out of touch with the reality of children’s lives that pupils turned to social media or their peers for information. Miller said many of its recommendations mirrored her own five years ago. One mother whose daughter was raped by a classmate called for a public inquiry into government failure to take action after the 2016 report. “The guidance is still deeply inadequate,” she said, “meaning that girls who have been raped are still being put back in class with their named rapists.” Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said:“We have known about the scale of sexual harassment and sexual violence between young people for years and have repeatedly raised concerns with the government. However, it is shocking to learn it is now so commonplace that young people do not even see the point in reporting it to adults.” The government has pledged a series of actions to address the sexual misconduct crisis in schools, and has asked headteachers to use an inset day to help train staff on how to deal with sexual abuse and harassment among pupils, and how to deliver the government’s new compulsory relationships, sex and health education curriculum. Making a statement to MPs on the Ofsted findings, the children’s minister, Vicky Ford, said: “Let me be clear: sexism and misogyny is not OK. Sexual harassment, let alone non-consensual touching, groping or sexual contact – none of this is OK. “Sending unrequested nudes is not OK and neither is bullying your peers into sending a nude and then sharing it with your mates. And yet this has become commonplace for so many young people. We as government, as parents, educators and as a society must work together to turn the cultural dial.” The minister said the government fully accepted the findings of the Ofsted review and promised to go further on the recommendations put forward by the inspectorate. She also urged to parents to play their part, particularly over children accessing pornography. “As a mum, I know the difficulty in discussing these issues with our children. But parents need to be aware of what their children are doing and how to support them when things go wrong.”",education
"Students should be entitled to compensation if they are adversely affected by the refusal of some Oxford University academics to undertake extra duties for Oriel College over its decision not to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes, Downing Street has said. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said that, while the government supported academic freedom, universities “have a duty to maintain access to good quality tuition” and should take action as needed. The 150 academics involved in the protest are not declining to take part in core teaching, just in outreach and access work, including undergraduate admissions interviewing. They have also pledged to not participate in recruitment and assessment processes for fellowships and other appointments at Oriel, along with boycotting talks, seminars and conferences. The protest follows criticism of Oriel’s decision last month to keep a statue of Rhodes, the leading 19th-century imperialist, despite an independent commission supporting its removal. The college cited “regulatory and financial challenges” in explanation. In a statement, the 150 academics said the decision over the statue “undermines us all”. They said: “Faced with Oriel’s stubborn attachment to a statue that glorifies colonialism and the wealth it produced for the college, we feel we have no choice but to withdraw all discretionary work and goodwill collaborations.” This did not include graduate supervision of Oriel students at master’s or DPhil level, delivering lectures at which Oriel students may be present, nor “examination of candidates who are Oriel students for university degrees” and “any duties specified in your contract with your employer”. Asked about the action, No 10 said: “Students rightly expect to get a good deal from their investment in higher education, and we would expect universities to take appropriate action should any student be seriously affected by these actions, which could include compensation. “We fully believe in protecting academic freedom, but universities have a duty to maintain access to good quality tuition as a priority, especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students already.” It marks the latest intervention by Downing Street on the issue of statues of contentious figures. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had previously welcomed Oriel’s decision to keep the statue. Oxford’s vice-chancellor, Louise Richardson, said she was “deeply disappointed that some of my colleagues would choose to punish students, and prospective students, for the actions of their college’s governing body, especially after the prolonged disruption of teaching during the pandemic”. Earlier on Thursday, a senior academic suggested one option could be to place a sign of apology around the neck of the Rhodes statue. “One of the options offered by the commission was to retain and contextualise so, if the college put up a notice explaining who Cecil Rhodes was, that would be fine,” the academic Robert Gildea, professor of modern history at Oxford and one of the 150 signatories to the statement, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “If the college put a placard around his neck at lunchtime today saying ‘sorry’, that would also be fine. Antony Gormley has suggested that the statue simply be turned the other way and face the wall, that would also be a very interesting idea.” It was announced in June last year that the commission would look into the issue, on which students have been campaigning since 2015, after the toppling of the statue of the British slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. Oriel’s governing body voted in favour of removing the statue of Rhodes, a prominent donor to the college, and that decision was supported by the commission. But the college backtracked. Gildea said the boycott was designed to put pressure on the college to follow through on its promises, which he said students had already sought to do as well. Taking no action was “not acceptable”, he said.",education
"When the government announced its first tranche of Covid recovery funding for schools, Anna Grice, a headteacher at Thameside primary in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, immediately knew where to go, as she had an existing relationship with an established local tutoring charity. She was able to pick up the phone to Quest for Learning, one of the providers on the government’s approved list of catchup tutors, and re-establish their relationship after the long lockdown school closures. The twice-weekly reading comprehension sessions that Tamzin Einon, a qualified teacher, runs with small groups of children are heavily subsidised by the government and painstaking work. Although Oxfordshire is often seen as an affluent county it includes pockets of high disadvantage, and Thameside has above-average numbers of pupils eligible for free school meals and with special educational needs. “Some children haven’t picked up a book during lockdown and have struggled with home learning,” says Grice. “Either they didn’t have good enough devices or internet connection, or parents weren’t confident enough to support their learning or had several children to home school while trying to work from home. “The National Tutoring Programme has been good for us because it has allowed us to work with an established provider for face-to-face teaching.” But will the tutoring programme work? The government’s own research suggests that learning loss for primary children is already two months in English and three months in maths, with wider gaps in some parts of England (notably the much prized “red wall” areas), and the numbers of children off school because of the new Delta variant is increasing. The political fallout from the resignation of Sir Kevan Collins, the catchup chief, after the government’s rejected his £13bn recovery plan, eclipsed the detail of how the government funding – a further £1.4bn for the next three years in addition to £1.7bn currently promised – would be spent. Described by Collins as a “half-hearted approach”, the extra investment amounts to £310 for each pupil over four years and provoked anger and disappointment among school leaders and teacher organisations. That is partly because the tutoring programme, rather than a combination of extra tuition, a longer school day and wider pastoral support that Collins wanted, is now doing the heavy lifting in a plan that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, claims will make sure no child is left behind. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, promised 100 million tutoring hours would be available. But a significant portion of the funding must be spent on the government’s own list of tutors in a contract, currently administered by the education charity the Education Endowment Foundation, that will be taken over in September by the Dutch multinational recruitment agency Randstad, widely thought to have been successful by significantly undercutting other bidders on cost. Not all schools have shared Grice’s positive experience, with some claiming access to high-quality tutors through the national tutoring programme is patchy, and that the scheme is complicated to administer, involves too much online learning, and overlooks the impact of the pandemic on resilience, mental health and social skills. Earlier this year it emerged that the work was being outsourced to tutors as young as 17 in Sri Lanka. Keziah Featherstone, head of Q3 Academy in Tipton, West Midlands, and a member of the Headteachers’ Roundtable thinktank, said her school’s experience had not been good as many tutors were only offering online lessons, and the tutors changed frequently so could not build relationships with pupils. “Initially a number of the approved agencies we contacted said they had no capacity for our school. We are using the school day to tutor students, but this means taking them out of other subjects and creating more gaps in their knowledge. “After so much online learning, pupils are fatigued using technology. They find it difficult to concentrate and resent not having a real person to learn from. Sometimes when students are late to their timeslot, which has happened often due to our Covid safety measures, the tutors have not waited and have logged off. This has made previously keen students very angry and resentful. “We know our students learn best when they feel secure and trust the adults they are working with, and this is impossible when faces change every week.” There are signs that the government is listening to concerns, with more money in the latest announcement going direct to schools so they can make their own arrangement rather than being obliged to use the national tutoring programme. But more than £433m is destined for the NTP from September, and headteacher organisations say that money should go direct to schools. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the government’s fixation with tutoring was “one dimensional”. “Tutoring is certainly one possible solution for students, but the people best placed to identify the widely varying needs of young people are the teachers who see them every day. “Handing the significant national tutoring programme funding direct to schools, with a remit to spend it wisely to benefit their students in whichever way suits them best, seems to us to be a sensible way of addressing the issue of lost learning caused by the pandemic,” he said. According to the Education Endowment Foundation, the centralised tutoring programme was designed to use the best academic evidence about narrowing gaps in outcomes for poorer children and is necessary to combat regional inequalities in the tutoring market. All providers go through a rigorous assessment process and EEF’s chief executive, Prof Becky Francis, said almost 90% of schools were planning to continue their provision next year. “We have encouraged feedback from schools over the course of the school year, and should any school have specific concerns we would urge them to contact us direct,” she said. The scheme will be fully evaluated by the EEF and government, but by then much of the money will have been spent. Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at Exeter University, who presented a blueprint for a national tutoring service to government last year, believes massively scaling up from small well-resourced trials is difficult, especially if you are trying to do it on the cheap. “The outcomes are unlikely to be as good,” he said. Elliot Major is a longstanding advocate of a national tutoring service, having researched the advantages conferred on middle class pupils whose parents top up their school education with private coaching. But he believes the government is making a mistake in tapering down its investment over the next three years, at the end of which schools will be expected to fund the service themselves. “Tutoring is inevitably going to be popular with policymakers because it is easier to quantify than other interventions, it resonates with parents and evidence shows that one-to-one and small group tuition is very effective,” he says. “But if you really want to level up the playing field, a national tutoring programme should be there for as long as we have the disadvantage gap. And everything in education is about variation or consistency. If you are promising 100m hours of tuition you need to be very sure it is uniformly good quality, and if you are handing all the money over to schools, they also need to be held to account for how they spend it.” Featherstone acknowledges that the government’s intentions are good but says the money is not enough and the implementation of the tutoring plan has dented confidence that the necessary gains for the most disadvantaged pupils will be made. “Ultimately no one activity will fully enable students to recover, and every school will be different. I would hope that the DfE [Department for Education] would be celebrating the knowledge, skills, and dedication of its school leaders, not tying their hands with directives.”",education
"England’s exam regulator wanted to scrap last year’s A-levels but backed down rather than risk a “foolish” confrontation with the government, leading to the disastrous use of an algorithm to award grades, the regulator’s former chair has revealed. Breaking his silence for the first time since resigning as chair of Ofqual, Roger Taylor said the regulator wanted to issue “non-qualification” leaving certificates in place of A-levels last summer, when it became clear that socially distanced exams could not be safely taken. But ministers said GCSE and A-level grades should be issued, based on a “colossal error of judgment” that awarding grades calculated by algorithm would be acceptable to the public, according to Taylor. Ofqual’s algorithm was scrapped after public outcry and a week of furious infighting between the watchdog and the Department for Education that culminated in grades instead being awarded on the basis of teacher assessment – a policy that will be repeated this year. In a paper for the Centre for Progressive Policy, billed as “reflections on qualifications and the pandemic”, Taylor says it was wrong to blame the algorithm that took account of prior attainment and school performance. “The mistakes were made by humans, not machines,” Taylor said. “The problem was not the algorithm, it was what we were trying to do with it: it was human decision-making that failed.” Taylor claims the decision to award grades via data and algorithm by the governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was initially backed by a broad consensus among the public and policymakers. But the consensus disappeared when it became clear what the consequences would be for students missing out on university places. Taylor says policymakers were “hopelessly naive” to distribute university places “on the basis of an estimate of what might have happened if exams had taken place”. By August last year, Taylor said the initial optimism among governments was replaced by “a queasiness about the whole plan”. The best solution in the absence of exams would have been to expand the number of places available at university to compensate: “Allowing a much larger number of students to be admitted would limit the number who were wrongly excluded,” Taylor said. “This option was, to my knowledge, never seriously considered. But by a painful, chaotic and unplanned route, it is where all four countries ended up.” The 2020 exam debacle “has given algorithms a reputation as a mechanism for injustice” that is undeserved, according to Taylor. “It prompts the question of why exams are fair in normal times, when pupils also experience very different levels of educational support, differences that are reflected in the exam results they achieve.” Taylor’s comments came after research found that scrapping the algorithm-based grades in favour of those awarded by teacher assessment benefited students from highly educated backgrounds. A study by academics at UCL and the LSE found that students whose parents were graduates were 15% more likely to get a better grade from their teachers last year than from the process created by Ofqual. Charlotte Alldritt, director of the Centre for Progressive Policy, said: “The events of 2020 plunged the government into a trap of its own making. The system delivered to replace exam results merely replicated past patterns of inequality and attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged children across the country, showing a blatant disregard for individuals.” Instead, Alldritt argues: “The pandemic has shown that examination results can and should only ever be part of a wider set of information available to young people, employers, education providers and policymakers.”",education
"My friend Jane Struthers, who has died of cancer aged 70, devoted her career in university admissions to expanding the educational opportunities of young people from less affluent and multi-ethnic backgrounds. She was born in Doncaster, the youngest of three children of John Minto, a bus driver, and Kathleen (nee Cook). Her parents divorced when Jane was young, and she was brought up by her mother with help from her maternal grandmother. It was here, in a mining area of South Yorkshire, that Jane developed her strong political views. For most of her life she was a member of the Labour party. Jane attended Mexborough grammar school where she became head girl and a member of the debating society. Between 1969 and 1972 she read economics at Newnham College, Cambridge. I remember meeting her on our first day. Tall and attractive, Jane was never overawed by the more privileged members of the university, often holding court at coffee breaks in the faculty library. At Cambridge, she met Stephen Struthers, a fellow student, and they were married in 1977. On graduating, Jane worked at the British Council before moving to Keele University in 1974. There she became involved with student admissions, to which she devoted the rest of her career. In 1988 she moved to Oxford University, in due course becoming director of undergraduate admissions. This was a demanding role, requiring highly tuned administrative and diplomatic skills, liaising between the university, colleges and academic departments. There was also an important external dimension to her work, with periodic maelstroms of media interest that she had to field – most notably in 2000 when Laura Spence, a high-flying state-school pupil, failed to secure a place for medicine. Jane was passionate about widening access to the university, and used the public scrutiny to promote it. Schools’ liaison work was strengthened and she was instrumental in setting up the first summer schools programme with the Sutton Trust, which gave students from less privileged backgrounds an insight into life at Oxford. With Cambridge, she established annual conferences at major sports grounds around the country to debunk misconceptions that may deter bright students from applying to Oxbridge. In 2005 Jane underwent surgery to remove the first of two brain tumours. Following a lengthy rehabilitation, she retired from the university but continued to live an active life, volunteering for a number of local organisations. She and Stephen hosted language students and they also became “education guardians”, taking care of two boys on scholarships from Hong Kong; both are now at university and owe much to Jane’s guidance and support. Jane bore her final illness with the same stoicism and courage she had always shown. She was warm, funny, generous and a wonderful friend. She is survived by Stephen, their children, William and Harriet, and four grandchildren, Lucie, Arthur, Henry and Raphael, and her brother, John.",education
"The University of Leicester has threatened to strip an 81-year-old professor emeritus of his title after he posted comments on social media criticising the institution, which is currently facing a strike ballot over redundancies. Peter Armstrong, who accepted the offer of emeritus status when he retired from the university in 2010, told followers on Twitter that management had threatened to rescind the honorary title because his comments breached the university’s “dignity at work” policy. Armstrong, a leading scholar in the field of critical accounting, is one of multiple academics to publicly criticise developments at Leicester University, where staff are holding a ballot for strike action over plans for up to 145 redundancies across five academic departments and three professional services units. Criticism has focused not only on the way in which the redundancies have been handled, but also on governance of the university’s finances and broader concerns about restructuring and the direction in which the university is being steered. The university has also been accused of attempting to “intimidate and silence staff” who speak out. The University and College Union, which is balloting its Leicester members over industrial action, says management have denied that there are financial reasons for the planned redundancies and have therefore refused to share data on finances with unions. According to the UCU, however, the 2019-20 financial statements show the university’s finances are fragile. Leicester is one of a small number of universities to have accessed the Bank of England’s Covid corporate financing facility, borrowing £60m. Armstrong, who has amended his profile page to read “former professor emeritus”, has posted numerous highly critical, often irreverent, comments on Twitter. On governance at the university, he posted: “There’s something drastically wrong with the governance @uniofleicester when a small cabal of no more than half a dozen people can steer it into near insolvency, then wreck cultures of research and teaching decades in the making to cover up their mistakes.” In another, a follow-up to an earlier tweet, he said: “I accept that I should not have said that the @uniofleicester managers who were bullying a clearly distressed young academic ‘should be slapped across the neck with a stocking full of diarrhea’. I am sure that readers can suggest an appropriate alternative.” Armstrong has since posted extracts from a letter from university management which stated: “If [your] social media activity continues in the same manner as I have outlined, the university will recommend to council that the title of professor emeritus conferred in you by council be removed. “If approved, we would no longer support the privileges associated with the title, which include access to the library and the provision of an IT account.” According to the tweet, the letter was signed by Prof Henrietta O’Connor, pro vice-chancellor at Leicester. Asked about Armstrong, the University of Leicester refused to comment on individual cases, but in a statement said: “All members of the university community are expected to behave with respect and courtesy at all times, and adhere to the values and behaviours outlined in our dignity and respect policy. “We are firmly committed to creating an inclusive learning, working and research environment characterised by respect and dignity, and free from harassment, bullying, abuse and discrimination. We take any reports of unacceptable behaviours seriously and will investigate any concerns raised, taking action where necessary.” On redundancies and criticism of management, a spokesperson said: “The proposed changes we are consulting on are not driven by the need for financial savings but focus on our long-term strategy for the university. “Our decision to participate in the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) from the Bank of England was a precautionary measure in a year where we have made capital investment in projects which will significantly improve the student experience, and contribute to the university’s pioneering work in space research. “Pre-change engagement with staff and unions has been underpinned by the University’s Leading and Managing Change Principles, which were developed in consultation with, and then agreed by, the three recognised trade unions in 2018.” Dr Sarah Seaton, chair of Leicester UCU, said: “Our leaders’ behaviour over the past months and years betrays the poverty of their vision and their abdication of moral responsibility. Our university celebrates its centenary this year. But if we are to flourish in our second 100 years as we did in our first, we need new leadership.”",education
"Gavin Williamson’s claim that “out-of-control behaviour” could destroy the atmosphere in England’s schools has been rejected by teachers and children’s advocates, with experts saying there is no evidence pupil conduct has worsened since lockdown. The education secretary made the remarks as he announced the start of a national network of “behaviour hubs” designed to spread best practice among schools and teachers. Williamson said some children had been slow to readjust to the classroom because “the lack of regular structure and discipline will inevitably have had an effect on their behaviour”. He added: “Out-of-control behaviour will also destroy the wholesome and happy environment that every school should be, leading to bullying, and turning the playground from a place of joy to a jungle.” Williamson concluded: “There is nothing Dickensian about a classroom that is a well-ordered, disciplined environment, where firm and fair teaching gives every child the chance to learn and develop at their own pace without fear of distraction.” But Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Children’s Society, said: “The pandemic has been harmful to children and young people in so many ways. It has left many feeling isolated, missing friends and family and more exposed to risks both inside and outside the home. “Despite this, we are not aware of any evidence that their behaviour is worse, and our practitioners report that on the whole young people have been relieved to get back inside the classroom.” Wes Streeting, the shadow schools minister, said Williamson was blaming parents for lacking discipline when his own leadership “has been a chaotic shambles”. Mary Bousted, a joint leader of the National Education Union, said: “With all the challenges currently facing schools, playing to the gallery by talking tough on behaviour is the least useful approach the education secretary can take.” But Williamson’s promise to consider new guidelines on the use of mobile phones gained backing from the NASUWT teachers’ union, which has long campaigned for mobiles to be banned in school to stop distraction and reduce bullying on social media. Patrick Roach, NASUWT’s general secretary, said while many schools had excellent conduct, “some schools require further support to secure and sustain high standards of pupil behaviour”. The new behaviour hubs are part of a £10m effort by the government to improve the guidance available to classroom teachers and school leaders, after an 2019 election pledge by Boris Johnson. Stuart Lock, the chief executive of the Advantage Schools trust, which includes one of the 22 schools named as hubs, said: “I don’t believe classroom behaviour has got worse than it was before the pandemic. It is probably a bit better. We have a responsibility to make sure that poor behaviour doesn’t hold any pupils back.” Lock said the factors that may have led to improved behaviour included pupils being explicitly taught safety routines as part of Covid-19 precautions, and schools working with families and pupils to ensure they supported the management of behaviour. “These are factors that I think can contribute to good conduct at all times and post-pandemic. It’s when we take conduct for granted without explicitly working on these factors that we risk behaviour standards declining,” Lock said. The government’s new training project will be led by Tom Bennett, the DfE’s lead adviser on behaviour. “We’ve got some evidence that lockdown was very stressful for some children, and some evidence that it was stressful for staff as well,” Bennett said, but he said there was no evidence so far of long-term damage to children. “To be honest, the picture on behaviour we’re seeing is reasonably consistent with the behaviour we were seeing before the pandemic.”",education
"Universities are turning up the pressure on the government after they were excluded from the next phase of lockdown easing, with one asking its students to lobby MPs for campuses to reopen for in-person teaching. The move by the University of Portsmouth comes at a time of deepening concern among vice-chancellors that the government could delay full campus reopening until mid-May, leaving students of humanities, social sciences, business and law insufficiently prepared for exams that start that month. “My students have tolerated a lot of disruption this academic year and almost all have behaved extremely well. So to hear on Monday about what will reopen next week but for there to be complete silence on when or even if all of my students will be able to get back into the classroom is unacceptable,” said Portsmouth’s vice-chancellor, Graham Galbraith. “Universities don’t normally ask their students to write to their MPs, it is not how we operate. But it has become abundantly clear that this government is not listening to universities or to the evidence. It might, though, listen to its MPs if they get a mailbag of angry letters from students and their parents.” About 1 million students who are not studying for practical degrees still do not know when they will be able to receive in-person teaching again for the first time since campuses closed in early December. In Portsmouth’s message to its students, the deputy vice-chancellor, Paul Hayes, said there was no evidence that face-to-face teaching in Covid-secure environments posed a considerable infection risk, and it was safer than other activities that will be permitted from 12 April such as going to a hairdresser, wedding, gym or pub. Hayes wrote: “It staggers me that the government will not allow us to offer all of you face-to-face teaching. And it beggars belief that we have no explanation why.” The message includes a template letter for students to send to their MPs, warning that delaying reopening “hurts students, benefits no one and is inconsistent with other government decisions”. It asks that MPs pressure Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, and the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, to fix a timeline for reopening. Universities UK, which represents all vice-chancellors, has written to Boris Johnson, criticising the government for a “communications vacuum” that has left universities unable to prepare for the final term. The letter, signed by UUK’s president, Julia Buckingham, notes that universities have been “instrumental in vaccine development” and have spent millions of pounds on making their campuses Covid-secure. “The UK government owes [staff and students] a clear explanation about why decisions have been taken and how students and universities will be supported,” Buckingham wrote. In a press briefing, she described the summer term as a “crucial time of the academic year” in which students are preparing for final exams that determine whether they progress to the next year or graduate. The failure to announce a date for campus reopening is the latest setback in a tumultuous year for students. Many are angry that they were persuaded to sign up for a year’s accommodation through promises in the summer that they would receive in-person teaching and a conventional university experience.  Instead, the disruption caused by the pandemic has left many struggling to pay rent on rooms that have been empty for months. A survey carried out by the National Union of Students in March suggested that more than a fifth had been unable to afford their rent over the past four months, while more than two-thirds (70%) were worried about paying their rent over the coming year. “Instead of legislating to support students to leave their tenancies early, as they did in Scotland, the government has left students to rely on charitable handouts from universities, hardship funds, and be at the whim of huge, exploitative accommodation companies and private landlords unwilling to offer rent reductions,” said Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president. “We urgently need a true student support package to put money back in students’ pockets now.” New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that three-quarters of students are living at the address where they started university in September, in some cases defying government guidance to remain where they spent Christmas. The ONS data also suggests that campus closures and online learning have taken a toll on student wellbeing, with 29% struggling with loneliness, compared with 7% of the general population. However, the figures also show that fewer students reported worsening mental health (63% in March, compared with 67% in February). A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Students on practical and creative courses started returning from 8 March, and we will be reviewing options for the timing of the return of all remaining students by the end of the Easter holidays. Decisions will take into account the need to protect progress across the wider roadmap out of the pandemic, including the spread of the virus in communities and pressures on the NHS.”",education
"Fears are growing over how GCSEs and A-levels will be awarded in England this summer, with headteachers under pressure to carry out an “excessive” number of assessments on students and use historical data about previous pupils’ past performance to “unjustly” suppress the grades of individual high achievers. New government guidance, issued to headteachers shortly before the Easter holidays, has sent schools in England into a state of panic and is unfair on pupils, teachers say. Some schools are asking GCSE students to sit as many as 35 exams over the next four to six weeks, so that they have recent evidence to justify the grades they are awarding. But before they hand out any grades, headteachers have been instructed by Ofqual to consider their school’s results in previous years “as a guide to help them to check that their judgments are not unduly harsh or lenient”. Last summer, Ofqual created a controversial algorithm that relied on historical data about a school’s previous performance to determine the grades of pupils unable to take their exams during the pandemic. Thousands of bright pupils at poor-performing and improving state schools saw their results unfairly downgraded from their teachers’ assessments as a result. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said there was a risk that Ofqual’s guidance could distort results and lead to inappropriate grades being awarded this summer, too. “It may suppress the grades of a year group which has more able students than in the previous years. It could lead to injustices,” she said. “It’s imposing a data-driven outcome rather than an achievement-driven outcome.” Teachers are expected to award students evidence-based grades, with more recent evidence deemed to be more representative of student performance, according to the recent guidance issued to schools by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ). This has sent schools into an evidence-gathering frenzy. At one London comprehensive, pupils taking 10 GCSEs have 35 separate assessments to do over the next six weeks. “It is intimidating,” said one 16-year-old, who did not wish to be named. “I’m trying not to think about it so that I don’t get stressed.” Headteacher Jules White, leader of the WorthLess? school funding campaign, agreed headteachers across England are feeling under pressure to gather the evidence they need: “There is a danger schools will carry out too many exams when the whole point is that they were cancelled because everyone agreed that they couldn’t be carried out fairly. A range of evidence should be used rather than solely re-running exams by the backdoor.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We trust teachers’ decisions on grading and the evidence they need to assess pupils. JCQ has published guidance to support teachers, schools and colleges with their processes, including on using historic data, helping to maximise consistency across the country and fairness.” She added that the guidance is clear that grading judgments should not be driven by this data. A spokesperson for Ofqual said it had been “mindful of the impact on teacher workload. We expect teachers to use a range of evidence to arrive at a grade, and to use their professional judgment when deciding how to assess and grade their students.” Schools, it said, “will be required, as part of their overall quality assurance, to consider the performance of this year’s cohort compared to previous years when exams have taken place, to make sure they have not been overly lenient or harsh in their assessmentsof the 2021 cohort. They are not expected to use information from previous years to artificially suppress grades.”",education
"Three years ago, a miraculous thing happened to Andria Zafirakou, a 42-year-old art teacher at the Alperton community school in the north London borough of Brent. Out of all the 100,000,000 teachers in the world, she was named No 1, Global Teacher of the Year. Zafirakou, who had been nominated by students and colleagues, was awarded that honour at a ceremony in Dubai, along with a cheque for $1m, hers to do with as she pleased. She was so gobsmacked to have won the award, to be up there on the stage clutching the trophy and the cheque, that she had not the first clue what to do with the money. She still felt that way the following day when she was driven by limousine straight from the airport to Downing Street, where she had been invited for tea with Theresa May, the prime minister, and afterwards when she met with the schools minister, Nick Gibb, and a roomful of education grandees, and representatives of the Varkey Foundation, which made the award. Gibb, it turned out, was there to offer Zafirakou another “prize”, this one a job: he was delighted to announce that the government wanted her to become the new face of a recruitment drive to bring more people into teaching. You don’t have to spend long with Zafirakou to realise that she doesn’t stop smiling very easily. (“Have you seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding?” she asked me when we met last week at her school. “Well, that’s me and my family.”) But when Gibb offered her a promotional leaflet concerning that job, the grin left her face for the first time in 48 hours. She said that she would think about his offer - which was not the answer the minister, primed for a photo opportunity, wanted to hear. Why the hesitation, she was asked, and the room fell quiet. And so, she explained. “I don’t think this government has done enough to support the arts,” she began. “For example,” she said to Gibb, “you introduced the EBacc [the narrowed exam metric that insists schools concentrate on “core” subjects]. The British fashion industry has some of the best designers in the world, yet you killed the textiles curriculum. My curriculum. Where will the designers of the future come from now?” The minister started to speak, but Zafirakou had not finished. “In my world, I teach children who often have English as a second language,” she said, “and the arts are one of a handful of subjects, alongside maths, that give them a level playing field. Why is that not important to this government?” And then, as the minister tried to head her off again with data and jargon, she told him how, contrary to his understanding, education was not about schools meeting targets, or league tables, it was about two things: it was about children, and it was about teachers. And as she was saying that, she knew immediately what she wanted to do with the million dollars she had just been awarded. “If the government isn’t going to do anything to help these kids,” she thought, “then I will.” Zafirakou still teaches art at Alperton community school. She passed on the opportunity to become a millionaire. Instead, she used the prize fund to establish a charity that promotes an artist-in-residence model in schools like hers – providing students not only with inspiration and practical advice, but with living examples that a creative career is possible. Sitting across the room from her in her school office, as she explains some of this, I can’t help but wonder if the thought ever crossed her mind that she might keep just a little of that million dollars for herself – at least enough for a new car, or a holiday with her husband and their two daughters? Not for a second, she says. “I literally grew up in this school. And I think if I was to go and just take this money, I wouldn’t feel comfortable. Even my mom said to me, there’s no way you were ever going to keep that money, was there? You know, if it had been the national lottery… hell, yes. But this? I am who I am because of the colleagues around me, and the kids that I teach.” Zafirakou’s Global Teacher award is on a shelf in one corner of the room. All the walls around us are covered with dazzling paintings and artwork from some of the students she has taught in the 15 years she has been here. She makes a point of buying the pieces. “I remember when I did my own GCSE,” she says, “and two members of staff bought some of my work, my chemistry teacher and my English teacher. I could not believe that they would buy something I’d made – it was, like, £30 or something at that time. So what I do, when students of mine through the years have an exhibition, I just ask: ‘How much do you want for this?’, and I buy bits and pieces.” She always likes to give her students an idea that there is real-world value to what they do. And she likes to keep the art around her, because each piece tells her a story. Zafirakou shares some of these stories in her new book, Those Who Can, Teach, a memoir of her time in the classroom, told through the lives and experiences of some of her most memorable and hard-to-reach pupils. Alperton school is just off the North Circular in London, not far from Wembley stadium, in one of the most diverse corners of the capital, high on every measure of social deprivation. One of the reasons that Zafirakou won her award was that she taught herself the rudiments of the 35 languages that her students spoke, so she could greet each of them and make them feel a little more at home. Some of her pupils have been recent arrivals to Britain; some have escaped war; many have chaotic home lives, families living in single rooms, forever anxious about food to eat, clothes to wear. The stories she tells, of bringing these students to life in her art lessons, are little parables of possibility. They tell of students who have unlocked trauma through their drawing, or who have spoken for the first time because they found a home in the art room. There is, for example, the story of Alvaro, who spends the first weeks of his school life entirely silent, staring into the space ahead of him, desperate it seems to just disappear. Slowly, with the help of pencils and paper, Zafirakou explains how she first helped Alvaro to draw: tiny, lost, little images in the middle of huge sheets of paper to begin with; then how to speak, and then how to belong. Or there is Leroy in year 7, whose single mother works every night as a nurse. Leroy sleeps through lessons and term after term arrives at school in unchanging clothes – Zafirakou, typically, eventually starts washing and drying his uniform while he has an afternoon of PE, and returning it to his peg so the other kids won’t notice. Or there are the dozens of kids who need safeguarding, or who do their (inspired) homework on loo roll because it’s the only paper at home, or who explain that they did their best but had to sit on the stairs or in the bathtub to find a bit of quiet to concentrate. I haven’t read a book for a long time that so often had me close to tears – not for the deprivations described, but for the everyday efforts to overcome them. Since her award, Zafirakou has been invited to many conferences and forums across the world as a guest speaker. To begin with she did not know what to say – she had no grand philosophy of education – so instead she told these stories of her pupils, the stories in her book, the kind of stories that every good teacher “has ingrained”, she believes. They are, obviously, not all stories with happy endings. She is haunted by the children who disappear from the structure of school, back into chaos. “You always learn from a child,” she says, “and those lessons stay with you.” Sometimes, the lessons reappear out of nowhere. She laughs. “There was this boy who was like a kleptomaniac in year 7. He used to always do our heads in, constant battles and detentions. A couple of months ago I was on duty by the bus stop and this car screeched to a halt by me, black tinted windows and this huge guy jumps out and runs toward me, and I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God, what’s this?’ I had my shield on and my face mask, and he comes up and he lifts me up in this huge hug. It was this boy. ‘Miss, do you remember me? Miss, I’m so proud of you.’” I mention to Zafirakou that old cliche that insists “teachers shouldn’t have to be social workers”. But her book, page by page, makes a nonsense of the phrase. Does she wish there was more of a separation between those roles? “Anyone who teaches in a school like this one knows that comes with it,” she says. “I don’t think it’s the same in every country. But in the UK, it is assumed the school will do absolutely everything. It shouldn’t be that way.” There is a sentence in her book that might seem reductive to many people, but which seems a useful starting place: “The whole point of school,” she writes, “is to get every student through the day as a normal child.” She talks me through some of the measures that a school like Alperton has to invest in to achieve that, the mental health first aiders and the mental health supervisors and the visiting psychologists – all provisions that have been stretched to breaking point by the pandemic. But then, at the same time, she tells me how every day in her art room is an invariable joy, and you don’t doubt her. “The first day back after lockdown I had my crazy year 8s,” she says. “I came out of that class absolutely exhausted, my throat was hurting me. But we all loved every second back in that environment. They were loud, teasing and joking. But brilliant work was getting done. It takes you weeks to get to that point with those classes, but then they are with you.” Zafirakou grew up in Camden Town. Her parents, the children of Greek immigrants who left Cyprus when war broke out in 1959, tried to prevent her from doing art at GCSE, and from going to art school, impressing upon her that she needed a “proper profession”. It was only through the intervention of a cousin, who had seen her art work, that she managed eventually to follow her vocation. She has the same conversations now with the predominantly Hindu and Gujarati parents of her students, and comes armed with statistics. “The kids will say they want to do art and the father will insist they are going to be an accountant,” she says. She tells them about architecture and graphic design, points to the research that suggests kids who pursue a passion for creative subjects make better scientists – and happier adults. The constant messaging from the government that creative subjects are not “real” doesn’t help. “One of the best things about winning the award,” she says, “was the fact I was an art teacher. I think what we’ve become really good at in this country is segregating things. If you have a look at any science, the relationship with creative thinking has always been huge. So why are we still putting our students in boxes? I remember when I was training at Saint Martins, people used to just go: ‘Oh, if you’re a British designer, you’ll be getting a job just like that.’ Why do we refuse to recognise that talent?” One of the things she takes aim at in her book is the prevailing political idea that schools should be results-focused and concentrate on discipline. That might be appropriate for some schools, she suggests, but Gavin Williamson’s “silent corridors” model is never going to be the answer for the kids she writes about. They need spaces to create and to find their voices; she has been instrumental in helping to shape an out-of-hours and weekend roster of clubs and activities – including the “simple acts of kindness” club – that would be a match for any public school. “The problem is, every education secretary comes along, and if they have had a good education, they believe that’s the model for everyone: ‘I failed in art, therefore art is useless.’” The first principle of any school, she believes, has surely to be that every child is different. When the news of her prize was first announced, there was predictable sniping in the readers’ comments section of the Daily Mail: “Teachers should only talk in English”, all of that… What’s her response? “How would those people connect with a child who has just come to the school and can’t speak a word of English? A few words help, but give them some paints and a bit of paper and they might just blow you away, GCSE standard already. With that little bit of confidence, the amount of progress they make elsewhere is incredible.” While we are talking, after the end of the school day, Zafirakou’s elder daughter is waiting in the classroom next door; it is, I discover, her 12th birthday today, and her admirable patience has been bought with the prospect of a Wagamama takeaway later. I wonder how her daughters feel – the teacher’s curse – about having to share their mother with so many other children. She laughs. “I’ve got that brilliant support mechanism – my family, parents, brother and sister all live round the corner. I don’t think I would have ever been able to do what I’ve done if it wasn’t for them. And, of course, the girls like the fact that their mum’s on Google.” Still, as she has taken on more and more pastoral and leadership responsibilities at school, the work never stops. She often gets asked by newly qualified teachers: “What’s the secret to work-life balance?” “And, honestly, in this job, I’ve no idea what it is,” she says. “Because I haven’t mastered it.” One of the things that has struck me reading her book, I say, is how far removed it is from the detail of those classic myths of teaching – Goodbye, Mr Chips, To Serve Them All My Days – yet how similar it is in principle. Her commitment to this particular school reveals the power of longevity – she was inspired by a brilliant headteacher when she first arrived – and the way that, with staying power, you can make incremental positive changes in even the toughest environment. She agrees with that, and has no plans to leave. “But I am the anomaly,” she says. “In teaching, these days normally, it’s three years, five years, then you move on. But since I’ve been here we’ve had different heads, the school’s been rebuilt, and the challenge has always been there,” she smiles. “It’s never comfy and cosy here, you know, there’s always something that you need to get your teeth into. But that’s what I love.”",education
"City, University of London is to rename its business school after the 18th-century nonconformist theologian and mathematician Thomas Bayes after ditching the name of Sir John Cass, a merchant who made much of his fortune from the slave trade. The university stripped the Cass name from its campus last summer after students raised concerns in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. City’s president, Prof Sir Paul Curran, said: “The renaming of the business school marks the start of a new chapter in City’s history, but certainly not the end of our work to address racial inequality.” The university, which is based in Islington, said it would also fund a scholarship programme for black UK-domiciled undergraduate students to “improve under-representation within the school”. Only 2% of the business school’s undergraduates were black between 2015 and 2019. The new programme, which will run for 10 years from 2022-23, will offer 10 scholarships a year covering all tuition fees and an annual £6,000 stipend. City will also fund five PhD scholarships for black British students each year. The school will be formally renamed the Bayes Business School on 6 September. Until then it will be referred to as the Business School (formerly Cass). City University had renamed its business school in honour of Cass in 2002 after a £5m donation from the Sir John Cass’s Foundation. The foundation, which was established in 1748 to support disadvantaged young people in London, has been renamed the Portal Trust. Bayes, who died in 1761, was best known for his foundational work on conditional probability. His grave is in Bunhill Fields, opposite the business school. The Bayes theorem suggests that we get closer to the truth by constantly updating our beliefs in proportion to the weight of new evidence. “It is this idea, not only the person, that is the motivation behind adopting this name,” the university said in a statement.",education
"Few schools and colleges are to rely solely on internal exam results to set A-level and GCSE grades this year, although most schools in England say exams will remain the most important factor in assessing their pupils’ results this summer. A snap poll of state and independent secondary schools by the Association of School and College Leaders found that just 7% said they would rely entirely on tests “sat in exam-style conditions” to assess final grades, despite fears among parents and families that many schools would try to replicate the traditional exam season. Formal exams to award grades for A-levels and GCSEs were scrapped by the government in England at the start of this year during the winter lockdown, with teacher-based assessments to be used to award grades instead for more than a million students. Ofqual and the Department for Education have given schools and colleges wide latitude and broad guidelines in how they make assessments, with the examination boards producing banks of optional exam questions to use for internal tests. The ASCL survey of more than 500 head teachers and college principals found that 53% said that they would award grades based on a combination of tests and non-exam evidence but with “greater weighting” given to the exam-style papers, while 26% said they would give roughly equal weight to tests and other areas of study. Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, said: “We understand that the public may be confused by the fact that, on one hand, the government cancelled public exams, and on the other hand, many schools will be using exam-style questions and papers to assess students. “However, there are sound reasons for this approach and it is important to understand that schools will be formulating these assessments in line with their knowledge of the content their students have been able to cover during the pandemic. “A big challenge is obviously going to be ensuring that standards are consistent nationally across all these different approaches. Schools and colleges will be assessing evidence against common grade descriptors, and there will be internal and external quality assurance processes. Everything possible is being done to ensure that grades are fair and consistent.” Just 6% of schools and colleges said their grades would be based only on “non-exam evidence,” while a further 6% said that while they would use both in making their assessments, they would give greater weight to a pupil’s performance outside exams. Those basing grades entirely on exam results said the disruption caused by lockdowns and isolation made it hard to identify other evidence to use, as well as assurance that the entire class was being assessed on the same basis. Those rejecting the use of exams said the disruption affected pupils differently, so that teacher assessment was the only fair method. Teachers will be expected to draw on a range of evidence when determining pupils’ grades, including coursework and the questions provided by exam boards. The tests are not required to be taken in exam conditions, and schools have full flexibility in choosing how and where students take them. Barton said he wasn’t surprised about the “variability in approaches” given there were few parameters for school and college leaders to be guided by. “But it is important that parents, politicians and the commentariat understand that there is no one-size-fits-all model out there, and nobody thinks that any of this is ideal,” Barton said. A spokesperson for the exam regulator Ofqual said: “Teachers and school leaders have discretion to decide how to arrive at their judgments of a student’s performance, based on what they have been taught. The arrangements in place give teachers flexibility on how and when to assess their students, and the materials they use to do so.”",education
"A-levels are too narrow and should be replaced with a three-year “baccalaureate” that covers all academic, applied and technical courses, according to a new report by the EDSK education thinktank. As part of the proposed changes, all students would be required to study English and maths up to the age of 18, in line with other developed nations. Rather than narrowing choices down to three A-level subjects at the age of 16, the baccalaureate would allow students to retain more breadth in their studies and only gradually specialise over the three-year programme. The EDSK report says the dominance of A-levels in the English education system has relegated applied and technical courses to second-class status. Last year 83% of school and college leavers studied A-levels. Under the proposals, A-levels, BTecs, T-levels and apprenticeships would be combined into the single baccalaureate, enabling students to mix and match courses which would be marked using the same grading and accountability system for all. Tom Richmond, EDSK director and former adviser at the Department for Education, said: “Given that A-levels were originally created to prevent students from specialising too early and only studying a narrow range of subjects, it is ironic that this famous qualification brand has never fulfilled this mission and might have made the situation even worse. “No other developed country would describe studying just three subjects for two years as a ‘gold standard’. On the contrary, other major economies typically insist that students take around six to eight subjects in their final years at school or college to ensure they receive a broad and balanced education.” Richmond added: “If the current government is serious about boosting technical education, it must end the political obsession with A-levels by introducing a baccalaureate that creates a level playing field for a broad range of rigorous academic, applied and technical courses.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “We do need to look again at A-levels as part of a wider review of qualifications and the curriculum. Whether that means scrapping them is a moot point and there are arguments for and against. “But what does need to be addressed is the fact that for far too long vocational subjects and qualifications have been perceived as having less worth than academic subjects.” The Department for Education is keen to hold on to a diverse range of post-16 education options and is now reviewing its post-16 technical qualifications at level 3 and below to ensure they are high quality and can lead to skilled employment or further study.",education
"For Alex Barnes*, head of a large secondary school in Yorkshire, the stresses of being in charge in the pandemic became too much. Last spring, just at the end of the first lockdown, she reached breaking point. “The demands were coming at me from every angle,” she says. “Worried parents bombarding me with questions, teachers and their unions demanding assurances that the school was safe. I became desperately worried that I’d be responsible for a rise in infections. “One night I went home to my husband and said, ‘I don’t think I can do this any more.’ The look of shock on his face. He had never heard me speak like that before.”  Sophie Barwell* was just six months into her first headship when Covid struck. Suddenly she found it lonely at the top.  “All our teachers had ancient laptops they couldn’t use for remote working,” she says. The school’s finances were low. “Things reached crisis point,” says Barwell, “when I had to write complex health and safety assessments and I had no knowledge of how to do it. “I just hadn’t anticipated the anxiety and how much that would damage me and my family. I’m worried that I’m suddenly going to stop functioning, that I’m going to have a heart attack walking along the corridor.” Before the pandemic, Barwell had been supported informally by other local heads. “Those networks collapsed because every head was having to manage the crisis themselves,” she says. “I haven’t had more than five hours’ sleep a night over the last year. I wake up at 4am, get up and fire off emails.” Union leaders are now increasingly concerned about the number of heads who are struggling to cope. Sara Ford, of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says: “We are phenomenally worried about our members’ physical and mental health.” A February ASCL survey of members found nearly a half of respondents claimed that their workload was no longer manageable. More worrying still, 55% of headteachers are thinking of leaving their current role as soon as the pandemic ends. Heads want to see schools through this emergency, says Ford, but many could resign very soon, preparing for a final exit this summer. “There is also urgent concern about the pipeline, where talent of the future will come from.” Ros McMullen, a former headteacher, still remembers what she felt when the pandemic first swept the country in the spring of 2020. “I felt utter relief that I wasn’t an executive head any more, having to run schools during this time – competing with a terrible guilt that I wasn’t there, doing the job.” Headship, says McMullen, “is the best job in the world – except when it isn’t. The chance to make a difference to so many children, to your staff and the community is a huge privilege, but it comes with a massive weight of responsibility.” McMullen, who had taken early retirement the summer before, got together with her friend and former colleague Andrew Morrish; they decided they had to do something. In October 2020, they set up Headrest, a confidential phone service for headteachers, some of whom are struggling without support. Even in normal times as a head, says McMullen, there were working days beginning at 7am and ending at 7pm. There was “having to walk drug dealers off the site. Or sitting alone in my office at the end of the day and a young member of staff comes in to tell you she has been diagnosed with cancer.” Now heads face the extra burden of responsibility and risk that comes with Covid: making decisions about safety. Bereavements. Weekly new school policy announcements from the government. All the while, staff, students and parents expect the headteacher to be the one providing support, reassurance and answers. But who helps a lonely and panicking headteacher? A report last month from NAHT, the heads’ union, found that almost three-quarters of school leaders cited the government’s constantly changing pandemic guidance as their biggest challenge in the past year. And almost half of assistant and deputy headteachers say they have no desire to become the headteacher themselves. Once Headrest was set up, managed by a core team of four – McMullen, Morrish, Pete Crockett, a former special school head, and Kenny Frederick, a former head in east London – the calls began to roll in. “Some messages have been just sobbing,” says McMullen. “We always ring back, even if they say nothing, and this has always been welcomed.” Calls have tended to come in flurries, with Sundays and Mondays as the “peak days”. “Often there’s a final straw that drives a head to pick up the phone, maybe a stroppy parent or a local councillor criticising them on Facebook,” says Morrish. It would be hard to find two more experienced school leaders than McMullen and Morrish. McMullen helped to build a small multi-academy trust in Leeds before becoming executive principal of a trust in the Midlands. When he was 29, Morrish was one of the youngest headteachers in the country, of a large primary in east London. He later became founder chief executive of a trust of nine schools in the Midlands.  The helpline is not the only port of call. There are consultancies offering private advice, and the Department for Education funds a pilot scheme run by Education Support, a national charity, offering one-on-one counselling and peer group support sessions. Sinead McBrearty, head of the charity, says: “We provide what we can in terms of emotional support, a small amount of which is funded by DfE, but austerity has meant that professional development has been pared back across the country, and the picture is incredibly inconsistent. “Senior and middle leaders should have access to a range of services – coaching, mentoring, peer support, professional supervision – that give them the confidential space to reflect on what they do, to develop and improve and to discharge stress that arises from the job. This is common practice in many other demanding professions with a caring component.” McMullen says Headrest offers rapid response and professional advice and mentoring targeted specifically at headteachers, by experienced headteachers. The service is free and funded by the Navigate NDC consultancy and an anonymous benefactor. Often the best advice involves encouraging the school leader to stand up to pressures from above or outside. While some local authorities and multi-academy trusts are supportive, that is far from universal. “People working for more insensitive employers are giving us the other side of the picture,” says McMullen.  “Some multi-academy trusts or local authorities are even asking heads to do pre-Ofsted prep,” says Morrish. “That is just not appropriate at this time. We try to support heads to turn around and say, ‘I’m sorry but this sort of work cannot be my priority right now.’” Barwell says she locked herself in her office to call the helpline, and that talking to Headrest has helped her manage her stress for now. “The adviser showed me how to draw the line, and to understand that every head is struggling. That was massively helpful.” Still, she says, “If I had another route to go, I’d take it. I’m only here to pay my mortgage. The price of headship is just too high. All my senior staff say they would never now consider headship. I see a whole generation determined that they will stay as a deputy, and never take that final, lonely step.” *Names have been changed to protect headteachers and schools.",education
"Birmingham and London have recorded steep falls in demand for primary school places next year, with local authorities reporting that disruption caused by the Covid pandemic, as well as the falling birthrate and migration after Brexit, may be behind the decline. London’s boroughs had a 7% fall in applications for reception class places in September, while Birmingham had 9% fewer applications compared with 2020. Major local authorities in the south-east of England reported declines of 2% or more, including Essex, Kent, and Brighton and Hove. Local authority representatives said some of the fall was due to parents simply missing the deadline for applications on 15 January, when schools were closed to most pupils and the post-Christmas wave of infections was rising. The pandemic prevented schools and councils from carrying out traditional marketing such as open days. The Pan London Admissions Board – which administers state school applications for the 32 London boroughs – said the “turbulence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic” may have led to families not being aware of or missing the application deadline. Parents applying late after the deadline are not guaranteed a state school place. London Councils, the umbrella group for the 32 local authorities, said: “The boroughs are expecting more late applications this year as many parents were not accessing childcare, where they would usually have had reminders about the application deadline, or have just been too busy dealing with the disruption caused by the pandemic.” But the decrease was “also likely to reflect a wider set of factors”, it added. “Other factors, such as the announcement of Brexit and subsequent drop in EU migration, have been cited by some boroughs as having an impact on demand for primary school places,” the councils said. “Covid-19 is also already having an impact on London’s demographics as boroughs report that more families in London are choosing to move to less urban areas due to changes in circumstances and working patterns. “These factors vary from borough to borough and are very hard to quantify in terms of numbers, therefore making it increasingly difficult for local authorities to be able to plan school places in the medium to long term.” But outside London, some local authorities also reported steep declines, with Birmingham seeing applications for school entry fall from nearly 14,400 last year to 13,000 this year. Applications in Oxfordshire were down by more than 6%. A survey of 71 councils in England by the Press Association found that 63 had seen a fall in applications while just eight had seen a rise. In England children are encouraged to enrol in full-time schooling from the age of four. Births in England peaked in 2012, with applications for primary school places reaching 641,000 in 2016. But since 2012, births have declined by more than 12%, with applications falling to 612,000 in 2020. The fall in demand meant less pressure for places in popular schools, with most parts of the country reporting a rise in the proportion of families given places in their first preference. In Birmingham nearly 92% of applicants received their first choice, up four percentage points compared with 2020. In London, 87% of applicants – 79,343 children – secured their first-preference school, compared with 85% last year. Kensington and Chelsea remained the most difficult London borough to secure a first-preference spot, with just 66% achieving it this year – worse than last year, when 70% did so. In Doncaster, the local authority said that 97% of families were given their first preference of school.",education
"My friend John Haigh, who has died aged 79, was a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Sussex whose speciality was probability and statistics. Aside from his teaching at Sussex for 50 years, he wrote five books on his expert field, the first of which, Taking Chances: Winning With Probability (2005), explained probability to lay people, and sold very well. John was born in Skelmanthorpe, a village near Huddersfield, to Harry Haigh and Rhoda Firth, both millworkers. His father died when he was 11, and as a result he was on free school meals during his time at Penistone grammar school, from where in 1960 he won a scholarship to study mathematics at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was a soccer blue. He then moved to Caius College, Cambridge, to do research in probability under the supervision of David Kendall and John Kingman. From 1966 until his retirement in 2019, John worked as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Sussex, retiring as reader in mathematics and including a spell as chairman of the maths department. He published 60 research and expository articles, mostly within the field of applied probability, and his most cited paper is a joint one with the biologist John Maynard Smith on the hitch-hiking effect of a favourable gene. Being an expert on probability, after the UK national lottery began in 1994, he was often asked for comments by the media, although as a lapsed Methodist he never bought a lottery ticket himself. John also held visiting appointments at the universities of Melbourne (Australia), Stanford (US) and Guelph (Canada), was a lecturer for the Royal Statistical Society, and delivered schools lectures for the London Mathematical Society. After his first book he also wrote Probability: A Very Short Introduction (2012), two text books, and, with Rob Eastaway, The Hidden Mathematics of Sport (2011).  Throughout his life John maintained a devotion to Yorkshire cricket and to Huddersfield Town football club, and he enjoyed playing a variety of card games. During the 70s he helped with a weekly lunch club for elderly people. He met his wife, Kay (nee Raspin), on holiday in Crete in 1976; they married a year later and had two children, Daniel and Adam.

"The University of Oxford says it has almost doubled the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds starting their studies, as part of a five-year turnaround resulting in its most diverse ever intake. The proportion of new students from socio-economically disadvantaged areas rose from 8.2% to 15.9% over the last five years. For the academic year 2020-21, the university also recruited record numbers of state school-educated students (68.6% of the total, a rise of 18% over five years), black, Asian and minority ethnic students (23.6%, a 50% increase) and students with disabilities (10.4%, a 44% rise), according to its annual admissions report. “We have made a concerted effort to diversify the socio-economic backgrounds of our student body. There has been a real commitment across the university,” said Oxford’s vice-chancellor, Louise Richardson. “Those who live and work in the university believe it to be a meritocratic institution, and that the public image is not consistent with day-to-day life. I’m enormously proud of the progress we’ve made.” A university spokesperson said early figures for offers made for the 2021 intake suggest that progress will be maintained, with similar numbers of state school students receiving offers and an increase among those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The university has continued its outreach activities online throughout the pandemic, and sent out laptops and wifi dongles to ensure that all students would be able to participate in online interviews. Five years ago, state school applicants to Oxford received 56% of undergraduate offers, while 43% went to those educated at independent schools, generating widespread criticism from MPs and the media that the university was not doing enough to attract a wider range of students. The university responded by introducing a target to boost the proportion of its undergraduate intake coming from underrepresented backgrounds from 15% to 25% by 2023. The figure currently stands at 18.8% for 2020. Richardson said targeted initiatives were helping the university to be “firmly on track” to meet this goal, especially those that demystify the university. Oxford has doubled the size of its Uniq summer school, and launched an Opportunity Oxford course that teaches study skills to help students from lower-performing schools catch up, and also a new scholarship targeted at black British undergraduates, funded by Arlan Hamilton, the US tech entrepreneur, and black postgraduates. Kane Moylett, a first-year law student from Scunthorpe, said Opportunity Oxford had helped him make the transition from a school where he had only been expected to achieve minimal grades to a highly pressurised environment. “It was quite a big jump,” he said. But mostly he has benefited from the social connections. “Coming to a university like Oxford you’re apprehensive that everyone’s going to be very posh and from private school and you’re not going to find anyone like you, but I found so many friends on the programme.” Despite the progress, Richardson acknowledged there remain disparities among geographical regions and ethnic groups. The report showed that the university recruits a greater proportion of students from London than the region’s share of AAA+ students (27.2% compared with 19%), but the figure is lower for Yorkshire and Humber (4.9% compared with 6.5%). Equally, Asian students made up 9.6% of UK students admitted, while students of black African or Caribbean heritage comprised 3.7%. Samina Khan, director of undergraduate admissions, said the university is “increasing our focus on reaching regional cold-spots” by working with schools across the country. One additional barrier for BAME students and those who are state school-educated or from disadvantaged backgrounds is that they are more likely to apply for the most competitive courses than their more privileged peers, the report noted. Richardson said this is due to a lack of understanding of the system, which the university is seeking to remedy by providing clear information on course popularity. In 2020, the university also admitted 300 more students than usual following higher than expected results among A-level students; however, Richardson said Oxford would continue to keep tight number controls in place, unlike many other prestigious universities, to maintain its highly personalised model of education. “That means it becomes more competitive to get into Oxford – every year more and more students are applying but there’s no growth in places, so we’re turning down more highly qualified students we would love to take,” she said.",education
"Secondary school pupils in England will no longer be advised to wear masks in classrooms, the education secretary has said, despite pleas by teaching unions and others for the guidance to remain in place. Gavin Williamson confirmed reports the government was planning to water down its guidance around the wearing of masks at step 3 of its roadmap out of lockdown, which will be no earlier than 17 May. Scientists, public health experts parents and teaching unions had written to him this week to warn that vaccination rates were not sufficient to fully mitigate the impact of transmission among children on infection rates in the community. But Williamson told the Daily Telegraph: “As infection rates continue to decline and our vaccination programme rolls out successfully, we plan to remove the requirement for face coverings in the classroom at step 3 of the roadmap.” However, the government’s guidance will continue to recommend that secondary pupils should wear masks in corridors and other areas inside schools where social distancing is not practical. Boris Johnson is expected to make the announcement as early as Monday, according to the newspaper. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “What we want to see from the government is clarity in the guidance that is given to schools and colleges over this matter so that everyone knows where they stand and there aren’t grey areas left to negotiate. It’s important that it’s very clear what schools and colleges are required to do, and where they have discretion to make decisions based on their own contexts and risk assessments.” The letter urging Williamson to keep the requirement for masks in place until at least 21 June had been signed by scientists and public health experts from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Exeter and UCL, among others. They joined forces with five unions representing teachers and other school staff and parents. It said that after schools fully reopened in England on 8 March, the number of children testing positive for Covid-19 increased, so that by the start of the Easter break the prevalence of infection was higher in school-age children than in any other age group. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showed school infection rates were down, with about 0.33% of pupils and 0.32% of staff in secondary schools testing positive for Covid-19 from mid to late March, compared with 1.22% and 1.64% in December. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London, who was among the signatories to the letter, reacted to news of plans to dilute the rules on masks by warning about the spread of a Covid-19 variant from India. “So the govt appears to be scrapping masks in secondaries – while delaying releasing information about B.1.617.2, which has been spreading in secondary schools + outbreak involving 100 children in Derbyshire … Data not dates?” she tweeted. A Department for Education spokesperson said virus transmission in schools was continuing to drop and that new data showed a significant decrease in students and staff testing positive. Positive cases were isolating quickly thanks to a twice-weekly rapid testing programme, it said.",education
"My father, Len Bower, who has died aged 100, was an art lecturer and artist who had a striking ability to draw and paint anything, from slick cartoons to stylised landscape. He also showed equal ease in words and music. Born in Leeds to Hettie (nee Berry) and Herbert Bower, a tailor, as a six year old Len could play hymns by ear and improvise on the piano. He also showed early ability in art and music at Leeds Central school. His training in illustration at Leeds College of Art was interrupted in 1940 by six years in the RAF, as an aircraftsman at Mildenhall, Suffolk, Binbrook, Lincolnshire, and St Athan in Wales, latterly as an instructor. There he also picked up live bookings as a dexterous jazz clarinettist and pianist. After the war he became an art teacher at Batley grammar school and then, in the early 1950s, a senior lecturer at Leeds College of Art. He always found inspiring ways of engendering learning, wonder and understanding. Later he used his wealth of talent modestly, writing sketches and stories for friends, drawing humorous greetings cards and church visual aids of the highest quality, and playing music only at home. He turned down opportunities for musical contracts and exhibitions in London, and preferred to remain a hands-on teacher. Aside from his RAF years, he stayed in Leeds for a century, enjoying his art and his music, and sharing with his children his imaginative ideas and his passion for local history – particularly of Leeds and of Whitby, his annual holiday destination. He never owned a car, and had no interest in the expensive or pretentious. He retired in 1974, still working for the same employer, although Leeds College of Art had in 1970 become Leeds Polytechnic. In his 90s, registered blind, he walked daily to a small Headingley centre where adults with learning difficulties gathered. He loved them; they loved him.  He provided illustrations for my book, Thread and Thrum, published in 2020, in aid of the Macular Society. Underpinning all that Len did was his Christian faith. As he aged and lost people close to him, he never stopped finding new friends. He had the great gift of judging the exact level and topic to make others feel relaxed. “Tell me something you’re looking forward to,” he would say, always ready with suggestions.  In 1950 he married Sadie Espie. She died in 2009. He is survived by their daughters, Sarah and me, and grandson, Ted. Their son, Andrew, died in 1995. ",education
"Forget about having the right clothes or the right attitude, being cool in school could be about being just slightly older than your peers, a study has found. Researchers surveyed more than 13,000 teenagers aged 14-15 in England, Sweden and the Netherlands on who they thought was the most popular in their class and compiled a popularity score for each pupil in the classroom linked to their birth month (“past relative age”) as well as their age position in their class (“current relative age”). The analysis found that relative age – on either measure – affects popularity, the authors wrote in the journal PLOS ONE. Relative age related to primary school cut-off was strongly associated with popularity in England, where students progress to the next grade every year regardless of school performance. Meanwhile, current relative age had a sharper link to popularity in the Netherlands, where students repeat a year if their performance does not pass muster. Sweden – which officially has a system of promoting children regardless of their achievements, but in rare cases holds pupils back – fell in between those two findings, said lead author Danelien van Aalst from the University of Groningen. “So, in England, if you’re born in an unlucky month, it will be so for the rest of your educational career, whereas in the Netherlands, the system of grade retention and skipping classes creates over-time changes in class composition, which makes current age more salient/relevant than past relative age,” explained co-author Frank van Tubergen, from Utrecht University. “I see this study … showing the surprising effect of relative age, and more generally, on how unexpected social forces shape our lives,” he added. Many western countries impose a minimum age and cut-off date for school enrolment, which means there can be a difference of up to 12 months between pupils within a class. The cognitive, social and physical differences between the younger and older peers manifest in multiple ways, research suggests. For example, these gaps can strongly affect educational outcomes: children who are relatively young when they enter school do not tend to go to university as much as their older peers. Other studies have also linked relatively younger children to lower rates of self-esteem and higher mortality rates by suicide. Overall, said Van Aalst, feeling safe and accepted was a prerequisite for concentrating on school tasks and performing well in school. “In some classes, the popularity hierarchy is … not necessarily related to being liked or being seen as a friend. Sometimes the most popular kids can be bullies and just have a lot of power and are looked up to for that reason, not because their peers like them. It is therefore hard to say whether popularity contributes to academic performance or educational outcomes.”",education
"Due to the pandemic’s disruption of pupils’ studies, GCSE and A-level exams have been scrapped in England this summer and replaced with a teacher-assessed grading system. Five teachers shared their views about the new system, from how it has affected their workload to the potential impact on their students’ grades. For Emily Gildea, an English teacher and deputy head at a Cambridgeshire secondary school, the new grading system has brought extra pressure. “Usually, while marking GCSE practice papers, I wouldn’t be too worried about the marks I’m giving; I’d be thinking more about what pupils need to do to improve,” she said. “But now you’re second-guessing yourself. We’re all marking through weekends and late at night. It’s the added stress of knowing how important it is to get the marking right.”  To make sure pupils’ grades are as fair as possible, Gildea consults with colleagues in her department and teachers from other schools. “The exam boards won’t supply grade boundaries for these papers, so we are still having to make our own judgments on this,” she said, adding: “The quality assurance and appeals process could come down on us if we get it wrong.” Like Gildea, other teachers who contacted the Guardian via a callout said exam boards had only recently supplied them with suggested test questions. They added that many examples had already been published and used before.   “Any teacher, or well-run department, would have already used those questions,” said Thomas, sixth form subject leader in the north-west. “Detailed guidance [on conducting the assessments] was not published until the week before Easter. For a lot of institutions, this was during the Easter holidays. Students needed some direction on how they were going to be graded [before that].” Thomas said updates from the exam boards had been a “constant drip feed of changing policies and requirements”, which was “exasperating and exhausting”. “There are so many documents and blogposts that are coming from different sources – the JCQ [Joint Council for Qualifications], Ofqual and individual exam boards – all detailing additional requirements, with short deadlines, being published almost daily now,” he added. “I now feel sick every time I see a new document from the JCQ or Ofqual, because I know that it’ll mean more work for my team, who are already on their knees. It’s like building a house on shifting foundations.” Sian Morgan, a specialist teacher in south Wales who works in two schools supporting children with special educational needs, is likewise concerned about inconsistencies within the new grading system. “I can see variation in the way students are being prepared for exams. This is not just between schools but within schools. Some students are being told what topics to revise, while others are told to revise everything they have studied for the past two years,” said Morgan, echoing concerns raised last month by MPs on the education committee about a lack of standardisation across schools. “There does not appear to be any consistency.” Alongside concerns about discrepancies in assessment styles, schools have also been affected differently by coronavirus itself, meaning some pupils have lost significantly more learning time than others. In Yorkshire, deputy head Mark said roughly one in 11 children had been bereaved by coronavirus. Due to repeated isolations, he estimates that year 11 students have lost 8,692 days of face-to-face learning this academic year alone, about 55 days each. The school itself has recorded around 100 positive cases in pupils and staff over the same period. The school also has high rates of deprivation among pupils, with many students lacking access to devices for remote learning and a quiet room at home for studying. Mark said he feared these factors would disproportionately impact his pupils’ results. “We have siblings sharing bedrooms with three or four others and had to provide hundreds of devices ourselves,” he said. “To develop skills you need to practise and our students are missing that experience, teaching and time.” Mark said he believed assessments needed to take account of the pandemic’s impact on children’s learning. “We’ll follow the guidance this year but our students will obtain lower grades than they would have in normal circumstances. The comparisons with students in leafy suburb schools where the difference in pandemic experience has been stark are there to be made.”  But some teachers felt the system may actually give a fairer reflection of their students’ ability. Laura, an assistant principal at a secondary school in the south-west, described this year’s assessment system as “rounded”. Allowing open book exams would help compensate for the months of missed in-person learning as a result of the pandemic, testing them less on their ability to cram from a year of disrupted teaching and more on their grasp of information. “My students feel like they have more chances,” she said. “It’s not just how they’ve done in the final exam. When they have missed around seven months of face-to-face teaching and are having increased issues with mental health, this more flexible system of grading feels much fairer and less stressful.” A spokesperson for the JCQ said it applauded the incredible effort teachers have made in supporting students and their families during the pandemic. “Guidance from JCQ and the exam boards has been, and continues to be, developed to minimise additional burden on them, and made available at the earliest opportunity.” A spokesperson for the exam regulator Ofqual said: “We are confident that teacher-assessed grades are the fairest way to award results in these challenging times. Exam boards are supporting schools to make sure that their approach to grading is consistent, and there are quality assurance arrangements in place.”",education
"School leaders and education experts have warned that GCSE and A-level results this summer will see levels of grade inflation similar to last year despite onerous measures imposed on teachers to try to make the system fair. Teacher-assessed grades will replace exams in England this summer as part of the fallout of mass school and college closures amid the Covid pandemic. But there are fears that schools with a strong track record for results – such as independent schools and grammars – could benefit disproportionately, submitting more generous grades that escape subsequent scrutiny, while others that exercise caution could lose out. Teachers have described having to fill in multiple forms for every assessment of each pupil as part of a system of checks and balances to provide evidence and justify grades awarded. Some schools have also decided to deliver exams or mocks to help inform the grades. “The form-filling is seemingly endless,” said a teacher at a north-west London secondary school whose students will be assessed based on mock exams in March and other tests this month. “The stress at the moment for me is off the scale. The workload is unbearable at times.” Experts have warned, however, that grade inflation is inevitable even with additional levels of scrutiny promised by the qualifications regulator Ofqual, and they say another year of inflated results will make it harder to return to exams pegged to pre-pandemic results next year. Last year, when the Department for Education abandoned its algorithm in favour of school-assessed grades, there was a 13 percentage-point increase in A and A* grades awarded at A-level. “There’s inevitably going to be grade inflation in the system this summer. That’s not because teachers are cheats but because we are human and we’ve been given an impossible task,” said Stuart Lock, the chief executive of Advantage Schools in Bedford. Teachers are working to assess, mark and moderate their pupils’ results, but across the country a variety of assessment methods are being used in different schools, making it impossible to compare outcomes between areas of the country, critics say. “The whole point of the system is it should be the same in Hartlepool as it is in Penzance. That’s not going to be the case and schools will be hung out to dry,” said Alan Brookes, the chair of the Kent Association of Head Teachers. “If grades look better than previous years, then those are the schools [Ofqual] will focus on,” Brookes added. “If you’re a private school or a grammar school or a school in a leafy suburb, it’s a self-perpetuating cycle of expecting higher grades and continuing to offer similar grades.” “The system is fraught with problems,” added Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted. “We know teachers err on the side of generosity. They will always give youngsters the benefit of the doubt and there will be grade inflation. It’s a question of how much. I think we will see roughly what we saw last year which was 10-12% grade inflation, somewhere in that region.” Wilshaw said strong schools in well-run groups or academy trusts would have more robust assessment systems in place, with in-house moderation. “The worry is where you have a school that struggles, a school in special measures, a school where they’ve got a lot of inexperienced heads of department. They would not have the experience to moderate those judgments.” Schools and colleges must submit all grades by 18 June. They will then be asked to provide samples of student work, plus the evidence used to determine grades. “The work that Ofqual are making teachers do might make the system seem more valid and reliable,” said Lock, “but in my opinion it will not be any more valid or reliable. It’s not worth the work being done.” Richard Sheriff, the president of the Association of School and College Leaders, was more upbeat. “Teachers are developing a whole variety of assessments as part of a really robust system that hopefully can deal with the excesses of grade inflation … “The idea that it’s completely fair in other years is a myth. I don’t think it was absolutely fair before. I don’t think it will be absolutely fair this time, but the profession should be trusted to get this right and people should back off.” One head of department described a bureaucratic process that requires him to fill in a department assessment record justifying each assessment, a teacher-assessed grade record form justifying the grades for each individual student, plus a detailed moderating form on how grades were decided for individual questions. He is also required to sign a document as evidence that he has read and understood the Joint Council for Qualifications guidance, as well as his school’s own policy, which is 10 documents on its own. “Our stress is that if our students don’t meet the grade profile for their subject, by grades being either being too high or too low for the school, that it will cause a mini-crisis all over again,” he said. A spokesperson for Ofqual said it was impossible to know the results picture in advance but it had been “mindful” of teacher workload. “It is important that schools have evidence to support their judgments, and we have built flexibility into the way that schools and colleges will gather that evidence to determine students’ grades. It’s also important that exam boards quality assure those judgements so that there is as much consistency as possible,” the regulator said. “Where their overall results at GCSE or A-level look very different from recent years [2017-19], schools and colleges should record the likely reasons for this, as exam boards might ask to see this if the centre is selected for external quality assurance. Centres with the largest differences are more likely to be selected for quality assurance checks.”",education
"A London school accused of institutional racism is at the centre of a police investigation after alleged death threats against its headteacher. Harris Academy Tottenham issued a safety notice to staff after its executive principal became the focus of hostility. A petition calling on the executive principal to quit and alleging discrimination against black students had collected nearly 6,000 signatures as of Friday. The petition was started last week by Joshua Adusei, a PE teacher at the school for 16 months, who later posted that he had been suspended. This week Adusei was dismissed after a longstanding investigation into alleged gross misconduct. He has appealed against his dismissal. Adusei, 27, has alleged that the school’s discipline policies disproportionately affect students from Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. He said he did not condone threats against Harris staff and he did not want any such behaviour to distract from the issues at the school. “I loved my job and I love the school and I’d like to go back,” he said. “I am not aware who made these alleged threats, and obviously if it is true that’s not good, but we shouldn’t forget what this is about – there are so many problems at the school and I wouldn’t want this to take away from that.” The petition states that the new head was appointed in September 2020 and goes on to claim that in the first month of his leadership he permanently excluded three black students. “[He] introduced a zero-tolerance behaviour policy that disproportionately affects BAME and SEN [special educational needs] students,” it alleges. “He has now commenced a restructuring of the school staff and is bullying staff into accepting redundancy. [The head] is not acting in the best interests of the school or the local community. We the undersigned call for his immediate resignation and rescinding of the restructuring proposal.” After the school reported four death threats to police, as well as a threat to stab teachers made via the Change.org petition site, the head’s name was removed from the petition. All comments have now also been removed. Schools Week reported that one comment had compared a “silent lineup” policy to Putin’s Russia, and another had claimed the school was “run by white people … who don’t understand the children”. A Harris Federation spokesperson called the petition a “misleading, vindictive and vexatious campaign”, and its diverse leadership team “categorically denies” racism and all the allegations made. A Metropolitan police spokesperson said “reassurance patrols” had been scheduled in the area and that officers had made inquiries over malicious communications aimed at staff.",education
"My partner, John Hayes, who has died aged 85, was one of the bright lights assembled around Basil Bernstein at the Institute of Education, London University, during its prime in the 1970s and 80s. Along with Bernstein, John taught about the social impediments to learning and the influence of class structure on education. As a senior lecturer at the Institute from the late 60s until 1991, he worked with postgraduates from many disciplines and countries, most of whom responded eagerly to his anarchic humour and his mordantly seditious line of thought. However, the Institute’s sociology in education department was eventually disabled by Margaret Thatcher’s campaign against radicalism in teaching, and John was obliged to take early retirement when the subjects he taught were purged from the curriculum. Born in Rochdale, now in Greater Manchester, he was the son of John Hayes, a motor and components engineer, and his wife, Mary (nee Hardwick), a florist. From Manchester grammar school he went to Oriel College, Oxford, where he read classics, graduating in 1958. It was there that we met and became life partners for the next 63 years. After Oxford, John became a teacher of classics at St Peter’s school in York and then the City of London school, while simultaneously reading for a further degree in the sociology of education at King’s College London, where he was recruited as a lecturer by Bernstein. Once he had left the Institute of Education he became a private tutor, working from his home in Greenwich, south east London, where people of all levels of academic ambition sought him out. At home he loved to cook, and to entertain his many friends in the worlds of art and literature, who included the writers Angela Carter and Carmen Callil, the film producer Derek Granger, the literary agent William Miller and the artist David Hockney.

"When Daisy Davis imagined her gap year, she pictured global adventure. Building schools as a volunteer in Tanzania or Ghana, perhaps, Interrailing through Europe, or travelling in Thailand. Finally 18 and with a year of blissful freedom before university, Daisy presumed that the world was there to be explored. At school near her home in East Sussex, where she lives with her teacher parents and 11-year-old brother, there was a lot of talk about gap years. “People would come back and describe the fun things they’d been doing. And you’d see it on social media. All these different cities. Elephants and white sand. Travelling to Asia.” The hope that she could do the same got her through her exams. She narrowed down her plans: leave school; work until Christmas; travel to Australia or New Zealand; apply to university once she figured out what she wanted to study. But in the course of just a few weeks in March last year, the first lockdown began, exams were cancelled, her school closed. All certainty had suddenly disappeared. She got a job in the kitchen at Nutley Hall, a local residential care community for people with learning disabilities. Then a friend who had worked as a chalet girl in Austria said, “Look! They’re hiring! We can do this!” The ski resort was advertising for childminders. It looked like restrictions were easing. “I’d never been skiing before and was excited about learning,” says Daisy. Her friend flew to Austria at the beginning of December. But Daisy wanted to apply to university before she went – she’d settled on graphic design – and spend Christmas with her family, so she booked flights for 30 December. “Then we went into lockdown. And Brexit happened.” Suddenly, Daisy needed a visa to work in Austria, which cost £150 and took three weeks to be approved. She wasn’t even sure there would be a job when she got there, because Austria was in lockdown. (When I spoke to her friend in March, the ski resort was still closed; she was snowboarding.) Daisy tried to book flights, and get a visa. “At the end of January, I stopped trying,” she says. She was jobless – “I’d stopped working in the kitchen because I thought I was going away” – and had lost £70 on flights. Now she is working in a local cafe, making piles of bacon baps. “It’s very different from how my gap year was meant to be.” The school leavers of 2020 had no way of knowing, when they were writing essays and sitting tests at the beginning of the year, that their futures were about to be knocked sideways. For the young people hoping for an adventure, and those expecting to plunge straight into university life, the traditional trajectory was so familiar as to seem inevitable. Instead, they have found themselves in limbo. Schools closed, A-level exams were cancelled, and then grades were calculated by a government algorithm which downgraded almost 40% of students, with poorer students disproportionately hit. After a national outcry, grades were given according to teacher predictions, but for many it was too late; university places had been given away. Those who did become students last year found that university life barely resembled the experience they’d been promised at open days. If the changes wreaked by the pandemic have been universal, few have had to face up to them at a more critical time in their lives. “Dramatic social and economic shifts have happened just as that age group – generation Z – are on the cusp of adult life,” says Louise Tyler, a counsellor and psychotherapist. “This is the time when people are working out who they are and where they fit in the world.” Covid disrupted that natural development of independence and freedom. There was a loss of proper endings – exams, end-of-school celebrations – and of proper beginnings. “Not knowing about the future and what it will look like, and whether there is any point to it, has just added to the anxiety and low mood,” says Dr Rachel Andrew, a clinical psychologist who specialises in working with children and young adults. “Referrals have certainly increased in that age group. There is a sense of frustration and anger that they haven’t been listened to and that their feelings haven’t been validated.” Even when the threat of Covid is lifted, the impact may endure. “They could always feel regretful that they missed out on this big chunk of something very important in their life,” says Tyler. “Maybe their midlife crisis will be about chasing the loss of that something they can never get back.” Last February, Lara Baden, 21, was in the first year of her law degree at Kingston University, when, suddenly, the institution switched to virtual learning, libraries closed, her halls emptied, and about 90% of students disappeared home. “I am a care leaver and didn’t really have anywhere to go back to,” says Lara, who asked to use a pseudonym. “I was still going to my online lectures, still doing assignments, still studying for exams – all from my room, which I don’t really like doing. Maybe that’s because I grew up in the system and all I could smell at home was cannabis. It wasn’t really a learning environment.” Nonetheless, she was still expected to pay nearly £10,000 for an experience that was far below what she expected. “University is meant to be a way of having a community, a stepping stone before you get to the world of careers. My entire university experience was going to be a Zoom call of people saying, ‘I can’t hear you.’” She deferred her place, and is now living in supported accommodation while she works for Camden council. Universities hoped they would be functioning again with a mix of online and face-to-face learning in time for the new academic year. In fact, all but a very limited number of practical courses have been entirely online, and it was only recently announced that in-person lectures could resume on 17 May at the earliest – just before the end of term. By late last summer, the argument for taking a gap year, either through choice or necessity, was compelling. The number of applicants accepted for deferred places increased by 5,400 from 2019 to reach its highest ever level in 2020, at 35,725, according to data from Ucas. But what have these unexpected gap years been like when it’s almost impossible to achieve any of the things they are supposed to be about: travel, freedom, exploration, adventure? For Calum Leitch, the past year has given him a taste of working life that has changed his plans altogether. “It sounds really bad, but I’m almost glad Covid happened in that it’s given me experiences I would have never had.” The 19-year-old from Inverurie, near Aberdeen, had a place to read medicine at the University of Nottingham in September 2019. But his life was thrown off course a few months earlier when he witnessed a terrible car crash. He was on his way to a 50-mile cycle race as a first-aid volunteer for the Red Cross. He didn’t actually see the crash, but arrived seconds afterwards. Two people were trapped in the car: one person was dead; the other was unconscious and bleeding heavily. “There were five of us, but I was the most experienced at the time and had to take charge of that scene. We had no first-aid equipment whatsoever, because it was all at the event. I felt completely helpless. It was always at the back of my mind that I could have done more.” He decided to defer his university place. “I just needed a year or two to get myself into the right frame of mind.” In May 2020, he became an ambulance volunteer for the Red Cross, working 12-hour shifts transporting patients to and from hospital. Covid emergencies escalated, and he had an epiphany: he wanted to be a paramedic. “When you’re in the back of the ambulance, it’s just you and the patient. You’re seeing them at this raw moment of crisis,” Calum says. “By the time a doctor sees them, they’ve already had several people interacting with them. There is something about being in the community that I really like.” He’s applied to five universities to study paramedicine. So far he’s received unconditional offers from Glasgow Caledonian, Queen Margaret, Edinburgh and Stirling. “This time last year, I was so unsure about what I wanted to do, but now I’ve made up my mind: being a paramedic is right for me.” He says his parents were “deep down probably a bit disappointed” he isn’t going to medical school, “but they know I wouldn’t have been happy as a doctor”. Matthew Doyle, 19, never intended to take a year off. “I might have been able to afford to go with my mates for a week in Spain or something, but I was never going to be able to afford one of those big trips,” he says. Last February, Matthew, who lives in Manchester, was offered a place at Cambridge to read human, social and political sciences. No one in his family had been to university. His dad works in IT and, having had a series of strokes, needs care, which Matthew and his mum provide. “It was a great feeling,” says Matthew. “I thought, now all I have to do is meet the grades.” He needed two A*s and an A (in addition to the A he’d already got in his maths A-level). But on results day he discovered he’d got one A* and two As. Having joined his grammar school for sixth form, he wondered whether he was given his grade by a teacher who had never taught him and didn’t know his background. He appealed, and won. With the government and higher education sector agreeing that all students who achieved the required grades would be offered their first-choice university, Cambridge offered Matthew a place – deferred to next year, “due to accommodation being filled up”. “I was ecstatic to get the confirmation, to actually know I’d got the place,” says Matthew. “But then you think, I’ve got a whole year I hadn’t planned to take out. I’m going to have to try to do something.” His enforced gap year would have been “a lot worse if I wasn’t into reading as much as I am”, he says. He’s stockpiled “fancy books” from Oxfam by writers like Gabriel García Márquez and Ernest Hemingway in preparation for Cambridge. “When I went for my interview I met someone whose dad, grandad and uncle had all gone to Cambridge, so I need to feel worthy. Yes, I can talk about politics, but I also want to know about other areas, like music, literature and film.” In a year of lockdowns, options were limited; traditional gap year companies were hit by travel restrictions. Last March, Raleigh International, for example, had to bring home 500 volunteers from Tanzania, Costa Rica and Nepal. But online tutoring is booming. Yipiyap, a company that employs a network of high-achieving gap year students across the UK to support school and college pupils, says it hired 105 school leavers this year, an increase of 110% on 2019-20 . They support 30,000 learners a week. Despite experiencing her own anxieties about her disrupted education, Maya Williams-Hamm, 18, who lives in Sheffield, has enjoyed working as an online maths tutor for both Yipiyap and Tutorfair Foundation, a volunteer tutoring service for schools and charities. “It’s sad to see the impact of the pandemic,” she says. “I’ve got a year 12 student who moved to a new sixth form just before the pandemic hit, who had only had a couple of in-person maths classes and doesn’t know anybody from their school. But it’s really good when you actually help someone to make a breakthrough.” Maya lives at home with her dad, who works for children’s services, and her mum, a youth worker. She had expected to go straight to university, but even before she got her results realised she was going to have to take a gap year because she and her mother are clinically extremely vulnerable. “Covid was a risk to me, but it was more of a risk to my mum. If I’d gone to university, I wouldn’t have wanted to come back for holidays and put my mum at extra risk. So I would have had to stay the whole year, which didn’t seem like a good idea.” Maya got into her first-choice university, St Andrews, to study physics and maths. But the stress of getting to this point has, at times, felt overwhelming. “I had such an abrupt end to year 13, I didn’t feel I was done with school or education.” She was downgraded by the algorithm in three out of four of her subjects, and then upgraded again. “It was a horrible moment realising that however much work you do, due to circumstances out of your control other things can decide what happens to you,” she says. Seeking something more solid, she decided to focus on work experience. “Once you’ve had a job, you actually have experience of doing things, which is more useful than all the information you’ve learned from school subjects.” When we spoke, Maya hadn’t met up with anyone for three months. “Obviously I would have preferred to travel,” she says. “But it’s OK, I have a great group of friends I speak to on Skype or Zoom.” Some are on gap years, some at university. Few are where they expected to be. “A lot of them ended up at places they hadn’t wanted to study at, because they lost their offers and didn’t manage to get them back,” says Maya. “Some people have enjoyed it.” But others, she says, feel very “isolated” in their halls or student flats, unable to join societies or clubs, or see their coursemates. “I have quite a few friends who haven’t made a single friend so far.” Many people assumed student numbers would fall in response to the pandemic, but 534,750 applicants were accepted at universities for 2020-21; 20,000 more than in 2019, according to Ucas. However, more than half of students said their mental health and wellbeing had deteriorated since the start of the autumn term in 2020, according to an Office for National Statistics survey.  “In addition to the obvious disruption to education and career plans, they’ve had their social and sexual development really interfered with,” says Sue, who works for a suicide prevention charity, and often hears from 18 and 19 year olds. “There’s been no outlet for sexual desire, very little opportunity to create friendships and relationships – and you often form lifelong friendships when you’re at university. And then, for those on gap years, having to stay at home with your parents, at the very point in your life when you are really seeking to establish your independence, is a huge setback.” This strange gap year has also been a time of unexpected opportunities and revelations. Olivia Clarke, 18, lives in Fallowfield, south Manchester, with her dad, a freelance photographer, her mum, a driving instructor, and three younger brothers. The day Olivia learned that her A-level results would be worked out by a computer program, she felt relieved. “I had faith in the process because I thought it was going to focus on homework and class assessments. I perform well in class, so I thought, ‘I’ve got this in the bag.’” She was predicted to get CCC; the algorithm gave her CCD, which meant she didn’t have enough Ucas points to get into Liverpool Hope University to read theology. But that wasn’t the only reason for her anger. “To see the algorithm working against people in working-class communities; I was fuming.” Her school, Loreto college, a sixth form in Hulme, is, says Olivia, “based in a very working-class community. I have peers who live in better off parts of Manchester who got their predicted grades.” By the time her grades were upgraded to BCC after teacher assessment, Olivia was clear-eyed and resolute. “I want to learn about every little thing behind the education system we have today. I want to change it, and in order to do that I need to know who made it and what their thought processes were.” She has a place at Manchester Metropolitan University, to read education. “We should never have had our lives predicted by an algorithm,” she says. She had planned to work in a pub and travel around Greece, but the pub closed and she got a job as a “youth change leader” with Ashoka, a charity that supports young entrepreneurs. “I should be lying on a beach now. Instead, I’ve been put in a position where I get to recruit two other young people to join the team, which is really exciting.” Will she travel at all? “Me and my friends had been thinking about going away this summer, but it’s not looking very hopeful. I’ll probably be staying at home again this year.” The pandemic has given others time to learn about what matters and what doesn’t. Eleanor Bartram, 19, lives near Ashburton, in Devon. Her father owns a holiday rental business; her mother is a town clerk, she has three younger brothers, and went to Torquay grammar school for girls. Eleanor planned to “really throw myself out there” on her gap year. “I was hoping to visit every continent, somehow.” But then local cafes closed, shutting off her means of earning money. Tourists stayed home. And so did she. Life changed when her exams were cancelled last March. “I was planning to get a job anyway, so I thought, let’s just start a little bit earlier.” She saw an ad on Facebook for a care worker in a nearby residential home. The idea of working in healthcare had first occurred to Eleanor the previous year. “I had an eating disorder and spent a couple of months in hospital. It was a key experience in that it made me realise I was quite good at supporting people, even as a patient. I was interested in what was going on professionally; and it made me consider working in the healthcare industry. “I definitely came out better than I went in, but I did struggle with lockdown. Quite a big source of support for me was my friends, and not being able to see them or go to school or have face-to-face professional support was challenging. So that was part of the reason behind me wanting to get a job, because I knew I needed to keep myself busy. I’m not a person who likes to spend a lot of time sitting around with my thoughts. I applied for the job, and it has kept me very busy.” She is now a senior care worker at the home, is “passionate” about dementia care, and has a place at the University of Cambridge to read psychological and behavioural sciences – the same course as before, but with a different end result in mind. “I used to see my trajectory as finishing A-levels, going to uni and then into the world of work. When I was in hospital, I had time to think about what I wanted out of life, and I decided I wanted a year out to learn more about myself and the world, just to get a bigger perspective on life,” she says. “I didn’t get to every continent, but in a strange way I’m glad that I’ve had a different gap year from the one I’d planned. I’ve realised there are many more opportunities closer to home than you think.” How can this generation, who have been stymied just as they transition into adulthood, recover? “It’s important that universities and society as a whole don’t expect them just to move on as if nothing has happened,” says Tyler. On the other hand, there may be some silver linings, she says. They may be a kinder generation. “They’ve been forced to put others before themselves. They’ve had to develop resilience – they’ve sacrificed a hell of a lot.” And for a generation who’ve never had to wait for anything – if you want food, Deliveroo; if you want a song, Spotify; if you want clothes, go online, even at midnight – “they’ve had to develop patience, which is no bad thing”. Even the turmoil of last year can provide a kind of perspective. While working in Cafe Coco isn’t quite the gap year Daisy imagined, she says she feels lucky to have a job. “I’ve made sure to apply for courses that have a study-abroad year. And hopefully before university, even if it’s in England, I’ll do something small; have my own little adventure.” ",education
"Families of children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) have been left “exhausted” and “despairing” by the pandemic which has affected their children disproportionately, according to a report by the schools watchdog in England. Parents told Ofsted they had been forced to leave their jobs to care for their children as essential services shut down, while others documented the deterioration in their child’s progress, with some youngsters suffering anxiety, depression, hair loss and sleep loss as a result of the Covid disruption. “These last few months have undone years of work with my child and we have had to start at the beginning again,” one parent told inspectors. “It was a very dark place for a very long time,” said another, while a third added: “I’m absolutely shattered. No respite. Increased stress.” Ofsted inspectors found that many pupils with Send missed out on their education or put up with a significantly narrowed version. Essential services, such as speech and language support and physiotherapy, were either lost altogether or subject to longer waiting times. During lockdown, schools were closed to all pupils except children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable by the government, including children with Send who have an education health care (EHC) plan. According to the report, however, many were unable to access schools, even though they qualified. The report concluded that children with Send, already at a disadvantage in the education system, have been left “even further behind their peers”. Others are at risk of being incorrectly identified as having Send “simply because they are struggling following extended periods away from their education setting”. And another group of children “may have new or different needs that have not been identified because they have not been ‘in sight’ of education, health and care professionals”, putting further strain on an already overstretched system. The report also documented the damaging impact on the wellbeing of children with Send. “Confidence has rapidly reduced,” noted one parent. “Anxiety is high. Access to wellbeing activities nonexistent. Depression. Loss of hair. Sleep disorder. No motivation. Poor personal hygiene.” The report, which was based on visits to 10 areas in England, found that existing weaknesses in the system had been exacerbated by the pandemic. “By our final visits in the spring, many families were exhausted, even despairing, particularly when they were still unable to access essential services for their children,” said the chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman. The national disability charity Sense called for the government’s review of support for children with Send to be brought forward. Its chief executive, Richard Kramer, said: “Today’s report shows yet again how children with Send and their families are some of the hardest hit by the pandemic.”",education
"Online learning has increased, with almost a quarter of primary pupils in England now doing more than five hours a day, but children in lower income households are still lagging behind with insufficient laptops, according to a report. Research by the Sutton Trust showed schools are now better equipped to deliver remote learning than they were last March, but significant socio-economic gaps persist, which will fuel mounting fears about the growing attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their classmates. The paper compares the amount of time children spent studying during the March lockdown, when schools were suddenly forced to close to all but children of key worker parents and vulnerable pupils, with time spent learning during the current lockdown. At primary level, 23% of pupils are now doing more than five hours of learning a day, up from 11% at the end of March, while among secondary students, the proportion has increased from 19% to 45%. However, researchers found that, while 40% of children in middle class families were managing five hours, just 26% of those in working class households were doing the same. The study also looked at how remote lessons are being delivered and found that more than half (54%) of teachers are now using online live lessons, compared with just 4% last March. The digital divide persists, however, despite government promises to deliver laptops to all who need them. Just 5% of teachers in state schools said that all their pupils had access to a device, compared with 54% in private schools. Parents on lower incomes were more likely than their wealthier peers to be finding the second lockdown more difficult than the first (28% compared with 15%), the report found. It also highlighted differences in parental spending on their child’s home learning since September, with one in five of the highest earners (19%) splashing out more than £200, while almost a third of the lowest earners (31%) had spent nothing. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, called for a £750m one-off pupil premium boost for the most disadvantaged. He said: “Today’s research shows that schools are now better equipped to deliver online teaching. But significant barriers remain that threaten to widen the gap between rich and poor pupils still further. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “It is pretty clear from this research that there are still significant gaps in laptop provision despite the government’s programme to provide devices to disadvantaged youngsters.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are aware of the additional challenges faced by disadvantaged children during this crisis, which is why we are providing 1.3 million laptops and tablets for those who need them most, with more than 800,000 of these delivered already, alongside access to free mobile data for disadvantaged families. “It is encouraging to see the substantial increase in teachers providing online live lessons for pupils during this lockdown.”",education
"The work of the British jazz artist Courtney Pine is to be swiftly reinstated to A-level music, after an examination board admitted it had been wrong to drop his album from its course and leave its syllabus without any black composers. The Guardian revealed this month that Edexcel had cut Pine’s compositions from the works in its jazz and popular music category for A-level, while retaining albums by Kate Bush and the Beatles. The board, owned by the education publisher Pearson, had defended its decision as being part of a necessary slimming-down of the course to make it more manageable for students during the pandemic. But Edexcel now says it will conduct a rapid consultation and revise the course for the next cohort of A-level students. “The first thing to say is that we got this decision wrong. As a learning company and qualifications provider, we agree entirely that pupils should study music by composers from diverse cultures and backgrounds. We hold ourselves to the highest standards and, on this occasion, we have fallen short,” Edexcel said. “In order to fix this, we will work together with teachers, learners and a range of stakeholders to carry out a further review of the set works and the wider listening pieces. This will be completed in time for students starting their A-level music studies in September 2021.” Pine said: “Having spoken to Pearson Edexcel today, it became apparent to all that the need to inspire students was the most important goal that we have in common. They have after much consideration decided to reinstate my contribution to the A-level music exam – a decision that I commend. “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who care about music education that stood up, signed and made their voices count on such an important subject.” Other artists dropped included the Cuban ensemble La Familia Valera Miranda and the British composer Rachel Portman, the first woman to win an Oscar for best original musical score, as the board cut the number of compositions to be studied from 18 to 12. As well as removing Pine’s album Back in the Day from its list of works to be studied, Edexcel also axed jazz from its studied works, renaming the section popular music. The Ivors Academy, the professional association for British composers and songwriters, had described Edexcel’s original decision as “appalling”. “I welcome Edexcel’s statement, but we didn’t need to be here. The reinstatement of jazz and Courtney Pine should be immediate,” said Robert Mitchell, the pianist and composer who chairs the academy’s educational publishing working group. “We are very keen to contribute to broadening the music A-level syllabus for Edexcel. The same goes for other exam boards who are thinking about reducing or changing their curriculum. Now is the time for an inclusive, bold and creative syllabus that will inspire, educate and broaden young minds in an ever smaller world.” One of the first to protest the exam changes was Eleanor Mountford, a sixth form student at Simon Langton grammar school in Kent. Having started a petition to have Pine’s work reinstated, Eleanor said she was “over the moon” about the U-turn: “It’s a win for diversity and hopefully the start of more equal representation in education.”",education
"One of the UK’s most deprived boroughs has abandoned controversial proposals to axe its pioneering universal free school meals scheme after an outcry from local families, campaigners, MPs and headteachers. The Guardian reported in December that Newham council’s Eat for Free scheme, which benefited up to 14,000 local children annually and saved families about £500 a year for each child in food costs, was under threat because of funding cuts. The east London borough has now announced the £6m-a-year scheme – that guarantees all primary school pupils aged from three to 11 years of age a free dinner during term time, regardless of household income – will remain in place. “We have listened to local families and know how important Eat for Free is. Despite the central government cuts and the economic costs of Covid-19, I am delighted to confirm that Eat for Free will remain,” said the Newham mayor, Rokhsana Fiaz. Local MPs and school leaders had praised the scheme as “life-changing” and said they feared the impact the proposed cut would have on the health and educational development of thousands of children, especially during the pandemic. Welcoming the decision, local MPs Stephen Timms and Lyn Brown, and London assembly member Unmesh Desai said in a letter to Fiaz the scheme was needed more than ever. “We are proud that Newham will continue to set a positive moral and political example of excellence, especially in the context of stretched finances.” Newham has been required to make £250m of funding cuts over the past decade, and in common with many other councils it has been forced to look at closing or shrinking “non-core” services that it has no legal duty to provide. Newham had put forward a range of options to save £2m a year from the Eat for Free scheme, including charging parents up to £1.42 a day for school meals. It is understood council officials are examining draft budgets to see where those savings can now be found. Under the government’s national scheme for England, all primary school pupils from reception to year 2 receive free school meals. Newham extends that offer to years 3 to 6. It is one of just four such council schemes in England, alongside the London boroughs of Islington, Southwark and Tower Hamlets. Half of all children in Newham live in poverty, making it the second poorest borough in England after Tower Hamlets. Hunger is a growing problem in the borough during the pandemic, and just under a quarter of Newham’s children are food insecure, meaning they regularly miss meals or go hungry.",education
"My husband, Bob Godfrey, who has died aged 81, had an influential life, which left a lasting legacy in teacher training and higher education. After graduating in French from Exeter University, and a brief flirtation with industry, Bob began to find his true vocation, moving to France in 1963 and teaching English and business studies at the Université de Bretagne Occidentale in Brest. In 1967 he returned to the UK to work at St Luke’s Teacher Training College, Exeter, as head of French, gaining an MA and a PhD along the way. The next step, in 1975, was to Gypsy Hill College of Education in Kingston upon Thames as head of research and development. Gypsy Hill merged with the then Kingston polytechnic, and Bob soon became head of teacher education and music and then dean of the faculty of education. This was a difficult time for teacher education, with cuts and many new-style courses. Bob’s faculty emerged even stronger, and his innovative work, not least in school partnerships, was recognised nationally when he sat on the education committee of the Council for National Academic Awards. In 1989 he became deputy director of Kingston, and then, when it became a university in 1992, pro-vice-chancellor. Good relations with the town were critical during this period, and Bob was generous with his time, serving as president of the Kingston Chamber of Commerce. Despite worsening staff to student ratios, Kingston gained an excellent reputation for teaching and learning, with Bob using his inspirational leadership skills to manage many changes that improved the student experience. It was no surprise that, soon after retiring from Kingston University in 1999, he was asked to help turn around the fortunes of Thames Valley University. Bob brought all of his skills to the role of supporting the interim vice-chancellor, and a stronger institution emerged. He was held in high regard by staff, many of whom remained firm friends. Born in Plymouth, Devon, Bob grew up in Newton Abbot, attending the local grammar school. His mother, Amy (nee Hansford), was a teacher and his father, Thomas, an engineering tutor. Pedagogy was in his blood. The prolonged effects of major reconstructive hip and leg surgery and MDS, a rare blood cancer, took their toll, but Bob never lost his sense of humour, and enjoyed a busy and happy retirement. Everyone who knew Bob valued his friendship and many acts of generosity and kindness. He had been a keen rugby player at Exeter University and was an enthusiastic England supporter, so he was thrilled when, three weeks before he died, his team Exeter Chiefs beat Racing 92 to win the coveted Heineken Champions Cup. Bob and I met at Kingston polytechnic in 1979 and we married in 1988. He is also survived by his sons, David and Nick, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce, his stepchildren, Rachael and Jason, his grandchildren, Jacques, Felix, Olivia, Ella and Amelie, and his step-grandchildren, Ruben, Ava and Akasha.",education
"The government has been urged to set up a post-pandemic wellbeing fund for schools in England to match its £650m academic catch-up funding, after a major study highlighted worsening mental health among young people, with teenage girls particularly severely affected. The research tracked the experiences of young people in England, at the ages of 11, 14 and 17, and found that while wellbeing declined for all groups as they got older, girls experienced far lower levels of wellbeing and self-esteem than boys and were more likely to feel unhappy about their physical appearance. The study by the Education Policy Institute and the Prince’s Trust, conducted over two years and based on data from the Millennium Cohort Study, found the proportion of girls that felt unhappy about their appearance rose sharply between the ages of 11 and 14, from one in seven (15%) to about one in three (29%). Researchers found that poverty, heavy use of social media, being bullied in childhood and lack of physical exercise all had a negative impact on wellbeing, and warned that the experience of the pandemic was likely to exacerbate existing mental health and wellbeing problems among young people. Whitney Crenna-Jennings, the report’s author and an EPI senior researcher, said: “Young people already face significant challenges at this stage in their lives, but this generation have also had to deal with a pandemic that will have starved them of the vital relationships and experiences needed to support their journey through adolescence. “The government has provided extra academic support for pupils but there is now a compelling case for it to consider emergency funding to support young people’s mental health and wellbeing. If we fail to counter the ill-effects of this crisis on young people’s health and development, there is a real risk that it inflicts irreversible damage on their later life chances.” With most children and young people studying from home during lockdown, the government is coming under growing pressure to set out when and how schools will reopen amid mounting concern about young people’s mental health. An NHS Digital report published last year found one in six young people have a probable mental illness, up from one in nine in 2017. The schools minister, Nick Gibb, faced a battery of questions from disgruntled MPs when he appeared in the Commons on Tuesday to respond to an urgent question from Labour, amid continuing uncertainty about when and how schools will reopen and criticism of the government’s laptop scheme. Among those MPs in favour of getting all children back in school was the Tory MP Dr Caroline Johnson, who said the balance of risk was now in favour of reopening schools. She said: “As a paediatrician, I see the damage that is being done to children’s mental health when they’re not at school. “With the vaccination programme steaming ahead, levels of Covid falling and in some cases lower than they were last term when schools were open, does he agree with me that the balance of risk is now in favour of reopening schools and that they should reopen at February half-term at the very latest?” Meanwhile, the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has published her own roadmap, calling for progress on school reopening to form a regular part of the Downing Street briefings. Among her proposals for gradual reopening are halving class sizes, staggered returns, rotas, a regionalised approach and the use of additional community spaces to spread pupils and make schools safer. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is clear that the pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the mental health and wellbeing of many children, and we fully endorse this report’s recommendation for additional funding for schools to deliver extra support.” A Government spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to supporting the mental wellbeing of children and young people, particularly through the challenges of this pandemic which have uniquely impacted this generation. “Early intervention and treatment is vital and we are training a new dedicated mental health workforce for schools and colleges across the country as well as teaching what good mental and physical health looks like.”  ",education
"Schools should let teachers select additional vulnerable pupils for an early return to classrooms to increase numbers gradually, a leading scientist has said as the children’s commissioner demanded a roadmap for full reopening. In an interview with the Guardian, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Prof Russell Viner, said any increase in pupil numbers in England’s schools would depend on infection rates and demand on NHS services. But when safe to do so, vulnerable children currently not attending school could be prioritised for a return to the classroom, he said, rather than the reintroduction of entire year groups which would have a greater impact on Covid transmission rates. About 14% of pupils in England are currently getting in-person teaching, including children of key workers and the most vulnerable pupils, amid closures planned until February half-term. But with the government declining to guarantee that schools will reopen even after Easter in April, many in the sector are arguing for a phased return, with early years, primary and exam years among groups likely to be considered first, and with rota systems in secondary schools to limit transmission. Viner said: “We could look at a gradual increase in school attendance, starting with more vulnerable children and those coming to harm at home. If we asked every teacher, most would be able to identify five children doing less well at home. We may have some room to bring those children back into school before we open up to whole years.” The call came as the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, urged Boris Johnson to set out key criteria that need to be met for schools to safely reopen, and what additional measures may be necessary in schools, such as testing or staff vaccinations, to suppress the virus. “Unfortunately, it is much easier to close schools than to reopen them,” she wrote in a letter to the prime minister. “That is why we are calling on the government to produce a clear roadmap for reopening schools to all pupils. Without it, there is a risk that the status quo becomes embedded as a default position.” In further pressure on Johnson, the Times reported that Public Health England has concluded primary schools can safely reopen after half-term if cases keep falling. It said a series of studies had concluded that pupils in that age group play a small role in spreading infection. Earlier, Downing Street indicated that schools in England are not expected to start fully reopening until at least early March. The government has promised to reassess lockdown measures on 15 February, and Johnson’s spokesperson said this would be the point at which the evidence would be examined to see if any easing could take place. The comments came after the prime minister said he would examine “the potential of relaxing some measures” connected to lockdown once the top four categories of vulnerable adults had had their first Covid vaccination, due to happen by mid-February. Labour accused the prime minister of causing further confusion over when schools will reopen and called on the government to guarantee that schools and colleges will be first to reopen when lockdown eases. Speaking ahead of an urgent question in the Commons on Tuesday, shadow schools minister Wes Streeting said: “Labour has been clear that safeguarding our children’s education must be the top priority: that means schools must be the last to close and first to reopen. “The government should be working with education staff to develop a credible plan to get pupils back to schools and colleges safely as soon as possible.”  Longfield said children and families had been left “stunned” by the apparent unravelling of return plans, and called on the government to have more ambition and not to be “defeatist”. She said it seemed more manageable for primary children to return to school and there was a strong argument for children to go back in stages. “There’s the potential to have some blended learning so children can learn at home for half the week, but children need that sense that actually there’s an end to this and they can start to get their lives back.” A Mumsnet survey of 1,000 UK parents of school-age children found that 62% were in favour of primary children and those in exam years returning to school after February half-term. Three-quarters said school lockdowns were harming their child’s education, and 73% of those doing home-schooling said their child was more demotivated and disengaged than usual. The Mumsnet founder, Justine Roberts, said: “Most parents accept that the national situation demands restrictions on school attendance, but the impacts on parents and children are serious. Working mothers in particular are really struggling, and worrying about their own future in the workplace as well as children’s education and wellbeing.” New research into remote education by the schools watchdog Ofsted raised concerns about pupil motivation, with nearly half of parents who took part in the survey struggling to keep children focused. Almost two-thirds of parents of pupils with special educational needs said their children were disengaged from remote learning.",education
"My friend and colleague Roy Wisbey, one of the leading figures in British German studies, has died aged 91. Roy revolutionised the study of modern languages by pioneering the field of digital humanities, which is now fundamental to research in the area. He founded the Literary and Linguistic Computing Centre at Cambridge University in 1964, and collaborated in the creation in 1973 of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (now the European Association for Digital Humanities), of which he was the first chair and president (1980-83). In the early days, computing was extremely laborious, being based on mainframe computers, punched cards and magnetic tape. It is all the more remarkable that Roy recognised the medium’s potential and made Cambridge a world leader in digital humanities. Equally important was his transformation of the Modern Humanities Research Association (MHRA) into a financially well-endowed and high-powered force with national reach. Roy taught 16th- and 20th-century German literature at Durham and medieval German literature at Cambridge, before being appointed head of the department of German at King’s College London (1971-94). Under Roy’s stewardship the department was modernised and became one of the leading places for teaching and research in the subject in the UK. When I took over from him, the secretary had no files, but Roy’s filing cabinets were bursting with papers covered in innumerable notes in his tiny, angular handwriting. During this period he held other distinguished offices including a tenure as honorary director of the Institute of Germanic Studies of the University of London. His services to German studies were recognised by awards from the Federal German Republic in 1987 and the Republic of Austria in 1988. Above all a brilliant medievalist, specialising in Gottfried von Strassburg’s Tristan, Roy played a key role in the creation of the King’s Centre for Late Antique and Medieval Studies, of which he was the first director. He was truly a universal man. Born into a working-class family in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, to Albert, who became chairman of the council in Bishop’s Stortford, and Mary, Roy attended Bishop’s Stortford College. He then did military service, serving as a warrant officer, second class, and went on to study modern and medieval languages at Cambridge, graduating with a first in 1952, after which he earned a doctorate at the University of Frankfurt. Everything Roy did was marked by his probity and his commitment, his passion and his kindness. At the end of every day he would go for an hour’s swim in the students’ union and then return to the office for a night shift. In 1949, Roy met Ernestine (Erni) on an exchange visit to Vienna. They married in 1951. Erni was tireless in assisting Roy in his duties as honorary treasurer of the MHRA. She died earlier this year. He is survived by their son, John, and grandchildren, Jamie, Elizabeth, Arabella and Alexander.",education
"Some primary school pupils, along with students taking vocational courses, could return to classrooms in Wales after the February half-term as long as the Covid infection rate continues to fall, but the end of the lockdown in other aspects of life is still many weeks away, the Welsh government has said. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said a “phased and flexible” return to school for some pupils was being planned for the week beginning 22 February. He said the youngest children might be the first to return, as it was difficult for them to learn remotely and they were the least likely to catch the infection and pass it on. But he said the Labour cabinet was also keen to get students sitting qualifications, especially vocational ones, back as quickly as possible. Drakeford went against the call of the UK Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, for teachers to be vaccinated at half-term, insisting the Welsh government would follow the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s advice on who should receive their jabs first. He said parents would not be forced to send children back to school if they did not feel it was safe, and revealed summer schools might be arranged for some pupils to catch up. But Drakeford warned the fast-changing nature of the virus meant plans might have to be revised. “When it is safe to do so, we will bring more children back, and I’d like to see it build up as quickly as it is safe to do so, but you can only judge that in the circumstances at the time.” As expected, the lockdown in Wales, which began before Christmas, will stay in place for at least another three weeks. Falling infection rates in Wales mean that two minor “easements” are being made over support bubbles and exercise. People will now be able to exercise with one person from another household – while remaining local. This has been brought in after women said they felt nervous going out alone in the dark. Citizens who have been allowed to form a support bubble with another household will be able to “dissolve” that arrangement and form a different bubble provided they leave a 10-day gap. Drakeford, however, made it clear that there was “unlikely to be much headroom” for more restrictions in Wales to be lifted at the time of the next review on 19 February. Asked whether activities and sports such as fishing, golf and tennis might resume, he said: “Every bit that you do creates new opportunities for people to get together and when people get together, coronavirus thrives.” Drakeford took a couple of swipes at the UK government. Asked whether he would welcome Boris Johnson to Wales following his controversial trip to Scotland, Drakeford said he was only leaving Cardiff when there was a genuine emergency. He said: “On the whole I think it is preferable for people who make rules that we expect other people to observe to observe them ourselves.” The first minister also argued that UK ministers had done “the least they thought they could get away with” when they drew up plans to tighten up the UK border to drive down Covid cases. Asked whether he could envisage the UK being closed off for six months or the rest of the year, he said: “I can envisage that. I did say in a meeting with the UK government this smacked again of the UK government doing the least they thought they could get away with rather than the most that needed to be done.”",education

"Teachers have raised strong concerns over the government’s plans to mass test secondary pupils, warning that it will delay the reopening of schools and fail to catch asymptomatic carriers of Covid, as well as spreading “a false sense of security” among teenagers. On Monday, the government will reveal it wants schools to use controversial lateral flow tests to check secondary pupils for Covid-19 up to three times, before allowing them to return to the classroom in England on 8 March, the Observer understands. Millions of students will then be expected to test themselves twice a week at home, under the supervision of their parents, in a bid to catch asymptomatic cases before they can spread the disease to others at school. However, the NEU teachers’ union says many school leaders are “entirely unconvinced” that lateral flow tests are sensitive and accurate enough to pick up positive cases among asymptomatic young people, who typically have lower viral loads than adults. Mary Bousted, the union’s joint general secretary, said headteachers face a huge logistical challenge to set up mass testing in schools, and fear it will be time-consuming and pointless. “The idea that we could do three tests and open in one big bang on 8 March – that simply won’t be possible,” she said. It could easily take two to three weeks for the average secondary school, which has around 1,000 pupils, to carry out 3,000 tests, teachers estimate. School leaders who have already set up lateral flow testing regimes for vulnerable children and the offspring of key workers have “no confidence” they are fit for purpose, Bousted said. According to the latest NHS test and trace figures, just 0.31% of lateral flow tests conducted in the week ending 10 February found positive cases – a figure so low it is actually below the 0.32% “false positive rate” for these tests. “School leaders are telling us that they’re doing these tests and they just don’t get any positives. Their accuracy is very doubtful for mass testing. They’re not sensitive to small viral loads and secondary school pupils are much more likely to be asymptomatic [than older people]. So they’ll miss a lot of positive cases.” She said carrying out such inaccurate tests could be dangerous and give “an entirely false sense of security” to asymptomatic pupils who test negative. “If you’ve taken a lateral flow test which is giving you a false negative, then it’s all too easy to imagine that lots of teenagers will feel confident they haven’t got the virus and behave accordingly. “The danger is that these pupils start not to practise social distancing, hand washing and other protective measures.” Lateral flow tests “simply will not eradicate the virus” in schools: “School leaders don’t have any faith they are worthwhile.” She also warned it is highly unlikely that all teenage pupils will comply with the instruction to take a home test twice a week after they return to school, and that compliance will be difficult for schools to enforce. “How you police this is a nightmare. I taught teenagers for a long time, and I love them, but they have really quite clear views about their own bodily space. “Some will flatly refuse to stick swabs down their throat or up their nose – and I don’t think there’s much of an incentive for parents to ’fess up if their child won’t take the test. Or the child may tell their parents they’ve taken it, when they haven’t. ” On Friday, nine teaching unions, including the NEU, called for a gradual, phased return of children to school in England, warning that if sufficient time isn’t given to assess the impact of opening schools on transmission rates, it could trigger another spike in Covid infections. Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, is also said to be “very unhappy” with the idea of all 10 million children and staff returning to school on 8 March. “Headteachers are determined to open schools as rapidly as possible,” said Jules White, founder of Worth Less?, the grassroots headteachers’ group. “But we need to be trusted to make the right decisions for our local communities.” That includes the ability to operate a staggered start and, depending on local infection rates, use rotas which will allow children to socially distance more effectively in classrooms. “We want as many kids back in school as is safe for kids and staff.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We know schools, parents and pupils need clarity on plans as soon as possible, which is why we have committed to providing two weeks’ notice for them to prepare. “The prime minister is due to set out plans for schools reopening on 22 February, and pupils will return from 8 March at the earliest.”",education
"You might think that postgraduate courses and pandemics don’t mix, but Tristram Hooley, chief research officer at the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), says that the demand for postgraduate study actually rises during periods of recession. “Many graduates sensibly seek to delay their entry to the labour market and enhance their skills while they wait,” he says. “Obviously universities are taking advantage of this situation and pushing postgraduate degrees hard.” Chris Rea, head of commercial services for graduate careers specialist Prospects at Jisc, which works with research and education partners to develop technologies for teaching, says that despite the government’s current financial constraints, it is business as usual when it comes to postgrad funding. “Government loans schemes remain popular and there has been no significant change to tuition fees,” says Rea. “There has been some talk about refunds for the first term but that has been focused more on undergraduates than postgraduates. The postgraduate funding instruments are intact – the national master’s and PhD loan schemes, Research Council studentships, charities, foundations and trusts, and university scholarships are all running as usual.” The impact of the lockdown has probably been felt more acutely by postgraduate students who are working while studying, he says, with the collapse of jobs in traditional student employment sectors. Before you embark on a postgraduate course you should, however, consider the costs against the long-term employment benefits, says Hooley. “Not all postgraduate courses are equal and students should be wary about just staying in education for the sake of it. “Very few of our ISE members actively require a postgraduate degree. Students would be advised to choose postgraduate courses that clearly lead to jobs and which can demonstrate that they produce employable graduates.” The average taught master’s course costs more than £8,000, according to figures from FindAMasters and the Times Higher Education but postgraduates fees can vary depending on the subject, university and location. Postgraduate master’s courses can include MSc (master of science), MA (master of arts), MRes (master of research) and LLM (master of law.) The UK government offers postgraduate student loans of up to £11,222 but the eligibility criteria can vary depending on the student’s course, age, nationality or residency status. There are a number of other options, too: government funding from the seven UK Research Councils (students usually apply through their course provider); scholarships; studentships – postgraduate positions that come with funding, charitable trusts and societies and, if you’re working, potentially your employer. UK students wanting to study a postgraduate course in Northern Ireland may be able to get financial support from the Department for the Economy. Scottish students may also get help from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Prof Bruce Rayton, academic director of PGT (postgraduate taught) Recruitment and Admissions at the University of Bath, says that despite the current conditions, the prospects for the postgraduate market remain buoyant. “Every indication is that prospective students still greatly value the opportunity of a postgraduate education and look forward to pursuing their studies when they feel the situation allows.” Melissa Aitchison, 22, is doing a master’s in politics and contemporary history at the University of Nottingham“I applied to do my master’s last summer, which was quite late in the year but after the pandemic started in March I thought it would be even harder to get a full-time job. I was a student at Nottingham Trent before, but the experience of doing a master’s has been completely different. Funding my course has been one of the biggest challenges for me. Previously, I’d received a core bursary of three payments totalling £750 for each year of my degree, but this was not available for postgraduate study. As master’s students we pay for our own tuition. I have a loan of £11,000, which is split into three payments and my course costs £9,045. I share a house with seven other students and my rent is around £95 a week. “I earn between £300-500 a month as a waiter at our local Beefeater restaurant, but I was furloughed during the second lockdown last year, which meant my earnings went down. My mum also has to help me out each month or else I just wouldn’t manage. Mum is self-employed so gives me whatever she can afford that month, usually around £100, but it can vary. “There have been other challenges, too. My housemates and I all got Covid in October and had to self-isolate in our rooms for two weeks. I only have two hours of face-to-face seminars a week for my course so it’s hard to feel part of things at times. I’d have felt lost without my housemates.” Saurav Dutt, 35, is doing a master’s in law at King’s College London “We had a fairly swift transition to online learning when the pandemic began last year (March 2020) but e-learning was already a major feature of my master’s course. It’s very convenient in lots of ways and I like the fact I can do it from the comfort of my own home, but not being able to have as much interaction with students and teachers can be a bit challenging at times. I think recorded videos lack the personal touch and it’s much easier to learn, debate and analyse issues in a small classroom. “My master’s is self-funded and I had initially planned to cover most of the £9,000 costs with my earnings from my job as a contractor in the City but I was made redundant after the pandemic. By then I’d paid off about half of the cost of the course. “After that, I borrowed from family and worked in various freelance roles to make up the difference. I did think about getting a loan but thought, given the current climate, interest rates would be prohibitive. “I am looking to do a Doctorate in law after the LLM and teach law. I’m also trying to cultivate a side-gig with digital marketing, creative writing, being an author and research for NGOs.” *Interviews by Georgina Fuller",education
"Children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England have had their education “pushed to one side” during the course of the pandemic “for the convenience of the majority,” according to a survey of parents. The poll of more than 1,000 parents uncovered “widespread failure” to restore special educational needs provision when children returned to school in September 2020, with a “sizeable” number of Send children unable to return to school at all. Although children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) – legally binding documents that entitle them to additional vital support – are among those eligible to attend school during lockdown, fewer than two in five were in school last week. In some cases, parents said, risk assessments carried out prior to allowing children back on site had been used to “filter attendance” and prevent some Send children from returning to school, while 8% of those who took part in the poll said they had no placement to send their child back to. The survey conducted by Special Needs Jungle, a parent-led campaign group, found therapies normally delivered by NHS staff, including speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, were particularly badly affected, with many still not back in place last term. Almost two-thirds of parents of pupils with EHCPs reported that their child’s additional provision had not been fully restored, while fewer than one in five confirmed that all provision had been fully restored. “Given that schools have been allocated funding to carry out these interventions, and there is an absolute legal duty for local authorities to ensure that the provision in EHCPs is delivered, we believe the failure in delivering it should be investigated at a national level,” the survey’s authors said. Provision was worse for Send children without an EHCP – just 8% of parents said all their child’s special educational needs support was back in place, while almost three-quarters said some or all of their child’s Send support had been withdrawn, including vital teaching assistant support. The poll was published just days before the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was due to give details about how and when schools will fully reopen as lockdown restrictions are lifted. The outgoing children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said: “Every child has a right to an education, and every child with Send has a right to receive the help and support they need. “Some have fallen out of sight during the lockdown, and it is vital that, as schools begin to fully reopen, local authorities and settings have plans in place so that all children with Send can return as quickly as possible.” After the cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels in England for the second year running, the government is also due to unveil its plans for summer assessments next week, but there are fears that more than 300,000 Send students could be adversely affected by the new arrangements. The National Deaf Children’s Society, the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), the Professional Association of the Vision Impairment Education Workforce and the British Association of Teachers of the Deaf have joined forces to raise awareness of the potential unfairness of the emergency arrangements. In normal times, students with Send are allowed adjustments including extra time or rephrased questions for exams, so they can perform to their full potential. If assessments are based on past performance, however, campaigners say students risk being assessed without the adjustments they would normally get in formal exams, which could result in lower grades. Caireen Sutherland, the principal education officer at RNIB, said: “Young people with vision impairment must be given the same opportunity as their sighted peers to achieve the grades they deserve. “These results could affect their lives for years to come, so it’s vital that accessibility arrangements and the views of specialists are taken into account when these grading decisions are made.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We know the impact of being out of education can be greatest on vulnerable children and young people, including those with education, health and care plans. That’s why schools should continue to welcome vulnerable children and young people to attend where possible. “For pupils with special educational needs and disabilities who cannot attend, schools should ensure those pupils are able to access remote education alongside their peers.”",education
"When Zak Romaszko finished his physics degree at the University of Liverpool, a PhD in computing was his obvious next step. “I have always been fascinated with computers,” says the 27-year-old. “I broke my dad’s PC when I was younger and he was away in the forces, so I had to fix it myself.” His interest grew from there, but Romaszko’s choice of focus for his research isn’t just any type of computing – but the cutting-edge quantum variety. Thought by many to be the next step in the field, and key to solving complex problems in a manageable amount of time, quantum computers use quantum bits rather than the regular bits used by standard computers. “It will be able to solve problems that might take computers millions and billions of years in timescales that are more realistic to humans,” says Romaszko. “It seemed to be that this would be the way forward in how big calculations would be done in the future.” He found an opportunity to undertake a PhD at the University of Sussex with Prof Winfried Hensinger – a subject expert – linked to making an ion trap quantum computer, the next step in the computers of the future. Romaszko, who is from Barnoldswick in Lancashire, spent four years on the project as part of the university’s Ion Quantum Technology group, graduating in June 2020. He has now joined a spin-off company founded by Hensinger called Universal Quantum, which is looking to commercialise the technology to make a large-scale quantum computer. “My PhD focused on how we would scale this technology from the level we are at now and get to the point where we need to be to make a truly useful quantum computer,” he says. It sounds like science fiction but Romaszko explains that quantum computers could hold the key to solving some major issues in our world today. “People are looking into things like simulation of chemicals and materials and understanding how medicines interact within the body and AI applications,” he says. While it may be difficult to grasp the scale of the computing power at work in the quantum, Romaszko is thrilled to be pushing the boundaries. “With a PhD you’re basically learning about a field and a very narrow area of science that you just plan to push out a little bit further and expand human knowledge. It’s really exciting.”",education
"The mental health of postgraduate students is starting to receive the attention it needs. While undergraduate wellbeing is often in the limelight, postgrads are six times more likely to experience depression and anxiety than the general population, according to global research into 2,279 mostly PhD candidates. But universities are ramping up support that can make students more resilient, while mental wellbeing is also associated with superior productivity. Coronavirus has been the catalyst. More than 50% of students think their mental health has suffered since the pandemic struck, according to a survey from the National Union of Students. The switch to remote teaching has made many experience anxiety and depression. Research students face some unique challenges, given that a PhD has always been a potentially isolating experience that relies on a good relationship with a research supervisor. Even among taught students, returning to study can be a challenge after a long spell in the workforce. Postgrads should be aware of the wealth of support on offer, though. “Researchers can fall through a gap between student and staff mental health support,” says Katie Wheat, head of engagement and policy at Vitae, a non-profit that trains researchers. “Provision can target the larger undergraduate population.” The pandemic is amplifying existing stressors and creating fresh challenges for postgrads, including switching to virtual research projects, or seeking funding extensions if research must be postponed. Vitae and the Student Mental Health Research Network surveyed researchers during lockdown and found half were stressed about their work, two thirds worried about their future plans and 70% fretted over finances. Meanwhile, Georgie Hopkins speaks for many postgrads when she relays feeling sometimes isolated studying for her MBA online at Exeter’s Business School: “There are times when it’s just you, your desk and your camera but you could really do with some personal interaction with other students.” However, she adds the support of her peer group has been strong, with virtual meetups on Zoom common. Indeed, Exeter has its own welfare adviser and postgrads are also offered appointments with qualified mental health practitioners, group support sessions and a series of workshops on how to take charge of their own mental health. At City, University of London, postgrads have access to a counselling team that provides a safe place for students to speak and seek therapy. An early intervention can prevent the situation from worsening. “Universities need to allow protected time for academic staff to offer pastoral support for students,” says Midge Seymour-Roots, head of student counselling and mental health services at City. Inmaculada Adarves-Yorno, senior lecturer in leadership studies at Exeter, runs mindfulness sessions and advises that students practice breathing exercises and improve nutrition as well as sleep. “The mind is the biggest resource for a PhD candidate,” she says.",education
"Postgraduate study can at times be more of an isolating experience as there aren’t the huge numbers that you have at undergrad level. But while you may find yourself among fewer fellow students in the aggregate, taught postgraduate courses are often designed to include more collaborative work. “There’s a real sense of community and family that develops,” says Daniel Jones*, who has just completed a scriptwriting MA at the University of Derby. “It was awesome and a lot of us are great mates after it now.” Peers tend to interact much more and critique each other’s work and the feedback plays a large part in creating a more intense environment. “The emphasis on smaller, group work fosters a sense of community and working together brings people closer than you would normally see in undergraduate courses,” says Damon Miller, associate lecturer at the Open University. “As a postgrad student you will be much more self-directed but there is certainly a greater sense of peer relationships.” Students also have a more intense relationship with their tutor as they tend to work more closely with them than at undergraduate level. Dublin City University, for example, has recently increased the level of small-group teaching to give students a direct and interactive experience with university staff. This is designed to help students engage, ask questions, and build connections with other students. Students are also scheduled with the same group for most of their classes to encourage the development of small communities within class groups. Online platforms are helping too. Most courses have shared WhatsApp and Facebook groups. The success of these depends on what the students make of them, as students themselves often establish, run and keep the groups active. They can also be used to bring people together outside the course, and many students share information about their hobbies and interests, such as sport and music. This can be especially important for part-time students who may have little contact with the activities of the wider university. For many, postgraduate study is a chance to forge new friendships. “You’re left more on your own, but it’s part of a growing process. People are no longer in that clique that they spent the last three years hanging out with at undergrad, and it helps you forge new relationships,” says Jones. Making connections is easy, he says, when you know you’re all into the same subject, and it can have a profound effect. “It changed my life, it really did. I got a job off the back of it and I’m moving to a new city.” *Name changed on request",education
"From commissioning TV ads to analysing sales data, marketing is a discipline that combines science with creative magic. Perfecting skills such as branding, digital promotion, creative engagement and consumer psychology requires both in-depth study and on-the-job experience. A master’s degree in marketing offers a chance to learn these skills and helps students plan their career path. “The opportunities are limitless,” says Beverly Wagner, department head of marketing at the University of Strathclyde. Graduates from Strathclyde’s marketing MSc degree can go into classic marketing roles, such as becoming brand managers or they can use the course to broaden their business skills base. “As well as the typical marketing jobs, our marketing MSc graduates are employed in businesses to support innovation, undertake market research, analyse industry trends, carry out strategic planning and create social media strategies,” she says. Students learn about areas such as consumer behaviour, customer service and digitalisation. “Every class includes guest speakers from industry and students are appraised of industry trends and how their degrees can support a variety of career choices. Assignments are often based around real-life business problems,” she says. One of the big attractions of a master’s in marketing is that it offers a wide-ranging perspective of the field. This was part of the appeal for Lily Garefalaki, who has just completed a one-year MSc in strategic marketing at Cranfield School of Management. The course was interrupted by the pandemic lockdown, though teaching shifted seamlessly online. She says the MSc has provided her with a comprehensive understanding of marketing strategy from concept to implementation. She was also glad to receive training in two distinct areas, marketing to consumers (B2C) and marketing to businesses (B2B). “We were taught a range of modules covering both B2B and B2C, from key account management and digital marketing to branding. We were able to create strategic plans because the curriculum was structured as a journey, it connected everything together at the end. I liked this course because we were able to get a holistic view of marketing,” she says. In the first term, students worked on key account management – managing a company’s most important clients – with a real business. “Each team had a real live client for whom they did a key account management plan and we had meetings with the actual executives. So it was really hands-on from day one,” she says. Her ambition is to work in film and TV distribution, so she focused on areas such as subscription TV services and online video during the course. For her 16,000-word dissertation, making up 35% of the assessment, she conducted a literature review on the use of video games to conduct market research. Meanwhile, Maggie Jones, director of qualifications at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, advises candidates to check whether their chosen master’s offers a high level of digital training, as there is a shortage of digital skills in the industry. Another consideration is whether fellow students are pursuing careers in marketing or more general areas of business. “You pay a lot of money for a master’s, but many of the people who join it may not be marketing related. That can affect the whole experience, so it’s worth knowing what you are going into,” she says. Media and marketing: what you need to knowMedia and marketing remain popular choices for postgraduate study, offering either a route to academic study or a practical career boost. Those looking to work in news and reporting can take an MA in journalism at a number of universities – and there are a variety of media studies courses combined with subjects such as sociology, film studies and cultural studies. Most UK universities offer marketing master’s courses. These can either be MA degrees that focus on advertising, retail and public relations or MSc degrees that lean towards data and market research. The skilled marketer needs the ability to blend the two areas together. A master’s typically requires a bachelor’s degree, which can be in any subject. A master’s is especially useful for those with a number of years’ experience working in the field as a potential foot in the door for more senior roles. The qualification can aid promotion to a senior marketing role such as board-level marketing director. While many students self-fund their degrees, there are employers who are prepared to help with tuition fees. More than 10,000 students took postgraduate studies in marketing in 2018/19, according to HESA. Meanwhile, more than 5,000 students took media studies postgraduate courses and 2,000 studied journalism at postgraduate level. Some universities also offer marketing as part of an MBA course. The Chartered Institute of Marketing offers a variety of auxiliary training options that can prepare students for a master’s. Students can take a diploma in professional marketing or a diploma in digital marketing ahead of a master’s. A master’s can also be helpful when applying for chartered marketer status, recognised as the highest level of marketing in the profession.",education
"Graduate workers in America’s higher education system are organizing in response to high tuition fees, cuts to staff and faculty positions, reduced budgets and suppressed graduate workers’ right to organize unions. College and university administrations have introduced the measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Job losses have been substantial at US universities and colleges, as student enrollment has declined and reduced public funding for higher education at the state level is leading to drastic budget cuts. The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center reported in December a decline in enrollment of students at postsecondary institutions of 2.5% compared with fall 2019, driven largely by sharp drops in enrollment of undergraduate freshmen at public two-year institutions. Between February and November last year, employees at colleges and universities in the US declined by more than 188,000, not including affected workers employed by contractors. Graduate workers at the University of New Mexico (UNM) are currently awaiting hearings before the state public employees labor relations board at the end of March, in regards to the school administration attempting to use a rule proposed by the board under the Trump administration, which declared graduate workers are not workers, therefore they do not have the right to organize unions. The move comes after the University of New Mexico provost asserted the university recognizes the rights of graduate students to organize in October last year. “Some of the issues that we face are just being overworked and expected to work overtime without compensation for that overtime,” said Ramona Malczynski, a graduate worker in geography and environmental studies and a union organizer. “We receive about $6,000 to $8,000 annually in stipends, less than the living wage in Albuquerque. We don’t have good healthcare benefits, we don’t have dental or vision coverage. There are no protections against discrimination or mistreatment, and it’s widely known that graduate students are treated really poorly at any university.” Workers publicly announced their intent to unionize in October, and secured a majority of signed union authorization cards by December, though the University of New Mexico declined to formally recognize the union seeking to represent about 3,750 graduate workers.  University of New Mexico spokesperson Cinnamon Blair said in an email: “The issue of whether graduate students are ‘regular employees,’ and thereby eligible to unionize and bargain collectively under New Mexico law, is an undecided legal question. Regardless of how that question is decided, UNM will continue to both value and collaborate with its graduate students to ensure that their time at UNM is both personally fulfilling and advances their academic and professional goals.” Colleges and universities across the US are also cutting staff and faculty positions over budgetary concerns. The cuts have extended to private and public institutions, large and small. The pandemic has cost US universities and colleges an estimated $120bn in lost revenue. After months of looming cuts at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 39 workers in various departments received layoff notices on 21 January 2021. Faculty and students have held protests against the cuts and firings over the past several months. “It was a very immediate and harsh cutoff from campus and the community, and there was very little ability to provide feedback in the process,” said one of the laid-off employees. They requested to remain anonymous as the employees were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements to receive severance pay.  A Marquette University spokesperson said in an email: “There are no further layoffs planned at this time.” At Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York, the administration is cutting 116 non-tenure faculty positions over the next year out of 547 faculty positions at the school, citing the apparent coronavirus-accelerated need for the college to downsize amid budgetary concerns. Students, faculty, and alumni have criticized the cuts, pushing for more transparency and collaboration with students, faculty and alumni in finding alternative solutions. “We’re frustrated and hoping for a more collaborative response to all of this,” said Juan Arroyo, a politics professor at Ithaca College for 20 years who is expected to lose his position when his current contract expires at the end of the 2021-22 school year. “My contract ends when I’m 59 years old. So I’m starting to think of things that I wasn’t thinking about – like what is the earliest I can draw from social security, Medicare eligibility, all kinds of stuff like that, it’s now on the front burner.” A spokesperson for Ithaca College said in an email: “The facts demonstrate that the current size of the college is not sustainable. So the difficult but necessary steps are being taken to align our academic offerings with student interest and institutional need.” University students and workers are currently organizing strikes against exorbitant tuition fees during the coronavirus pandemic as some universities, such as Georgetown and Williams College, have reduced tuition and fees as many student activities remain cancelled and several classes are conducted remotely. Graduate workers at the University of Chicago are organizing a pledge to refuse to pay student fees to the university, which are currently $416 per quarter, citing the reduced services for students due to the pandemic and the high cost of the fee. According to the union, over 600 graduate workers and students have signed onto the pledge. “These are crises that have been coming to a head for a long time and Covid has really highlighted them. Tuition and exorbitant fees are getting higher and higher,” said Laura Colaneri, a graduate worker in Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian studies.  A spokesperson for the University of Chicago told the Guardian in an email: “Students at the University of Chicago have access to many critical services that are made possible by the student services fee.” They did not comment on what services are currently limited or halted due to the pandemic. More than 1,000 students at Columbia University are currently withholding their spring semester tuition as part of a strike to demand a 10% reduction in tuition fees and a 10% increase in financial aid. “The tuition strike is an effort to push back against the idea that administrators should unilaterally be making decisions with the financial resources that come out of teaching by faculty, tuition payments from students, the expropriated land of the surrounding community, and hard work of campus workers,” said Becca Roskill, a junior at Columbia University and one of the organizers of the strike. Without financial aid, tuition for undergraduates at Columbia University currently costs over $80,000 a year. The tuition strike movement also includes demands to reduce funding of campus police, divest school funds from fossil fuels, improve working conditions for graduate and undergraduate workers, and for the university to commit to transparency in regards to its investments. Students taking part in the strike have claimed the university has already begun to impose $150 late fees for unpaid tuition. “Our best safeguard against these sorts of measures is our collective strength. There’s been a really impressive will among strikers to continue striking through this,” added Roskill. “We’ve been staying in contact with committed strikers and we’re also trying to provide assistance to anyone struggling to pay late fees.” A Columbia University spokesperson said: “This is a moment when an active reappraisal of the status quo is understandable, and we expect nothing less from our students. Their voices are heard by Columbia’s leadership, and their views on strengthening the University are welcomed.”",education
"As children return to classrooms next week, official government guidance recommends primary school pupils need not don face coverings. However, a London council has advised the 56 primaries under its control that masks should be worn by children as young as four. The government says: “The Department for Education are in contact with the local council on that matter.” In general, data suggests that children up to the age of 18 experience lower rates of Covid-19-related hospitalisation and death compared with all other age groups. While all children are susceptible to and can transmit the virus that causes Covid-19, younger children appear to be less susceptible to infection and when infected less likely to spread the disease than older children and adults. Last week, the government announced plans for the full reopening of schools on 8 March alongside a suite of measures designed to enhance Covid safety – including twice-weekly testing and a recommendation to wear face coverings in classrooms for secondary pupils. The World Health Organization also recommends that only children aged 12 and over should wear a face covering under the same conditions as adults. So, what are the benefits to getting primary schoolchildren to wear masks? For one, whatever little degree of transmission is occurring in these age groups could be limited. It could also help normalise the practice – young children wearing masks may make their families more likely to accept masks, said Susan Michie, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, a Sage subcommittee. On the negative side, whatever the gains on aerosol transmission, if young children are more likely to touch them, take them off, leave them on surfaces or swap them among each other, that benefit will be undermined. Another issue is children with medical conditions that make it untenable to wear masks – but those are surmountable challenges; afflicted children can be given a badge or something similar to reflect that they cannot wear masks, she added. “Really, we need to be collecting data,” said Michie, noting that this happening in one council but not others offers an excellent opportunity for a natural experiment, in which data can be collected to indicate whether or not the intervention has a significant impact on infections and transmission. Scientists have long stressed the need for measures to make schools safer for return, and one of the key interventions, they say, is improving ventilation. However, the government’s major messaging campaign still prioritises hand washing, surface cleaning and social distancing, which downplays the fact that Covid mostly spreads through the air, and emphasises the risk of surface spread. “Ventilation, I would say, is much more important than masks … and there’s no negative side-effect of that,” said Michie, highlighting that the government should have focused on addressing that issue while schools were closed. Another issue is class sizes. “We have one of the most crowded classrooms in Europe … other countries have much bigger classrooms and smaller class sizes,” she said, suggesting that unused buildings and retired teachers could be put into use to solve that problem.",education
"Confusion over the rules governing face coverings in classrooms is in danger of creating “mask anarchy” in schools in England, a leading Conservative has warned. As schools prepare to welcome all pupils back into class next week, Robert Halfon, who chairs the cross-party Commons education committee, told ministers that head teachers were coming under pressure from parents over masks and called for “definitive regulations” to clear up the issue. According to its latest guidance, the government “recommends” the wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms where social distancing cannot be maintained, but it is not compulsory, and states: “No pupil or student should be denied education on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering.” Head teachers, including Vic Goddard, principal of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, which featured in the television series Educating Essex and is situated in Halfon’s constituency, say the issue risks causing conflict because of polarised opinions in school communities. Goddard tweeted: “I adore working for the @PassmoresAc and Harlow community (for over 20 years). It is an utter privilege. Now I am deliberately being put in to conflict with some of it by the actions of this government about masks when they are the ones with the information.” He went on: “Everyone, inc the govt, knows that the issue will cause conflict due to the polarised views held and they are throwing me under the bus. Already had ‘human rights’ quoted, threats of litigation, reporting to Ofsted and to @halfon4harlowMP.” The wearing of masks in classrooms and repeat Covid testing for secondary pupils are key new measures designed to give parents, pupils and teachers confidence when schools fully reopen next week, but that appears to have been undermined when the school standards minister, Nick Gibb, told TV interviewers last week it was not compulsory. The chair of the education committee told the Commons on Monday: “Given that the schools minister said that the wearing of masks by pupils on the school estate is advisory guidance, if a pupil or a parent on behalf of a pupil objects to comply with the wishes of a head teacher to wear a mask, are we not in danger of creating mask anarchy? “Enormous pressure is being put on head teachers in Harlow because of the confusion, like Vic Goddard, head teacher of Harlow Passmores school. Is it not better to come down firmly on one side or another and provide clearly definitive regulations to help teaching staff?” Gibb responded that the wearing of face coverings in classrooms where it is not possible to keep social distances between pupils was “strongly” recommended. Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, also raised concerns about up to half of parents failing to give consent for regular testing of their child and asked whether testing should be made opt-out rather than opt-in. “I welcome the reopening of schools and the long-awaited introduction of school testing, but with parental consent required, some schools are unable to test up to half of their pupils, putting their peers and families at avoidable risk. “Given the importance of school testing, shouldn’t it be opt-out rather than opt-in, ensuring a far greater number of pupils are tested whilst retaining a parent’s right to choose?” Gibb responded: “We do give very clear guidance, we do expect … parents to give permission to the school to allow their secondary school pupils to be tested twice a week. This is an important initiative that helps to minimise the risk of transmission within the secondary school estate.”",education
"The education secretary is using “completely misleading” and “dubious” research to justify introducing new legislation on free speech in universities, according to the head of Cardiff University. Gavin Williamson sparked anger in universities when he unveiled plans on 16 February to counter what he called “unacceptable silencing and censoring” on campuses. He plans legislation to allow speakers who are “no-platformed” to sue universities for compensation if they feel their rights have been infringed.  The government is thought to have relied heavily on a 2019 research report by Policy Exchange for evidence of a free speech “crisis” on campus. This research was cited repeatedly in last week’s white paper. Iain Mansfield, now Williamson’s special adviser, was head of education at the rightwing thinktank at the time of the report. Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff, a member of the prestigious Russell group, says a key example cited in the report, and mentioned in the Commons, is untrue and needs to be fully corrected for the record. It said that his university allowed the feminist Germaine Greer to be no-platformed in 2015 on the grounds that she had made “transphobic” comments. This never happened, he says – the event went ahead. Riordan says: “The research this is all based upon is completely misleading. There was a campaign against Germaine Greer speaking, and we had to consider whether to cancel the event – and we didn’t. It is exactly the opposite of what has been suggested: the event went ahead.” He says on a personal level he had some sympathy with the views of the protesters at the time, but felt his university had a duty to uphold free speech, and Greer was a professor at Warwick University. Policy Exchange surveyed students on their attitudes to possible free speech infringements, and asked them whether Cardiff had done the wrong thing in not stepping in to allow Greer to speak. Greer’s picture was on the front cover of the research report when it was published. Riordan says Cardiff wrote to Policy Exchange in 2019 asking for a retraction, and Mansfield promised to write a footnote correcting the mistake, but did not do so. After criticism on social media, the thinktank added a footnote last week to say the event had taken place.  Riordan says he is furious the mistake was ignored for so long. “David Davis cited the episode in his private member’s bill on free speech just last month, and others have quoted it as though it is fact. Now the government is taking it forward as a basis for serious legislative proposals.” Richard Wynn Jones, professor of Welsh politics at Cardiff, who attended Greer’s lecture at the university in 2015, says he found it “jaw-dropping” to read research saying it never took place. “I am outraged that this alleged event in Cardiff keeps being brought up by the culture warriors, and it’s now being presented as a key argument for new legislation.” He says the Greer case was clearly the one where the authors felt they had the best evidence for feelings being prioritised over free speech. “Supposedly this was someone who was a fearless feminist of her day being closed down by a woke mob while the university stood by. But that is absolutely, categorically untrue.” At Oxford University, students famously cancelled a talk by the former home secretary Amber Rudd 30 minutes before she was to appear, in March 2020, because of her links with the Windrush scandal. And gender-critical feminists have said they are being blocked from discussing trans issues on campus. But research by the government’s Office for Students found that of more than 62,000 requests by students for external speaker events in English universities in 2017-18, only 53 were rejected by the student union or university. In 2018 MPs on the joint committee on human rights concluded that claims of a free speech crisis on campus had been “exaggerated”. Their inquiry did not find “the wholesale censorship of debate” that some rightwing media had suggested. Now university heads say the government is manufacturing suspicion to fuel a “nakedly political culture war”. A spokesperson for Policy Exchange said: “We were happy to note that Cardiff University ensured that the Greer event went ahead. The question still serves to reveal a split in student opinion about what the university’s actions should have been, in response to the protest that led to the initial cancellation.” He said the question about Greer was one of seven examples, and the overall results illustrated “some challenges to academic free speech among students”. Privately, university heads say they are finding the clash between feminists and trans activists on campus difficult to navigate because their obligations under the Equality Act seem to clash with freedom of speech. Debates about Israel and Palestine are another fraught area. However, Riordan insists there is no solid evidence of a systemic problem with speakers being silenced on campuses, or of the “chilling effect” Williamson has described. “This is a bill in search of a cause. Higher education is getting caught in the middle of the culture wars,” he says. Some vice-chancellors worry that the government is seeking to blacken the universities’ reputation to make it easier to cut student numbers in the future. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, says the government is diminishing the achievements of universities. “Schools ministers and the secretary of state have had a bad pandemic. By contrast, universities are riding high in public affection because university researchers have produced a vaccine, and provided the science needed to understand what is going on, and people know we educate the nurses and doctors on the frontline.” Green was one of the university heads who blew the whistle in 2017 when the Conservative MP Chris Heaton-Harris sent what was seen as a “McCarthyist” letter to every university head, asking for the names of lecturers teaching about Brexit as well as lecture notes and syllabus details. At the time, Williamson was chief whip and Heaton-Harris worked in his office, Green says. “I have absolutely no doubt that when Mr Heaton-Harris MP wrote to me and other vice-chancellors he was intending to ‘chill’ discussion and debate,” he adds. Smita Jamdar, head of education at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, says the firm has been asked to advise on “quite a number” of free-speech cases, and in each case universities have been trying to find ways for a contested event to go ahead lawfully. “In the buildup to the university making a decision there are often all sorts of exchanges and negotiations, with one side protesting that this is hate speech and the other side arguing that it is lawful expression,” she says. “This is real, messy dynamic free speech in action. I don’t think someone questioning whether something can go ahead is a breach of free speech.” Some vice-chancellors view Williamson’s decision to crack down on free speech in the middle of a pandemic as unfair and shockingly timed when frustrated students are demanding fee and rent rebates, academics are exhausted, and no one has been debating anything on campus because of restrictions. The head of one prestigious research university, who wished to remain anonymous, says Williamson is attacking universities to score political points. “This is a nakedly political culture war. It is not about what it is pretending to be about,” the vice-chancellor says. “I remember David Cameron singling out universities as being the very best of Britain. Fast forward a few years and we’ve come to a place where universities are cast as a problem by elements of the Conservative party.” Dr Eric Lybeck, presidential fellow in Manchester University’s institute of education, is hosting a virtual “debate-in” every Monday afternoon, challenging “free speech warriors” in higher education to justify their claims of a crisis in the sector, although as yet it is unclear whether he has any takers. “They are painting our overworked, increasingly insecure yet noble profession as a stazi-like woke mob,” he says. “Me and my colleagues know for a fact there is no crisis of higher education beyond the jinned-up global campaign to smear us for political gain.” The Department for Education did not comment on the Germaine Greer case but said the government’s concern about censorship and silencing went further than high-profiled cases of no-platforming and cancelled events, and included a “chilling effect” on campus. “Unacceptable numbers of students and academics feel unable to express their lawful views without fear of repercussion. Our universities must remain areas where free speech and academic freedom are encouraged, which is why we have taken legislative action,” it said.",education
"With children and teenagers spending hours on screens each day, how do parents help them reap the benefits and stay healthy? Child development experts share their tips. Primary school-aged children may need help bridging the gap between what they view on screen and applying it in the real world. Parents should give them the space to get on with their school work, but regularly check in on them to ensure they understand what they are doing, as well as asking them about what they have learned afterwards, says Rachel Barr, a professor of developmental psychology at Georgetown University in Washington DC. Children can learn a lot from educational videos, but they will learn more if they build on those lessons using other types of content. For example, a young child might watch a CBeebies programme about spring and plants growing, then talk to their parents about it, and then play an app involving the same TV character watering a seed, or even plant a seed in real life. “This variety of activities helps her to connect the information to her real life and to build on that information,” Barr said. For an older child, they might have a favourite TV show and then decide to write their own story and discuss it with a friend online via text or video chat. “Media is a tool that can be used in multiple forms to learn about things that interest a child,” Barr said. “They may need support from others around them, but variety maximises the possibility that children will transfer the information from the media and integrate it into their everyday experience.” Screen time can be harmful if it displaces an healthy activity you need for healthy development, such as sleep, a good diet, and regular outdoor exercise. “Parents need to set boundaries at an early age, and the earlier the better, in terms of screen time and social media use, so it does not displace activities to stay healthy like, such as sleep,” said Bernadka Dubicka of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. “One of the other things I recommend is that parents are not too dictatorial around this, as the more you say no the more likely kids will go and do it. Having an open dialogue is important.” Talk to your child about setting tech-free times and zones, such as no devices at the dinner table or in the hour before bed. Also, be a good role model yourself – switch off noisy alerts and avoid constantly checking emails or social media updates. Websites can be blocked, content filtered and time limits set on devices. Get familiar with the various parental controls that are built into your devices’ operating systems. You can also adjust settings on video streaming sites such as YouTube and Netflix to prevent the next clip automatically playing, or children seeing inappropriate content. “Being able to turn off those automatic controls actually helps the child when you say okay, time to go outside for a minute, or go and read a book or play a puzzle,” Barr said. Common Sense Media has guidance on how to do this. Screen time does not have to be passive: children can make video clips, music, podcasts, or learn to code. It can also provide valuable opportunities for to children to stay in touch with friends, or even collaborate on projects, from baking cakes to writing a novel. Go to Common Sense Media for more tips.",education
"The Scottish government plans to reopen its primary schools after half-term, on 22 February, but initially only for pupils in the three youngest year groups and for some older children taking qualifications. England is waiting until at least 8 March, two weeks later, to start reopening schools. Education policy is devolved to national administrations, so the government in Westminster has no say over schools outside of England. Infection rates for Covid-19 among the general population are twice as high in England as in Scotland, meaning there is far greater community transmission of the virus. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week estimated that one in 55 people in England were infected, including one in 35 in London, while in Scotland the rate was one in 110. To put it another way: case rates in England are nearly 282 per 100,000 people, compared with close to 142 per 100,000 in Scotland. Wales has said it may reopen schools along the same lines as Scotland, from 22 February, but only if its Covid-19 infection rates continue to fall. The latest figures show one in 70 of the population infected as of last week. Northern Ireland has a higher rate of infection, with one in every 50 people estimated by the ONS to have been infected. As a result Northern Ireland, like England, is waiting until 8 March at the earliest for schools to return. At Wednesday’s press conference, Boris Johnson said the government’s top four priority groups would have acquired immunity after their first vaccination at least three weeks earlier by that date. Asked if schools could open before then, Johnson said data on the impact of vaccinations would not be ready until 15 February, and he wanted to be “prudent and cautious”. No. Some scientists and officials insist that a further delay may be needed. Calum Semple, a member of Sage, has said there are still “very high levels” of community transmission that could require schools to continue to allow only the children of critical workers and those in care or needing support to attend in person, as they have since the start of term. Others say reopening may need to be delayed so the spread of the worrying South African variant can be kept in check.",education
"If you want to start a university or college course this year but fear you’ve missed the deadline, all is not lost. Applications for undergraduate courses starting this autumn were due to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) by 29 January. Some highly subscribed courses, such as medicine, cut off in October last year. But there’s still time to find the right course for you. Isobel Rossiter, head of student recruitment at the University of Plymouth, says the key dates are useful to work towards, but universities have always recruited after the deadline to enable students to access available places. In fact, many students apply after January for valid reasons: some outdo their predicted grades, or have a change of heart or of circumstance. And for mature students or career switchers, there’s less need to apply around exam results. All of this means late applications are welcomed throughout the year. There’s space to apply, and support available to make the most of it. You have until 30 June 2021 to apply for courses that still have places. After that you can use Ucas clearing, a scheme that matches applicants with vacancies. The very last date to apply for 2021 entry is 21 September. The main difference is that applications received after January aren’t guaranteed equal consideration (where course providers consider all applications equally). In practice, Rossiter says, this mainly applies to more competitive courses. Gurjit Nijjar, assistant registrar at the University of Derby, adds that even some in-demand courses don’t always close immediately. “The reason being universities haven’t quite processed everything that’s come in,” she says. Either way, Courteney Sheppard, senior customer experience manager at Ucas, recommends students contact the university to “find out if the course will be available either in clearing, or if they’ll make it available later”. First, check which courses have vacancies. You can look this up via Ucas, then confirm availability on the course provider’s website. Next, ring the university and ask about teaching, facilities, funding, housing, etc. Make sure they’re right for your needs. Share your circumstances and why you’re applying late, too, as you may be due additional support. Nijjar advises attending any university events on offer (a good sign they still have places to fill). Rossiter recommends forums such as thestudentroom. Or use the buddy box, if the university’s website has this feature, to chat to current students. “The process for applying is still fundamentally the same,” Sheppard says. “Students will need to complete a Ucas application form and fill in their personal details. They’ll need to do a personal statement. They will also need to get a reference.” Nijjar adds: “We do get people applying to us directly, and we try to reroute them back into Ucas.” She says the benefits include deadline reminders, a smoother process and streamlined access to funding. Clearing – which runs from July to October – can be a prime time to get offers or even swap to better matches. There were 19,640 direct acceptances via clearing in 2019, rising to 24,755 in 2020, as more students either applied later or took advantage of the full admissions cycle. There’s also clearing extra and adjustment, which are additional ways to secure offers later in the year. You can use these if you apply after January, as long as you’re eligible – see Ucas for details. Lots of students get on to great courses despite applying later – but that’s not a recommendation for leaving things until the last minute. If nothing else, Sheppard says, giving yourself enough time means less stress. There’s a chance courses will fill up, especially once clearing starts, and you risk missing the start of term if you don’t get organised in time, Nijjar says. “An example is where they have to have an enhanced DBS check.” The later you apply, the later you’ll hear from universities and colleges. This may affect how quickly you get financial support, or your housing, childcare or job arrangements. There’s no shortage of support for students who apply later but make sure you have what you need to succeed on your course. Sheppard says students should “consider all of the options ... and not make any snap decisions because they feel they’ve left it late”.",education
"Librarians at UK universities say students’ reading lists for this term are being torn up because of publishers’ “eye-watering” increases to ebook prices, and some students are now reading what is available or affordable, rather than what their tutors think is best for their course. With thousands of students studying in their bedrooms at home because of the pandemic, providing access to textbooks and research books online has become crucial. However, librarians say academic publishers are failing to offer electronic versions of many books, seen as critical to degree courses during the pandemic. And, they say, universities frequently cannot afford to buy the ebooks available, for which they can be charged more than five times as much as the printed version, often running into hundreds of pounds a copy, sometimes for one user at a time. Nearly 3,000 librarians, academics and students have now signed an open letter calling for a public investigation into the “unaffordable, unsustainable and inaccessible” academic ebook market. Johanna Anderson, subject librarian at the University of Gloucestershire and one of the authors of the letter, says: “Publishers are manipulating the market and price gouging from Covid. We are trying to support students during an unprecedented public health crisis and they are making it so much harder. It is a scandal.” Examples librarians have given include an education textbook called An Integrated Play-based Curriculum for Young Children, published by Routledge, offered to libraries for £36.99 in print but for £480 for an ebook that can only be read by one student at a time. The cost to libraries for one business studies book, Fundamentals of Corporate Business, published by McGraw Hill, was £65.99 in print and £528 as a single user ebook. Libraries say they have struggled with high ebook prices and lack of availability for years, but the problem has come to a head during the pandemic because students urgently need digital resources. Anderson reports that publishers introduced price rises for ebooks for libraries at the start of 2020, often alongside changes to licences that meant instead of numerous students being able to access an online book simultaneously, only one student would be able to read it at a time. Although several publishers offered free access to many ebooks in the first lockdown in March, this was withdrawn in June. Anderson says ebooks costing more than 500% more than print versions are “not exceptions, but the prices I have come to expect to see”. Publishers are adamant that they have been supporting universities and students and not trying to profit from them in the pandemic. They insist their pricing is fair, and say ebooks are not comparable to print books because they can be used in different ways, with extra features, and are shared widely throughout the university. Caroline Ball, subject librarian at the University of Derby, says one reason librarians are angry is that academic publishing is one of the most lucrative industries in the world, with unusually high profit margins, estimated at around 40%. She says: “Academics typically write, review and edit publications like journals and textbooks, and they are often not paid for that. Charging their universities huge amounts of money to access these books in a digital format in a pandemic is surely unfair.” Anderson is getting emails every day from students who cannot find the books they need online, and says she is having sleepless nights worrying about them being unable to access the books they need for dissertations or revision. “They are starting a new semester with new modules and new reading lists, but so many books aren’t available electronically or cost too much for us to buy,” she says.  The librarians also complain that some publishers tie libraries into expensive subscriptions or package deals to purchase some of the most popular academic books digitally. “You have to pay thousands for a package with a few ebooks you need and lots of things you don’t,” says Anderson. “It’s like if Waterstones said ‘you can have this novel but you have to buy the whole shop’. It’s outrageous.” Rachel Bickley, senior academic liaison librarian at London Metropolitan University, wonders why it costs so much more to produce an electronic version of a book. She asks: “What is all this extra money going on?” Bickley says the ebook crisis is affecting all subjects, but some more than others. On some science courses, she says, there are core texts that “simply aren’t available” to students studying at home. “Since the summer, academics have been trying to redo their reading lists so they are more accessible to students who can’t get into the library,” she says. “But they send these lists through to us to check and a lot of the time ebooks aren’t available or only at an eye-watering price.”  Bickley says libraries across the UK are having to tell lecturers to rewrite course reading lists because they can no longer afford them. “We are seeing academics having to put together reading lists based on what is available, rather than on what they actually think students most need to read. This just isn’t acceptable.” Graham Edgar, professor of psychology and applied neuroscience at the University of Gloucestershire, says: “I have had to take some of the textbooks off my reading list as I can’t justify having them on there. It will cause too much stress if the students can’t access the books they need via the library. Some students buy textbooks themselves but there are vast numbers who can’t afford to do that.” Paul Ayris, pro vice-provost for library services at University College London, says he has had to spend an extra £3m during the pandemic to buy enough ebooks for UCL’s 48,000 students, an investment he agrees other institutions may not be able to afford. UCL’s librarians have been working through several thousand reading lists, repeatedly having to tell academics that the books they want students to read cannot be accessed electronically, or cost too much money. The university is so exasperated by what Ayris calls “the scandal of ebooks”, that it has just decided it will begin publishing its own open-access textbooks. “This is a direct response to this crisis,” he says. “We are fed up with paying these prices when our academics are writing the textbooks. In the future, universities need to club together and take control of their own publishing.” The Guardian approached the Publishers’ Association but it declined to comment. A spokesperson for Taylor Francis, which owns Routledge, says: “Comparing individual print costs to a digital licence does not represent the reality of how the different formats are used, nor the additional functionality etextbooks provide. We believe our etextbooks, which are sold on a title-by-title basis and not in bundles, are fairly and competitively priced for the library market. “We recognise the current particular challenges that libraries are facing in providing remote access to materials, and will continue to support their needs during the pandemic and beyond.”  He said that the publisher had provided free etextbooks to students as well as free upgrades to libraries from single to multi-reader licences for the 2020 summer term. A spokesperson for McGraw Hill said the company would be making more titles available as ebooks “as quickly as we can”. “Since the pandemic started, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to help students and educators transition smoothly to online learning situations. In spring 2020, we provided free access to ebooks and our digital courseware solutions to more than 65,000 students and supported 500-plus instructors to help them transition online in the UK and Europe alone.” He said McGraw Hill was “deeply focused on affordability in higher education”, adding that “in the US and elsewhere, the average cost of course materials for students has been declining steadily for more than a decade, which is a great thing”.

"Gavin Williamson is drawing up plans for students to make a phased return to universities in England from 8 March, although vice-chancellors warned that many were unlikely to be back on campus before summer. The education secretary is expected to announce on 22 February that final-year students in practical subjects will be able to return to face-to-face teaching, with students taking other subjects to follow soon afterwards. But unions said as much tuition as possible should remain online for the rest of the academic year to put the safety of staff and students first. It comes amid fierce debate over the timetable for lifting the national lockdown, and as universities and the government fear the financial fallout of extended closures while students continue to pay tuition fees and rent. Schools across England are also expected to reopen from 8 March. But with infection rates still high and the UK reproduction number, or R value, down slightly to 0.7-1, compared with 0.7-1.1 last week, no dates have been given for socialising to be permitted or shops, pubs and restaurants to open. While the new higher education timetable was welcomed by senior leaders, they also fear that the education secretary’s waning influence with Downing Street means the Department for Education’s plan may be ignored in favour of other concerns. Ministers want to avoid a repeat of the scenes last autumn when thousands of students travelled to university only to be forced to isolate within their campus accommodation as Covid outbreaks swept through halls of residence. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said universities would follow the same roadmap as schools for reopening, with the government looking at data up to 15 February and planning to announce on 22 February that both schools and universities in England will reopen in some form. Donelan told the Tab that the government “will be looking at data including death rates, the virus rate, the vaccination programme and the pressure on the NHS. Then the decision will be announced on 22 February. From the 8 March, more students will be able to go back, should that be what we decide, and that does include higher education students.” Priority is expected to be given to final-year students on undergraduate courses or taught postgraduate degrees in practical subjects including performing arts and lab-based science courses. But many students may struggle to be allowed back before the Easter holidays at the end of March, when teaching in effect ends for many courses before exams. With most exams being delivered remotely, that means many of England’s 1.3 million undergraduates will not have any reason to return in person. Currently only students taking laboratory-based courses such as medical and veterinary science, and courses deemed to be important such as nursing, teaching and social work, are able to be on campus to receive face-to-face tuition. Some institutions, such as the London School of Economics, have already said students will be taught remotely for the rest of the academic year, but Donelan said the government “will be giving them the option to alter those plans”. For universities that have given rent refunds or rebates to students with rooms in their halls of residence which they have been unable to use, the lost income will run into millions of pounds for each institution, increasing the financial pressure they have been under since the pandemic began. The government has given no direct financial aid to universities or students in England, other than hardship funds. In contrast, Northern Ireland this week announced £500 “disruption” grants to all of the region’s 40,000 UK and EU students, as well as hardship funding and other support, in a package worth nearly £40m. Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “The priority right now must be to keep as much teaching as possible online for the rest of the academic year, and putting staff and student safety first. “Instead, ministers and universities seem intent on reopening campuses due to financial pressures. We need to learn the lessons of last term and prevent further outbreaks.” The government in Scotland appears to be following a similar timetable to that proposed in England, with an announcement later this month in preparation for a return for some students in early March. Prof Peter Mathieson, the vice-chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, said: “We have indicated to undergraduate students that we don’t think there will be any substantial face-to-face teaching for the rest of this semester, which means until Easter. We still hope it will be possible for postgraduate students. Sadly undergraduate students are not going to get a lot of face-to-face teaching in this academic year.” In defiance of the government’s orders to stay at home, several universities report that students are “returning to campus in droves”, even without the prospect of face-to-face teaching or the use of university facilities. One university is said to have about 70% of its usual student numbers on or around campus, in part due to high numbers of students on exempt courses such as nursing. Most others estimate that 30% to 40% of students are back, and some have more than half. Mathieson said his university was keen to follow the regulations but he was aware some students had returned even though they had been advised not to. “Some students have voted with their feet, it’s been reported by just about all the universities I’ve heard from, Russell Group and elsewhere. It’s interesting, it reflects the fact students start to identify university as their new home,” he said. Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors at mainstream institutions, said: “Universities are continuing to work with government on plans for the return of more students as soon as the public health situation allows. Once we know more about when and how restrictions are being lifted for the higher education sector, universities will be able to communicate directly with their students.”",education
"Children studying for exams and those from disadvantaged families are the most likely to have suffered severe disruption to their learning and motivation during the pandemic, according to the largest published study of its impact on pupils in England. The surveys and interviews of more than 60,000 students aged from six to 18 reveal huge disparities in the impact of lockdown and school closures, with very different profiles for learning loss and wellbeing among children spread across different households. Children taking GCSE courses appeared most at risk of disruption, with nearly one in four pupils in years 10 and 11 saying they could not get help from family members with questions about their schoolwork, while 40% said they lacked a routine to help them study from home. The research comes after academics estimated that the pandemic will cost about £350bn in lost earnings across the working life of today’s school pupils, adding to calls for the government to do more to help children catch up over the coming years. James Turner, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said the research showed there was “no question” that the pandemic was having a devastating impact. “Many of the findings reinforce our own research showing the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on disadvantaged young people,” said Turner. “The road to recovery will not be straightforward and will require a sustained and multifaceted approach, focussed on those who have lost out the most.” Pupils in years 10 and 11 had the most pessimistic view of their learning last year, with children in those year groups remaining the most anxious after the summer holidays. “These scores hint at the pressures that exam uncertainty has caused,” the report’s authors noted. The research uncovered some intriguing details that explain the disparities between groups. While 97% of children in disadvantaged households – largely those who had received free school meals – said they had a digital device such as a laptop or tablet at home, only two out of three said they they were able to use it to complete their schoolwork. In non-disadvantaged households, 99% said they had digital devices at home, although more than one in five reported that they did not have sufficient access to complete their work. Of the learning itself, many children reported they didn’t understand the schoolwork given to them during lockdown, but the effect was more pronounced for those from disadvantaged families. Only 45% of children eligible for the pupil premium said they understood the school work they were given during lockdown, compared with 57% of their better-off peers also working remotely. The study by the charity ImpactEd carried out a series of surveys of 62,000 pupils in schools across England, from May until November last year. “Education throughout Covid-19 has been a challenging process but we hope this study and its findings assists schools. We are already seeing schools using the data to target resources towards those groups of pupils in their schools who need different types of support,” said Owen Carter, co-founder and managing director of ImpactEd. On wellbeing, the research found there was little impact on pupils overall, with self-reported wellbeing slightly higher in May, June and July than prior to lockdown. But the impact varied: girls reported 10% higher anxiety than boys, and nearly twice as many girls as boys said they were worried about returning to school.",education
"Of all the sectors in the UK, hospitality has perhaps been hit the hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, with repeated lockdowns and tier restrictions preventing restaurants, bars, hotels and cafes from trading. Recognised by many as a challenging career to embark on, hospitality runs the risk of becoming less appealing after the trials and tribulations of 2020. But apprenticeships remain a way of starting out in what is a competitive industry, with the opportunity to undertake training at a range of levels and in a multitude of roles, from bartenders and front-of-house staff to chefs and managers. “The big thing about apprenticeships is they give a broad education,” says Jill Whittaker, managing director at HIT Training, a specialist training provider for the UK’s hospitality industry. “Apprentices are not stuck on a production line in a kitchen doing just one job – their experience is varied.” HIT offers training and apprenticeships from basic short courses to full apprenticeships, starting at intermediate level 2 hospitality team member and going up to level 7 senior leader – the equivalent of a master’s degree, delivered in association with Arden University. It’s also important to recognise that the industry is about more than serving food and drink. “It’s more convenient to talk about hospitality, the third-biggest sector in the UK, as if it’s just this raft of unskilled people who wander in, pull a pint and then go home.” The reality is far from that, says Whittaker, with hospitality developing a whole range of skilled workers. “Hospitality employers say they are forever having their really good staff poached by retail companies or other companies because of their skills.” For Julie Crump, chief operations officer at bespoke wedding catering business Caviar & Chips, whose owners also opened a pub in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, a week before the first lockdown in 2020, apprenticeships are vital in training the next generation of the hospitality industry. The company works with University College Birmingham to offer a front-of-house placement and a kitchen placement in the wedding business, and will also be running apprenticeships at its pub, The Virgins & Castle, in partnership with Warwickshire county council. Like Whittaker, she thinks hospitality is often under-estimated. “It’s not just about putting food on a plate and taking it to a table. We want to make sure people have a start and see it as a career.” Last year proved difficult, she admits, with apprentices’ trial shifts having to be postponed every time the business was forced to close, but she hopes the torrid time won’t put people off a career in hospitality. “It’s an exciting and innovative industry to work in and there’s different concepts coming out all the time.” To help encourage people, Crump says they are trying to change the idea that hospitality is a “hard and horrible place to work”, by making sure staff don’t work endless hours with no breaks, get fed and watered on shift and get rotas in advance so they can plan their time. “It’s about trying to be a better employer so people can be the best of themselves and be happy at work. We’re not saying there won’t be hard days and hard times, but it should be about having a positive career and bettering yourself.” Karl Svendsen turned his back on a law degree to train as a barista. Now, he’s a store manager and looking to take on the next career challenge When Karl Svendsen became a father in 2019, he decided providing financially for his new family took priority. That meant the difficult decision to leave university where he was studying for a law degree and instead embark on an apprenticeship as a barista with Caffè Nero through HIT Training, a training and apprenticeship provider for the hospitality and catering industry. “An apprenticeship offered me the perfect opportunity to earn a living, kickstart my career and secure a comfortable future for me and my family,” said Svendsen, from Liverpool. “Initially, having little experience working as a barista created a steep learning curve for me as I started my apprenticeship. Putting my ego aside, and asking for help, I was put on to a six-week learning plan to help me develop my knowledge, skill set and behaviours.” That resulted in a promotion to shift leader, allowing him to expand his skills even further. Svendsen faced an obstacle to his apprenticeship journey when he and his partner separated, leading to him moving temporarily to Manchester. Despite the move, he and his area manager worked together to make sure he could complete an apprenticeship as he “sofa surfed” and adjusted to his new life. Svendsen finished his apprenticeship in full, achieving a distinction. He was given the opportunity to advance from shift leader to store manager in just 15 months as part of a hospitality supervisor apprenticeship, enabling him to take the next step in his career. “By taking on the role of store manager in one of the Liverpool stores, I was immediately able to make positive changes,” he said. “My apprenticeship gave me the tools I needed to launch an investigation into the store’s discrepancies with stock taking. I then confidently delivered training to staff to prevent this issue from happening in future, and within three months the missing margin was brought back within the target percentage.” On top of that, he took responsibility for writing rotas to ensure hours were fairly distributed, as well as leading on inventory management and recruitment for his store and two others in the area. Svendsen reflects: “My apprenticeship pushed me outside my comfort zone, encouraging me to go headfirst into situations that I felt less comfortable or capable of tackling otherwise. The training has encouraged me to take more time to reflect on my own learning and how I communicate with my team. This has culminated in more confidence to take on greater challenges and motivates me to look for opportunities where I’d previously have doubted myself.”",education
"The government has refused to rule out lengthening the school day and shortening summer holidays in England to help pupils catch up on lost learning, despite fierce opposition from school leaders who warned against attempts to “grind out more hours of learning from tired children”. The schools standards minister, Nick Gibb, told MPs on the Commons education committee he was “open to all ideas” on how to help pupils make up for lost lessons. Headteachers responded that speculation about longer school days and shorter holidays was “misconceived and unhelpful”. Gibb told the committee many academies had already used their additional freedoms to lengthen the school day to drive up standards. He also appeared to acknowledge the appeal of a shorter summer break, accepting there was evidence of lost learning during the six-week holiday. “We just have to leave no stone unturned in making sure that we can help those young people catch up from the lost education.” His comments followed the appointment last week of Sir Kevan Collins as the new education recovery commissioner overseeing the government’s catchup plans, with the promise of an additional £300m on top of the £1bn catchup fund already in place. “He will be looking at all these ideas and potential proposals for how we can ensure that young people catch up,” said Gibb. The two unions representing school leaders warned against “policy gimmicks” that sound superficially attractive. “Many schools already run after-school activities and holiday clubs but this is totally different from a blanket requirement to grind out more hours of learning from tired children with the likelihood of diminishing returns,” said Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. Barton also cautioned against mandatory lessons during the summer holiday that would have to be enforced by fines for non-attendance. “The essential element of catchup support is quality rather than quantity, and schools are very good at identifying learning needs and putting in place the appropriate support. What they need from the government is sufficient funding to enable them to do this as effectively as possible, rather than policy gimmicks.” Nick Brook, the deputy general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, added: “Research evidence shows that there are better methods to help pupils than lengthening the school day. The government must filter out loud calls for superficially attractive schemes and listen to the experts.” The government is expected to unveil further plans for its catchup programme in the coming weeks. It has already provided an additional £80 for every pupil as well as offering subsidised one-to-one or small group tuition under its national tutoring programme (NTP). In a separate hearing on Tuesday, the Lords Covid-19 committee was told the government was in danger of imposing a multitude of external initiatives on schools that would have little impact on those most in need. Richard Sheriff, who heads the Red Kite Learning Trust, cautioned against “big national complex programmes” and told peers there were disadvantaged children in his schools who had still not received any input from the government’s flagship tutoring programme. “We’ve got a danger going forward of having a multitude of different external initiatives that are quite hard for schools to handle, that aren’t actually focused on the specific needs, and just look like we’re really busy, but don’t actually have an impact.” He also said there was a growing breach in trust between schools and parents, making some communities even harder to reach, and flagged up concerns that boys in particular were having difficulties engaging with their studies, which could lead to a widening of the gap between boys and girls. Summer school Collins, the newly appointed catchup tsar, has already said that the idea of summer schools is “promising”, but he has indicated he would want them to be locally led and locally informed, rather than a national blueprint being imposed by government. Where they do happen, they are likely to include sport, music and drama to enhance mental health and well-being, and Collins says they need to be “engaging and motivating” to get students onboard. Longer school day Many schools in England are already accustomed to offering additional support and activities outside of the formal school day, including Saturday morning revision sessions. But Collins, in an interview with Schools Week, said new technology now in use in schools would make virtual classes a way of extending the school day, rather than tagging on an extra lesson to keep children in school longer. Shorter school holidays The government is said to be reviewing the school year, with a view to extending the summer term by two weeks and therefore shortening the holiday. There has long been support for a shorter summer holiday from those who argue that disadvantaged children lose out most from the six-week break. But after the turmoil and demands of the past year, teachers and families might not feel it is the time for such a change. One-to-one tuition After the first lockdown the government launched its £350m flagship national tutoring programme, offering subsidised one-to-one and small group tuition to disadvantaged children. School leaders have complained that it is an unnecessarily complicated way of delivering extra support. Collins said tutoring was definitely part of the picture, but again stressed the need for schools to be in control. Repeating the school year Some policy experts have suggested that pupils who have lost out most should be allowed to repeat the school year in order to catch up, but the idea is fraught with practical difficulties. Barton said: “In principle, this is worth consideration, but in practical terms it would need to be confined to small numbers or otherwise it would create a logjam in the system which would leave schools with more pupils than they could accommodate.”",education
"Scientists have cautioned against bringing forward the reopening of schools in England, saying it would be “a recipe for disaster” while the prevalence of the virus remains high. Boris Johnson is facing pressure from his own MPs to follow Scotland’s lead after the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced a phased return to the classroom from 22 February. Scotland’s youngest children, including nursery and primary pupils in years one, two and three, are expected to be back in the classroom full-time from 22 February, along with small numbers of secondary pupils who need to complete practical work in class for national qualifications. In England, by contrast, Johnson has said schools – which are currently open to only 15% of children who are either regarded as “vulnerable” or whose parents are critical workers – will not open more fully until 8 March at the earliest. The prime minister reiterated on Wednesday that he still considered 8 March “the prudent date to set”. Johnson told a Downing Street press conference: “What we don’t want to do now that we are making progress with the vaccine rollout and we have got a timetable for the way ahead, we don’t want to be forced into reverse. We think this is the prudent and cautious approach. I think it is much better to stick to that.” However, one senior Tory with knowledge of the prime minister’s thinking suggested there were now hopes of a “big bang” reopening, rather than the phased return that had previously been envisaged. Meanwhile, the prime minister announced the appointment of an education recovery commissioner to oversee the government’s plans to help children catch up. Kevan Collins, formerly of the Education Endowment Foundation, who has worked in the sector for more than three decades, will advise the government on how to spend the £300m recently allocated for plugging the teaching shortfall created by the crisis. Johnson said: “I am absolutely determined that no child will be left behind as a result of the pandemic. Our top priority is to get schools open again and once they are, we will make sure that teachers and students are equipped with the resources and the time they need to make up for lost learning.” When Scotland’s schools reopening plans were announced on Tuesday, some Conservative MPs, including the chair of the Covid Recovery Group, Mark Harper, responded by calling for the return of pupils in England to be brought forward. Robert Halfon, a Conservative who chairs the Commons education committee, is among those pushing for schools to open sooner. He tweeted: “Given that Scotland is likely to open some schools in the next couple of weeks, and given Public Health England say primary schools are ‘safe to open soon’, surely England can lead by example and at least open primary schools before 8 March.” In an interview with the Guardian, Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out, however, that according to the latest Office for National Statistics data, the overall prevalence of Covid in Scotland is currently half that in England. “The issue with schools is not opening them, it’s keeping them open,” she said. “If you keep having cases, you will be having bubbles of 50 kids going home repeatedly, and that’s not sustainable education. You are better off keeping them closed longer to get your numbers down and then opening in a more sustainable way.” Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London, urged the prime minister to resist pressure to reopen schools any sooner, warning that even 8 March looked unrealistic. She said levels of community transmission were still high and cases were not declining sufficiently rapidly. “We are in a very, very precarious position. Parents and children have made huge sacrifices because of schools being closed to most children. It’s very important we don’t squander this.” Gurdasani said evidence suggested that primary schoolchildren were two times more likely than adults to be the first case in a household, and once infected they were two times more likely to transmit than adults. Putting children back into schools while community transmission remained so high was “a recipe for disaster”, she said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Everybody wants to see all pupils back in school as soon as possible, but it is of critical importance that this happens when scientists believe it is safe to do so without triggering an immediate increase in infection rates and necessitating another period of restricted opening. “The plan in Scotland for a phased return from 22 February has clearly been made on the basis of the evidence there, and that does not automatically mean that England should follow suit if the evidence is different. What we have to avoid is another spike in coronavirus cases, and a revolving door of school opening.”",education
"Hiring apprentices boosts productivity, cultivates talent and builds a diverse workforce. But, despite diversity and inclusion being the watchwords of good business, the proportion of apprentices from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities remains low. Why does this gap in opportunity persist? “If you look at apprenticeship applications, people from BAME backgrounds are applying, but not getting through,” says Jeremy Crook, chief executive of charity the Black Training and Enterprise Group (BTEG). “It’s less a lack of awareness of apprenticeships than how employers recruit. Word of mouth recruitment is common, which puts BAME applicants at a disadvantage.” Of all apprenticeship starts in 2019/20, 13.3% were BAME, figures from the Department for Education show. While this represents a significant increase over the past 10 years, critics point out BAME groups represent roughly a third of the student population across primary and secondary education in England. And the youngest fall the furthest behind. BAME apprentices in the 16- to 18-year-old group made up just 7.8% of new apprentice starts in 2018/19, down from 8.6% the year before, according to research of official data by further education publisher FE Week. Sandra Kerr, race equality director for charity Business in the Community, says: “Apprenticeships are meant to be a door into a new career, but all too often it’s slammed shut for BAME communities. Even well-intentioned employers can seem disconnected from what inclusion and diversity means in reality.” In 2017, Business in the Community launched a Best Employers for Race list, but for the two years it ran, the list comprised fewer than 100 companies. Since, the charity has created a Race at Work charter, which sets out five actions for organisations to address racial inequality, including having a senior sponsor for race, tracking and publishing ethnicity data, and taking action to support ethnic minority career progression. Kerr says: “An employer which doesn’t invest in diversity and inclusion – from apprenticeships to the boardroom – is failing to invest in itself. Who can afford to do that anymore?” But while some employers are making progress, various initiatives to increase BAME apprentices have faltered. The 5 Cities Project, which saw the National Apprenticeship Service work with businesses to boost take-up of apprenticeships among under-represented groups, was wound up last year. Crook believes educating recruiters is vital, as well as encouraging further education colleges to challenge employers who use unfair hiring practices. He points to an employers’ toolkit BTEG recently developed with the Greater London Authority to help companies in growth sectors adopt more inclusive recruitment methods. He warns: “The government has to work more with employers or we’ll remain stuck at the current BAME participation rate.”",education
"Global advertising agency Ogilvy launched an apprenticeship scheme in 2016 that aims to celebrate and champion diversity, and provide more employment routes into the creative industries. Open to all, regardless of background or qualifications, The Pipe is a two-year programme based in Ogilvy’s London headquarters. Apprentices who are taken on – known internally as Pipers – gain experience in a range of specialities, including advertising and customer engagement, design, social, PR and behaviour change. They work on client briefs while also studying towards a level 3 qualification, which is equivalent to two A-Levels. The scheme has seen Ogilvy welcome poets, skaters, sculptors, jewellery designers, shelf stackers, artists and DJs through its doors. Key to its message is appealing to those who think the creative industries are difficult to get into unless you know someone on the inside or have certain qualifications. “We launched The Pipe in 2016 very purposefully to open up the creative craft to a more diverse pool of potential emerging talent, and many of our Pipers are now fully fledged creatives in a number of different roles within the agency,” says Helen Matthews, chief people officer at Ogilvy UK. “Our aim has always been for at least 50% of our intake to be from underrepresented backgrounds, and we’ve been working closely this year with Uptree and Brixton Finishing School to ensure we cast our net as widely as possible.” The Pipe was the route to a creative career for Natalie Narh, now a social content creative with Ogilvy and vice-chair of Ogilvy Roots, a network set up to champion greater ethnic and cultural diversity within the agency. Narh is from Ghana and was motivated to apply to the Ogilvy scheme when she graduated in 2018, after her father mentioned that David Ogilvy didn’t embark on a creative career until his 30s. “My time on The Pipe didn’t just confirm that I wanted to work in the advertising and marketing world, it actually helped me to define who I am as a creative,” she says. Narh works full-time for Ogilvy and has a clear sense of where she sees her career going. “Previously if someone asked where I wanted to be in a few years’ time I’d have given an answer focused on improving myself as a creative and my actual craft, but over the past year, I have realised that my purpose is more aligned with giving other people the opportunity to be creative,” she says. “Although I enjoy the process of creating, empowering other people to do the same is very satisfying to me. I hope to be able to impact a wide range of people to execute their own ideas as creatives.” To help lower the barriers to entry, Ogilvy passes some of the apprenticeship levy back to The Pipe apprentices. “In effect, we’re giving them a startup bonus so they can pay a month’s rent or cover travel costs, making the apprenticeship scheme as inclusive as possible and setting participants up for success,” says Matthews. “Natalie is a brilliant example of a young apprentice who has made her own luck and success, grabbing every opportunity she can,” she adds. “Especially at time when so many opportunities for young people have closed or been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, it’s important to combat the misconception that the creative industries are closed unless you know someone on the inside, and vital at a societal level to ensure that creative industry apprenticeship schemes continue.”",education
"My friend, Donald Hoskins, who has died aged 88, was a gentle, much-respected man who had an enormous passion for bringing live music to local people of all ages and backgrounds. This he did with great gusto and good humour, inspiring many to share his deep love of music. Don was born in Abertillery, south Wales, the only child of William Hoskins, a blacksmith, and Olive (nee Hagley). In later years, Don would speak passionately of his beloved home town “in the valleys”. His parents very quickly recognised and supported his considerable early musical and pianistic talents. He won many local prizes while still very young and eventually went on to gain a BMus degree at Cardiff University, following this with MA and PhD degrees. Don’s teaching career commenced in Birmingham, during which time he conducted many choral and orchestral concerts and performed as soloist with the Birmingham Philharmonic Orchestra. Following a period as a music lecturer at Eastbourne College of Education, in 1967 he joined Barking Regional College (now the University of East London) and three years later became head of its music centre, remaining in the post until retirement in 1997. In 1985, he founded the Aminta Chamber Orchestra (which evolved into a larger concert orchestra), performing at many prestigious London venues and working with world-renowned soloists. He also appeared as guest conductor with the London Mozart Players, BBC Concert Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Choir. His musical activities took him to France, Germany, Greece, Russia (where he performed at the Moscow Conservatoire) and the US (as a visiting professor). For nearly 40 years, Don arranged and conducted charity concerts in east London. For his outstanding service to music and the local community he was awarded the freedom of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham in 2005 and made an MBE in 2007. In neighbouring Redbridge, he was president of Redbridge Music Society from 1995 onwards, distinguishing his presidency with much kindness and generosity of time. Don married Dinah Stanton in 1972 and over the years they fulfilled their joint love of travel with visits to many areas of the world including Australasia and the US. Don is survived by Dinah, who cared for him so magnificently, especially in his final months.",education
"University students have wasted nearly £1bn on empty rooms in flat shares and halls of residence that they have been unable to use because of coronavirus restrictions this academic year, according to a new estimate. The average student has so far paid £1,621 in rent for empty rooms for which they have not received a refund, according to an annual survey of 1,300 university students by money advice website Save the Student. Two in five (43%) respondents said they had spent under three months on campus, while nearly half (46%) would have made different decisions about where to live had they understood the likely impact of the pandemic on their education. One in three plan to ask their landlords for a break clause next year to give them more flexibility. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, the National Union of Students’ vice-president for higher education, said: “Students have been consistently exploited and ignored during this pandemic. We are seen as cash cows, with many stuck paying extortionate rents for properties they either cannot use or cannot afford.” Students’ anger with high rents, which Save the Student estimates take up three-quarters of their maintenance loans at an average of £146 per week, boiled over on UK campuses this term as students launched the largest rent strike in 40 years. There has been a patchy response from universities, private halls of residence and landlords, with some refusing discounts while others have offered full rebates. The survey suggests a third of students have been offered a discount, which averages at £75, though this has been extended to just 6% of students in private rentals. Half of the those surveyed were unhappy with their accommodation provider’s response. On 14 February, 92 students at the School of Oriental and African Studies became the first to withhold the outstanding 50% instalment of their tuition fee payments in protest at their university’s coronavirus response. They were joined by 1,000 students – a fifth of the student body – who signed a petition asking for fee reductions. The government has so far responded to students’ financial concerns with £70m in additional hardship funding, a figure that falls short of more generous packages in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Most students have been asked to remain at the address where they spent Christmas – in many cases their family homes – during lockdown. Plans for their return are expected to be announced next week, although university leaders are preparing for the possibility that many students will not be allowed on campus until 17 May, shortly before the end of the teaching year. St Andrews University and the London School of Economics have already told students that most will study online for the remainder of the year. Universities UK said: “Decisions on accommodation costs are a matter for individual universities, taking into account the circumstances at their institutions and of their students. But with the vast majority of students not renting university-owned accommodation, there is an ongoing issue about support for those with contracts in the private sector as well as assistance for non-residential students who have been financially hit by the pandemic.”",education
"My father, John Andrews, who has died aged 77, was a college lecturer in trade union studies, a dedicated parish councillor and a local historian. He spent most of his career, until 1996, at the Oxford College of Further Education, where he taught shop stewards and health and safety representatives, helping others change the lives of working people for the better. He knew how important good health and safety was, having worked while a student on a brewer’s dray and in a jam factory. In the course of this teaching, he probably visited every hospital, prison and mental health institution in Oxfordshire, along with the Morris car plant. His work also affected the lives of Mauritian textile workers, as one of his students was a labour officer in Mauritius. However, what was most important for him was when his courses gave trade unionists the chances they had never had before, to learn and to change their own lives. The son of Winnie (nee Neate) and Vic Andrews, John was born in Caversham, near Reading, to where his mother had been evacuated from south London during the second world war. His father, an amateur cycling champion and later an active trade unionist, was then serving as a fireman with the London Auxiliary Fire Service. Like many of his generation in the postwar years, John grappled with being working class in a grammar school system that expected pupils to have completely different experiences, motivations and aspirations. His family of five lived in a three-room flat without running hot water. A new landlord successfully employed aggressive “Rachman” techniques to force them out. His background and experiences made John a lifelong socialist, trade unionist and active member of the Labour party. For him, class was the key factor in the shaping of society. After studying politics at Leicester University, my father taught in primary schools in Lewisham, London. A placement during teacher training in Leicester led him to switch to adult education. He began by teaching sociology at Plymouth College, in Devon, then moved to Dunstable College, Bedfordshire, and the OCFE.  In 1969 he married Jill Redrup and for many years they lived in the Oxfordshire village of Great Haseley. On his retirement in 2010, John became more involved in the life of the village, fighting to keep the local bus service, and working on the village plan. John wrote throughout his life, starting with pieces for specialist athletics magazines, having inherited a love of cycling and sport from his father. His later writing (as a member of the village history group) attempted to explain the history of working people in Great Haseley. His article on the handwritten magazines produced by Dorothy, daughter of Haseley’s reforming 19th-century rector Canon Henry John Ellison, was published in the journal Oxfordshire Local History in 2020. Copies of a biography of James Worledge (2016, which John co-wrote with his brother Peter) are held by the national libraries of Scotland and Poland.  He is survived by Jill, me, and two granddaughters, Anne and Helen.",education
"Gavin Williamson has promised that a system for teachers to decide exam grades in England this year will be “fair to every student”, but faced challenges from Labour over delays in announcing the plan and how assessments could be made consistent. The education secretary also faced opposition concern over how schools in England will fully reopen from 8 March, with Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, saying he had not presented a “credible plan” for this to work. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education committee, also expressed concern about the exams system, saying it risked creating a “wild west of grading” and permanent grade inflation. Williamson was updating MPs in the Commons after the overnight announcement of a system that will replace exams for A-level, GCSE and vocational qualifications, with teachers taking the lead. “The most important thing that we can do is to make sure the system is fair to every student,” said Williamson, who presided over chaos last summer after an initial algorithm-based grade assessment system was scrapped amid mass disquiet. “It is vital they have confidence that they will get a grade that is a true and just reflection of their work. This year’s students will receive grades determined by their teachers, with assessments covering what they were taught, and not what they have missed,” he said. There would be, Williamson added, a fair appeals system: “I can confirm that no algorithm will be used for this process. Grades will be awarded on the basis of teachers’ judgment and will only ever be changed by human intervention.” He also outlined plans to mitigate infection risks with the reopening of schools, including home testing for older students, and masks worn in secondary schools and colleges until Easter, as well as longer-term support to make up for lost learning. “All our children and young people have paid a considerable price for the disruption of the past year. It knocked their learning off track, it has put their friendships to one side, and it has put some of the wonder of growing up on hold,” Williamson said. “This summer’s assessments will ensure fair routes to the next stages of education, or the start of their career.” But Green questioned both the timing of the assessment announcement, and how it would work. “This year’s exams were cancelled 52 days ago,” she said. “For seven weeks pupils, parents and staff have faced damaging and utterly unnecessary uncertainty.” Saying the cause of last year’s turmoil over exams “was not an algorithm, it was his incompetence”, Green expressed concern that a lack of common evidence over exam grades would make overall fairness extremely difficult. She said: “How will he make grades fair and consistent between and across schools? If the answer is teacher training, why has he not used the last seven weeks to provide it?” Halfon called for Williamson to set out a plan to make sure the exams system did not create inflated grades, which would be effectively meaningless for employers. He said: “Whilst I accept that this the least-worst option that the government has come up with, my concern is not so much about having one’s cake and eating it as baking a rock cake of grade inflation into the system.” On the reopening of schools, Green called for other measures to make them safer, such as teaching via rotas and improved guidance on better ventilation in classrooms. “It is not enough simply to say that schools will reopen,” she said. “There must be a credible plan that will not only enable schools to open in March, but will keep them open. The secretary of state has failed to use the period when most pupils were not in school to put the necessary measures in place.”",education
"Headteachers fear that the reopening of England’s schools could be undermined because parents will not consent to Covid testing for their children and because guidance on the wearing of face masks in classes is unenforceable. The warnings came after a slew of education announcements from the government, culminating in a flurry of guidance on summer assessments that will pile pressure on already overstretched teachers. Announcing its plans this week for a full reopening of schools on 8 March, the government promised a series of measures designed to enhance Covid safety, including twice-weekly testing for secondary pupils and a recommendation to wear face coverings in classrooms. However, school leaders complained to the Guardian that the message was undermined when the school standards minister, Nick Gibb, admitted in television interviews on Thursday that neither were compulsory and it was up to parents to decide. “I despair really,” said Alan Brookes, the executive head of Fulston Manor school in Sittingbourne, Kent. He said letters had been sent out earlier this year requesting parental consent for regular Covid testing using rapid lateral flow tests, and uptake had been low, with consent in some schools in Kent running at 35%-40%. “We are beginning to get parents saying, ‘If it’s not compulsory, what’s the point?’” said Brookes. On the confusion surrounding the wearing of masks in classrooms, he added: “In some ways it’s simpler when people say, ‘That’s how it is, that’s what you’ve got to do.’ It will be incredibly challenging for all teachers to hold a line on that now.” Jules White, the head at Tanbridge House school in Horsham, West Sussex, described Gibb’s intervention as “pretty unhelpful”. Having written to parents on Monday saying it would be mandatory for pupils to wear face coverings in classrooms, he was forced to revise his guidance. White also expressed scepticism about testing. “I think it will be difficult. What happens if 10%, 20%, 30% of children decide they are not going to do the test? They can all still come in the next day. Practically, we know the tests are only moderately reliable. It’s a huge amount of time, resource and energy for something that’s flawed.” A pupil’s first three tests have to be carried out in school over a two-week period, after which pupils will take testing kits home. One school leader pictured the streets around his school littered with discarded tests. Armies of local volunteers, teaching assistants, kitchen workers, office staff and retired teachers have been roped in to help administer the tests. Many pupils are being called in next week to begin the testing programme early to ensure that face-to-face to teaching resumes as early as possible. There are fears too that disenchanted older students, especially those in year 11 with no exams to prepare for, will not return. Sammy Wright, the vice-principal of Southmoor Academy in Sunderland, said: “For students who did not engage before and have totally switched off now it’s going to be quite hard to get them to think school’s a place for them.” School and college leaders told the Guardian that their staff would face increasing demands on their time to award A-levels and GCSE grades, with teacher assessment replacing in-person exams for pupils in England after exams were cancelled by the government earlier this year. Teachers will be expected to collect material for making awards to each student, using previous work and mock exam results as well as all future work until the submission deadline on 18 June. The Department for Education and Ofqual, the exam regulator, on Thursday issued the first guidance to schools on how the process would work, although Ofqual has yet to release technical details, including how schools are to weigh evidence of pupils’ work. Under the new system, grade inflation and quality assurance will be policed by the examination boards, AQA, OCR and Pearson Edexel, in training materials and guidance issued to teachers and by investigating schools and colleges making unusual awards. The Royal Statistical Society, which was highly critical of Ofqual’s efforts last year to issue grades using an algorithm, criticised the government’s latest plans as vague and called for more transparency in the use of historical data. “While a system of teacher-awarded grades will help avoid some of last year’s issues around the awarding of qualifications, we need to see more detail,” said Sharon Witherspoon, the society’s vice-president for education and statistical literacy. “We understand that schools will be provided with results from previous years as a guide, but there is no information on how teachers should – or even could – use these data. “The process of maintaining external quality assurance is even less clear. If exam centres are to be reviewed based on both random sample and risk, it suggests historical results will play a part. We would like to see transparency from exam boards about the sorts of changes from historical patterns that might trigger an external quality check in the next stage of guidance.” Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announcing the plans for teacher assessments to parliament, said: “Exam boards will be issuing grade descriptions to help make sure grades are fair and consistent. These will be broadly pegged to performance standards from previous years, so that teachers and students are clear what is expected at each grade.” But Williamson later told MPs that it was not possible to peg this year’s awards to those of previous years “because, sadly, as a result of doing that, it would probably entail some form of algorithm”. A direction from Williamson to Ofqual revealed that students will be shown the evidence used by teachers to determine their grades before the school or college submits its final grade. Simon Lebus, Ofqual’s interim chief regulator, warned in his response to Williamson that “outcomes may this year look different from previous years”. Lebus said teachers would be asked to “take account of the way in which the pandemic has disrupted teaching in their school or college. Teachers will not be asked to make individual grading judgments which require them to imagine the pandemic had not happened.”",education
"The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, announced on Thursday that teachers would get sweeping powers to decide exam grades in England this year. The move, which covers A-level and GCSE students, has raised concerns about grade inflation. Here four pupils who were due to take exams this year give their verdict on the situation. A-level student Musab, 18, from Norwich, fears he and others will be disadvantaged by the government’s decision to cancel exams and replace them with teacher assessments. “It’s weird as it feels as if we’ve been working towards nothing for the past few months doing constant live lessons. This is actually my third year doing A-levels as I’ve had to redo the year due to last year’s algorithm fiasco. I’m just happy I’m more prepared this time.  “My only concern really is teacher bias, I just hope that they can be as objective as possible and give everyone the grade they deserve. “Teacher bias is real, they are only human. It’s fair enough, it’s probably the next best thing to do it this way, but I’d 100% prefer to sit exams.”  Liam, from Chester, is studying towards A-levels in geography, psychology and media studies this year. The 17-year-old believes he will fare well by having his teachers decide his grades, but is not convinced that grades will be awarded entirely fairly. “I’m glad this decision has been made after we have missed seven months of face-to-face education. However, I think that coursework should not play a major role in the grading of students as some is partially incomplete due to the lockdown,” he said. “The same goes for mock exams. When we took them, we were under the impression that they weren’t really important, and now they are. The whole thing seems like yet another last-minute decision. The government could have let us know much sooner.” Liam also fears grade inflation could dilute the value of his year group’s A-levels. “I think this will allow for teachers to potentially give students higher grades than they perhaps deserve, as well as some teachers failing students who would have passed in proper exam conditions.” “In any case, the value of this cohort’s A-levels will be greatly reduced – everyone will know we haven’t sat exams. I’m definitely worried recruiters might look at us unfavourably. The government needs to reiterate that we are worth the same, and say that we shouldn’t be discriminated against.” David, 18, from Derbyshire, is studying for a combined English literature and language and a history A-level, and was dreading having to take formal A-level exams this year. “I have moderate to severe ASD [autistic spectrum disorder] and ADHD, and am honestly just relieved. It was unrealistic and would have been unfair to force exams to go ahead in 2021. I was quite concerned about another ‘mutant’ algorithm being used to assess our grades, which seemed to favour those from more privileged, privately educated backgrounds. I do believe my teachers will do a good job of awarding grades, but if something goes wrong, people will inevitably blame them, which seems unfair.” In the absence of clarity on what kind of assessment guidelines teachers will be given, he worries what teacher-assessed A-levels will look like. “I am concerned about how the teachers will decide what evidence to submit for the assessment. Some of us have missed handing in one or two pieces of homework due to various circumstances. However, I am hoping that maybe this pandemic could finally demonstrate how our exam-obsessed and intensely stressful education system is not working.” Bella, 15, a GCSE student from London, understands why exams were cancelled but feels frustrated about the government’s delay in communication. “In an ideal world, without Covid, I personally would have preferred to sit exams, but I acknowledge that they simply could not take place. While I personally had not fallen behind, many people I know have, because we were told that exams were cancelled. The delay between announcing this and the news that we will be assessed formally in some way seems very unfair.” Grade inflation is not a primary concern for her, but she believes the rewards for her hard work may be diminished through a combination of teacher-assessed grades and the “mini-tests” that GCSE-level pupils will now have to sit instead of proper exams. “It’s better to have grade inflation than deflation, and to reward students for such a difficult year. But it’s also a bit unfair. The struggle of GCSEs is having to memorise a vast amount of knowledge, but now with shorter topics tests, it will become a lot harder to distinguish between the top and bottom grades. Having worked so methodically and diligently for the past two years, I feel like my energy has been wasted.” Like others, Bella is acutely aware that lockdown has created an even more uneven playing field for students. “I know lots of people who simply couldn’t keep revising and haven’t done well in their mocks, for various reasons. Many people have been depressed and unmotivated. My school is now consulting with every pupil and parents about how to best assess them. They are trying their best.”",education
"The government has been criticised on social media after supporting a campaign encouraging schoolchildren to commemorate “One Britain One Nation” day on Friday. A tweet from the Department for Education said it was encouraging schools across the UK to celebrate the day and featured a link to onebritainonenation.com website. The campaign, led by former policeman Kash Singh who is chief executive and founder of One Britain One Nation (OBON), says it needs the support of schools to “celebrate the day in the spirit it is intended”. The site says “OBON is devoted to galvanising the efforts of people from all backgrounds to rejoice in their pride in Great Britain.” The campaign’s supporters include actor Joanna Lumley, MP Brandon Lewis, and former MPs David Steel and Norman Tebbit. The site says that schools should encourage children to clap for a minute to “pay tribute to all those people who helped during the Covid 19 pandemic crisis” and give a rendition of the OBON Day 2021 anthem. The song, which included the lyrics “We are Britain and we have one dream to unite all people in one great team”, has provoked particular ridicule on social media. The song ends with the lyrics “Strong Britain, Great Nation” repeated four times. The Department of Education in its tweet said OBON day was “when children can learn about our shared values of tolerance, kindness, pride and respect”. One user on Twitter responded: “I don’t know where to start with this crap! “The fact that you claim it’s about those things and you’re encouraging kids to sing this song?! This is nationalistic crap! “Or that you’re actively using *schools* to try and campaign against Scottish independence! The whole thing is profoundly wrong!” Another tweeted: “Who decided these were “our values” and when?” Another tweet read: “Absolutely and utterly pathetic. This is not North Korea, for goodness sake. ‘Shared values of tolerance, kindness, pride and respect’ are a far cry from the current state of the UK.”",education
"“The Woman Who Got Things Done” is how a former colleague described my mother, Auriol Earle, who has died aged 93. There is no better way of describing her.Born in Totnes, Devon, Auriol was the elder child of Col Guy Lucas, an army officer, and his wife, Audrey (nee Smith), a professional tennis coach who appeared at Wimbledon in the 1930s. Auriol was among the first women to attend university, graduating from Exeter with a degree in English literature in 1949. Her interest in education was matched by that of her husband-to-be, Eric Earle, an Irishman. After an impossibly romantic encounter involving trains, coinciding job interviews and Waterloo station, they married in 1952.Eric worked for the Colonial Education Service and soon afterwards was posted to the West African colony of the Gold Coast. In what was soon to become Ghana, Auriol threw herself into starting a family and helping to establish an international nursery school for the colonial community and local Ghanaians.The family returned to England in 1961, and set up home in Guildford, Surrey. They divided a large house in two with one half taken by their lifelong friends, Bill and Nick Smyth, and their three children. Auriol and Eric filled the other half by adding a fourth child to their own family.Never contained by family life and always concerned to enlarge the lives of others, in the 1960s Auriol set up, with her friend Pauline Gough, Guildford Holiday Fun, which mobilised a small army of enthusiastic volunteers to offer sports, art and craft classes at a nominal fee to hundreds of schoolchildren.Auriol became actively involved in developing the arts in Guildford, including through her work at Surrey University as an associate lecturer developing a general studies module for engineering students. She served as Liberal Democrat councillor representing the people of Worplesdon on Guildford borough council for several years from 1995. As chair of the arts and recreation committee, she pushed through plans for a skate park, despite encountering stiff opposition from other councillors who felt it would disrupt the tranquillity of Stoke Park. It opened in 1998 and was quickly embraced by the skater community because it was well designed and a decent size.Auriol and Eric were a dynamic and unbroken partnership. For 60 years their home and garden in Guildford were always open to friends and relations. Together they travelled the world and much of Ireland, loving the adventures arising from visiting their children in Botswana, Australia, the US and Norwich.Auriol was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2017. She is survived by Eric, their children, Wendy, Jennifer, Patrick and me, and seven grandchildren, Chloe, Samuel, Joe, Rosa, Niall, Hannah and Eva.",education
"Nearly half of all students thought their degree offered poor value for money this year, according to a survey that sheds light on the scale of student anger with their universities’ response to the pandemic. Twice as many students thought their courses offered poor value (44%) than in 2019-20, despite pandemic disruption that year, according to the survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank. The increase is thought to reflect a view among students that universities misled them about how much in-person teaching they could expect this year. This year is the first in which more students felt let down by their courses than were satisfied since the survey began 15 years ago. Students were unhappy with the cost of tuition as well as the lack of contact hours and in-person teaching, commenting that online learning “isn’t worth £9k” and “is extremely different to in-person learning”. Responding to the survey, Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the university regulator, the Office for Students, urged institutions to be more transparent with students about how much in-person teaching they are likely to receive next academic year so that they have “realistic expectations”. “It is clearly of concern to see such a significant increase in the number of students saying that their course presents poor value for money – largely driven by the limited availability of in-person tuition,” said Dandridge. “If we are going to learn lasting and meaningful lessons from the pandemic, listening carefully and responding to students’ views will be essential.” While some universities, such as the London School of Economics and Edinburgh, have said they will offer all lectures online and most seminars in person, other university websites are vague about their plans, with some stating that the blend of online and in-person will depend on year of study, course and module choices. The survey of 10,000 full-time undergraduates studying in the UK also showed that nearly a fifth plan to go on to further study. Several institutions, including UCL and Sheffield, have reported higher numbers of applications for postgraduate degrees this year, possibly due to students’ concerns about cuts to graduate schemes and entry-level jobs during the pandemic. A new report from the Sutton Trust, an education charity, said the introduction of government-backed postgraduate loans in England had doubled the proportion of graduates from lower-income backgrounds studying for masters degrees, from 6% to 12.9%, but that they remain underrepresented relative to their more privileged peers. The authors warned that the high cost of study may still be shutting out some students, with average tuition fees at universities in the prestigious “golden triangle” of London, Oxford and Cambridge having doubled since 2011 to reach £10,900, outstripping increases among other universities. Once living costs are factored in, this averages £20,000 a year, beyond the scope of available loans.",education
"Novelists including Mark Haddon this week accused the government of “baseless prejudice” against the humanities as they made an impassioned plea for universities not to ditch their English degrees despite a slump in applications. By the January application deadline this year, 7,045 18-year-olds in the UK had applied to study English at university, a fall of more than a third from 10,740 in 2012, according to data from the admissions service Ucas. Experts say this is because far fewer students are now studying English at A-level. Over the same period there has been a boom in applications for subjects such as computer science, psychology and maths. Staff at Cumbria University were told on 27 May that it would no longer take the students who had applied to start its English degree in September, owing to low numbers. The course website promises that students can explore literature in the Lake District setting that inspired William Wordsworth, Arthur Ransome and Beatrix Potter, “a landscape which has been a source of inspiration to generations of poets and writers”. Its Ambleside location makes it the “only university campus in the UK located in a Unesco world heritage site”, the site says. Staff were told the university would help the candidates to find alternative English courses elsewhere. This month academics at Leicester University went on strike to oppose cuts to English jobs, and last summer Portsmouth University axed more than half its English department. With applications to study English declining further each year, academics fear more cuts will follow. Haddon, whose novels include the multi-award-winning The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, said the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, was “clearly driven by an utterly baseless prejudice in favour of Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] subjects and against the humanities”. Williamson enraged many academics in the arts and humanities when he said in a speech in February that universities must focus on technical courses and filling gaps in the labour market “instead of pushing young people on to dead-end courses that give them nothing but a mountain of debt”. Haddon, who studied English at Oxford, said Britain was “already poorer” for the decline in English degrees. “English is about history, it’s about psychology, it’s about philosophy, languages, sociology, theology. It’s about what makes us human,” he said. Despite arguing that English has a value that goes beyond money, he feels the government has ignored research from the British Academy showing that humanities graduates are just as employable as scientists and mathematicians. The academy found that of the 10 fastest-growing economic sectors, eight employed more arts, humanities and social science graduates than any other disciplines. Haddon said: “You don’t need to declare English as a special case on account of some nebulous, impractical, spiritually improving quality which business-oriented politicians are too coarse to comprehend. It is a great degree on its own terms.” Patrick Gale, the author of 19 novels and the Emmy-award-winning BBC drama Man in an Orange Shirt, also leaped to the subject’s defence. “English fosters our understanding of one another,” he said. “If more members of the current cabinet had English literature degrees, you can be sure they wouldn’t be cutting our overseas aid budget or so radically undervaluing the importance of investing in children whose education has been disrupted by the pandemic.” Dame Marina Warner, the novelist and historian, said English degrees offered a “vast and rich repository of knowledge, insights and experience across time”.  She argued that understanding how people used language to influence others was more important than ever in an age of social media and disinformation. “Shakespeare’s Iago will teach you a lot about lying and persuasion and being turned around, misled, deceived by someone’s talk,” she said. English academics say much of the decline in applications to study the subject is driven by a matching slump in numbers doing English A-level. In 2012, English was the most popular A-level, with 90,000 students taking it. But in recent years numbers have plummeted. This summer 57,000 students will be taking English A-level, according to Ofqual’s latest figures – a decrease of a third since 2012. David Duff, the chair of the English Association and professor of romanticism at Queen Mary, University of London, said: “English is not dying out. It’s still the fourth most popular A-level and it still attracts some of the brightest students. But that is definitely a challenging statistic.” The English Association and others have been analysing what has gone wrong. Although there may be factors such as parental influence at play, they think the former education secretary Michael Gove’s radical changes to the English GCSE curriculum in 2017, part of sweeping changes designed to make exams more challenging, have done the most harm. Duff said: “Our research shows that the English language GCSE has been more problematic in putting young people off doing an A-level in English than any other factor.” Duff also said the government’s “disproportionate support for Stem, at the expense of other subjects”, had been deeply unhelpful. “They are fostering this reductive narrative that you can measure the value of education with a calculator. The rhetoric from the government is all about Stem. But why does it have to be either-or? I took two maths A-levels and English and I loved them all.” Alex Thomson, the head of the English literature department at the University of Edinburgh and chair of the University English umbrella group, said the government’s decision to decouple AS and A-levels – so that a year doing AS no longer counts as half an A-level – had also hit English hard. “It used to be the case that when students took AS-level English, a lot of them carried on and did A-level English because they loved it most,” he said. Andrew Miller, the author of popular historical novels including Pure, said he was “delighted” that his daughter was about to start an English literature A-level and expected her to thrive as a result. “Stem subjects are vitally important, but the humanities are, if not the actual heart of a serious university, at least one of its ventricles. You can survive, I believe, with a single ventricle, but only just. You will not be well.” Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, which has been fighting the cuts, said: “If the government continues down this track, we could be seeing one of the biggest attacks on the arts and humanities in English universities in living memory. If courses close, current and future students lose out, and brilliant academic teaching staff risk being laid off.” Cumbria’s vice-chancellor, Prof Julie Mennell, said that while the university had “reluctantly suspended recruitment” to English for this September due to low student demand, it was working on new options in the field of literary studies for future years, such as environmental writing. “In an area of such rich literary heritage, we are absolutely committed to ensuring we maintain an offer for a whole range of students, young and old, to study English literature,” she said. Prof Henrietta O’Connor, the head of the University of Leicester’s college of social science, arts and humanities, said: “In line with other universities across the UK, we have seen a drop in student demand for English and have not been able to ignore this issue. “Our English degree programme offers students the opportunity to study literature from the medieval through to the contemporary period; however, it is essential that we can manage our resources and activity efficiently and effectively.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Our manifesto commitment is to drive up standards for all students, no matter what they study. High-quality provision in a range of subjects, including English, is critical for our workforce, our public services and is culturally enriching for our society. “Progression is the key to our reforms and we have been clear that this is not measured on how much graduates go on to earn.”",education
"Headteacher Ben Davis bowed to the inevitable this week and wrote to all of his year-11 pupils and their families to inform them that the school prom – the now-fashionable highlight at the end of secondary school – had been postponed. The hotel that was to have hosted the event contacted the school to say that in the light of the prime minister’s announcement on Monday that final Covid restrictions were to remain in place for another month, the prom could sadly no longer go ahead. The school prom is traditionally a big event at St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic high school in Wardley, Greater Manchester. Pupils spend months planning their outfits. With “freedom day” on the horizon, dresses were bought, suits hired and limos booked. “I’ve been getting emails from parents asking, ‘What are we doing? Should I take the dress back, should I take the suit back? It’s a big, big deal,” said Davis. “This year it matters more than ever. If there was ever a year group that really, really deserved a prom, it’s this year.” When the venue cancelled, staff looked into bringing the event on site, but the cost of renting marquees has gone through the roof thanks to the pandemic. Instead, the prom will be postponed until the start of the next academic year, Covid permitting. It’s disappointing, says Davis, but with nearly 200 pupils self-isolating and some staff unable to come into work, it was looking increasingly unlikely. “At the end of the day, however much we would want to have a prom, the fact of the matter is that in Salford we have over 300 cases per 100,000. However sad it is, it’s not a responsible thing to do.” Will Carr, the headteacher at Ralph Thoresby school in north Leeds, decided to keep it simple. Instead of the usual prom, which can be a big expense with £30 tickets and dresses costing up to £300, staff organised a leavers’ assembly in the school theatre followed by a barbecue, complete with ice-cream van, personalised cupcakes and a poem with a couplet dedicated to every student. “There were a lot of emotions,” said Carr. “We’ve been through a lot together – positive cases, online learning, mass testing. In 27 years of teaching I can’t remember a time where the year 11s were so grateful and so appreciative. There are always tears, but this year they were not quite sure what to do, or what to make of it. It felt a lot more poignant.” For some of Carr’s students, it was a relief not to have to do the big prom. “I remember the year 11s used to do a lot of fundraising for their proms. It would start in September,” said Katie Jackson, 16. “This year none of us were really expecting it. And because there were less expectations, you could be there in the moment, rather than worrying about your dress and what you look like.” Primary schools are also saying goodbye to their year sixes. In many cases the traditional residential trip has had to be cancelled, end-of-year shows are being filmed to avoid large gatherings of parents and “graduation” ceremonies are being staggered to keep numbers down. Jamie Barry, the headteacher at Yew Tree primary school in Sandwell in the West Midlands, is determined his year-six children will get to wear their graduation gowns and caps without compromising on safety. They’ve already missed out on so much,” he says. “It’s a rite of passage. You can’t let that pass without any sense of occasion.” Sarah White, at Coates Lane primary school in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, is one of a number of primary headteachers who have decided to buy every year-six leaver a copy of Marcus Rashford’s book, You Are a Champion. The England and Manchester United footballer achieved legendary status in schools across the country during lockdown for his free school meals campaign. “In a normal year we would have an end-of-year play where the parents would come and watch, we would have a residential trip somewhere, we would make a massive thing of it with a leavers’ disco and a barbecue, but we’ve stripped it right back this year,” White said. “I had seen Marcus’s book and I thought it would be an amazing present.” When she posted the idea on Twitter, Rashford responded: “Love this, best of luck Year 6. Remember, no one journey is the same, go out and make it your own.” His message will be glued into the front of every child’s book.",education
"My grandad, Henry Barrow, known as Harry, who has died aged 95, was a mechanical engineer and expert in heat transfer who spent more than three decades at the University of Liverpool. His work made a major contribution to the science of tunnel cooling. Born in Liverpool, the younger child of Catherine (nee Boyd) and her husband, James Barrow, a bakery packer, Harry attended Oulton high school and was the first person in his family to go to university, graduating from the University of Liverpool in 1944 with a first-class honours degree in marine engineering. Harry served in the engineering branch of the Royal Navy from 1944 to 1947, first in Portsmouth and then in the Mediterranean. On his return to the UK in 1947, he married Christina O’Brien, who had grown up a few streets away from him in Fairfield, Liverpool. They went on to have two children, Stephen and Janet. Henry undertook further practical training at Vickers-Armstrongs in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, before teaching at Liverpool Technical College. In 1951, he was appointed as a lecturer in the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Liverpool. Following the completion of his PhD, he was promoted to senior lecturer in 1964 and then to reader in 1979. He published more than 90 articles in scientific journals during his career. Harry retired in 1984, but continued to teach part-time in the department of engineering until 1987. On retirement, Harry found a new focus for his expertise. Development work on the Channel tunnel had highlighted the need to mitigate thermal problems in long railway tunnels, both for safety and for passenger comfort. Working with Clive Pope, an expert in train aerodynamics, over the next 20 years he made a major contribution to the science of tunnel cooling, receiving funding from British Rail, Crossrail and Mott MacDonald. In recognition of his scholarship, he was awarded a doctorate of engineering by Liverpool University in 2005. Despite research success, Harry was committed to teaching and maintained lifelong contact with his former PhD students. Outside work, Grandad enjoyed oil painting and watching snooker, rugby and football, but, even in his later years, he could often be found sitting in his chair writing equations and theorising. He also delighted in sharing his experiments – and magic tricks – with each new generation of the family. Christina died in 2012. He is survived by their children, his grandchildren, Lois, Louise, Samuel and me, and great-grandchildren, Harry, James, Sophia, and Joanna.",education
"The head of the schools watchdog in England has denounced a “militant” new brand of activism in school communities, which she warned was leading to confrontation within and outside the school gates and having a potentially limiting effect on education. Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, raised concerns not only about recent parent and community protests, which have led to children having to cross picket lines to get to school, but also a rise in pupil activism on issues such as racism, climate change and recent developments in the Middle East. In some cases, she said, children and teachers were being subjected to abuse and even violence for being the wrong religion, race or ethnicity, and she said pupils should not be forced to support their peers’ campaigns for fear of being ostracised if they do not. On teachers, Spielman said they should not be policed by “self-appointed moral guardians” who refuse to tolerate alternative viewpoints, or harried on social media to apologise for what they have said or change the way they teach. “What I’m concerned about is not the activism that broadens debate and brings about long-term change, but the militant kind of activism that demands an immediate adherence to a position,” she told an education festival on Thursday. “We are seeing these confrontational approaches both outside and inside schools. It is affecting staff, parents and children and can have a limiting effect on education.” Spielman avoided referring to any cases in detail, but in recent times there have protests outside schools over LGBT and relationships education as well as, at Batley grammar school in West Yorkshire, after an image of the prophet Muhammad was shown in class. The recent Middle East conflict prompted a wave of pro-Palestine protests among pupils in schools and controversy over the staff response, with students being accused of antisemitism and one headteacher describing the Palestinian flag as a “call to arms”. In addition there have been climate change protests by pupils and, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, pupils in England have protested about their experiences of racism, while students at Pimlico Academy in London staged a walkout complaining of discriminatory policies. “This is a difficult problem for schools,” said Spielman. “So much effort goes into encouraging young people to understand and think about their democratic rights, which of course include the right to protest and to campaign for what they believe in. But education must come first. And no child should ever feel targeted or marginalised because intolerance has replaced reasoned debate.” She told sector leaders attending a virtual Festival of Education: “It cannot be right for children to have to cross what amount to picket lines outside their school because one group’s religious beliefs – protected by law – sit uncomfortably with teaching about another group’s sexuality – also protected by law. It cannot be right that the curriculum can be filleted by pressure groups. “And the militant defence of orthodoxies is not confined to adult protests, or to the protected characteristics. We are also seeing more pupil activism in schools, on many fronts. Some of this is about racism, or anti-racism; some is about climate change; some is about issues that are quite remote for most British children, such as the charged and complicated politics of the Middle East. “But in some cases children and teachers are suffering abuse or even violence simply for being who they are: for being the wrong religion, or race or ethnicity. This is completely unacceptable.”",education
"Schools in England face a “creativity crisis” with the number of creative arts students and teachers down by as much as a fifth in some subjects after a decade of underinvestment, Labour has warned. Pupils’ engagement in the creative arts is considered by many to be a key factor in their recovery from the pandemic yet, according to Labour, specific government funding for music, arts and cultural programmes will equate to just £9.40 per pupil this year. New analysis of government data shows that the number of GCSE music and drama students has fallen by a fifth over the last decade, Labour says, a trend mirrored by a drop in the number of drama teachers. In addition, one in seven music teachers and one in eight art and design teachers have left the profession, Labour’s analysis has shown. School reforms have caused pupils to move away from arts subjects such as dance, music and art, and towards more traditional academic subjects such as geography and English. In further education, there was an outcry in May from artists and musicians who accused the government of neglecting the country’s “cultural national health” after becoming aware of plans for a 50% funding cut to arts subjects at universities, which could come into effect from this autumn. The shadow schools minister, Peter Kyle, said the government’s refusal to back school arts threatened children’s recovery from the pandemic and the country’s future prosperity. He said creative industries contribute £11bn to the UK economy, but warned that this would be under threat if fewer pupils had the chance to learn such skills. He said: “Parents across the country want their kids to thrive and to bounce back stronger than ever from this pandemic. Pupils want to draw, act and sing – and through doing that, they’ll make friends and develop their creativity. “After a decade of failure on school arts, the Conservatives are out of step with parents’ priorities. Labour is calling on ministers to back our children’s recovery plan, and fund the activities all children need to learn, play and develop. Our kids, as well as the economy of tomorrow, can’t wait.” The study of music is an area of particular concern, with critics warning that it is increasingly becoming the preserve of wealthier families. Earlier this week, a report by the schools watchdog, Ofsted, said the study of music was in decline not only at GCSE and A-level, but also earlier in a child’s education. Music provision for children in key stage 3 (ages 11-14) has been reduced, the report finds, and primary-level trainee teachers are offered shrinking amounts of musical training. “And with reduced lesson time, this has been accompanied by lower levels of staffing to support a school’s rich musical life,” the report says. A Department for Education spokesperson said the proportion of young people taking at least one arts GCSE since 2010 had remained stable. “We have committed to an ambitious and long-term education recovery plan, including an investment to date of over £3bn, to support children and young people to make up for the learning and experiences they have missed out on during the pandemic.” Responding to a parliamentary question from Labour last week, the school standards minister, Nick Gibb, said the government had delivered the largest cash boost for schools in a decade. He said: “This government values the arts and supports the creative arts throughout the education system. “Alongside funding for schools, the department has invested nearly £620m from 2016 to 2021 in a diverse portfolio of music and arts education programmes to ensure all children, whatever their background, have access to a high-quality education in music and arts. A further £84m has been made available for music programmes and a range of arts and cultural programmes in this financial year.”",education
"Jane Considine is an educationist with a cause: she wants a total ban on the time-honoured, traditional weekly spelling tests still carried out in many primary schools – the kind that involve a list of words sent home in pupils’ book bags to be taped to the fridge door, with parents expected to weigh in with “look-say-cover-write-check” opportunities in those elusive moments of empty time in the family day. “I’m not anti tests generally,” Considine says. “But school spelling tests have an essential design flaw, which is that involving parents hugely amplifies the opportunity to pile on stress and pressure.” Parents, says Considine, are A* students when it comes to modelling anxiety – especially anxiety about spelling. And while she couldn’t agree more with parents who say that spelling really matters, she also understands (as a mother of four herself) why passion gets caught up with worries about performance – with the net result that children are disadvantaged, rather than advantaged, by taking home a list of words each week to be fretted over en famille. Considine has canvassed primary school teachers to find out what they think – and 76% of the 1,362 she surveyed agree with her and think tests are an ineffective way to teach spelling. Only PE is less popular as a subject for primary staff to teach, apparently. The pandemic has not made matters any better: 82% of teachers believe spelling has suffered as a result of the restrictions to teaching over the past 18 months. For Considine, whose book on spelling has just been published, it was partly Covid that alerted her to the seriousness of the spelling dearth in British primary schools. An Ofsted inspector turned educational consultant, she found herself, in spring of 2020, unable to work in schools during lockdown. “So I decided to do something else: I put the camera on in my living room at home, straight after the Joe Wicks workout, and invited any child who was interested to log on and join me in a literacy drive.” The feedback from her sessions, she says, was tremendous. “Mums said I’d changed their child’s life by switching them on to writing. That meant a lot.” What she concentrated on in her online sessions was what she calls “the craft and construction” of literacy. As a former consultant with the National Literacy Strategy, she is evangelistic not only about the usefulness, but also the joys, of being able to use words effectively – and that, of course, includes spelling them correctly.  Next, Considine turned her attention to teachers. “I set up a support group for teachers, #teachersquad. It became a kind of online staffroom – there’s a lot of professional love out there, people sharing lesson plans, talking about how to best serve children in these difficult times.” There was a lot of feedback about what teachers were finding about spelling and how to teach it; and also, when Considine found herself marking work from pupils via her online classes, she was struck by how shaky their spelling was. “I already knew, from research pre-Covid, that spelling wasn’t good – only 13 % of all 10-11 year-olds, for example, can spell the word ‘coarse’. So spelling seems to me to be on the scale between what I’d call shonky and mediocre. And that’s really sad, because I believe children want to be good spellers.” In her new book, which is aimed at teachers, Considine outlines what she is suggesting to replace weekly spelling tests. “What we need to do is keep everything within schools, so we don’t up the anxiety. Then, we need to focus on the words each individual child needs to learn to spell – and that’s different for each pupil.” Considine calls these the pupil’s “focus five”, and says the list should be laminated and on the child’s desk at all times. “The words are tailored for that child, and the idea is to encourage them to put them into their work,” she says. What is not difficult is identifying the five key words each pupil needs: the truth is, she says, youngsters can identify these for themselves. “When they’re editing and reviewing their work, it comes naturally to them to work out which words they’re not confident about spelling correctly.” Considine, whose own children are aged between 15 and 25, says the bedrock of sound spelling and good literacy skills is reading. “Reading is fundamentally critical because it’s about interplay. But reading gets you so far, and beyond that it’s about sharpening children to be effective word detectives. In the schools that are best at literacy, vocabulary is prized and teachers work really hard with word-catching and word-collecting. It’s about instilling a love of words – and that starts with finding patterns.” Much of the book is serious teacher-speak. But when asked what parents can do to help their children become better spellers, her answer is simple. “Make sure your child gets eight hours’ sleep a night,” she says. “Read to and with your child. Enjoy your child being a reader. Foster a love of reading through your own relationship with books and words.” What about IT – won’t spellcheck programs mean a book like hers will soon be obsolete? Do kids today really need to know how to spell? Considine laughs. “Of course spellcheck can be useful – in the same way a dictionary is useful. But what’s crucial is that you need to understand homophones, like practice and practise. Because spellcheck won’t pick up on the misuse of words.” The bottom line for both parents and teachers, she says, is to recognise the power of words. “We work so hard to let children be connected to books, but spelling misses out because it hasn’t got the razzle-dazzle of writing or the emotive spell of reading. And yet it’s so important, and that needs to be acknowledged. Spelling is the nuts and bolts of writing: once you can do it, you’re on track. You can soar.”",education
"England’s current five Covid hotspots are home to some of the largest student populations as the Delta variant rips through young, largely unvaccinated communities. Those aged 18 to 20 were offered their first vaccination on 17 June, meaning only clinically vulnerable undergraduates had received two doses when cases started to soar in student cities.  Central Oxford, where an estimated 69% of the population are students, this week recorded the highest infection rate in England – 2,144 cases per 100,000 people, almost 10 times the national average of 239 per 100,000. Across the city, 80% of the cases were in the 18-29 age group, according to Ansaf Azhar, Oxfordshire county council’s director for public health. The Guardian analysed data on cases and vaccinations for middle-layer super output areas (MSOAs) – smaller administrative areas within a local authority. Durham City, where 73% of residents are students, according to data from the House of Commons Library, has the second-highest infection rates. On Monday, the area had 2,011 cases per 100,000 people. The large numbers of students self-isolating caused huge problems on 1 July, the day student tenancies typically end across many English cities. Deri Humphry, a Durham history student, said he was “still fuming” after his landlord evicted him and four flatmates last week despite him receiving a positive result on 30 June. The whole household was told by test and trace to isolate for 10 days but the landlord refused to let them stay. “He said if we paid £100 a night, all five of us could go and stay in an unfurnished place with only three bedrooms,” said Humphry. “We called the university, council and trading standards asking if it was legal for him to evict us but no one could seem to give us a straight answer. We thought we were doing the right thing by wanting to stay put, but the landlord was having none of it.” In Leeds, where the student district of Hyde Park recorded 1,524 cases per 100,000 on Monday, Leeds University let isolating students stay on in halls beyond the end of their tenancy agreements in order to complete their quarantine. Quite how many of the Leeds cases are students is unclear, with many students having gone home for the summer. Figures collected by Leeds University on 4 July suggested there were 67 active cases of students and staff who had tested positive in the preceding 10 days. James Lewis, the leader of Leeds city council, said he believed the high rates in Hyde Park were not solely down to students, but also to the high numbers of houses of multiple occupancy. “A lot of young people live in shared houses and many work in hospitality, which means they are more likely to come into contact with the virus,” he said. North Jesmond in Newcastle recorded the third-highest infection rates on Monday, with 1,666.8 cases per 100,000 people. About 56% of the residents there are students. In a statement, Oxford University said: “We have been monitoring closely the recent rise in cases, which reflects the pattern seen across the country, and responding accordingly. We have issued guidance to students, and those testing positive are told to immediately self-isolate in Oxford, receive appropriate welfare support from their university and colleges, and all their contacts are also tested. We are working closely with Public Health England and the local councils, following their advice and supporting their drive to increase testing and vaccination across the city.” While Oxford, Leeds, Newcastle and Durham have had strong numbers of young people coming forward for their first vaccinations, in other student cities take-up has been generally low. In the Cathedral and Kelham area of Sheffield, for example, just 32% of all adults have received their first vaccination, compared with the England average of 78%. An estimated 66.5% of the local population are students. Amanda Healy, the director of public health for County Durham, said: “We are aware that, as with other university cities, Durham has an infection rate higher than the national average, and this needs to be viewed in the context of the extremely high proportion of young people in its population, who have only recently become eligible for vaccination. “We have worked with other agencies to deliver vaccination pop-ups in the city alongside increasing access to testing and other measures to reduce transmission; and Durham recently had the third highest number of under-25s to have received a first vaccine in the country.” Lorna Smith, the assistant director of public health at Newcastle city council, said: “Our data shows that the majority of cases are among the largely unvaccinated under-25s, who also account for much of the mixing that takes place in social and household settings. “We know wards such as North Jesmond have a high percentage of its population that fit into this age bracket, and whilst many of our city’s students have returned home for the summer, a small number are still in Newcastle working, studying or supporting the city’s hospitals, testing and vaccination centres.”",education
"School leavers across the UK have shrugged off fears about the continuing impact of Covid and applied for undergraduate places in record numbers, according to data from Ucas, the university admissions administrator. The admissions service said that across-the-board increases in applications and offers of places meant the highest ever number of students would be starting university or college courses in the autumn, with particularly high rates of applications coming from women and sixth-formers. The push for places suggests students in England are undeterred by the government’s repeated warnings about “low-value” degrees that offer little boost to graduate pay, or by the prospects of student loans of more than £40,000 on average by the time they complete their degree. Ucas said 311,000 UK 18-year-olds had applied for higher education places by its deadline at the end of June, 10% more than the previous record of 281,000 last year. More than 50% of school leavers in Northern Ireland have applied for university places, and 44% in England. The total number of applicants through Ucas, including mature and international students, also hit a new high of 682,000, with a record 400,000 women applying. The pandemic appears to have encouraged record numbers to apply to nursing courses: nearly 66,000 people of all ages have sought places this year, a 19% increase compared with 2020. Applications for medicine and dentistry places were up by 23%. Universities have responded to the extra demand by increasing their offers of places, including a 20% rise since 2019 in offers to students living in disadvantaged areas. Ucas said it had also seen record traffic and applications on its site for degree apprenticeships. “These numbers show the clear demand for undergraduate study and apprenticeships is growing, rising significantly during the pandemic,” said Clare Marchant, Ucas’s chief executive.  “Universities are ready to welcome more students on to courses this autumn and have worked hard to be flexible, enabling students to progress to their next level of study.” The Association of School and College Leaders warned that universities needed to prepare for the “significant educational disruption” experienced by the new cohort since March last year.  “Despite the best efforts of schools and colleges, the learning of students will have been affected to a greatly varying extent, and the mental health and wellbeing of many young people will have been impacted by the pandemic,” the group said. Hollie Chandler, the head of higher education policy for the Russell Group of leading research universities, said: “The increase in offers by higher tariff providers to UK 18-year-olds, including those from the most deprived areas, reflects our universities’ commitment to be as fair and flexible as possible to ensure students are not disadvantaged in their applications by the changes in the awarding of A-levels this year.” Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said the record numbers of places being offered were not being matched by higher levels of staff employment, pointing to redundancies and course cuts at universities across England. “Ultimately, cuts impact on students as staff become increasingly stressed and burned out, so it’s important that universities match increased student numbers with increased investment in their staff,” Grady said. But she said it was encouraging to see increases in the numbers applying to study humanities, social sciences and creative arts across England, despite the government’s attacks and funding cuts aimed at these subjects. “If ministers are serious about delivering a strong post-pandemic recovery, they must abandon all proposed funding cuts to the arts and take action to bolster this vital sector of the UK economy,” Grady said.",education
"The University of Cambridge has been accused of entering “a Faustian pact” over plans for a £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates in what would be the biggest deal of its kind in the university’s history. According to internal documents seen by the Guardian, the 10-year collaboration would help Cambridge, one of the wealthiest higher education institutions in the UK, “weather the challenges faced by universities as a result of Covid, Brexit and a constrained funding environment”. The documents state that the UAE has pledged to commit £312m – the biggest single donation by far that the university has received – and £90m will be paid in kind through Cambridge staff time. The deal has yet to go before the university’s general board, the Guardian understands. But if approved, the UAE-Cambridge Innovation Institute will begin as a virtual entity and culminate in “a physical footprint” in the UAE with its own staff and “joint UAE and University of Cambridge branding”. Key areas of focus will include education, Islamic art and culture, engineering and innovation, in particular research into alternatives to fossil fuels. The UAE has long been the focus of global campaigns concerning alleged human rights abuses. Three years ago there was uproar when a British academic, Matthew Hedges, was convicted in the UAE on spying charges after going to Dubai for research. Hedges is suing four senior officials from the Gulf state who he alleges were complicit in falsely imprisoning and torturing him. Cambridge University documents acknowledge the risk of reputational damage posed by the collaboration. They also raise concerns about a “values gap”, “academic freedom and institutional autonomy”, and “the potential burden such a large partnership could place on parts of the university and attendant mission drift”. The project is said to have the full support of the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope. The documents state: “We are fully aware of the UAE’s recent treatment of UK researchers and other visitors, which reflect a dramatically different cultural and legal context than that which may be familiar to our staff and students. We will put in place sufficient support to ensure that our staff are prepared before their work in the UAE begins.” Several UK universities, including City University, the London Business School, Birmingham, Middlesex and Heriot-Watt, already have branches in the UAE, but the scale of the collaboration with Cambridge, one of the most successful and best-known universities in the world, will be seen as a huge coup for the Gulf state, which is keen to use soft power to improve its image on the global stage. The collaboration would see Cambridge working with “several educational, governmental and corporate partners in the UAE”, involving the university at multiple levels of its economy and society. According to the document, the funding would go towards the creation of a large number of new posts including eight endowed lectureships, 24 postdoctoral positions and 42 PhD fellowships as well as other management and support roles. An official announcement by the university on Wednesday gave few details, saying only that the institution was in talks with the UAE about a potential strategic partnership. “This collaboration is designed to develop innovative solutions that enable the transition away from fossil fuels; the continued development of high-quality teaching and learning; the ongoing progression of social cohesion through the study of arts and culture; and the advancement of globally competitive research, education, and entrepreneurship.” Asked about the internal documents, a university spokesman said: “These are talks regarding a potential partnership and no details have been finalised.” Nicholas McGeehan, a human rights researcher working on the Gulf states, said: “This is a Faustian pact that should be of profound concern to Cambridge faculty, students and alumni and UK academia more broadly. The UAE is a deeply illiberal state with a zero-tolerance stance on free speech and critical thought, and it deals with its critics in the most brutal fashion imaginable through torture and forced disappearances.” McGeehan, a co-director of the FairSquare Projects human rights group, said Cambridge would be giving up some of its hard-earned reputation in return for burnishing the reputation of the UAE. “Only academics who see higher education as a commercial enterprise could think that it’s worth the cost.” Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: “This is a clear case of a rich authoritarian state using its wealth in an attempt to launder its reputation. It would be shameful if the University of Cambridge were willing to be used in this way. “It is one of the wealthiest institutions in the UK and does not need this money. UCU members in other institutions have raised concerns about LGBT+ rights in the UAE, and this deal looks especially problematic in light of the legal action which the British academic Matthew Hedges is pursuing over alleged false imprisonment and torture.”",education
"My friend and former colleague, Mike Lennon, who has died aged 78, was appointed to the staff of the University of Manchester in 1969, becoming senior lecturer in community dentistry in 1980.  There, with Professor Phil Holloway, he developed supplementary undergraduate training outside the dental school. Students were sent out to clinics managed by local health authorities, and treated mainly child patients under supervision.  This novel “outreach” approach, initially opposed by traditional dental educators (though students loved it), has now been adopted by every dental school in the UK, and trials have shown that students’ ability to formulate realistic treatment plans is greatly increased as a result. Mike was also a co-director of the groundbreaking trial of a capitation system which paid general dental practitioners an annual fee to provide all the treatment necessary for child patients in a year, instead of a fee per filling or extraction, for example. Health ministers, who thought that the “fee per item” system incentivised overtreatment, were very pleased with the results, and the system was adopted nationwide. He was born in Liverpool, to John Lennon, a headteacher, who was known by his middle name, Pearse, and Betty (nee Healey). Mike qualified from Liverpool dental school in 1966 and gained the diploma in public dentistry from Dundee University before joining Manchester. A committed advocate of the fluoridation of public water supplies, he was chair of the British Fluoridation Society from 1987 until 2012. In 1989 he was appointed professor of dental public health by the University of Liverpool, and honoured as an emeritus professor on his retirement. In 2003, finding full retirement unappealing, he moved to a part time chair at the University of Sheffield, managing Sheffield’s outreach programme. During a distinguished academic career Mike published more than 100 articles in refereed journals, was a busy referee for 20 journals and in global demand as an external lecturer and examiner. A founder member of the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry, he served as its secretary (1977-81), president (1984-85), and editor of its journal, Community Dental Health 2010-16. He was appointed OBE in 2006.  His very busy professional life would not have been possible without the support of his wife, Gill (nee Smith), whom he met at Liverpool dental school, and married in 1969. His interests outside work included classical music and supporting both Liverpool and Everton. He is survived by Gill, their daughters, Sarah, Helen and Kate, and son, Chris, and nine grandchildren.",education
"Pupils who are due to sit GCSEs and A-levels next summer will be given advance notice of the focus of some examinations to try to mitigate for learning lost as a result of the pandemic, according to plans unveiled by the government. Ministers have already stated their intention that exams should go ahead in England next summer, but under proposals published on Monday schools will be given some choice over topics in a number of GCSE subjects, in recognition that many students will not have not had time to complete the whole curriculum because of lockdowns and self-isolation. Pupils will also be allowed support materials, like a formulae sheet for GCSE mathematics, while those facing GCSE physics and combined science will be provided with an expanded equations sheet. There will also be adjustments to science practicals and art and design assessments. The proposals are now the subject of a consultation and plans will not be confirmed until the autumn term is already under way. Worried school leaders warned the government was “way behind the curve” and expressed concern that there were still no contingency plans in case exams have to be cancelled for the third year running. “In reality, all of this should have been put to bed weeks, if not months, ago,” said Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the NAHT school leaders’ union. “We are only days away from the end of term. “School leaders wanted decisions for adaptations and contingencies made before the summer break, with details before the start of term in September, not least because August will be a busy month supporting students with their results and working on reviews and appeals.” Under the new proposals, schools and colleges will be given some choice about the topics on which their students are assessed in GCSE English literature, history, ancient history and geography. Exam boards will also be required to provide advance information about the focus of the content of exams at AS and A-level. Ofqual, the qualifications regulator in England, and the Department for Education are simultaneously consulting on proposed changes to vocational and technical qualifications, which would enable colleges to streamline assessments and provide revision guidance. Simon Lebus, Ofqual interim chief regulator, said: “With things slowly returning to normal we are launching a consultation so that the flexibility we are building into qualifications will future-proof them against any public health crisis.” Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned: “With grim predictability, the government is launching a short consultation in the dead of summer on an absolutely vital issue – this time on exams for next summer … this is already far too late.” Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “We are very concerned that the consultation does not include proposals for a contingency plan in the event that exams cannot go ahead in 2022. “The last thing we want to see is exams cancelled again but given what has happened this year and last year it is simply a matter of common sense and prudence to map out a contingency plan at this stage.” The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “Exams will always be the fairest way to assess students, which is why they will take place next year, but it’s right that next summer’s arrangements take into account the disruption young people have faced over the past 18 months.”",education
"The Schools minister, Nick Gibb, has pushed back against calls to decolonise the curriculum in England and has warned that what pupils learn in the classroom should not be tailored to any one particular group. Amid mounting pressure to make the teaching of black history mandatory in schools and to diversify the national curriculum, the minister said there was no reason why children from ethnic minorities should not study the work of dead white men. In a speech to the Social Market Foundation thinktank on Wednesday, Gibb said a “knowledge-rich” curriculum taught well was “inclusive and diverse” and would ensure that pupils learned about the struggles and achievements of people from all races. He said: “We will not create a more harmonious, tolerant and equal society through promoting a curriculum based on relevance to or representativeness of any one group. Nor will we do so by being ashamed of who we are and where we came from. “A curriculum based on relevance to pupils is to deny them an introduction to the ‘best that has been thought and said’. And, of course, there is no reason why the work of a ‘dead white man’ is not appropriate for children from ethnic minorities to learn about.” The Department for Education has resisted calls to make the teaching of black history mandatory, insisting that the curriculum already allows for teaching black history and includes black and ethnic minority voices and experiences. Black history will be be mandatory in Welsh schools from next year to help pupils become “informed citizens of the world”. Gibb also expressed concern about reports of what he described as “violent and angry protests” in schools around the country, sparked by recent events in Gaza. Escalation in the Middle East conflict triggered a wave of pro-Palestinian protests by pupils, some of whom later complained they were accused of antisemitism and subjected to disciplinary action. He said young people should be given all the facts to help them understand the situation in Israel and Palestine and warned: “We must be on our guard to ensure that schools don’t become centres of one-sided propaganda, or a hostile environment for young people of any faith or religion.”",education
"A Russell Group university is offering a year’s free accommodation and a bursary of £10,000 to medical students who agree to defer their studies for a year amid a surge in applications to study medicine and uncertainty about A-level grade inflation. The University of Exeter said there had been a significant increase in the number of candidates for medicine who had made Exeter their first choice, but because of a cap on numbers students are being offered a range of incentives to encourage them to delay their studies. The university has written to candidates who have accepted offers to study medicine starting this autumn, asking if they will delay until 2022. In return the university will guarantee their place, if they get the required grades, provide free accommodation worth up to £7,600 and a cash bursary of £10,000 “to spend on preparing yourself”. Prof Mark Goodwin, Exeter’s deputy vice-chancellor (global engagement), said: “We’ve seen a significant upturn in the number of outstanding applicants prioritising the University of Exeter as their first choice for medicine this year. All medicine student numbers are set by the government to ensure that we can accommodate everyone in a way that provides a high-quality education and stimulating student experience, as well as safe and secure NHS placements. “To maximise the choices available to our students, we are offering a range of options, including financial incentives, deferral or studying a postgraduate programme, prior to students commencing their medical studies next year.” The Exeter deferral offer comes as universities across the country are receiving a record number of applications, up 10% among UK 18-year-olds on last year’s figures. While many courses can expand to take in additional students, there is a government ceiling on the number of medical school places and therefore no flexibility. Admissions officers have been grappling not only with the increase in the number of applications to study medicine, which are up 20% on last year’s figures, but also with the prospect of grade inflation due to exams being cancelled and the use of teacher-assessed grades instead, which could see more students achieve the required grades. Dr Katie Petty-Saphon from the Medical Schools Council told the BBC the increase in applications had made it harder for universities to judge the right number of offers. “In the past the very best applicants might receive four offers, which would mean they would reject – and thus free up – places at three medical schools. “This did not happen this year and so the conversion rate of offers to firmly accepted places has changed, meaning that some medical schools have more acceptances than they were anticipating.” Places to study medicine are among the most competitive and oversubscribed in higher education. Universities are hoping not to see a repeat of the chaos last year when many students planning a career in medicine lost their places after results were downgraded by the government’s standardisation algorithm. After the algorithm was abandoned in favour of centre-assessed grades that were significantly higher, many students were too late to get into their school of choice as spaces had been filled. Some were forced to defer a year and will take up their places in the autumn. “The government has funded 450 additional places for applicants who were required to defer last year – and so such candidates are not taking up places destined for 2021 applicants” said Petty-Saphon. This year’s deferrals could impact on next year’s places for medicine, which are capped at 7,500 in England. Dr Tim Bradshaw, the chief executive of the Russell Group, urged the government to expand the number of places available to study medicine. “The significant increase in applications this year and the uncertainty generated by the introduction of teacher-assessed grades means it has been much harder for all universities to judge the right number of offers to make. This is particularly the case for medicine, where the number of places is capped by the government.”",education
"Abdi Yusuf’s first day of middle school was tough. He was 13 years old, and he and his family had recently fled to Texas from South Africa as refugees. Yusuf had just finished the equivalent of third grade in Cape Town but found himself in eighth grade in the US, and remembers trying to decipher a math worksheet and to find a friend amid a sea of unfamiliar faces. “That was really hard because in my school in Africa, I always had friends,” said Yusuf, now 19. In high school, his family moved to Seattle and he started to find his footing, even taking a college-level English class in his senior year. Yusuf dreamed of attending college to become a social worker to help refugees like himself, but after skipping so many grades and being uprooted, his grade point average was low. Questions were looming about how he and his mother, who had three other children at home, could afford college. That’s when he was introduced to Seattle Promise, a program fully launched last year that offers free community college tuition to all of the city’s high school graduates, along with class guidance, an equity stipend and internship opportunities. Yusuf enrolled last fall. “I lost all hope, you know, and because of Seattle Promise, I can go to college now,” he said. The Seattle program is one of at least 350 state and local initiatives across the US launched in recent years offering free tuition and extra support for those attending a community college, which typically consists of a two-year program where students earn an associate’s degree and credits toward a bachelor’s degree. The programs relieve financial burdens on students and their families and have been shown to increase enrollment and completion. In April, Joe Biden unveiled a bold proposal that would implement these programs on a national scale as part of his $1.8tn American Families Plan. Such a plan would remove critical financial barriers and thus fling open the doors to a form of higher education with the largest student body of any type of college and made up of students with some of the greatest economic challenges. “Community colleges meet students where they are,” Biden said at the time. “We can’t afford to exclude so many from continuing their education just because they come from certain areas or income brackets.” The plan is expected to increase educational attainment across the US, according to Mark Huelsman, Policy Fellow at Temple University’s Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice. The result would be potentially more people entering the labor force with a credential or diploma, or transferring to a four-year school. And given that more than half of Latinx undergraduates and a little less than half of Black undergraduates attend community college, millions of students of color would undoubtedly benefit. Advocates say the program would also serve to significantly boost the economy. A 2020 report out of Georgetown University found that a national tuition-free program could result in hundreds of billions of dollars in federal and state tax revenue and private after-tax earnings gains. “These benefits would outweigh the costs of tuition-free-college programs, with yearly tax revenue exceeding the annual cost within the first 10 years after a tuition- free program is implemented,” the report stated. After a year battered by Covid-19, in which community college enrollment fell by more than 11%, many in the education community rejoiced at Biden’s plan. “From an economic, enrollment and certainly an equity standpoint, this could have a powerful impact, and could accelerate our progress in not only getting people back in college, but get them educated, and get them redeployed in an ever-changing economy,” said J Noah Brown, president and chief executive of the Association of Community College Trustees. The proposal calls for free community college for first-time students and adult learners. It also includes a $62bn grant program to help “strengthen completion and retention rates” and raises the cap on Pell grants, the federal government’s need-based grant program for undergraduate students, by $1,400 a year. It would be funded primarily through tax hikes on the wealthy. Experts predict it would be an opt-in program: the federal government would cover 75% of tuition while the states that sign on would be responsible for the rest. In Seattle, community college enrollment has more than doubled and graduation rates have reached twice the national average since the Promise program was launched two years ago. Chancellor Shouan Pan of Seattle Colleges praised Biden’s proposal: “It’s only going to help more students who are not in the Promise program.” But others, particularly Republican lawmakers, have resisted, condemning the plan as expensive and directed at a form of higher education that in many states is already low-cost or free, and has worse graduation rates than four-year schools. Lindsey Burke, director for the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank, has criticized the proposal for its $109bn price tag, saying it would place a financial burden on taxpayers. During a recent Senate education committee hearing, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina voiced concerns about rewarding states that have not kept their tuition fees low. “‘Make college free’ and ‘cancel debt’ may be good liberal talking points, but back home in North Carolina we’ve already made community college very affordable, and in West Virginia and Arizona they’ve made community college tuition less than the average Pell Grant,” the Republican senator said. However, Tennessee – a deeply red state – was one of the first in the US to launch a tuition-free community college program, and has touted its success. James Snider, Tennessee Promise director, said they now receive applications from about 90% of the state’s graduating high school class. And after expanding to include adult learners in 2018, they credentialed more than 1,200 students in the program within the first year. “When our then governor stood up there and essentially said, ‘I want to be able to tell kindergarteners that you can go to school for free,’ it has power,” said Snider. “And it truly has been a powerful statement for our state. It’s been a powerful movement for our state.” When asked about Biden’s proposal, Snider called it an “excellent idea”. “I think that expanding this across the country can only do good,” he added. Warren Rigby decided to give higher education one more chance, 15 years after dropping out of a four-year college in Pennsylvania because he didn’t have adequate financial aid. This time, he tried a community college. At 35 years old, Rigby enrolled at Hudson County Community College in New Jersey, where he took night classes surrounded by students in similar situations. But taking out loans to pay for the tuition meant adding to the nearly $27,000 he already owed from his initial stint in higher education. So, he said, it was a relief when in his second year, he qualified for the state’s tuition-free college program. “When you go into higher education, whether it be a college or university, you understand that there’s obviously fees that are associated with this,” he said. “But what a lot of students don’t necessarily realize is how quickly they add up.” He graduated last year and will be starting at a four-year college as a political science major in the fall. He said he hopes to get a job in government so he can help make a difference for other members of the LGBTQ+ community. Public community college tuition varies widely between states. California and New Mexico have the least expensive tuition, with price tags under $2,000, while in Vermont the cost tops $8,600, according to College Board. But Huelsman cautioned that just because community colleges have relatively low tuition doesn’t mean they’re low-cost for students. “There’s the cost of living and the cost of childcare and the cost of rent and the cost of books and the cost of supplies and computers, you name it,” he said. “All of these indirect costs tend to build up in a way that makes community college actually quite unaffordable for students.” Biden’s proposal to remove tuition costs while increasing other aid to students could make college truly affordable, Huelsman said. The proposal also focuses resources on students that have historically been overlooked. It opens the free tuition program to the “Dreamers”, the hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the US unlawfully as children, but are allowed to live in the country legally. While they may study and work, they can’t access Pell grants and often don’t qualify for institutional aid or even in-state tuition. Biden’s proposal also calls for two years of subsidized tuition for students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU) or Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI) whose families earn less than $125,000. For students in one of the 35 fully accredited tribal colleges and universities (all of which offer associate’s degrees), where the majority of students are very low-income, free tuition could be transformative. Carrie Billy, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, reports that a community college in North Dakota started offering free tuition and saw its enrollment triple. But she said, given the structure of these institutions, in which the federal government is responsible for operating support, she worries about the financial burden the colleges might bear. . “We’re afraid that with free tuition, our colleges that already have inadequate operating support, can’t do bonding and things like that, are then going to be asked to bear a disproportionate share of the tuition costs,” she said. Lezli Baskerville, president of the not-for-profit National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, questioned whether the proposal’s plan for HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs is the best method for helping a diverse group of students earn a degree. “Additional public debate is necessary with regard to creating an entitlement to the first two years of community college for any students who desire to attain a two-year college degree and not doing the same for those desirous of attaining a four-year degree at an HBCU, TCU, or MSI,” she told the Guardian in an email. For Yusuf, the program in Seattle came at just the right time. But it has not been without its challenges. He struggled in math – failing the class twice – and when school went online because of the pandemic, he took the spring quarter off because he didn’t feel like he was getting the help he needed. However, Yusuf said he was eager to return to school in the fall. He plans to transfer to a four-year university after graduation and then he hopes to fulfill his dream to become a social worker. “Because of Seattle Promise, I feel like I have a long future ahead of me now,” Yusuf said. “I get to go to college. I get to get a job that I’ve always wanted ever since I came here.”",education
"Nearly three-quarters of secondary schools in England are offering activities and catch-up classes for children this summer, according to figures announced as part of a £200m scheme supported by the Department for Education. But Labour and school leaders said the summer scheme and other elements of the government’s catch-up programme were inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem caused by millions of children missing school since March last year. The DfE said more than 2,800 mainstream state secondary schools – 74% of the total – have signed up to provide “a mixture of academic and extracurricular activities” before the start of the new academic year in September. Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said: “We have invested £3bn so far in helping children catch up ahead of the next academic year and summer schools are an integral part of the overall effort to recover from the disruption caused by the pandemic.” The DfE said schools are expected to target their programmes at children most in need of catch-up, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds or entitled to free school meals. Pupils going into Year 7 in September have also been encouraged to attend to ease their move from primary school. But Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, accused ministers of showing “a staggering lack of ambition for our children’s futures”, criticising the scheme for the small numbers of children involved. “More children are leaving school without any catch-up support than will attend a summer school this year, providing yet more evidence of the Conservatives’ failure to deliver on their promises on children’s recovery,” Green said. While the DfE claims that 540,000 children are registered to take part in the summer schools, Labour said that was equivalent to just one in 15 state school pupils and fewer than the 560,000 pupils who left school this year without any catch-up support. Natalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute, said the government was wrong to restrict the funding to narrow numbers of children. “Summer schools are a vital part of the education recovery process, but the government’s programme is limited as it is only targeted at a small subset of pupils,” she said. “Supporting those pupils transitioning into Year 7 is important, but we need to see summer schools open to pupils in all year groups, including those in primary schools. “In order to recover the months of lost learning experienced by pupils, we estimate that the government needs to spend closer to £2bn over the next three years on summer schools – that’s 10 times what they’ve currently committed to.” The EPI estimates that a three-year funding package worth £13.5bn will be needed to fill the gaps in children’s learning resulting from the pandemic. Labour has said it would spend £15bn on school catch-up programmes.",education
"Parents are angry and confused by the government’s shifting messages over how schools deal with Covid outbreaks among pupils, according to a headteachers’ leader, who says “exhausted” staff are unlikely to get a break over the summer. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said comments by MPs and special advisers meant teachers were being blamed for the huge rise in pupils in England having to self-isolate, while ministers dangled the prospect of the isolation rules being scrapped. “The debate is creating confusion and friction at the school gates – parents are anticipating that these changes are going to come and make things easier for them, and their patience is wearing thin that the government hasn’t followed through,” said Whiteman. “Parents can’t understand why bubbles are being burst after positive tests and why children are being sent home to self-isolate. And our members are getting the blame for that, when all they can do is follow the guidelines and rules that are in place, not anticipate what’s coming over the hill.” Whiteman said the sharp rise in school Covid outbreaks – after official figures showed 330,000 pupils in England isolating at home last week – was compounding the heavy workload for headteachers, which was likely to continue into August. School leaders will be expected to oversee test and trace for pupils infected a week after the end of term, while those in secondary schools will need to administer teacher-assessed A-levels and GCSEs next month. That includes the appeals process over grades, which will need to be done urgently for students applying for university or sixth-form college places. Before the new school year in September, heads may have to prepare for further disruption among the last remaining unvaccinated age groups. But despite the hints dropped by Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, the government has not yet announced its plans for September. “We are a fortnight from the end of term in most schools – so if we have to make arrangements, for example, for on-site testing, then we need to do that now,” Whiteman said. “If we are going to have to continue to live with bubbles, we need to be able to arrange those bubbles and get the timetables right. If there’s also testing needed before children come back, then we are going to have to arrange staggered starts in secondary. “So the pressure on schools isn’t really abating, and the government isn’t doing anything in the last two weeks of term to help. Come September, we’re still going to have a workforce that has been under pressure even over the summer.” Whiteman’s views were echoed by Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, who wrote in the TES that the government had “presided over a week of unhelpful confusion and sniping”, adding it marked “another squalid low point in the trust and confidence that the education sector now has in the government”. Whiteman, Barton and the National Education Union have written to Williamson in protest at the lack of guidance for the next school year. After accusing the government of treating school leaders “with what is, frankly, starting to feel like contempt”, the letter states: “We do not accept that schools and colleges should be expected, on an indefinite basis, to continue to undertake public health duties, to the detriment of our members’ health and wellbeing, and to their capacity to focus on providing the high-quality education that children and young people desperately need.”",education
"Schools in England are “bleeding out” with thousands of teachers having to isolate under a bubble system that is harming the most vulnerable children, ministers have been warned. Headteachers are growing increasingly exasperated about a lack of clarity from the government about how to deal with Covid outbreaks among pupils, with only two weeks until most schools in England break up for summer. Gerard Jones, the director of children and young people at Oldham council, said the town was struggling to keep schools open with 400 staff isolating along with more than 6,400 children – about 15% of the whole school population. “What we’re getting from the government is ‘be patient’ and the Department for Education have just refused to say very much about it at all. Meanwhile we’re bleeding out here,” he said. Jones said the much-criticised policy of sending home dozens of pupils if one tested positive was increasing the risk of harm to vulnerable children at home. “What we saw during the last lockdown was a lot of children come to harm because they were not being seen at school, so we always worry about that.” The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said last week he wanted the bubble system scrapped as soon as possible, but the government has not yet announced how it will be replaced. Ministers are said to be considering a “test and release” system, which would allow pupils or staff who have been in contact with an infected person to remain at school as long as they produce a daily negative test. A sharp rise in school Covid outbreaks meant that 330,000 pupils in England were isolating at home the week before last, with that figure expected to rise in the final days of term. Prof Adam Finn, a paediatrics expert and member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the greatest threat to children from Covid was “primarily through disruption to their development and education”. He said: “It’s clear not just in schools but in society more generally that because of the rapid rise in cases and the number of contacts, a lot of areas of activity have been paralysed by the need to isolate. “So there’s an emerging dilemma there that either you accept that kind of paralysis or you relax the rules. At some point, whether it’s schools or workplaces, we’re going to have a kind of de facto lockdown, simply because so many people are being asked to self-isolate.” Jones, who is responsible for about 35,000 children in Oldham’s 72 schools, said the bubble system was putting younger children’s health at risk because it meant that those isolating may miss out on vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella. “We need a new plan for daily testing and a reformed approach to how we handle Covid in schools and we need these not in three months but now,” he said. “This is not just an issue Oldham is facing but is being seen across Greater Manchester with thousands of pupils affected. Northern kids are at risk of being left behind – when exams do go ahead children from wealthier boroughs will have had far more schooling. “If this was happening in Westminster, there would be action – if this government is serious about levelling up, they need to put their hands in their pockets and give us the resources to help these children now.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are grateful to everyone who works in education for their tireless work over the course of the pandemic – and for following safety measures to protect public health while maintaining high-quality teaching for pupils. “We recognise the disruption that a minority of schools and colleges continue to face, which is why we are working across government to relax restrictions and provide clarity on the new approach in line with the wider move to step 4 of the roadmap.”",education
"The University of Manchester is facing a mounting backlash from students after becoming the first to unveil plans to keep its lectures permanently online with no reduction in tuition fees. More than 3,000 students have signed a petition condemning the redbrick university for its plan to offer only seminars in person – with lecture halls to be left vacant even after the pandemic. Prof April McMahon, vice-president for teaching, learning and students, also ruled out offering a tuition fee discount. However, Manchester pledged to continue in-person teaching for lectures with an “interactive” element, such as question and answer sessions. Other universities are said to be planning similar approaches after the pandemic, although Manchester, one of the largest universities in the UK, is understood to be the first to make a formal announcement. Student Emily Bennett, who launched the petition against online learning, said: “Students are obviously unhappy with the decision as we don’t feel like we were adequately consulted on the matter, and particularly for humanities subjects, this change would result in drastically lower contact hours a week.” She added: “Obviously it is essential that there is an option for online learning due to continued restrictions and access requirements, but the majority of students would be able to and would prefer to return to in-person teaching for the next academic year.” The anger came in response to an interview with student newspaper the Tab, in which McMahon said the university planned to move towards a “blended learning” model in the long term and there would “absolutely not” be any fee discounts for students, since “it’s more expensive to produce a lot of the material, to make sure it’s inclusive, accessible and high quality”. Prof Danielle George, head of blended learning, confirmed in a clip of the interview shared with the Guardian that this would mean large lectures would stay online, since they are “didactic and non-interactive”. However, she said “there isn’t that much across the university” which is not interactive. Ayma Khan, a student researching the shift for the university, said in the clip: “So far the data we have and the students I’ve spoken to are so demotivated by online learning that they don’t want any element that’s online.” The interviews follow an earlier statement published by the university which unveiled blended learning as the “default model of teaching” in future. The statement said in-person sessions on campus would be reserved for “labs, seminar discussions or in-depth Q&As” while explanatory material, thought to include lectures, would be available via video. “People are very angry,” said Ben McGowan, the first-year politics and sociology student who conducted the interview for the Tab. “It doesn’t feel like it’s done for accessibility reasons, it feels profit-driven, a way to cut corners without cutting tuition fees.” The move follows a fractious year for relations between the University of Manchester and its student body. Last autumn, students tore down fences erected outside halls of residence in a heated protest against the university’s botched pandemic response. This later resulted in large-scale rent strikes and a vote of no confidence in the vice-chancellor, Nancy Rothwell. A Universities UK spokesperson said: “Universities continually review their learning and teaching strategies, and will be looking at how and when to incorporate more blended provision in a non-pandemic future. “It is unclear at this stage whether blended learning will be a permanent fixture.” Last week vice-chancellors from several universities in Wales told MPs that “some things work better online, especially some large lectures”, and that they expected this to continue post-pandemic. A University of Manchester spokesperson said: “This is not online teaching, but about augmenting in-person lectures, seminars, labs, Q&As and discussions, and workshops with high quality online materials for self-study. We have been speaking to students for some time about ways to increase flexibility and choice and we will continue to do so to help shape this activity to their needs and the needs of each discipline. “Once the pandemic is over and social distancing is no longer required, if large lectures – or any other size lecture – are interactive then they will go ahead in person.”",education
"A university has apologised to transgender and non-binary staff and students over a review that suggested it had unlawfully no-platformed two female academics whom some had accused of transphobia. The vice-chancellor of Essex University has written to staff and students to say sorry for the timing of the highly critical report, which was released shortly before exams and Pride month, and for the stress under which it had placed staff and students. “I have been asked to provide a number of apologies including: to anyone who felt excluded from or affected by the process of contributing to the review; for the manner in which the report was released, and in particular for the timing of the release,” Prof Anthony Forster wrote on the university’s website. The report by Akua Reindorf, a barrister who specialises in employment and discrimination, said the university’s policy on supporting trans and non-binary staff was based on a misinterpretation of the law and that some members of the institution believed “gender-critical academics can legitimately be excluded”. It was commissioned after two gender-critical academics had speaking engagements cancelled amid claims they were spreading transphobic views and engaging in hate speech that would cause harassment to students. The report said the university regularly submitted its workplace inclusion policy to the charity Stonewall for approval, and Stonewall appeared not to have picked up on the university’s “incorrect summary of the law”. It said the policy assumed that “gender identity or trans status” were protected under the law, whereas it is only gender reassignment that is protected. Stonewall has dismissed the distinction as semantics. The university accepted the report and Forster reasserted its commitment to protecting freedom of speech on the campus and apologised to the two academics. “I was deeply concerned to read the input into the review from some staff and students who said that they felt constrained to self-censor their speech and activity because of concerns about how we manage the balance between freedom of speech and our commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion,” he wrote at the time. On Friday he issued the further apology, which he said followed a meeting with trans and non-binary students and staff where they discussed the review’s impact on the community. “In the meeting we discussed how hurt people feel about the outcome and the very negative impact that this has had and continues to have on trans and non-binary staff and students.” Forster added: “My personal view is that the current law in the UK does not fully respect and protect the identities of trans and non-binary people. I understand that in meeting our obligations to respect academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law, we have given the impression that we might not care about the lived reality of trans and non-binary people. “As we revise our equality, diversity and inclusion policies and procedures we will continue to go beyond the minimum standards required by law, wherever we can, to ensure that we recognise, respect and protect the identities of trans and non-binary people.”",education

"Viral videos of impassioned parents denouncing critical race theory at school board hearings have become a cornerstone of the movement to ban its teaching. In one such video, a mother declares critical race theory (CRT) to be “a tactic used by Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan on slavery very many years ago to dumb down my ancestors so we could not think for ourselves”. In another, a woman calls CRT “the American version of the Chinese cultural revolution”. A third mother says she has proof that her local school board is “teaching our children to go out and murder police officers”.  The videos, and their spread online, are emblematic of the way the campaign to ban CRT has combined genuine grassroots anger, institutional backing, and a highly effective rightwing propaganda machine to propel critical race theory from academic obscurity to center stage in the US political debate. That movement has gained tremendous ground at great speed. Legislation seeking to limit the teaching of CRT has been introduced in at least 22 states this year, and enacted in six: Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Statewide resolutions against CRT have also been passed in Florida, Georgia and Utah. “This was a massive campaign that has borne fruit in very dramatic fashion,” said Emerson Sykes, a first amendment lawyer with the ACLU, which is exploring litigation to combat these bills. “It’s going to take a massive campaign to try to push back against that.” When Moms for Liberty first came to Jacksonville, Florida, the nascent conservative parents’ group was talking about one of the issues that worried many parents during the coronavirus pandemic: mask mandates for kids. But Quisha King, a mother of two who worked for the Republican National Committee and the Black Voices for Trump campaign in 2020, also wanted to address other concerns. The district was debating renaming certain local schools, including Robert E Lee high school, and King thought that the argument for making the change – that the name was damaging to Black students – was disrespectful of those students’ ability to succeed. King signed on as a co-chair of Moms for Liberty and began advocating against an ideology she had been reading up on: CRT. Raised in a “staunchly Democrat” household, King experienced a change in perspective in 2017 that was part political, part spiritual, she said. She felt that the Black Lives Matter movement had little to say about Black victims of crime apart from those killed by police, and she began seeking out new sources of information, including Dr Thomas Sowell, a prominent Black conservative intellectual who argues that “systemic racism” is an untestable hypothesis and has compared it to Nazi propaganda. She read foundational CRT scholars, such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, Derrick Bell and Richard Delgado, but also Christian critics of CRT, including Neil Shenvi and Pastor Voddie Bauchman. “I’m a person of faith, Christian, and I felt like God spoke to my heart,” she told the Guardian. “He said, ‘Your skin color has become an idol in your life and you’re seeing yourself through your skin color, and you’re not seeing yourself through Christ.’ That was really the moment for me that changed everything. I felt the shackles of all of those limiting thoughts. That’s why I fight so hard about these thoughts and these ideas being planted into kids’ minds because it is debilitating.” On 11 June, King attended a meeting of the Florida state board of education to argue in favor of Governor Ron DeSantis’s proposal to ban the teaching of CRT. “Just coming off of May 31st marking the 100 years of the Tulsa riots, it is sad that we are even contemplating something like critical race theory, where children will be separated by their skin color and deemed permanently oppressors or oppressed in 2021,” she said. “That is not teaching the truth unless you believe that whites are better than Blacks.” Video of King’s speech, in which she went on to falsely argue that CRT involves “teaching hate”, was quickly clipped and packaged for social media, where it was primed for virality. Of the 500 most viral Facebook posts that mentioned “critical race theory” between 1 January and 21 June, more than 20% were articles about or reposts of parent videos, according to a Guardian analysis of data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned analytics tool. The posts use combative language to sell the videos, with captions like, “Watch this parent absolutely obliterate Critical Race Theory at an Illinois school board meeting” or “Black Mother TEARS Into School Board for Pushing Racist Critical Race Theory”. Among the most viral is a 20-minute video by the conservative TV channel Newsmax sold under the caption “Mom tears apart school board over Critical Race Theory”. The clip includes an entire speech by Tatiana Ibrahim, a mother who accuses school officials of “creat[ing] a curriculum of Black Panther indoctrination” and teaching students to kill cops, before the Putnam county schoolboard in New York. The video racked up more than 4.6m views on Facebook alone and was shared nearly 150,000 times.  In one sense, these videos are so successful because they are, simply put, great content for social media. Hyperbolic takedowns have long been a reliable formula for web traffic (just Google “John Oliver eviscerates” to see how the liberal media capitalizes on this). A recent study by University of Cambridge psychologists found that social media posts that criticized or mocked a “political outgroup” – those on the opposite side of a political divide – were twice as likely to be shared on Facebook or Twitter as posts that praised the author’s political allies. But the videos have also enjoyed a significant boost from the rightwing media ecosystem, which appears to be engaged in a concerted effort to promote the critical race theory narrative.  King’s speech became fodder for a mini-news cycle within the conservative press. With headlines such as “Black mom blasts critical race theory as ‘not teaching the truth’”, the speech was covered by, among others, the New York Post, Fox News, the Daily Caller, theBlaze, the Daily Signal, the Daily Mail, the Washington Examiner, Rebel News, Tucker Carlson and Newsmax. King appeared on Fox News multiple times and was interviewed by the Federalist, Rudy Giuliani’s YouTube show, the One America News Network, and Newsmax. It’s a pattern that has been repeated numerous times, and may increase as more media coverage inspires more parents to head to their local school board meetings. Take Ibrahim. Her school board speech video earned more than 1.1m views on YouTube after it was posted by an account called “Actively Unwoke”. The virality of Ibrahim’s video was then covered by numerous rightwing outlets, including the Daily Mail, the Daily Signal, the Daily Caller and the Wall Street Journal. Ibrahim also appeared on Fox & Friends, One America News Network, and the podcasts of Glenn Beck and Sebastian Gorka. Shawntel Cooper, the mother who attributed CRT to “Hitler and the KKK”, spoke at an 11 May hearing in Loudon county, Virginia, a wealthy DC suburb that is one of the epicenters of the CRT fight. A video of Cooper’s speech amassed more than 800,000 views after it was shared on Twitter by Ian Prior, a former Trump administration official who is leading the effort to recall school board members over antiracism reforms. The video received news coverage in the Washington Free Beacon, Washington Examiner, Western Journal, Blaze Media, and FaithWire, and Cooper gave interviews to the Daily Wire, Tucker Carlson, and Sebastian Gorka. Xi Van Fleet, the mother who compared CRT to her experience growing up in China during the cultural revolution, is also from Loudon county. A video of her speech was shared on Twitter by another rightwing group that is heavily involved in the Loudon county debate – the Virginia Project’s “Program on Un-American Activities”. The video was covered by Fox News, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, Newsmax, theBlaze, the Washington Examiner, the Daily Caller, and Real Clear Politics, and Van Fleet appeared on Sean Hannity’s show, earning another writeup in the Daily Signal. Becca Lewis, a Stanford doctoral student in communication theory who studies rightwing media, characterized these dynamics as an example of “network propaganda”, a theory developed by researchers at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for for Internet & Society. “Conspiracy theories aren’t more likely to emerge on the right or the left,” Lewis said. “The difference is that on the right you have this whole ecosystem that amplifies the conspiracy theory and turns it into generalized knowledge, whereas in the mainstream media, what you have is outlets that try to quell them.” The opposition to critical race theory may not precisely be a conspiracy theory, but many of the fears about it stem from misinformation and there are strong echoes of classic conspiracy tropes in the narrative that anti-CRT influencers such as Christopher Rufo and James Lindsay tell about it. Both Rufo and Lindsay present a narrative of the development of CRT by Black legal scholars in the 1980s that seeks to scandalize the influence of earlier leftist thinkers, as if Bell and Crenshaw were puppets of 1930s German Jewish intellectuals. The University of North Carolina professors Alice Marwick and Daniel Kreiss have described the campaign against CRT as “an all-out disinformation war” that invokes claims “buil[t] on long-standing antisemitic conspiracy theories about Marxism and the Frankfurt School”. The sheer volume of content created by the conservative media about incidents like the parent speeches has helped the right set the terms of the conversation about CRT. While the mainstream media has increased its coverage of the controversy in recent weeks, negative coverage by Fox News has dominated: the cable station has dedicated six times as much airtime to CRT as CNN since 1 January, according to data from the GDelt Summary Television Explorer. CrowdTangle data for every post mentioning “critical race theory” by a Facebook Page or verified profile since 1 January showed that the Pages whose posts received the most interactions were, in order: Ben Shapiro, Sean Hannity, the rightwing media personality Dan Bongino, Fox News, the rightwing podcaster Michael Knowles, Glenn Beck, the conservative evangelist Franklin Graham, Breitbart, Newsmax and PragerU. Shapiro alone has posted about critical race theory 167 times, racking up 6.5m interactions and more than 8.6m video views. The highest ranking non-conservative source was the historian Heather Cox Richardson, who came in 20th place, just behind the rightwing extremist and QAnon promoter Marjorie Taylor Greene. The value of the parent speeches to the rightwing propaganda machine has led some to suspect these moms and dads are not what they seem. A report by Media Matters for America pointed out that many of the people that Fox News had billed as simply parents were in fact professional political operatives, prompting criticism that the entire anti-CRT movement was “obvious astroturf” – a term used to describe well-funded campaigns posing as grassroots activism. But to Lewis, the communications scholar, the rush to dismiss the anti-CRT movement as simply astroturf is reminiscent of liberals who similarly, and inaccurately, dismissed the Tea Party movement as nothing more than Koch brothers-funded astroturf. In a 2012 study of the Tea Party, the sociologists Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson described a more complicated dynamic involving “mutual leveraging” between rightwing organizations, rightwing media and real grassroots energy. Lewis suspects similar leveraging may be at play today. “There’s a tendency outside of the world of the rightwing ecosystem to dismiss [rightwing movements] as being orchestrated by billionaires,” she said. “There are parents who very sincerely believe this, who aren’t necessarily connected to rightwing foundations. There’s a whole spectrum there that can exist.” With substantial grassroots energy from parents already angry at schools over Covid, a super-charged propaganda machine, and major institutional backing from well-funded groups like Heritage, the movement to ban CRT is poised to keep getting stronger. In May, Republican operatives established a new political action committee, the 1776 Project Pac, to fund school board takeover campaigns around the country. The takeovers are modeled on the fight in Southlake, Texas, a wealthy Dallas suburb, where the school board attempted to implement “cultural competency” reforms in response to a 2018 Snapchat video showing several white students shouting the N-word. Conservative parents declared the efforts “reverse racism” and launched a successful campaign to oust the members of the board. The next viral video of a parent denouncing critical race theory may just come from a school board near you.",education
"More than 250 former pupils at Westminster School have signed a letter demanding that it combat the “toxic culture of racism within the student body”, promote the teaching of black culture and confront its links with the slave trade. It is one of the first indications that Britain’s public school system is now coming under pressure to follow the example of many universities and examine how it tackles racial and colonial issues. The letter, to the outgoing headmaster Patrick Derham and his replacement, Dr Gary Savage, explains how “recent events surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement” have forced the pupils to examine what they were taught at the prestigious school whose political alumni include Nick Clegg and Dominic Grieve. While praising the school for “taking a constructive approach to learning”, the former pupils said “our education fell short in educating us about the great privilege that we had as predominantly white students of a public school”. The pupils complain that during their time at the school they did not read a single book by a black author and that black history and Britain’s role in the slave trade were largely ignored. “Schools such as Westminster, with all its privilege and power, have a duty to ensure its students are actively anti-racist, and equipped to contribute to a fairer and more equitable society,” the pupils claim.  The letter notes that the school has a house named after Richard Hakluyt, who promoted the English colonisation of the Americas, and boasts a society named after John Locke, whose Constitutions of Carolina justified slavery. It also has a statue to Elizabeth I, whom the pupils describe as “the monarch who began the English colonial project”. The UCL Legacies of British Slave ownership website reveals that Westminster School has at least 28 alumni linked to the slave trade. These include William Beckford, a former lord mayor of London who inherited an estate in Jamaica with 3,000 slaves. Dr Miranda Kaufmann, a historian whose blog promotes greater understanding of black British history, welcomed the pupils’ intervention. “There’s been quite a lot of movement on this among universities over the last couple of years but I’m not very conscious of many schools doing much. But … the pupils need to think personally about what they can do as well.” The letter also claimed that racist incidents at Westminster had been brushed aside. “It would be great to hear from you what concrete measures you have taken, or intend to take, to reverse a longstanding toxic culture of racism within the student body, which has long gone unpunished,” the pupils ask in their letter. In a statement, Westminster said it had established a “challenging racism committee” made up of staff and pupils and that it was reviewing its procedures to identify ways in which it could “ensure a diverse school community that is truly reflective of the multicultural city in which we live”.",education
"The chief inspector of schools, Amanda Spielman, has expressed her disappointment that primary schools will not be reopening before the summer, amid continuing concern about the government’s failure to prioritise children’s education in the coronavirus crisis. The head of Ofsted said she was saddened that people are “perhaps more frightened than they actually need to be” and called for as much preparation to be done for September reopening as possible before the summer holidays, which start next next month. Giving evidence to the Lords public services committee, Spielman said: “So many people perhaps have been looking at this from the point of view of what they can’t do, rather than what they can. “I would love to see more people in local areas really stepping up and saying – I could make this happen – and getting as much on the road as possible this side of the summer and real ambition for what happens in the autumn.” Spielman said the scale of the medical and care home crisis meant the focus had been on adults and mostly older adults during the pandemic, and children’s interests had been deferred.  “And yet there’s a really, really big and serious issue here that I would very much like people to be bringing to the forefront of their minds because children’s lives have been disrupted a lot for a long time already.” Earlier, one of her predecessors, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said the government’s failure to plan to get children back to school safely was “absolutely astonishing” and must be remedied before September. Wilshaw, who led Ofsted from 2012 until 2016, said schools will need to put in place recovery programmes, appeal to teachers to run catch-up classes over the summer and even allow some of the most affected to repeat their school year. The government has been criticised by MPs from all parties and unions for lacking a coherent plan, after announcing that primary schools in England would return in June before backtracking this week. Speaking at the No 10 daily press conference, Boris Johnson made a new promise that there would be a “huge amount of catch-up over the summer months”, insisting he would like to be in a position to get all schools back by September. “It’s going to be a big summer of catch-up. We are going to continue to make sure kids get the remedial help that they need,” he said, pledging more details next week. But he acknowledged that the infection rate and new cases were not down far enough to make it safe for schools to operate without social distancing, which means class sizes of 15 and keeping pupils 2 metres apart. Earlier, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, repeatedly accused the government of having no coherent plan for the return of all pupils. “What it required for that to happen was a robust national plan, consensus among all key stakeholders and strong leadership from the top,” Starmer told the Commons. “All three are missing. The current arrangements lie in tatters. Parents have lost confidence in the government’s approach. Millions of children will miss six months’ worth of schooling, and inequality will now go up.” In response, Johnson accused Starmer of inconsistency on the subject, saying Labour had previously suggested the plan to get primary schools fully back in June was going too fast. The government is also facing controversy over its plans for exam results, as teachers’ leaders in England called for GCSEs and A-levels grade boundaries to be relaxed this summer to ensure pupils are not unfairly disadvantaged. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, told MPs on the Commons education committee that the qualifications regulator, Ofqual, should consider relaxing the boundaries so more pupils receive higher grades. “Where there is doubt, somebody should move up a grade mark rather than moving down a grade,” he said, “and that will mean exams are regarded as not having the same rigour as the previous exam series, but I don’t see how else we’re going to get through this.” He made the call following the cancellation of summer exams, which have been replaced by predicted grades based on teacher assessment. There are fears that some groups, including black and minority ethnic pupils, may be penalised unintentionally and will not receive the results they deserve. There are also concerns that exam boards and Ofqual will be inundated with appeals once results are published this summer, and that disadvantaged pupils are less likely to access the appeals system. Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, told MPs that this year’s results should be closely monitored to assess the impact on poorer pupils. “I think the worry is that unintentionally teachers will underestimate, sometimes, the academic potential of poorer pupils, potentially those from black backgrounds, and potentially boys as well.” He said students who leave their revision until the last minute – often boys – and summer-born children were also likely to lose out in a grading system based on teacher assessment. And he suggested universities may need to consider if they should lower their offer to disadvantaged applicants who have faced particularly difficult circumstances during the crisis. Zubaida Haque, the interim director of racial equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, told MPs that the Department for Education had not responded to three letters from the trust calling for the government to ensure BAME pupils were not disadvantaged. MPs were also told there was a “tsunami of anxiety” facing students preparing to sit their exams next summer, having missed so much of the curriculum this year, and continuing uncertainty about what school will look like from next September. Sally Collier, Ofqual’s chief regulator, told MPs that schools and teachers needed to know what the plans were for exams in 2021 as a matter of urgency. “Schools and teachers need to know very quickly, and exam boards, before the summer break ideally, as to what’s going to happen in September.” Separately, a TUC poll of 3,400 women reveals that a quarter of pregnant women say they have faced discrimination at work during the coronavirus outbreak – including being singled out for redundancy or furlough. Of those surveyed, 28% of low-paid pregnant women (earning less than £23,000 a year) had faced discrimination compared with 17% of women on higher salaries.  Pregnant women told the TUC they were required to take sick leave when they were not sick, to take unpaid leave, to start their maternity leave early or to leave the workplace, because their employer did not act to make their workplace safe for them.",education
"Teaching unions and school leaders are to hold talks with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Monday to discuss plans for schools and colleges in England as they start to negotiate the impact of the growing coronavirus emergency. The government has until now resisted pressure to close schools as other countries have done, but there is mounting concern in the sector about how schools will continue to function with growing numbers of staff required to self-isolate. The education secretary is also expected to address concerns about potential disruption to GCSEs and A-levels this summer, amid calls from some to delay examinations until September or even postpone until 2021, which could result in pupils having to repeat the current year. School leaders are also expected to raise concerns about the impact of any potential closures on children in poverty and those who are vulnerable and depend on school for food and security. They will also call for all inspections by Ofsted to be cancelled to allow headteachers to focus on the current emergency. Before the meeting with teachers’ leaders, the government issued updated guidance to schools reiterating its recommendation that they should remain open. The guidance acknowledged, however, that some could be forced to close if too many staff had to self-isolate, causing “operational issues”. The guidance, published by the Department for Education and Public Health England, advises that pupils and staff who develop a continuous cough or fever at school should be sent home. Children who become unwell at school should be isolated while they wait to be collected, ideally in a room behind a closed door with an open window and separate bathroom where possible. Staff dealing with suspected cases of Covid-19 do not need to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves. In most cases, closure would not be needed, the guidance says. “If there is an urgent public health action to take, the educational setting will be contacted by the local Public Health England protection team who will undertake a risk assessment and advise on any actions or precautions that should be taken. “PHE will rarely advise a school to close but this may be necessary if there are so many staff being isolated that the school has operational issues.” Among those due to attend the meeting is Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Speaking before the talks, he said: “School leaders are obviously concerned about the impact on exams and assessments but right now their main priority is keeping children safe. “It’s important that we all work together to do the maximum we can. We will be working jointly with the secretary of state to establish a credible plan for schools and colleges in the coming weeks. “We will use the meeting to bring some clarity and direction. Vulnerable children and families are uppermost in our minds. For some children a day at school is a place of sanctuary and nourishment as well as a place of education.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, who is also due to attend the meeting, added: “The concerns we will be raising with him are the challenges of keeping open schools and colleges when a growing number of staff are away from work because they are self-isolating; the potential for disruption to GCSE and A-levels and what contingencies will be put in place; and how we ensure children in poverty do not go hungry and that vulnerable young people are safeguarded if schools are closed. “We aim to work through these issues in order to arrive at constructive solutions about the way ahead. School and college leaders are showing calm and assured leadership in these difficult times and we can reassure the public that everything that can be done to support young people will be done. On Sunday, Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies, which runs a string of outstanding state schools in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, called on the government to “do the unthinkable” and postpone this summer’s exams immediately, along with Sats tests to be taken by England’s primary school pupils, to save lives during the peak infection period of May to June. “Cancellation is the only sensible and humane option. It will go a long way to ensure the success of the ‘delay’ phase of the government’s strategy. It could save tens of thousands of lives because it will ensure good decision-making, and good decision-making by individuals is central to how we manage this crisis,” Patel said in a comment piece published by the Guardian. The Department for Education confirmed the meeting was taking place, but made no further comment.",education
"Schools will prioritise pupils’ emotional and physical needs when classrooms fully reopen tomorrow, as two major reports warn of a crisis in children’s wellbeing and in the opportunities to play with their friends. Headteachers are planning to devote more time and resources to lessons that support children’s mental and physical health this term, rather than piling on pressure to catch up with academic work. “What’s important off the bat is to get children – especially young children – back used to the routines and the socialisation of schools, and actually give teachers a chance to learn how each child has reacted to what they’ve been through and what’s missing. To move headlong into strategies for catch up and recovery, without understanding that, will be misplaced,” said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers. School leaders will want to prioritise “the whole child” over educational attainment when pupils who have been home-schooling return to their classrooms. “We need to get children ready to learn before we can expect them to learn.” Research by play experts at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Children’s Charity suggests children are experiencing a “play deprivation” crisis due to their inability to play with one another during lockdown. The charity’s report found two-thirds of parents are worried that the impact of the pandemic on their child’s ability to play will have long-term consequences for their child’s wellbeing. One in five say they are “very concerned” about this. Another major report, released today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, reveals that while more than 90% of parents are in favour of at least some “catch-up” academic policies in schools, 83% are also in favour of policies that support pupils’ wellbeing. They want schools to prioritise in-class activities such as art and creative writing, and time outdoors, as well as offering more mental health support, extracurricular activities and unstructured socialisation time. Research, carried out last month by the Parent Ping app, also found the vast majority of parents think there should be an increased focus on socialisation and mental health when home-learners go back to school. James Biddulph, headteacher of the University of Cambridge Primary School, thinks it would be wrong to put pressure on children to catch up. “‘Catch up’ suggests that it’s a competition, that we’re in some kind of frenetic state and need to squash into the next three or four months what children have missed. And if we do that, we’re not attending to what children have really missed,” he said. “We’ve decided we’re going to focus on a reconnecting curriculum that will help children to flourish again.” Over the next three weeks, his pupils will spend less time studying subjects such as history and geography and almost twice as much time as usual doing sport – at least an hour each day. They will also spend double the usual amount of time on lessons that support their emotional wellbeing and socialisation skills, such as singing, music, art and meditation. Academic learning will remain a priority and teachers will assess pupils’ learning loss over lockdown, in order to address this over the summer term. But Biddulph is equally concerned about the way the pandemic has forced many children to spend lots of time indoors and has prevented most from playing with their peers face to face. “I spoke to one parent who told me their child, who is a single child, hasn’t seen another child since January. And that’s just not what childhood’s about.” Laura Walsh, head of play service at GOSH, said the impact of restrictions on children playing cannot be overestimated: “It can be argued that children are experiencing a form of play deprivation at a time when they need the freedom to play more than ever.” In the GOSH study, parents frequently comment on their child’s increased general anxiety and wariness around others, with 64% reporting that their child is missing playing with other children and 59% reporting their child had lost confidence during the pandemic. One parent of a six-year-old in London told the charity: “He feels more insecure when going out to play in the park.” Another parent in the south-east said of their eight-year-old: “Less time playing with other children has made my child more shy and awkward around other people.” Nearly a third of the 6,000 parents surveyed by the IFS said they think it will take a year or more for their child to make up for the pandemic’s effect on their learning, and some fear their child will never recover. Writing for the Observer on theguardian.com on Sunday, the government’s new “catch-up tsar” said the ministers’ recovery plan needs to cover “at least the next three years” and affect the shape of the education system “for a generation”. Kevan Collins, the new education recovery commissioner, writes: “An approach that works will provide academic help, but also offer opportunities for young people to participate in drama, sport, music and social activities – all aspects of education that children have missed out on in the last year.” He added that further investment from the government would be needed to fulfil this goal. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “ Monday will mark a moment of joy for millions of people across the country – from the students going back to class to the teachers who can’t wait to get them back – as young people walk through their school and college gates and are reunited with their friends. “I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been, with some children in class and most at home, but I do know how important it is for all children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their mental health and wellbeing.” It has been almost a year since Ata, 7, who is an only child, has been able to play normally with his friends, says his mother Ayse Kocal-Hove. “He loves playing with other children, being outdoors. So his language changed, his attitude changed.” At one point, during lockdown, he got so “hyper”, she decided to buy him a punching bag to help him vent his frustration. “He was really depressed throughout lockdown,” she said. She is worried about the socialisation skills Ata has missed out on during the pandemic. “What he needs is to be outdoors with friends. He needs to learn to share. He needs to learn how to negotiate [and] get on with people. Children playing together learn so much from each other.”",education
"My wife, Enid Hankins, who has died aged 70 of cancer, was a youth worker and keen champion of adult and lifelong learning. Through her work with the Workers’ Educational Association in Wales and England, and with Estyn (the education and training inspectorate for Wales), she was a consistent advocate of involving people in the evaluation of their own development. Enid was fond of saying that her commitment to social justice was generated by being born in Tredegar, in Blaenau Gwent. The daughter of Samuel Hankins, a pharmacist, and Megan (nee Davies), a domestic science teacher, Enid attended Bedwellty grammar school before doing her teacher training in Llandaff in 1969. She and I met in Corby, Northamptonshire, in 1972, where Enid’s first job was teaching home economics at Hazell Leys secondary school and I was a social worker. Enid’s involvement in the local youth club and in groupwork with deprived children helped develop her interest in community work. She gained further experience in in Leytonstone, east London, before taking a job as a youth centre manager in Felixstowe, Suffolk, and later Bolton Lane youth arts centre in Ipswich. There her role was significant in widening the scope of the centre to include dance, video art and jazz, and in bringing national exhibitions to the town.  In 1985 we moved to Hertfordshire, where Enid combined running Monks Walk youth centre in Welwyn Garden City with co-leading Stevenage Community Arts. We married the following year before heading to Sheffield in 1987. There, Enid co-led the Need to Read project for young adults and Sheffield Youth Arts. Enid’s interests then took us to South Wales in 1989, for her to manage one of three projects that made up the Youth Work in the Valleys apprenticeship scheme, an initiative supporting young adults in gaining formal qualifications. Enid joined WEA Cymru in 1996 as tutor organiser for south-east Wales, eventually becoming regional education manager. She was especially committed to the Somali Women’s community in Newport and worked to bring this outreach into the WEA programme.  She became an Estyn inspector in 2006, looking into adult learning until retiring in 2011.  In retirement on the Isle of Wight, where we had long enjoyed walking holidays, Enid became involved in the work of the Quay Arts Centre, and returned to her lasting commitment to the WEA, acting as volunteer and committee member at local and national levels. She was also a member of Down to the Coast, an environmental group. Avid travellers, Enid and I and enjoyed extended trips worldwide. She particularly liked exploring the different social systems of Guatemala, Costa Rica and Cuba.  She is survived by me, her brothers, Rhys and Glyn, and her sister, Mary.",education
