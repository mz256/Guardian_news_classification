"Margaret Nolan, the actor best known for appearing in the title sequence for Goldfinger and for a string of appearances in TV shows in the 1960s and 70s, has died aged 76. Film-maker Edgar Wright, who directed Nolan in her final film role, in the forthcoming Last Night in Soho, reported the news on social media. Nolan, who was born in 1943 in Somerset, first appeared on film under the name Vicky Kennedy in “glamour” shorts by the then notorious Harrison Marks, appearing in his naturist film It’s a Bare, Bare World. She soon graduated to more mainstream films, with a noticeable role in the Beatles film A Hard Day’s Night (as the girl accompanying Wilfrid Brambell in a casino), and the James Bond film Goldfinger, as the masseuse Dink. Nolan also appeared in Goldfinger’s celebrated title sequence, wearing a gold bikini and with images projected on her skin – though in the film itself it was Shirley Eaton who played Jill Masterson, the girl smothered to death by gold paint. Nolan quickly outgrew her glamour-model beginnings and forged a reputation as a performer of great likability, with small roles in films as varied as Witchfinder General, The Great St Trinian’s Train Robbery, and the Marcel Carné drama Three Rooms in Manhattan. She also began a long association with the Carry On movie series, beginning in 1965 with a role as a secretary in Carry on Cowboy. She would go on to appear in five more, finishing up in 1974 with Carry on Dick. At the same time, Nolan developed a prolific career in TV, with guest roles in a wide variety of programmes, including Spike Milligan’s Q, Budgie, Steptoe and Son, The Persuaders! and Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? After the mid-70s Nolan stepped back from screen acting, but did appear as the dancehall girl Effie in the celebrated TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited in 1981. Nolan went on to develop an interest in visual arts, and her piece My Divided Self – a cut-up collage of her own publicity stills – was included in the feminist exhibition Equals in 2013 in Manchester’s Blankspace gallery. In an interview in 2007, Nolan described her artworks as “the idea that I was there as this passive woman, being looked at, but behind it all, behind my eyes, of course I knew what was going on”. Nolan also became involved in politically inflected theatre in the early 70s, influenced, she said, by her then husband Tom Kempinski’s experience of the 1968 “évènements” in Paris.",film
"In the 90s, everyone had heard the urban myth about black-market organ trading: the story of the poor chump who went to a party and woke up in a bath of ice minus a kidney. Now, with this blackly funny, cheerfully violent bad-taste comedy-horror, director Brea Grant riffs on the legend. Her film is set in 1999 in the ER unit of an Arkansas hospital where one of the nurses, Mandy (Angela Bettis), runs a side hustle in organ trafficking. Whenever a patient who is unlikely to make it is wheeled in, she earmarks them for harvest – and has even been known to nudge victims along with an injection of bleach. Mandy arrives for the night shift dead exhausted. Patients assume that she is overworked, but the truth is that Mandy is addicted to opiates, slipping vials of morphine into her scrubs pocket. She bankrolls her habit with the organ business, working in cahoots with nursing colleague Karen (Nikea Gamby-Turner). Bettis is terrific, beautifully underplaying Mandy’s bone-dry sense of humour: she is openly contemptuous of patients and their families, rolls her eyes at colleagues and refreshingly has zero anxiety to please. And while she may bump off the odd patient, she is also highly competent. She is not, however, a criminal mastermind. Things go seriously wrong when Mandy recruits her cousin, textbook airhead blonde Regina (Chloe Farnworth), who botches a kidney pick-up. After misplacing the organ, Regina puts on a nurse’s uniform and decides to find another patient to kill. It’s a throwaway film that perhaps I shouldn’t have enjoyed as much as I did, but Mandy is such a deliciously sour character.",film
"When T’Nia Miller first told her mother that she was dating a woman, she explained to her mum that she wasn’t there to see her have sex with men, so this was no different. “It’s just about me having really good friendships and beauty in my life,” she recalls saying. “That was it. We never had more of a conversation than that. If she had any issues, they were hers to deal with, not mine. She knew that. She’s a very educated, very well-read woman. For her, coming to terms with it was easy.” The east-London born actor is telling me this story over the phone as she walks her dog (she forgot about the interview and her seven-month-old pomeranian, Dilhi, needed his daily steps) because she’s taking part in the #YoungerMe campaign, an initiative by the LGBTQ+ young persons organisation Just Like Us, which asks how LGBTQ+ inclusive education would have helped older queer people when they were in school. “With my ‘coming out story’, I was very much supported by my family,” she continues, “but there are many children that aren’t. I know as a black actor what it meant to see people like me on the screen, and I think that’s exactly the same when it comes to sexuality and how we identify. That’s why Just Like Us is so important. It helps forge those intergenerational connections.” Miller says that she had “no exposure, no knowledge, nada” of LGBTQ+ issues growing up. “I’d never seen a queer person on TV and I didn’t know any queer people at all until I got to college. I used to travel from the East End to go to college in Notting Hill and that’s where I met my first queer family, as it were; people who were a little bit different than the social circle I was used to mixing with. My God, it was refreshing.” In fact, she kept her sexuality hidden until her early 20s. “I have Jamaican heritage. I love reggae music and I used to listen to a lot of bashment as a kid,” she says. “That scene, at the time, didn’t support me being queer. Although such views weren’t present in my family, in the wider society there was a shame shrouded on it, so I sort of denied it and pushed it back.” Ultimately, she ended up marrying a man and having children, “but by the time he started being an arsehole I realised: I have two kids, I’m a little older and I don’t give a shit about social pressure, so I’m going to start dating women. It was really that simple.” Miller has never been one for conventionality. While she followed a fairly traditional route of studying theatre at college and gaining a place at Guildford School of Acting, she arrived at university in her early 20s divorced, with two kids and a mortgage. She also refused to succumb to the tactics employed by the institution to break down its students so they can build them up into actors. “You go to drama school and you think these people are gods,” Miller says. “You feel very fortunate to be there and you believe these people. You’re young and impressionable. Yes, I had two kids, but I was under the age of 23. I was a baby who had babies. The difference is that I wasn’t going to cry and break down because, damn, I had already lived. That shit wasn’t going to get to me and that was a point of contention.” She recalls one horrific experience with a member of staff on her first day, who told her that she was lucky to be there as there were no good black actors in the industry. “Of course, we got into a back-and-forth. It wasn’t an argument, per se, but that’s that the moment I went, fuck, I’m back here …” she says. “You’re in an institution that doesn’t recognise you and minimises your experiences.” Does she feel like it was personal bias from the teachers or the institution itself that was racist? “I don’t think there’s a difference. The institution is not hiring the right people. Institutions are made up of people and policymakers. There was obviously personal bias among the teachers, but there were some beautiful teachers as well. It is about the texts and what is studied, and the parts that you’re cast in, if there is even a part for you because you have a darker hue. It’s down to the teachers who make the lesson plans to think about these things.” Thankfully, she says this isn’t something that she has encountered in her professional life. After finishing drama school, she graduated to small roles on shows such as The Bill and Holby City, finding meatier parts in Channel 4’s Dubplate Drama, an interactive series about a teenage grime MC, and, later, the groundbreaking queer film Stud Life, which was directed and written by Campbell X. In the latter, Miller played JJ, a masculine-presenting black lesbian working as a wedding photographer. “Campbell X made us do this method-acting thing,” she says of the role. “For three weeks we had rehearsals, and so I bound [my chest], packed and walked in that body. Sometimes I was mistaken for a young black boy and I got to understand my son more.” However, Miller was careful to avoid getting pigeonholed into the “queer actor” box, just as she was about taking on any roles that perpetuated a derogatory narrative about black people. “You always have choice,” she says. “I think that’s really important, otherwise I would have done so many things and my career would look very different. But when I first signed with my agent, I said: ‘I’m not prepared to play the stereotypical council estate prostitute single-parent mother.’ I am a single parent, but I wasn’t prepared to play those roles.” Miller has played police officers in her career, though “It’s weird as I don’t like the police,” she says. Does she feel differently about those roles now after the Black Lives Matter protests this year? “I look at them the same way. It was a role and I liked the role. Do I believe in the establishment as it is? No, I do not. Do I like the police? Not particularly. But if the script and character are good, and there’s an integrity in the story then yes, I’d play those roles again.” In previous interviews she has said that she has played characters that felt “whitewashed” – “just look at my CV; you can see them there,” she says – but even then, “it’s about what you, as the actor, bring to the part”. When she’s working with someone such as Russell T Davies, with whom Miller has collaborated twice, most recently on the dystopian drama Years & Years, she doesn’t have those issues. “He listens and he’s patient and he’s funny,” Miller says of Davies. “He takes the time and is invested in people. Also, we talk about people using their white privilege for good – he’s an amazing example of that. It’s about having conversations with the producers and the writers. Working with Russell, I was able to do that.” Her most recent role, as Hannah Grose in Netflix’s horror series The Haunting of Bly Manor, also provided the opportunity to tell a queer story that wasn’t centred around coming-out narratives, of which Miller is bored. “We had that lesbian love story and it was just a given,” she says. “I think we’re seeing that more in programming and that pleases me. That’s where it needs to be headed. What I will say is that we need more of it and more differently able-bodied people and different races.” Miller is aware of casting directors and agents having “difficult conversations” about inclusion, although she remains cautious about how change is brought about. “If the response is to just stick a load of black people on the screen, then that’s not really doing the job, in my opinion. It has to be behind the camera and in front of camera. It’s not just black people, too. Don’t think that you’ve filled your diversity quota by just sticking a black person in one of those roles. There are so many people to consider and until that happens, we’re not there yet.” The pandemic hasn’t helped, of course, and Miller says that it’s been hard to gauge whether any of the progress being discussed has actually been implemented. “I think that’s a longer journey,” she says. “Not too long, but I think it’s going to take a while to really find out.” 2020 hasn’t been a washout, though. Career wise, Miller has just returned from Spain where she has been shooting Spanish-Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar’s series La Fortuna, which also stars Stanley Tucci and Clarke Peters, star of The Wire. And Miller believes that without the pandemic, the spotlight on this summer’s Black Lives Matter protests wouldn’t have been so bright. “There has been a global social justice movement, which has never happened,” she says. “That’s the beauty of this year. Also, I got to spend three months in the sun. That was brilliant.”",film
"In 2013, French documentary-maker Thomas Balmès made a film called Happiness, about an eight-year-old monk called Peyangki in the remote Himalayan village of Laya in Bhutan – and how this boy was responding to the astounding novelties of TV and the internet. Now seven years later, Balmès has returned to Laya and to Peyangki, who has grown to young adulthood in this brave new digital world. What Balmès has chanced upon now are not simply more instances of how the web has opened or closed that innocent mind: he gives us a sad and sombre love story from the globalised 21st century. Basically, Peyangki is now regularly neglecting his religious studies and is addicted to his smartphone and to the web, though arguably no more so than any other young person in the developed world. And in particular he is into the Chinese video service WeChat, through which he is regularly talking to a woman called Ugyen, apparently a bar hostess in Bhutan’s capital, Thimphu, who sings songs for him. Eventually, the two meet in the big city: Ugyen clearly didn’t quite grasp that he was so young and a trainee monk (rather than a possibly well-off farmer, which she assumed from his stories about collecting and selling mushrooms). And he didn’t realise that she had a small child and is, in any case, thinking of quitting the country for two years to do domestic work in Kuwait. It is a subdued film, and watching it is like continuously walking up a slight gradient. Balmès has subtly guided the stories of his two principals, though the setup is occasionally a little uncomfortable, as when the monk’s master tells Peyangki’s friend to search for him in the city. A thoughtful portrait of separate lives and destinies.",film
"It’s been a tough year, hasn’t it folks – with horrific bushfires, a global pandemic and the continued existence of Pete Evans. To say the spread of coronavirus has affected the worldwide movie industry is of course something of an understatement. The pandemic is acting as a great accelerant, fastening pre-existing trends towards a streaming-centric industry. The Australian film industry is more practised at being resilient than Hollywood, with homegrown productions battling for audiences at the best of times. This year they more than held their own, delivering plenty of fine works in a wide range of genres. Here are the 10 best Australian features from 2020, all receiving a local theatrical or streaming release (outside of film festivals) during the calendar year. There’s lots of talking in writer/director Serhat Caradee’s Sydney-set family drama, with almost the entire first act consisting of a single dialogue scene in the back of a car. Jamal (Tyler De Nawi) is the black sheep of his family, to say the least, secretly returning home to Sydney’s western suburbs to visit his dying mother after joining Islamic State in Syria. The radicalised Jamal engages in long and tense debates with his kith and kin, during skilfully constructed dialogue exchanges that toss around big discussions about motivations people have for joining groups like Isis. The pangs of pain and betrayal are never far from the surface, with a baffled and heartbroken family unable to separate the personal and the political. Big, bright, juicy colours dominate the mise en scene of director John Sheedy’s H is for Happiness . A vibrant aesthetic for a coming-of-age film about a very perky pipsqueak – the cherub-faced 12-year-old Candice (played charmingly by Daisy Axon). Candice becomes besties with the new boy at school, a potential love interest named Douglas (Wesley Patten), whose full name according to her is “Douglas Benson from Another Dimension”. The question of whether Douglas is indeed from another dimension is one of the subjects pondered in this sweet, nuanced and lovingly textured film, peppered with various Wes Andersonisms and coated in that beautiful, radiant, rainbow look. I’m tempted to say you don’t see films like Hot Mess much anymore: a nano budget character-oriented drama that turns scruffy aesthetics and pared-back production values into virtues. But in truth we didn’t see these films much before either. Sarah Gaul is utterly authentic as 20-something aspiring playwright Loz, who has a tenure at a small Sydney theatre (I used to live around the corner!) and struggles to balance her workload and love life. Writer/director Lucy Coleman brings a plucky spirit that reminded me of other spritzy dramedies from cash-strapped Australian film-makers – such as Love and Other Catastrophes, All My Friends are Leaving Brisbane and That’s Not Me. Hot Mess had a small number of event-based screenings in cinemas last year but didn’t receive a proper release until landing on Netflix in October. In Christiaan Van Vuuren’s feature film directorial debut, the camera is in on the joke; it probes the space for laughs. A Sunburnt Christmas is Bad Santa crossed with the 1987 Australian family movie Bushfire Moon, following an on-the-run-criminal (Daniel Henshall) who arrives at a tinder-dry farm in the middle of nowhere, recruiting a couple of children (Lena Nankivell and Eadan McGuinness) who believes he is Santa Claus to help him find stolen money hidden somewhere on the property. It’s cute, warm-spirited, very entertaining and not short on attitude and sass. Van Vuuren presents a unified approach to comedy, from script to performance and cinematography, bundling everything together to land the jokes. When the sentimental stuff eventually arrives, it’s well-earned and satisfying. The director Catherine Dwyer’s fist-pumping documentary about the women’s liberation movement in Australia during the 60s and 70s is one of those films that makes you want to take to the streets. The focus is on second wave feminists who saw a window for change and fought tooth and nail for it. Dwyer blends talking heads, photographs, posters, archival footage, music and more with momentum, capturing the movement’s energy. Many interesting discussions are raised, such as whether the activists ought to work within the system or try to rip it down: that age-old, important debate about reform versus revolution. Director Jeremy Sims’ remake of the excellent 2015 Icelandic drama of the same name stars Sam Neill and Michael Caton as brothers and neighbouring sheep farmers who haven’t spoken to each other in years. It is a very thoughtful drama about masculinity, isolation, long-held familial grievances and, erm, that annoying yobbo redneck who happens to be your brother. Caton is the belligerent drunk and Neill the more sedate and sensible of the pair. Both react in different ways to the compulsory culling of their prized cattle following the spread of a terrible disease. What at first feels like a simple film grows increasingly nuanced, buoyed by a gentle but profound tone and temperament. David Wenham’s career is ageing like fine wine or malted whisky, the actor exuding gravitas as a pasty-faced gold thief who teams up with an Afghan cameleer (Ahmad Malek). But fine wine and whisky sound a tad too gentle on the palette, given his gritty and gravelly portrayal in writer/director Roderick MacKay’s commandingly styled western. Is it possible to age like fine ... rocket fuel? The Furnace is another reminder that the Australian or “meat pie” western is alive, well and packing heat, adding to the genre’s very impressive recent titles – including Warwick Thornton’s Sweet Country and Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale. Its focus on ethnic minority communities (including Chinese immigrants and Islamic, Sikh and Hindu cameleers) suggests there are many more stories to tell and histories to revisit. You know Leigh Whannell’s second feature as a director – a US/Australia co-production, like his terrific previous film Upgrade – is working on bizarrely good levels when you can sense the titular character on the frame, despite no human actor being there, and anticipate with utter dread his next move. Every Invisible Man movie has involved dodgy men and their use of the sleaziest of all superpowers, from Claude Rains’ flaky scientist in the 1933 original to Chevy Chase’s yuppie stock analyst in 1992’s Memoirs of an Invisible Man. This time things are decidedly different, with Whannell washing away the B movie tropes to configure a thrilling drama about domestic violence and the terror of living with an abusive partner. A wonderful performance by Elisabeth Moss further elevates already powerful material as the terrorised protagonist Cecilia. Time makes monsters of us all is, broadly speaking, what I think director Natalie Erika James is getting at in her mysterious and big-thinking rumination on womanhood, family and dementia, which dabbles in the visual language and atmospheric framework of a horror movie. A deteriorating elderly lady, Edna (Robyn Nevin) is losing her grip on her memories and her mind – possibly also on her relationship with her daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote). Presented with a musty and sticky veneer, creating the impression that moss may be growing in the spaces between pixels, James finds various ways to reiterate in visual terms the key theme of the passing of time – from visions of an overgrown tennis court to mouldy produce in a fruit bowl. All the performances are great and the film is weirdly and intensely effective, yanking the heartstrings while delivering the collywobbles. When I interviewed George MacKay, who plays Ned Kelly in Justin Kurzel’s brilliantly bold and punkish film, the actor spoke about the famous bush outlaw using words that have stayed in my mind ever since – describing him as “a man who became, in the end, a fridge magnet”. Re-teaming with Snowtown scribe Shaun Grant and adapting Peter Carey’s best-selling novel, Kurzel’s thrillingly cerebral exercise positions the iconoclastic historical figure inside pop culture’s infinite cycle: less a hero or a villain than, indeed, a future fridge magnet, doomed to be reduced by his own destiny. The dialogue is strewn with lines reminding us the film is about the loss of life to legend and man to myth; also of history as an endless process of reinvention, ever-informed by the mores of the present. The drama gains velocity as it tumbles forward to the shootout at Glenrowan – a stunning sequence that paints in electric prose the film’s feverish meta qualities.",film
"As a child in 1960s east Harlem, documentary film-maker Sam Pollard was “profoundly touched” by two events. The assassination of John F Kennedy, in 1963, when Pollard was in junior high school. Then, five years later, the murder of Martin Luther King.  Yet as he grew up, Pollard found his memory of those events softening round the edges. “You think back and try to remember how you reacted to everything going on, particularly the March on Washington, and it all swirls around in your head,” he says. “Some things get lost. You think: ‘Wow, was that really happening?’ It’s history, but not so long ago that I can’t remember it.” That is as good an explanation as any for why someone would pursue a career in archival nonfiction cinema. For Pollard – a veteran documentarian who was nominated for an Oscar for 1997’s 4 Little Girls, about the 1963 murder of black children at a Baptist church by the Ku Klux Klan – it is also the rationale behind his new feature, MLK/FBI. The film aims to clarify and remind, looking not only at the complicated legacy of a civil rights leader who is all but enshrined as a saint, but also at the culture of federal law enforcement hostile to him and his cause. As opposing entities cloaked in nostalgia and ideology that must be peeled back to get at the truth, it is impossible to understand one without the other, Pollard believes. “I thought it could be another way to look at Dr King, and another way to break down the mythology of the FBI,” he says. “This was an opportunity to interrogate the images they’d made for themselves, and for each other.” David Garrow’s eye-popping book The FBI and Martin Luther King, Jr: From ‘Solo’ to Memphis provided what the director calls “the framework that became the genesis of the film”. Together, Pollard and Garrow expanded the research, filing countless freedom of information requests to access once-classified FBI documents. “It’s actually not that difficult to get material from the FBI,” Pollard says with a half-laugh. “It’s just that once you do, there are always a lot of redactions in it. What will be key are the actual audiotapes that will come out in 2027. But we were still able to piece together a lot from other transcripts about how they tried to discredit Dr King.” The tapes Pollard mentions, set for release later this decade by a 1977 court order, contain the recordings that J Edgar Hoover’s FBI surreptitiously collected through years of covert surveillance on King and his associates. The constant invasions of privacy were just one plank in a wider campaign of harassment recounted in granular detail throughout the film via pristinely preserved footage and audio. While the Bureau cultivated a fanbase through adulatory portrayals in an officially sanctioned TV series and films such as Walk a Crooked Mile and The FBI Story, it did everything in its power to undermine and defame King. His progressivism so threatened its status quo that agents sent King’s wife, Coretta, a tape of her husband allegedly conducting an extramarital affair, along with a note exhorting him to kill himself for the good of his movement. Pollard takes a nuanced stance, laying bare the injustice without excusing King’s indiscretions. “I think the thing that’s fascinating about this material is its understanding that Dr King was a human being,” he says. “He’s put forward as an iconic presence, but I felt strongly that we wanted to represent him in a more complex way. He was a man, and like many of us, multitasking. He was leading the struggle, while dealing with his personal life and its baggage. He was wrestling with the choice to speak out against Vietnam, and the backlash he received from that. He was dealing with the knowledge that he and his associates were being constantly watched by the FBI, which also took its toll on him.” The film shows King in repose, around the house and at the dinner table and surrounded by family; humanising looks at a larger-than-life figure. But Pollard also engages with his subject intellectually, connecting his beliefs about protest to a US that, to this day, is fraught with racial tensions, as sentiments critical of police grow more widespread. Although King urged non-violence, a talking point centrists love to trot out as a counter to more radical demonstrations, he also said that a riot is the language of the unheard. “Dr King makes a TV appearance,” Pollard says, “and the woman asks him: ‘Don’t you think your protests are causing the violence in these cities?’ The reality is when peaceful social protests happen, we’re saying that we want change and we’re willing to request that in a passive way. But there are people in America angrier than that who can’t take it. With enough systemic racism, people say enough is enough, then looting or burning is just what happens. Peaceful protests don’t lead to it. It’s a reaction. The death of George Floyd leads to it. The death of Breonna Taylor leads to it … What do you expect, when someone’s got their foot on your neck for hundreds of years?” The film posits that in his wariness of authority and his commitment to equality, King would have been more attuned to the world of 2020 than most in his day. But Pollard harbours no illusions about the man’s character, and how it might be received in an era increasingly harsh about personal failings. One of MLK/FBI’s major themes is the ease with which a man’s personal life can be turned against him, a practice that has been all but mainstreamed in the years since King’s death. Between the heightened moral standards in activism and the reactionaries still raging against everything he fought for, he would be under the same ethical microscope. “Unless he could have adapted to the time,” says Pollard, “he’d have been ripped to shreds, man,. Eaten alive.”",film
"It is a lonely business, being a Tom Cruise fan in 2020. The heel lifts, the way his arms pump when he runs (nobody runs like Tom Cruise), his Dorian Gray looks: I love Cruise for all of it, and yet I’m aware this is a deeply unfashionable opinion, and one I’m often called on to defend at dinner parties. And so it befalls me, as Cruise’s solitary champion, to step to his aid now, like Ethan Hunt in a tuxedo taking on a posse of earpiece-wearing hitmen, as behind him an orchestra plays Nessun Dorma. Earlier this week, The Sun released leaked audio of Cruise berating the crew of Mission: Impossible 7, which is filming at the Warner Bros Studio in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, for breaking Covid safety protocols. “If I see you do it again,” yelled Cruise at two crew members he’d spotted standing within two metres of each other, “you’re fucking gone. And if anyone in this crew does it, that’s it – and you too, and you too. And you, don’t you ever fucking do it again.” Cruise, who is producing and starring in the blockbuster, went on: “I’m on the phone with every fucking studio at night! Insurance companies! Producers! And they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies. We are creating thousands of jobs you motherfuckers! I don’t ever want to see it again. Ever! And if you don’t do it, you’re fired. No apologies. You can tell it to the people who are losing their fucking homes, because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education. That’s what I sleep with every night – the future of this fucking industry!” Clearly Cruise lost his temper, and it was wrong for him to shout at the crew. But – and this is a pretty colossal but – Cruise is under a phenomenal amount of pressure right now, the sort of pressure that would get to anyone, even Hollywood megastars who audition their future girlfriends on private jets. Listening to the rant, what I heard was not a tyrannical producer who likes to bully his subordinates out of a sense of personal vindictiveness, but a man under a near-inhuman amount of stress. Although he used profane language, Cruise wasn’t derogatory: he didn’t call the crew morons, or scream personal insults. This wasn’t a racist or sexist rant: it was a stern telling-off from someone who goes to bed at night worrying about the hundreds of people whose jobs rely upon him. When Cruise spoke about spending every evening on the phone to insurance companies, trying to keep the Mission: Impossible 7 set running, I felt sorry for him. The actor George Clooney, himself a director and producer, defended Cruise after the story broke. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show, Clooney said: “He [Cruise] didn’t overreact, because it [breaking safety protocols] is a problem … [He’s] in a position of power and it’s tricky, right?” Clooney added: “If production goes down, a lot of people lose their jobs. People have to understand that and be responsible.” Running a film set in the middle of a global pandemic makes rappelling down the Burj Khalifa (Cruise’s most famous stunt) look a breeze – I know which one I’d rather do, and I’m terrified of heights. Hardly any movies are filming right now, because it’s simply too expensive: the chances that one of the hundreds of people on set will contract Covid at some point, causing production to shut down, are too high. Every day a set is closed costs producers tens of thousands of pounds. As Cruise rightly observed during his rant: “People who are losing their fucking homes, because our industry is shut down.” Industry bible Variety estimates that 465,000 people were out of work in Hollywood this year, owing to Covid; in the UK, the figure was estimated at around 50,000. In addition to these woes, Hollywood is reckoning with the existential challenge posed by streaming platforms, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. In a sign of which way the wind is blowing, WarnerMedia recently released its entire 2021 film slate to streaming services, to the consternation of The Suicide Squad director James Gunn, and Tenet director Christopher Nolan. It’s only through Cruise’s superhuman will power, deep pockets, and personal clout that the Mission: Impossible 7 set is even running at all. Cruise reportedly shelled out £500,000 of his own money for two cruise ships to house workers safely during filming. “Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups,” a source explained at the time to the Sun. In addition to keeping the Mission: Impossible 7 set going – providing employment to hundreds of people – Cruise has also been generous in support of other directors. In August 2020, he filmed himself attending Tenet at the Waterloo Imax in London, to reassure people that cinemagoing was safe. (Looking very fetching in a tight black jumper and colour-coordinated respirator mask as he did – only Cruise could make PPE look so manly.) Before, Cruise has urged audiences to turn off the “motion smoothing” on their TV sets. (While he was in his Top Gun costume – I swooned.) Motion smoothing is a technique used to improve the quality of high-definition sport, which is now increasingly offered as standard in high-definition TV sets. It makes films look rubbish: naff, and like soap operas. Cruise is an old-school movie star, in the best possible way, and he wants to preserve the magic of cinema as an experience, even if audiences are watching his films at home, in their pants, on their brand-new tellies. Because if Tom Cruise is going to hang off a cargo plane while it takes off for your entertainment, the least you can do is fix the settings on your TV. Cruise is, by all accounts, not a systematic bully. He does not usually tyrannise his crew. Few negative stories emerge about his conduct on set. Brett Ratner, he is not. Cruise can be challenging to work with – he is famously a perfectionist, as tough on himself as he is on others – but he is not cruel. Speaking to Vulture last July, his former co-star in Mission: Impossible 2, Thandie Newton, recounted an experience in which Cruise asked her to reshoot a scene dozens of times, because he wasn’t happy with her performance. “It was a real shame,” Newton says, “and bless him … because he was trying his damnedest.” Newton said that Cruise “tries super-hard to be a nice person. But the pressure – he takes on a lot.” If you’re looking for a person who’s singlehandedly trying to save a movie business that’s on its knees, gun pointed at its head, Cruise is your man. But every man has his limits, and it seems that Cruise has finally found his. And who could blame him? Making a film during Covid – that’s mission impossible. Even Ethan Hunt has a breaking point.",film
"Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó deserves our thanks for going somewhere very few film-makers want to go: out on a limb. Many a time, his neck has been risked and his arm has been chanced; he makes movies to challenge us. White God (2014) was a Hitchcockian nightmare about a mass uprising among all the dogs in a city, and Jupiter’s Mood (2017) was a fantasy superhero-parable about a Syrian refugee who gets the ability to fly after being shot by an immigration cop.Most of his movies have been set in Hungary, but this new drama, scripted by Kata Wéber (who also wrote White God and Jupiter’s Moon), is his first English-language film, set in an indeterminate American city (but filmed in Quebec). It’s a vehement, forthright and sometimes unwatchably painful and upsetting emotional drama about the death of a baby; his two stars, Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf, are at all times giving it upwards of 10,000%, especially Kirby. This is clearly a personally engaged film for its creators; I wanted to admire it and in a sense I do. But there is something self-conscious and hammily plotted about it, once we have got past the real-time ordeal of its terrifying opening scene. There are times when a North American transplant of this European director is unconvincing, and the central situation itself is like a pop-art image rather than the impassioned real thing. We are uncomfortably close to Lars von Trier territory, or maybe Atom Egoyan at his most prescriptive. Sean (LaBeouf) is a builder working on a bridge whose construction we see very symbolically being completed throughout the drama. He is a rough-around-the-edges, blue-collar kind of guy, but his pregnant partner, Martha (Kirby), comes from a posher background. Her ageing mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), is a tough woman of Hungarian Jewish background who as a baby escaped the Holocaust, and is now in the first stages of dementia. She disapproves of the oafish Sean and is not so subtly dismayed by the fact of the pregnancy that appears to make his unfortunate union with her daughter permanent. She has also irritated Sean by insisting on buying the couple a pricey family-type people carrier, through the good offices of her car-dealer son-in-law Chris (played by director and actor Benny Safdie).The moment of birth arrives, and with it a well-meaning midwife called Eva (Molly Parker), a last-minute replacement for one they wanted, but who earnestly takes on board Martha’s desire to have her baby at home. Tragedy strikes like a bolt of lightning, and Kirby shows how Martha goes into a state of shock and unprocessed rage and horror. The film persuasively and sympathetically shows how Sean thinks her decisions after the tragedy amount to an act of self-harm that she will regret, and also depicted how this terrible event has raked up all Elizabeth’s agonised thoughts about what it takes to survive.But the film also gets bogged down in a lot of frankly inauthentic, silly and jarring plot points involving the existence of Martha’s cousin, a fierce lawyer called Suzanne whom Elizabeth wants to fight for a prosecution and also for compensation: she is played by Sarah Snook (Shiv, from TV’s Succession). This character is sketchily imagined, and the legal case and its courtroom technicalities aren’t convincing.The movie is at its very best at the (agonising) beginning and also, maybe, at the very end with its enigmatic, almost dream-like scene centred around an apple tree. The physicality of that opening, harrowing sequence is strongly managed: it has drama and compassion. (Interestingly, Susie Orbach is credited as a “technical expert”.) But as for everything in the middle – the people on the screen and their relationships look like high-flown imaginings, far from real life. The film is like an intensively bred hothouse flower that can’t exist in the open air.",film
"Musa Hadid is the popular Palestinian mayor of Ramallah in the West Bank, and this thoughtful, sympathetic documentary tracks his stressful day-to-day working life – shown suddenly getting a lot more stressful in 2017 when President Trump announced his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. Hadid feels strongly that this move emboldened Israel’s military to be more menacing in Ramallah, with soldiers marching into stores and demanding to see security camera footage on the grounds that there could be images of terrorists – and even doing the same at city hall. The film lets you appreciate Hadid’s delicate and complex situation. He is often receiving high-profile international visitors and relishes the opportunity to show off the city he loves – the opening and closing sequences of this film, incidentally, almost feel like the introduction to Woody Allen’s Manhattan. One such VIP is Prince William, though some of Hadid’s colleagues are less than happy: “All the problems of our country come from Britain!” says one, referring to the 1923 Mandate. Hadid is evidently irritated by some foreigners (such as a German delegation) who lecture him about the compromises necessary on both sides, implying an equivalence, and annoyed also that such events always come as a “balancing” of a visit to Israel. The boost for Ramallah, though gratifying in some ways, might also mean that the world might gradually come to think that it is the natural capital of Palestine, and Jerusalem the capital of Israel – though this is very far from what Palestinians want. And all the time the normal municipal problems have to be sorted out. Hadid is shown as touchingly enamoured of the impressive Vegas-style fountain display outside City Hall.",film
"This telephonically themed horror film, set in nameless American suburbia circa 1987, is not to be confused with the Korean horror film of the same name that also came out this year (and relies crucially on a landline call). This confection is a fairly shonky assemblage of tired tropes, full of dropped connections and annoying static. Its biggest virtue is that it contains another gamey, and game-for-anything, performance from horror-film matriarch Lin Shaye. Shaye has played spooky ladies in scads of scary films, such as the Insidious franchise and lesser known fare such as the enticingly titled Helen Keller vs Nightwolves. Here she is Edith Cranston, a former schoolteacher who has been a raving mess since being blamed for the death of one of her pupils (although never convicted of the murder). Nevertheless, a gaggle of teenagers, including Tonya (Erin Sanders), older sister of the murdered child, has persisted in taunting, teasing, playing pranks and bullying Edith for years. When Tonya and new kid in town Chris (Chester Rushing), along with brothers Brett (Sloane Morgan Siegel) and Zack (Mike Manning), finally push Cranston too far, she kills herself. But her husband Edward (Tobin Bell) summons the high-school seniors back to the house with a strange proposition: if they make a phone call on a decrepit old princess phone, ostensibly to a handset installed in Edith’s grave, and stay on the line for just one minute, they’ll each earn a substantial inheritance. Being teens in an American horror film, the kids are too stupid and greedy to twig this is a terrible idea. Traumatic flashbacks, mangled corpses with gymnastic abilities and blood-splattered undead apparitions soon ensue. One might posit a subtextual interpretation that the youth of today, reared on mobiles, are so unaccustomed to landlines that they see these once ubiquitous household fixtures simply as conveyances for transmitting evil.",film
"If ever you had the idea there was something bohemian or glamorous or Bukowskian about drinking in a Las Vegas bar … then this movie will wise you right up. It’s a docu-realist fiction about a seedy place called The Roaring 20s, in Las Vegas, which is about to close for good. (The films was actually shot at a place called The Roaring 20s in New Orleans, which is still open for business, but maybe there’s something about the desolation and melancholy in a bar that makes every closing time feel like the last closing time ever.) The film-makers got the barflies present, with one professional actor in the mix, to improvise over a long day’s journey into night and the following day, while doing real drinking and apparently dropping real acid. This isn’t actually as spectacular as they have might have expected; it leads only to a belligerent near-fight. The result is sometimes heart-rending and sometimes hilarious. One desolate guy announces: “I pride myself on only having become an alcoholic after I became a failure.” He also explains something of his backstory: “I overslept one morning and the bottom fell out of manufacturing.” Meanwhile, the boozing and the boasting and meaningless slurred arguments continue, to the soundtrack of Michael Jackson, Patsy Cline and Kenny Rogers’ The Gambler (twice). A beyond-drunk woman called Pam seated at the bar terrifyingly hoists up her top and announces proudly: “Look! Sixty-year-old titties!” The man next to her gallantly remarks that they are “higher than some men’s nutsack” – to which she responds: “I once divorced a man because his nutsack hung down lower than his dick.” If only TS Eliot could have got his pub-going “sweet ladies” in The Waste Land to say anything half as resonant as that. This is a fascinating slice of Americana which reminded me of 70s movie-making, like John Huston’s Fat City. I half-expected young Stacy Keach and Jeff Bridges to roll in for a few whiskies.",film
"One Night in Miami is a fluent, high-minded, if sometimes slightly inert movie, with an invigorating interest in ideas and debate – and it begins with a brutally effective sucker-punch of racism from the Jim Crow/antebellum world. Regina King directs with flair, working from the script that Kemp Powers (co-director of Pixar’s Soul) has adapted from his own stage play. This is a Stoppardian high-concept display, imagining the conversation of four legendary African Americans who really did come together in Miami in 1964 after the boxing victory of Cassius Clay (as he then was) over Sonny Liston. The world is about to change, and they are ringside.Eli Goree plays Clay, euphoric and slightly terrified by his own emerging greatness; Kingsley Ben-Adir is Malcolm X, keen to nail down Clay’s private promises to convert to Islam; Aldis Hodge is Jim Brown, the NFL megastar thinking of going into the movies; and Leslie Odom Jr is soul singer Sam Cooke, under fire for going along with the white music establishment. The movie puts them all in the same motel room – Malcolm X’s – and this is to be, to quote the Hamilton musical, the room where it happens; or at any rate, where what’s going to happen gets talked about. (Without comment, King lets us absorb the faint echo of the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in 1968.) Meanwhile, wives and children get distractedly phoned up, but women themselves are absent from the action and debate. Chiefly at stake is the world of Malcolm X, about to break away and start his own organisation, and so tensely aware that claiming Clay as a prestige convert would be of enormous help. Clay is suddenly unsure if abandoning all that delicious secular pleasure is what he wants to do. Brown feels sports have got him just as far as they’re going to, and that maybe he can cash in his celebrity capital and transfer it to the movies. Cooke angrily defends his own career, proclaiming the real black power of his lucrative music publishing empire.One exchange between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke rang a little false for me. Cooke has just told them how the Rolling Stones have covered a tune written by his contracted protege Bobby Womack: It’s All Over Now, doing far better with it than any black star. Then Malcolm X tauntingly asks him how it is that Bob Dylan can make the kind of chart-topping protest music that black people should be doing. Well, the obvious answer is – because Dylan is white. Hasn’t Cooke already explained this? Hasn’t he given him the example of Bobby Womack and the Rolling Stones recording the same song? But Cooke and the movie itself are weirdly reluctant to spell it out, perhaps because Dylan is another icon-ally on the right side of history. At any rate, it’s an engaging and spirited piece of work.",film
"For his children’s films, Robert Rodriguez long ago established his own style in strip-cartoon type graphics, garish colour schemes and affordable digital effects – notably with the genuinely likable and now almost 20-year-old gem, Spy Kids, which starred Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. But since then, his line in family movies has felt visually wearing, hectoring and pretty flat, without much in the way of a funny script. This new one pops thinly like day-old bubblegum, with the same lack of anything satisfying or nutritious. It is a sequel to his entirely disposable 2005 kids’ film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, which felt like he had knocked it out in a month in his edit suite. This follow-up isn’t quite as insufferable, but it has the same tendency to confuse hyperactivity with energy, and that reference to David Bowie in the title is not earned, unless we’re talking about turning into a type of chocolate assortment. Taylor Dooley returns as Lavagirl, but Taylor Lautner, the original Sharkboy, was apparently not available for this movie, so his character is now behind a mask. These characters are only cameos anyway. Now it is all about the new tween generation, the wacky, moody kids of the superheroes, particularly Missy Moreno (YaYa Gosselin), who is the daughter of Marcus Moreno (The Mandolarian’s Pedro Pascal – also appearing as a supervillain in Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman 1984). She and a bunch of other Gen Z contemporaries find themselves cooped up in a creche-style school classroom in the grownup superheroes’ HQ, presided over by the stern Ms Granada (Priyanka Chopra) until they realise they have to save the world against an alien invasion. This is pretty ho-hum stuff, but it could keep very young kids quiet over a lockdown Christmas.",film
"This typically ambitious Pixar animation comes on like a fever-dream cross between Disney’s Fantasia and Powell and Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death, with a bizarre hint of Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones thrown in for good measure. A tale of a music teacher who loses his life but discovers his soul, it’s a visually sumptuous riot of ideas, pitched somewhere between a playful musical, a divine comedy and a metaphysical drama. Just as the Minions movie opened to the delightful helium sounds of its heroes happily “ba-ba-BA”-ing the famous Universal theme, so Soul begins with the distinctive Disney anthem being jazzily murdered by a discordant school band. If music teacher Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) could wish upon a star, he’d wish to be somewhere else, preferably tinkling the ivories at a swinging club. Joe’s dream comes true when he gets a late-in-the-day call asking him to sit in with hip jazz saxophonist Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett). The audition goes well – so well, in fact, that Joe leaves with his head in the clouds and promptly falls to his death down an open manhole. So far, so slapstick. Yet finding himself on a moving stairway to the Great Beyond, and determined not to miss the chance of a lifetime, Joe runs the other way and winds up in the Great Before, a dreamy neverland where protean souls are assigned “unique and individual personalities” before being sent to Earth. Here, he meets 22 (Tina Fey), who has refused to take her place in the real world despite the best efforts of a string of teachers, including Gandhi, Lincoln and Mother Teresa (“I made her cry”). And thus it falls to the disembodied Joe to help 22 find her spark, with unexpected body-swapping results. Co-written and directed by Pete Docter, Soul shares many of the traits of his previous outings, Up and Inside Out. Like the latter, it addresses existential issues (the construction of personality; nature v nurture) through the accessible language of animation – like a theologically fired revisiting of the strip cartoon The Numskulls. And like Up, in which an old man rediscovers the meaning of life after turning his house into a helium balloon-powered airship, it ties its redemptive message to a bizarrely convoluted plot that occasionally trips over its own narrative shoelaces. It’s easy to become blase about the visual brilliance, both technical and artistic, of Pixar’s output, but Soul really is a treat for the eyes. From the almost photo-realist clarity of the earthbound scenes (the jazz club interiors give Damien Chazelle’s work on The Eddy a run for its money) to the otherworldly eeriness of the out-of-body segments, it’s a pleasure to watch. Witness the tangible physical beauty of Joe’s fingers flitting across the keyboards as music transports him to another dimension, juxtaposed with the wonderful strangeness of creatures from another world that resemble trippy line drawings of Fred Flintstone as reimagined by Picasso. With an original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and jazz compositions and arrangements by Jon Batiste (the ambassadorial house-band leader for Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show), Soul has musical pizzazz to spare. Foxx, who won an Oscar playing Ray Charles, lends emotional depth to Pixar’s first African American leading role, with co-director/writer Kemp Powers (along with consultants such as anthropologist Dr Johnnetta Cole) ensuring that the film’s cultural reference points strike just the right note.

"Tom Cruise has been recorded screaming obscenities at crew members on his current film Mission: Impossible 7 after apparent breaches of on-set social distancing guidelines. The Sun published an audio recording of Cruise shouting and swearing at film crew on the project, of which is he one of the producers, threatening instant dismissal of anyone found to be contravening distancing rules. On the recording Cruise can be heard shouting: “I don’t ever want to see it again, ever! And if you don’t do it, you’re fired, if I see you do it again, you’re fucking gone. And if anyone in this crew does it – that’s it, and you too and you too … don’t you ever fucking do it again.” “That’s it! No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education.” Cruise appeared to be reacting after crew members were spotted standing too close to each other by a computer screen at Leavesden studios in the UK. Like all major Hollywood productions, Mission: Impossible 7 has been hampered by potentially catastrophic delays and shutdowns due to the pandemic. Production in Italy was halted in February after authorities banned public gatherings in response to the first wave of coronavirus, but in July permission was given for shooting to restart in the UK after Cruise personally appealed to culture secretary Oliver Dowden. In October, filming in Italy was suspended again after reports of a positive Covid test on set. Underlying Cruise’s outburst is his sense that the production is functioning as a model for how Hollywood can continue to work under pandemic conditions, with the actor stating: “I’m on the phone with every fucking studio at night, insurance companies, producers, and they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies. We are creating thousands of jobs you motherfuckers … Movies are going because of us. If we shut down it’s going to cost people fucking jobs, their home, their family. That’s what’s happening.” The film’s production company has been approached for comment.",film
"There comes a time in the life of a writer, director and, perhaps, a company when the days shorten, the shadows lengthen and contemplating the inevitable must begin. The guy in the cloak with the retro lawn equipment can’t be ignored any longer: Death. In Pixar’s latest film, Soul, mortality springs itself with supreme bad timing on protagonist Joe Gardner, a New York jazzman about to play the gig of his life when he falls down a manhole. After 2017’s Coco and this year’s Onward, this is Pixar’s third film about death in as many years. Is this fixation the Californian animation giant’s midlife crisis in multimillion-dollar CGI form? Soul, directed by Pete Docter, is a classy offering with smart colouring-book metaphysics in the vein of his 2015 film Inside Out, as Joe attempts to escape the “Great Beyond” and return to his body, via the “Great Before”. This is the realm where nascent souls must find their spark – their animating passion in life – and are then dispatched to Earth. Visually drawing on Powell and Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death, broaching the dark subject for children with life-affirming insouciance, and – featuring the company’s first black lead character – a big diversity coup, it’s a typically slick, four-quadrant-pleasing, stock price-boosting entertainment package. This is what Pixar do. But the company has been showing its age lately. A run of almost uniformly dazzling films culminated in 2010’s Toy Story 3. But under Disney’s management, a weariness set in: too many sequels, and originals that didn’t have the conceptual snap of that brilliant first spree. Perhaps the injection of morbidity is how Docter – also Pixar’s chief creative officer since 2018 – has planned to startle the studio out of its corporate lull, reconnect it with weighty themes and get its mojo back. Maybe it isn’t that premeditated. Perhaps it is a natural consequence of where Pixar’s top personnel are in life: Docter is 52, entering the decade where, as parents die and ageing really kicks in, death starts to become more than theoretical party-poop. Lee Unkrich – director of Coco, set in the Mexican “Land of the Dead” – is 53, though last year, in a very mid-life decision, quit Pixar to spend more time with his family. Onward’s director Dan Scanlon is only 44 but definitely, to use a golfing metaphor, moving on to the back nine. His film – set in a kind of Dungeons & Dragons-flavoured suburbia filled with centaur cops and a manticore restaurant manager – is the one that deals most directly with death in the form of loss. Its teenage elf brothers try to complete a “visitation spell” that will bring back their dad – a story inspired by Scanlon’s own life, as his father was killed in a car accident when he was one. Death, though, has always lurked in Pixar’s filmography in the sense of the creeping passage of time. Docter’s second film, Up, was roundly praised for its initial 10-minute sequence: a wordless prelude charting the years of lead character Carl’s marriage to Ellie, their inability to have children and her eventual passing. It was a stunningly sombre opening to a kid’s adventure romp. The driving motor of the Toy Story films is Woody’s fear, and struggle to accept, that he may become redundant as his owners Andy and Bonnie grow older. In toy terms, this is death – haunted by the prospect of dispatch to the refuse heap or, in the fourth film, the junk shop; decrepit, sad afterlives that are the opposite of being alive in the hands of a child. This fear of obsolescence – of being cast into shadowlands unlit by the imagination – is as much a part of Pixar’s identity as the cute anglepoise lamp. It’s also there in Wall-E’s vision of planetary landfill, a pile-up of defunct human objects and history. Or another oubliette: the Memory Dump in Inside Out, where Riley’s childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong must be jettisoned in order to allow her to grow up. Pixar understands this theme so well because the birth of the company itself signified a moment of pop-culture obsolescence, of the old pre-90s analogue world, in order to give way to the new digital age of infinite play. “Memento Woody” could be its motto. Toy Story is suffused with nostalgia, for the era of wholesome postwar entertainment that the likes of Woody and Bo-Peep represent. But however lovingly it evokes that feel of that world, down to the stitching on a cowboy’s friesian waistcoat and the cheap plastic snap of Buzz Lightyear’s wings, it did as much to kill it off as anyone. Consumers expect far more these days, and Hollywood’s digital CGI wizards can conjure up anything to match our expectations. Their boundless ability to encompass all eras of past pop-culture and simulate any reality, from a Lilliputian toy’s paradise to a bone-clattering Dia de los Muertos fantasia, only reflects our culture’s hunger for non-stop entertainment and distraction. Pixar is part of the same San Francisco Silicon Valley elite that, elsewhere with companies like the Google-backed Calico, is busy trying to “cure” death. Maybe depicting that great intangible is the one remaining frontier for its entertainment arm to conquer, irresistible to those with a nagging sense of ontological horror: that if you have the godlike ability to create anything, does that mean that, underneath, is really … nothing? No wonder Pixar metaphysics only come in primary colours. Dealing with death in its recent films, it has preferred to hew close to JM Barrie’s “awfully big adventure” line, with Coco and Soul making death just another big playground for kids to explore. Soul was inspired by Docter’s realisation, in the seconds after his son was born, that his innate personality was already formed. But, fundamentally rooted in Joe Gardner’s quest to return to Earth, play his gig and prove to himself that his life hasn’t been a pointless waste of time, the film is very much the adult’s perspective on death. It’s another mark on the side of the ledger that says Pixar secretly aren’t in the business of making films for children. Docter is also a practising Presbyterian who gives interviews to church media, but neither Soul, Coco or Onward have an obvious faith agenda; he has said the company is not about converting people. But there is nonetheless a kind of theology to this run of work, a subtle individualism visible in Soul’s search for a personal spark in the Great Before, which looks very much like a soft-play Silicon Valley campus. Or, co-existing with the Latino family values veneer, Coco’s insistence that its young mariachi Miguel must not ignore his musical calling. Similarly, searching for his father allows the young elf Ian to ditch the self-esteem issues and grow into a true spell-caster. That is Pixar’s corporate-evangelist meaning of life: to live your true potential. Whether that message is strong enough to act as a form of solace in a year in which death has been more close by than most remains to be seen. And Covid-19 could just be the 21st-century’s amuse-bouche for even greater environmental catastrophe that would mean le fin for possibly hundreds of millions more people. Wall-E sounded an early warning about that, but Pixar’s articles of faith – play and the imagination – are strong in the face of such darkness. Even in the valley of death, there was an inspirational videocassette and a comedy cockroach.",film
"Tom Cruise follows me on Twitter. Until now, I have been relatively proud of this fact, even though he follows tens of thousands of people, and only tweets three times a year, and his account is probably run by his staff, and he wouldn’t actually be able to tell you what Twitter was if you held a gun to his head. Regardless, I was proud. But now I feel like a failure, because Tom Cruise has never sent me a cake. And it turns out that all Tom Cruise does is send cakes to people. According to Yahoo, every year he orders more than 100 white chocolate coconut bundt cakes from Doan’s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California, and sends them to his famous friends. Rosie O’Donnell gets one. Kirsten Dunst gets one. Jimmy Fallon gets one. James Corden gets one. Graham Norton gets one, and his staff eat it without telling him. Henry Cavill called it “the most decadent, the most amazing cake”. Barbara Walters once ate hers live on television, in a power move as yet unmatched by any mortal human. And of course it is a good cake. Tom Cruise doesn’t operate by half measures. He thrives on intensity. He once explained how to make spaghetti carbonara to Oprah Winfrey with such ferocious conviction that I immediately started making it his way, no questions asked, in case he found out and ran to my house and kicked me in the throat. As I said, of course it’s a good cake. The Yahoo story is full of nice details. Cruise chose Doan’s as his bakery of choice because Diane Keaton bought one of its cakes to prove that it was tastier than Katie Holmes’ favourite cake. Cruise’s team takes each cake to a secondary location to be gift-wrapped before they send it out to recipients. Dunst calls it the “Cruise cake”. Despite all this, the most important thing here is the knowledge that Cruise has now officially become more legend than man. In truth, he was already well on the way. This summer, a conversation he had with culture secretary Oliver Dowden led to a Covid travel exemption so that Mission: Impossible 7 could resume production. Not long afterwards, when the rest of the world was sheltering in place, he was filming in Norway, driving a motorbike off the side of a mountain before gliding back to Earth on a parachute. Cruise has always been aggressively keen on reaching the upper levels of his capability, but this year it seems as if he’s forcing things to happen through nothing but sheer power of will. The cake thing leaves no doubt. Sending hundreds of cakes to people during a festive season so miserable that many of us have barely been able to get it together enough to write anyone a card is nothing short of miraculous. It’s as if Tom Cruise has decided that Christmas will happen and now, purely because of that, it’s happening. Yes, it’s true that he isn’t saving the world. But isn’t he sending a message to us all? If we can all go the extra mile and remember other people, and use our near-infinite wealth to direct a team of underlings to purchase, wrap and send a cake to the woman from Interview With a Vampire, then the world would undoubtedly be a better place. Was this entire piece a ploy to get Tom Cruise to send me a cake? Yes it was. Am I ashamed of that? Yes.",film
"As for everyone and everything else, this has been a traumatising year for cinema. Many new movies have had to be viewed at home, on streaming services, and cinephiles have had to accept this arrangement, rather like gourmets who see their favourite restaurants survive by repurposing themselves as delivery and takeaway centres. And streaming has, arguably, given a new audience to independent and arthouse cinema that might not otherwise have much of a showing in theatres. Lockdown has intensified the debate about the validity of the small-screen experience of cinema – and it’s especially intense for me, when I consider one of my favourite films of the year. Steve McQueen’s Lovers Rock is one of the glorious works in McQueen’s superb five-movie Small Axe sequence about the Black British experience. It is gloriously cinematic and was slated to feature at this year’s (cancelled) Cannes film festival. But it was commissioned by the BBC, and so the vast majority of the people enjoying this wonderful film will be doing so on the small screen. That’s why it is being described, understandably, as one the television highlights of the year. Well, it can be both, and so I am listing it in the Braddies, my personal choices that exist separately from Guardian film’s best-of-the-year countdown. As ever, there are 10 nominees in 10 categories: film, director, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, documentary, cinematography, screenplay, directorial debut. There is also the single-entry nomination in the special category: quirkiest future cult classic most likely to be overlooked by the boomer mainstream media establishment. The nominees are listed in no particular order and readers are invited to vote below the line for their preferred winner and talk about omissions.

"In a year when many of us obsessed over anti-escapist films about disasters engulfing the world while also being presented with a junkier than usual lineup of wannabe blockbusters (both the obvious result of the dreaded C-word), there’s something fitting about us closing the year out with Greenland, a chaotic comet thriller presenting the apocalypse up on a chipped platter, the cut-rate combo that 2020 deserves. Originally set to star Chris Evans with District 9’s Neill Blomkamp at the helm, instead we have Ric Roman Waugh reuniting with his Angel Has Fallen star Gerard Butler, a lower-wattage prospect compounded by the film’s prime theatrical release in June swapping out for an on-demand launch before Christmas. Butler, who last faced natural disasters in 2017’s dreadful Geostorm, plays John, a structural engineer trying to patch things up with his estranged wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and son Nathan. But in pleasingly quick and frantic fashion, their lives are upturned by an incoming comet, one that was originally predicted to bypass Earth but is now set to cause mass destruction. John gets a call to tell him he’s been pre-selected along with his family for shelter which sets them on a path to safety although it’s one that’s far from smooth … Working with a budget far lower than that for a film of its ilk (just $35m compared to Geostorm’s $120m or even the far less action-centric Contagion’s $60m), Greenland is sold on grand spectacle yet contains not that much of it. I’d argue that it’s just about enough for viewers not to feel short-changed (it’s no Reign of Fire in that regard) but it’s a film where the biggest moments are told in fleeting montage, something that works both for and against it. The tight focus on a family’s struggle to stay alive rather than the experts figuring out what to do behind the scenes is refreshing (Butler’s everyman can only do so much to help) and there’s a horribly well-orchestrated anxiety to some of the earlier, surprisingly believable scenes. The specifics of selection and how this process would then operate during a disaster (starting with the newly adopted presidential alert which leads to a QR code) feels just about convincing enough and there’s a clamminess to watching the characters desperately try to figure it all out. The script, from Buried writer Chris Sparling, is also infused with a rather pessimistic view of humanity, characters showcasing terrible behaviour that’s easily identifiable after the year we have all had. But the family’s lack of identifiable characteristics (dad = man, mum = woman, son = diabetic) means we get tired of them all too fast. The indulgent two-hour runtime also means that their journey starts to plod as well as lose even the slightest amount of credibility by the time we reach the film’s absurd finale. The clue to where it’s all headed is, er, in the title and despite the film’s enjoyably extreme ramping up of global mayhem, it all crescendoes in a classic “have your cake and eat it” disaster movie ending. It’s an adequate, involving enough afternoon watch (faint praise: better than Geostorm) and for those with a certain destructive itch that still needs scratching, this should do the job.",film
"Director Spike Lee and musician David Byrne have created a crowd-pleaser with this spry concert film of Byrne’s 2018 tour turned Broadway performance. Nearly half the setlist comprises hits made famous by Talking Heads – and who wouldn’t find their spirits buoyed by footage of Byrne and co careening through the crowd during a sweaty and exuberant performance of Road to Nowhere, GoPro cameras trailing them? Byrne and his band, who wear their instruments strapped to their bodies, dance barefoot in starched, steel-grey suits across a stage designed to look like a chainmail cube. This is a Spike Lee Joint and so Lee shoots Byrne from above so the viewer can better appreciate the clarity of the staging, from the wings to give a sense of the choreography and among the performers to capture their energy. There aren’t any isolated moments as cinematic as Byrne’s tender lamp dance in Jonathan Demme’s 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, but the director’s playfulness is felt. The show is interspersed with Byrne’s earnest reflections on low voter turnout and Black Lives Matter. It’s ambiguous whether Lee’s presence is supposed to legitimise or complicate any white guilt Byrne might feel. “We all need to change. I also need to change,” he says, introducing his cover of Janelle Monáe’s 2015 protest song Hell You Talmbout. Still, it’s a moving and reverent scene, with Lee inserting images of black Americans who have died at the hands of the police.",film
"In his visor-and-face-mask combo, Daveed Diggs resembles a cross between a welder and a highwayman. He peers into his webcam as he walks, offers a “Yo!”, and finds a quiet corner of a Los Angeles studio to sit down, then whips off his headgear to reveal spidery braids and a black beard. An East Bay T-shirt serves as a reminder that the 38-year-old hails from Oakland, the Bay Area city that provided the backdrop, and the dazed deadpan sensibility, for Blindspotting. That extraordinary film, released in 2018, which Diggs co-wrote and starred in, twisted straight-arrow subjects (racist police violence, unconscious bias, gentrification) into comic vignettes without any loss of gravitas. He is speaking today from the set of the TV spin-off series. “It’s the same idea as the film,” he says. “It’s a comedy in a world that won’t let it be one.” Praising Blindspotting in these pages two years ago, Mike McCahill described it as “2018: The Movie”, but there seems regrettably little chance that the series will look dated by the time it reaches our screens. “The topic of the different policing of poor and brown people is not new to the current resurgence of Black Lives Matter,” Diggs says. “That’s the world we live in. It’s as consistent as it has always been.” Audiences have had no shortage of Diggs this year. At the start of the pandemic, Disney+ streamed a 2016 recording of the Broadway musical Hamilton, originally intended to be released in cinemas next year, which features the actor’s swaggering, Tony-winning dual performance as Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette. Diggs is also the star of Snowpiercer, the Netflix series based on Bong Joon-ho’s post-apocalyptic train-bound thriller (a second season is in the can, with a third shooting next year). He recently played a comically carnal Frederick Douglass in the irreverent abolitionist drama The Good Lord Bird, and next year he will be Sebastian the Crab in the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. “I enjoy so much,” he says when I mention this eclecticism. “There’s really not a lot that I hate doing. My taste in everything is always the thing I haven’t tried before.” This month, he pops up in Soul, Pixar’s animated fantasy about a music teacher scrambling to get back to Earth from the afterlife. Diggs’s vocal imprint is minor – he has one scene as a barbershop know-it-all – but his main contribution was as part of a group of “cultural consultants”, also including the musicians Quincy Jones and Questlove. “It’s Pixar’s first film with a black protagonist,” he says, “so they wanted feedback on cultural relevancy from a ton of black folks. They’d show us character designs and ask: ‘Does this feel like a person you know?’ or ‘Are you offended by this in any way?’ One person said, ‘In the background voices, I didn’t hear anyone who wasn’t speaking English, and that’s not my experience of New York.’ I thought that was such a brilliant note! It hadn’t occurred to me. It’s buried in the mix – but somebody picked up on it.” He also sat in on feedback sessions, where material was mercilessly torn apart. “I don’t think I could write for Pixar,” he laughs. “They’ll hack away at a thing if it’s not working. It’s brutal. Nobody is concerned with anyone’s feelings, they just want to make a great film. I was a newcomer, so to me it sounded like they were killing babies all over the place.” The actor and writer Rashida Jones – Quincy’s daughter, who co-wrote Toy Story 4 – has called Pixar a place where “women and people of colour do not have an equal creative voice”. Diggs believes the studio is trying to remedy that. “It’s part of an industry-wide self-examination. Everybody means well, but there’s so much unconscious bias happening. If you don’t have representation in the upper ranks – if there’s no producer of colour at the top, and no upper-level writers of colour – then it doesn’t matter what’s happening in your writers’ room. When younger writers of colour present interesting ideas, those always get cut because there’s no one at the end of the line who understands the cultural relevance and specificity of those details. No one’s actually saying: ‘We don’t care if black folks or queer people manage to see themselves in this.’ But that’s the result. You don’t know what you don’t know.” It is a lesson he has taken with him into the Blindspotting series. “Our writers’ room was almost entirely women because we are writing for a female protagonist, and we were aware we would miss certain things because of our own blind spots. We also work with as many female directors as we can to check us on those things all the time.” Diggs is an eloquent speaker – check out his 20-minute commencement address at Brown, his alma mater, for definitive proof – with a gift for juggling light and dark subjects. This month, for instance, his avant garde rap trio, Clipping, released a bouncy tween-pop single, Puppy for Hanukkah, and a sinister, horror-soaked new album, Visions of Bodies Being Burned. Typical tracks include Pain Everyday, where the descendants of white racists are haunted by the ghosts of lynching victims, and Body on a Pile, which surveys the carnage following the slaughter of several cops. Among their previous songs is The Deep, which imagines the babies of drowned pregnant slaves building an underwater world. Why is horror – from Get Out and The People Under the Stairs to this year’s Lovecraft Country and His House – so adept at conveying black experience and black history? “The great thing about horror as a genre is that the times generally identify what the monster is,” he says. “When you look at Jordan Peele’s work, or any of the stuff enjoying popularity right now, it allows black creators to shine a spotlight on the things that have always been monstrous, and then to make physical monsters out of them. They become visually frightening so everybody gets to be scared of them.” Absent from the new album is the single Chapter 319, released on Juneteenth this year as a response to the murder of George Floyd. Diggs, a famously dexterous rapper, puts it as bluntly as possible on the track: “Donald Trump is a white supremacist, full stop/ If you vote for him again, you’re a white supremacist, full stop.” The song was written in a day, he tells me, “to be played at protests”; it also breaks one of the band’s self-imposed rules by having Diggs rapping in the first person. “Most rap is rigorously first person, but we always wanted to be able to talk about things without having people assume we were living them.” Much of Clipping’s music, like Pixar’s films, has a timelessness that will allow it to be understood easily in decades to come, whereas Chapter 319 may need footnotes for listeners in 2040. “That’d be great if it did,” Diggs says, smiling sadly. “It’d be really nice if we didn’t all immediately understand what that song was about.” I was planning to end by asking about his hopes for America in the coming years. But I think he just answered that.  Soul is streaming on Disney+ from 25 December. ",film
"Over the years, animation studio Pixar have patented and perfected a particular type of film: bittersweet life lessons of intense depth and emotion, wrapped up in super-slick, cutie-pie visuals. In among the more obviously kid-oriented Toy Stories and Cars, this strand of Pixar’s output has originated a string of sensational classics: Wall-E, Up, Inside Out. Well, Soul sees Pixar hitting another one out the park – and it’s perhaps unsurprising that it has Up and Inside Out director Pete Docter’s name at the top, as director and co-writer. (Another of the writers, One Night in Miami’s Kemp Powers, gets a co-director credit.) In broad terms, Soul appears to be a hybrid of Inside Out, with its literal rendering of internal psychological constructs, and Coco, the more traditional-looking afterlife yarn. What Pixar have come up with is a hypermodern spirit-world fable that also looks back to classical anchoring values with a touch of hippy-era mysticism: music, art, self-expression, rites of passage. In one way, the title is a little deceptive: jazz, not soul, is the musical motif of choice here. (Perhaps, like the original Toy Story and its wooden cowboy, there’s a retrograde yearning for the validation of generations older than the actual target audience?) Jamie Foxx is middle-aged music teacher Joe who falls down a manhole shortly after securing his life’s ambition of an actual live gig with a lounge-bar jazz combo, and is transported to a minutely detailed afterlife that bears more than a passing resemblance to A Matter of Life and Death – the Powell and Pressburger film where David Niven, like Foxx, passes over but is desperate to get back to the real world. Soul’s spirit world has immaculately designed conceptual architecture: a Great Beyond (plus conveyor belt) for dead people’s souls; a Great Before, with seminars and mentors for its nursery of unformed consciousnesses; and interesting subworlds, such as “the zone” for ecstatic fulfillment (“in the zone”) and a desert of “lost” souls. On hand are soul “counters” and “counsellors” that look like Picasso line drawings. Amusingly, though, all this is an elaborate preamble to Soul’s rich earthbound comedy: what is essentially a three-way body swap in which Joe’s soul ends up inside a cat, and the spirit of an as-yet-unborn being (played by Tina Fey) called simply 22 inhabits Joe’s body. In the end, though, all Pixar films are about growing up, and Soul examines this on multiple levels: from Joe’s reluctance to cut the apron strings to 22’s reluctance to be born. As cinema-going is decimated by Covid, Soul has been bumped early – and some might say cynically – on to Disney’s streaming service, instead of the big screen. It’s a shame: the film’s glowing designs deserve to be seen on the most large-scale format possible. But Soul is certainly a film that can rise to any occasion, even a cruddy laptop browser. It’s just a joy from beginning to end.",film
"Jeremy Bulloch, who has died aged 75, was a busy character actor who staked a claim for cinematic immortality by playing the inscrutable Boba Fett in the Star Wars films. A masked, enigmatic bounty hunter with a jet pack and distinctive costume design, Boba Fett debuted in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), capturing and carbon-freezing Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in order to convey him to the slug-like paymaster Jabba the Hutt. Despite relatively limited screen time and dialogue (his few lines were post-dubbed by the American actor Jason Wingreen), both Bulloch and Boba Fett became much loved contributors to the franchise and he reprised the role in Return of the Jedi (1983). In the eventual Star Wars prequels Boba Fett was played by the child actor Daniel Logan, and so Bulloch was instead hired to play the spaceship pilot Captain Colton in the third of them, Revenge of the Sith (2005). Unlike his onscreen villain, Bulloch was genial, good humoured and modest, playing down his contribution to the success of Boba Fett. He insisted he only got the part because he was a good fit for the costume, having been brought in by his half-brother, the producer Robert Watts, but his precise body language and smouldering presence were, in fact, integral to the character’s appeal. Bulloch was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. His mother, Aziz (known as Diana, nee Meade), already had three sons from a previous marriage when she married the aeronautical engineer (and later mushroom grower) McGregor Bulloch in 1944. Jeremy was the middle of three children from this second union. The family moved around and so his education was peripatetic: St Leonard’s school in Blandford Forum, Dorset, a private tutor in Wincanton, Somerset, then Dorset House in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Having failed his 11-plus exams Jeremy – and most of his siblings – enrolled at the Corona theatre school in London and was soon working, making his professional debut in a breakfast cereal commercial. He started appearing in films, as an extra in A Night to Remember (1958) and Carry on Teacher (1959), before playing more substantial roles on television, in the series Counter-Attack! (1960), The Chequered Flag (1960) and Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (1960-61). He made his theatrical debut in 1962 at the Pembroke theatre, Croydon, and hit the West End in 1964 in I Love You, Mrs Patterson (St Martin’s theatre, directed by Frith Banbury). His big screen break came in 1962 when he was cast in the film Summer Holiday as Edwin, one of four mechanics, led by Cliff Richard, who persuade London transport to lend them an old bus which they renovate and take on a road trip, provoking both mayhem and music. With a cheerful, open face and a light, melodic voice, he was perfect for juvenile leads and had a short run in Compact (1965), an early BBC initiative to create a rival soap opera to Coronation Street, and was then one of the originating stars of the next attempt, The Newcomers (1965). His three-year stint included the much publicised wedding of his character, Philip Cooper, for the show’s 200th episode (designed to steal the thunder of the rival soap’s imminent nuptials of Elsie Tanner). A solid career as a character actor in both drama and comedy followed, with appearances in most popular shows of the time – Doctor Who (1965 and 1973), Dr Finlay’s Casebook (1970), Crown Court (1972), Man About the House (1974), The Professionals (1978) and Richard II (BBC Shakespeare, 1978). He then became a regular in the thoughtful sitcom Agony (1979-81), playing one of the groundbreakingly non-stereotypical gay couple living next door to the advice columnist Jane Lucas (Maureen Lipman). His later TV work included Chocky (1984), Chocky’s Children (1985), Robin of Sherwood (1984-86, as the decent and stoical village headman Edward of Wickham), Faith (1994), Sloggers (1994-95), Spooks (2002), Doctors (2006-08) and Law & Order: UK (2009). Bulloch appeared in three James Bond films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Octopussy (1983), in the last two playing the gadget man Q’s assistant Smithers. He wrote an autobiography, Flying Solo (2005), contributed to Elstree 1976 (2015), a documentary about Star Wars actors, and was a popular guest at conventions around the world, endearing himself to fans due to his self-deprecation and unstarry conduct. He withdrew from public appearances in 2018 due to the effects of Parkinson’s disease. He met Maureen Walker, a model, on holiday in 1967 and they married three years later. She survives him, as do their sons, Jamie and Robbie, another son, Christian, from his brief 1965 marriage to Sandra Ford, which ended in divorce, and 10 grandchildren.",film
"With the taste of Christmas lunch and festive beverages still lingering on our palettes, it’s time to embrace the possibilities of the new year and wash away memories of that rotten old 2020. In that spirit, here are 10 Australian films to look forward to that are slated for release in 2021. Many more productions are in the works, of course, so this list is not exhaustive; think of it as a taste of what’s to come. Dir. Anthony Hayes Actor Anthony Hayes struck gold in the casting of his second feature film as director – which is called, in fact, Gold – with Hollywood heartthrob Zac Efron starring in this thriller about two men who discover the world’s biggest gold nugget. Efron may be in the “I should be taken artistically serious” stage of his career, with a recent portrayal of Ted Bundy in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, and appearances in The Disaster Artist and The Beach Bum. Let’s not talk about that upcoming Three Men and a Baby remake. Dir. Daina Reid Elisabeth Moss delivered a gooseflesh-raising performance as a victim of domestic violence in The Invisible Man and will star in another Australian thriller, Run Rabbit Run, re-teaming with The Handmaid’s Tale director Daina Reid (whose oeuvre includes the excellent basketball-themed series Sunshine). Moss plays a fertility doctor whose life spirals into turmoil due to the increasingly strange behaviour of her young daughter. Dir. Stephen Maxwell Johnson Some excellent Australian or “meat pie” westerns have landed in recent years, among them Sweet Country, The Nightingale and this year’s The Furnace. So the bar has been set high for director Stephen Maxwell Johnson’s film about a pair of men tracking down a dangerous Aboriginal warrior in the outback circa the 1930s. The buzz around High Ground is very positive, with Variety calling the film “handsomely mounted and absorbing” and Guardian Australia’s Debbie Zhou describing it as “a rip-roaring western against the starkly remote Northern Territory outback”, following its Berlin film festival premiere.. In cinemas 28 January Dir. Baz Luhrmann Baz Luhrmann’s currently untitled Elvis Presley biopic (a US/Australia co-production) has been given a tentative release of November 2021, but given the film comes from the extravagant Australian auteur, it may well be delayed as he awaits the world’s supply of glitter to be shipped to the set. It will be lavish, that much is certain, though little else is known about it beyond casting details – with Austin Butler, a Nickelodeon and Disney Channel alumni, playing The King. What will it be called: Love Me Tender? All Shook Up? Given Luhrmann’s play-to-the-back rows style, maybe just Elvis. Dir. Jane Campion Jane Campion’s erotic period drama The Piano was such a good film Australia kinda sorta pretty much claimed it as our own, bestowing it with a tonne of gongs (11 in total) at the 1993 AFI awards. Maybe we’ll do the same with Campion’s next film, The Power of the Dog, a New Zealand/Australia co-production. The great director adapts author Thomas Savage’s novel, which the Guardian reviewer Peter Beech called a “rich and challenging psychodrama” about two ranch-owning brothers. Dir. Larissa Behrendt After the Apology and Maralinga Tjarutja director Larissa Behrendt’s upcoming documentary explores, in the words of Screen Australia’s synopsis, “how a group of NRL greats came together to invent a new pre-game ceremony in response to the Maori Haka” – in an effort to confront racism and celebrate Aboriginal culture. It will premiere on NITV, which continues to build a repertoire of important and highly engaging non-fiction productions – highlights in recent times including the You Are Here series, Warwick Thornton’s eye-watering The Beach and the Fred Glynn portrait She Who Must Be Loved. Dir. Justin Kurzel News of an upcoming Port Arthur massacre movie was always going to generate controversy, reigniting debate about where the line is on narratives about real-life atrocities. In my opinion, we must listen to and respect the opinions of survivors while acknowledging that many great films have been made about terrible things. Voices condemning the film sight unseen add little if anything to the conversation. Nitram will be directed by Justin Kurzel, a tremendous Australian film-maker whose work includes Snowtown and True History of the Kelly Gang. That admittedly means little in this context, because even great directors can produce duds from time to time. The jury is out until the arrival of the film itself. Dir. Sally Ingleton I got tingles towards the end of the invigorating trailer for Sally Ingleton’s documentary about eco warriors – young, old and everywhere in between – fighting for the future on the frontline of environmental activism. Despite the spin and bluster from Scott Morrison’s government, it is clear to all and sundry that on the issue of climate action Australia is one of the bad guys, in the same category as Russia and Saudi Arabia. Instead of waiting for history to condemn us, these protesters are putting their arses on the line to say: no way; enough is enough. In cinemas 4 February Dir. Glendyn Ivin Naomi Watts leads this adaptation of a non-fiction book about a woman (Watts) who suffers a terrible fall that leaves her mostly paralysed, but whose spirits are lifted by an injured magpie her family names Penguin. The film will be helmed by Glendyn Ivin (who recently directed the excellent series The Cry and Safe Harbour), joining a pantheon of recent homegrown movies about the inspiring influence of animals – from dogs (Oddball, Koko: A Red Dog Story) to birds of prey (Healing) and a pelican (Storm Boy). In cinemas 21 January Dir. Thomas M Wright It’s no surprise that Joel Edgerton signed on to star in this South Australia-shot thriller, given it’s the sophomore feature of director Thomas M Wright, who previously made the enthralling Adam Cullen biopic Acute Misfortune. The Unknown Man is about an undercover cop’s attempts to convict a man for an unsolved murder. The Screen Australia website likens it to Animal Kingdom and Insomnia.",film
"Nothing warms the anti-yuletide misanthropes’ shrivelled hearts like a good old-fashioned Christmas-themed horror film wherein the evil inside human souls gets unleashed on happy-clappy hedonists. This Georgia-set spooky adventure story, although flawed, indulges that curmudgeonly instinct with a tale of a privileged white North American couple, Mia (Ivanna Sakhno) and Max (Alex Hafner), who arrive at a mountain resort where they plan to spend Christmas snowboarding and making lame jokes about the Overlook hotel from The Shining. This will prove prophetic. Director Stanislav Kapralov, making his directorial debut with a script he co-wrote with Omri Rose, affords just a little bit of sympathy towards recently orphaned Mia, who desperately wants to start a family. Max, on the other hand, comes across as much less likable, mostly because he insists on using the word “epic” as a superlative despite being above the age of 13. And partly because he insists, no matter how much the locals try to warn him off, that he wants to snowboard on the Black Ridge, which may be haunted by the spirit of a child killed by entitled snowboarders years earlier. In all honesty, the path towards the film’s final feeble twist is as discernible as a neon pink jacket on the ski slopes. But Let It Snow is well put together, from the spectacular location work to the strong use of sound to the sort of arresting imagery that recalls the haute body horror of Midsommar. Sakhno doesn’t quite match Florence Pugh’s performance in that film – but she does impress with a willingness to get cold and traumatised, and she screams with despair like a real pro.",film
"One of the most surprising new avenues to have formed for celebrities over the course of the pandemic has been Cameo. For the uninitiated, Cameo is a service where celebrities can create personalised messages for their fans. For £75, Hodor from Game of Thrones will wish you a happy birthday or – if you have £750 lying around – Richard Dreyfuss will put on a Jaws shirt and struggle to pronounce your name. But maybe this isn’t enough for you. Maybe you want to find direct engagement, with a much bigger star than Cameo offers, and for free. If that’s the case, I can heartily endorse not liking a Russell Crowe movie. Because, even if it takes him a while, Crowe will do his best to respond to your criticism. And if you’re really lucky, he’ll sound like an out-of-touch bus stop crackpot in the process. Here’s what happened. On 9 January, Ian McNabb, frontman of The Icicle Works, wrote the following about the 2003 film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World: “Lots of folk complaining about lack of sleep during the Pandemic. May I recommend Master And Commander starring the usually captivating, attention-grabbing Russell Crowe. I’ve never made it past the ten minute mark. You’re welcome. And thanks Russell.” The tweet began to pick up steam and, just nine days later, found its way to Crowe himself. Now, Russell Crowe is a very famous man who has almost three million followers. However, despite this he was unable to let the criticism sit. Instead, he narkily replied: “That’s the problem with kids these days. No focus. Peter Weirs film is brilliant. An exacting, detail oriented, epic tale of fidelity to Empire & service, regardless of the cost. Incredible cinematography by Russell Boyd & a majestic soundtrack. Definitely an adults movie.” As it happens, both parties are wrong here. Master and Commander was a perfectly adequate film, although I’d be surprised if anyone thought about it in any meaningful way from the moment the credits ended, but the important thing is that Crowe reacted. Again, not much new there. He reacted to Bafta editing a poem out of an acceptance speech by pinning a television executive to a wall and calling him a “motherfucker”. He reacted to poor hotel telephone coverage by throwing the telephone at a clerk’s face. This time it is different, because he did it on Twitter via the means of a “kids these days” rant. And this is brilliant. This is confirmation that Crowe is willing to share his generalised biases with the world, and all you have to do is have an opinion on one of his films. Perhaps you could write that Cinderella Man felt like such a deliberate piece of Oscar bait that it failed to be emotionally captivating, or that A Good Year felt shallow and redundant compared with its previous television adaptation, or that the promotional campaign for Unhinged was more entertaining than the film itself. Either way, there’s now a good chance that Crowe will respond by saying, “In my day children were taught to be seen but not heard”, or “We never used to wash our hands after going to the toilet when I was growing up, and it never did me any harm,” or “Is it just me or are Wagon Wheels getting smaller?” This could have huge repercussions. After all, Crowe is so influential that dozens of stars might start joining in. It’s the Twitter equivalent of the Law of Attraction. Tell the universe that you didn’t entirely love a film made 18 years ago, and the universe will tell the star to inform you that you are incorrect. Perhaps rolling your eyes at Bruce Almighty will bring Jim Carrey to your door. Perhaps frowning at Hulk will make Eric Bana say hello to you. Perhaps, if you’re really mean about Maid in Manhattan, Ralph Fiennes will create a Twitter account specifically to call you a prick. And anyway, Crowe is right. Kids these days are to blame for everything. Kids have got no attention spans. Kids only like superhero movies. Kids can’t sit through a ponderously slow film about boats because they’d rather be watching an unboxing video on YouTube. Kids won’t watch a film that doesn’t have any sequels, even if it has been deliberately titled to make it look like the first part of a new and exciting maritime franchise. Kids eat candy.

"Film and TV crew are no longer exempt from coronavirus restrictions related to job travel, it has emerged. The UK government’s list of jobs that qualify for travel exemptions has been updated to remove “television production” and “high end television production and film”, which means that executives and crew arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 10 days. The move is a reversal of the widely publicised policy that saw film-makers and crew allowed into the UK in July without quarantine as part of a government drive to get film production in the UK back up and running. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden had made the announcement after apparently consulting with Tom Cruise, whose Mission Impossible films were among the Hollywood productions to restart shooting in the UK in September. Other productions likely to be affected include The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, which had been halted for two weeks in September after Pattinson tested positive for coronavirus. The only media-related job on the government’s list still exempt from travel restrictions appears to be workers on the BBC’s broadcasting transmission network and services.",film
"Since the dawn of the 20th century and the mainstreaming of existential thought, every generation has fretted that they’re at the end of history, bearing witness to the hysterical collapse of social and political order. From the age of postwar nuclear anxiety to the sweet summers of the counterculture to the turn of the millennium, some faction always fears that they will be forced to let go of the world they understand to make way for a frightening, confusing new one. I would contend that the current generation of humans alive on Earth – having dealt over the past year with a global pandemic, incompetently attempted fascist takeovers, the fracturing and splintering of the world economy, and in some regions, the sky bursting into flame – has a more legitimate claim to that feeling than any that’s come before. If the year’s final days and their promise of a vaccine rollout introduce an aftertaste of hope, the prevailing note of 2020 has been a sour apocalyptic tang. The despair, tedium, frustration and surreal delirium that defined the past 12 months have all been amply articulated in writing over the past year; today, we look to the future. Even with real life having taken on the destructive maximalism of a Roland Emmerich movie, we may still turn to films set in the year 2021 for perspectives on what previous generations imagined may await us. And from those visions, whether dystopian or utopian, perhaps we can begin to brace ourselves for a year that can’t possibly be worse than this one. Read on for a survey of cinematic soothsaying about the possible dangers waiting in the days to come: Simon Amstell’s BBC mockumentary lays out an entire chronology stretching from the second world war to 2067, an ambitious account that details how the UK of tomorrow will come to forsake meat and adopt an all-vegan lifestyle. The year 2021 figures prominently into this timeline, as the point at which a super swine flu descends on Britain to claim a sweeping body count. Livestock numbers plummet, pork prices skyrocket, and the populace enters an “era of confusion” about what they’re allowed to eat. At a time when the Daily Mail expects everyone to forgo pizza and chow down on toast instead, as a gesture of nationalist solidarity, food scarcity stands out as an especially troubling symptom of geopolitical unrest and viral unpreparedness. Things turn out alright in Amstell’s projections, as Britons embrace veganism and learn to live harmoniously with the animals (who have been imbued with the power of speech, in the soothing tones of Joanna Lumley). For many, however, life without the prospect of a drippy, melty cheeseburger still represents a fate worse than death. In 1995, cult oddball Robert Longo predicted that the internet would grow too large and immersive for humanity’s own good, eventually becoming so central to our daily doings that it would start to eat away at our psychology. He also envisioned the consolidation of corporate influence into a handful of mega-conglomerates, with power centralized around Asian markets. The one thing this cyberpunk seer got wrong was that we’d all look great while the world went to hell, outfitting Keanu Reeves’ human flash drive and the pharmaceutical mercenaries chasing him with immaculate, slimming suits. Aesthetics aside – virtual styles would leave the clunky, primitive CGI of Longo’s e-dimension behind – his notion of an all-consuming online existence displacing our own real-life experiences was right on the money. As younger generations contend with the blurring of the lines between their authentic selves and their outward-facing alter egos on social media, Johnny’s neural implants scrambling his consciousness start to seem redundant. A few years on Twitter can melon-ball holes in your brain just as easily. The august Hammer Film Productions reigned supreme during the 50s with their vividly gory revivals of such classic ghouls as Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster, and the Mummy. But the following decade saw their relevance starting to wane, and left producers scrambling to figure out what the next big thing might be. The studio tried to pivot into sci-fi and met with little success, their 1969 lunar adventure cast aside by audiences and critics alike as laughable without quite being funny. Never mind the peanut gallery over at Mystery Science Theater 3000, though; there’s some substantial truth to director Roy Ward Baker’s treatment of space exploration as a gold rush sending capitalist competitors scrambling to plant their flag. Rumors of a gigantic asteroid made of pure sapphire pit an arrogant millionaire against a daring astronaut in a race to claim it, a conflict not such a far cry from the ongoing scrum between Virgin Galactic, Northrop Grumman, and the half-dozen other business interests keen on commercializing the galaxy. Baker had the foresight to realize that incineration by extraterrestrials wouldn’t be the primary hazard when venturing into other worlds – just the rich megalomaniacs back home on Earth. Japanese animation great Makoto Shinkai didn’t look too far ahead for this fantastical environmentalism parable, which jumped forward only two years from its release in 2019. He suggests that the future is now, and that the issues raised by his script’s subtext already matter to the present moment – namely, the well-founded concern over global warming, rising water levels, and inevitable planetary drowning. Tokyo teen Hodaka can’t believe his eyes when he meets the ethereal Hina, a “sunshine girl” capable of controlling the weather at the cost of her own body’s integrity. She’s a finite natural resource, used up over the course of the film until she has no choice but to drift into the sky just to keep the rains at bay. Shinkai’s unexpected conclusion, in which Hina returns to Earth and allows the sea to swallow up much of Japan, makes the bracing proposal that maybe we’re better off that way. We’ve lived too recklessly for too long, and if our species is going to get what it deserves, all we can do is accept our self-made destiny and try to find some inner peace. A land ravaged, ragtag bands of survivors, insectoid invaders, you know the drill. What sets this Philippine production apart from its genre’s many similar entries is its artistic medium of garbage, the production design guided by the in-universe plot point that manufacturing has ceased due to lack of materials and the human race has turned scavenger. Using whatever trash they can get their hands on, the rebellion must mount a jerry-rigged offensive against the “locusts” and the mutated homo sapiens in cahoots with them, while preserving the classified location of the recyclable sanctuary known as Paraiso. Their fight for freedom starts with everyone knee-deep in a problem many are still in denial about today, as expanding plastic landmasses float ominously out in the middle of the Pacific. Reality is confronting us with hard physical limits all over the place – cloud servers for data storage, the non-viability of fossil fuels – and we’ll soon have to learn how to make do with what we’ve got. Otherwise, it’s only a matter of time until we’re all subsisting on gelatin made from ground-up cockroaches, though that one comes from Snowpiercer. All of these films picture grim outcomes, but Lorene Scafaria’s feature debut is the only one that finds an optimistic way to see all the devastation. Her off-kilter comedy begins with the news that we’ve all got three weeks before a massive flaming rock obliterates our fragile blue-green marble and extinguishes all life on it. For the suicidal, middle-aged Dodge Petersen (Steve Carell), the certainty of annihilation actually jolts him out of his benumbed stupor and teaches him to appreciate the time he’s got left, which he mostly spends with the enchanting Penny Lockhart (Keira Knightley) on an end-of-days road trip. They find solace in one another, an object lesson in how to maintain sanity during an emergency that has everyone else running around like Chicken Little. Whether our oblivion comes through man-made or organic means, we’ll only have one another for light in those dark days. Some may choose to fight back, but some may concede to the whichever great cataclysm befalls us, and they might just have the right idea. Would you rather live for 50 years in austere, dangerous conditions, or spend a brief but glorious time free of regret and consequences?",film
"The film director Jasmila Žbanić does not regard herself as a catastrophist. “I’m an optimistic person,” she says, smiling hard. But, like any Bosnian her age, there’s no avoiding the fact that she was formed by the war that broke out in her country in 1992: “I was 17 when it started, and we didn’t understand at first that this was war. We were convinced that Yugoslavia, and especially Bosnia, would never go to war, because it was so mixed. I have Serbian family, I have Croatian family. We were naive. We couldn’t imagine it. We said this will pass. A month or two. There are some stupid people with guns, but they’ll be gone soon. When that didn’t happen, it was a shock, and what it taught us is that everything can turn upside down from one day to another. Life is fragile. The whole system is fragile. This is a feeling that I carry through life. I don’t take anything for granted, especially not institutions.” Žbanić’s gut-wrenching new film, Quo Vadis, Aida?, deals with one of the war’s most heinous atrocities: the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, during which Bosnian Serb forces under the command of Ratko Mladić executed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys – a genocide the United Nations forces deployed to protect the inhabitants of the supposedly “safe area” of Srebrenica did almost nothing to prevent. By the time of Srebrenica, Žbanić had been living under siege in Sarajevo for almost three years; she might have been preoccupied only with her own problems. But what she heard in the weeks and months that followed stayed with her. “Here was another shock,” she says. “This was a UN-protected area. We felt that if the aggression could not be stopped by the UN, then there were no human rights we could believe in – and from that moment, I was obsessed. I wanted to know everything about it. It was a trauma for all Bosnians. When we learned how many people had died, and how they had died, and how they were buried. When we learned that the graves had been moved [in an effort to cover up the massacre].” Ten years ago, she began to think someone should make a film about it: “But I was really hoping it wouldn’t be me. It’s such a hot political subject, even now. There is still huge denial from Serbian politicians that it even happened. Enter this territory, and everyone is against you, because it’s still so present. People continue to live with it. They have their own pain, and their own ideas of what such a film should look like.” What persuaded her in the end? Perhaps it was that she knew now that she could do it. Her 2006 film Grbavica, about the postwar life of a Bosnian woman who was raped by a Serbian soldier, had won a Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival. But she was pulled along, too, by her deep conviction that film has the power to change minds. “This past of ours,” she says, vehemently (she’s talking to me via Zoom from her cottage in the south of Bosnia). “The tendency is to deny, or to hide, or to make false facts. But in order to move on, we have to see it.” Quo Vadis, Aida? follows a UN translator – a character loosely inspired by Hasan Nuhanović, who published a book about his own experiences – inside the base at Srebrenica, minute by minute, hour by hour, as she fights to save her sons and husband from Mladić’s men. The Dutch soldiers for whom she’s working tell her that no exceptions can be made; that her family, too, must go with the Serbians on their buses; that they have received guarantees all those taken will be safe. But she knows their words are empty, even as it falls to her to relay similar promises through a loudhailer to the thousands of hungry and terrified civilians – many of them her friends and neighbours – who have sought protection at the base. For many different reasons, the film is a remarkable achievement; Žbanić deals so deftly with such freighted material (she also wrote the screenplay). Chief among them, however, is the astonishing performance of Jasna Đuričić, who plays the translator, Aida Selmanagic – one for which she deserves to win all the prizes. “Making the film was a responsibility for all of us,” says Žbanić. “But for Jasna, and for Boris [Isaković, who plays Mladić], there were huge issues. The [hostile] response from some to my film Grbavica meant that they knew what they could expect when it came out – and they’re both Serbians. It was brave and progressive of them to take on these roles. For Jasna, it was hard, hard work: she met some of the mothers [of the dead], and her responsibility was to them. For Boris, there was the issue that, in Serbia, Mladić is still considered a hero, even after his conviction as a war criminal. How to play him? How to capture his essence, this man who has the power over people’s lives, who is like a god?” What has been the response to the film in Bosnia? This is complicated. Bosnia, even now, is divided into the two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Republika Srpska. Žbanić and her producers made the decision to premiere Quo Vadis, Aida? at the memorial centre in Srebrenica, which is technically in the latter, to an audience of young people from all sides (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian); there was also a screening for survivors. “Those who were born long after these events were moved,” she says. “Many of those on the Serbian side live under the influence of a media that encourages them not to feel for Muslims, and the film emancipated that part of their brains. It allowed them to cry. As for the survivors, they told me that it was how they remembered it.” But in the rest of Republika Srpska, the Serbian-dominated part of the country, the film has yet to be shown. “The cinema owners are too frightened. They fear the government will give them the kind of punishments that cannot be proved: financial inspections, for instance. To get round this, we suggested underground screenings that we would not even announce. But they said no, someone will find out. A group of boys will be paid to throw stones at the cinema.” It gives her particular pleasure that young audiences find the film gripping: a thriller, of sorts. “My thesis film at film school was about mass graves,” she says, with a black laugh. “This is where I grew up! Even sex was used as a weapon here. But I remember my professor saying: look, this isn’t a document for submission to an international tribunal. It’s a movie.” All directors believe in film as a medium, but when Žbanić talks about the way culture in general, and film in particular, can bring people together, she speaks with more authority than most. “In the siege, we quickly resumed normal activities that were not normal at all in the circumstances, and there was a feeling that by going to the theatre or a film festival, dressed up nicely, you were showing that you were not a victim, that this barbarism would not win. It is really true that we needed culture almost as much as we needed food. To see a film with others, even in crazy conditions, a VHS tape screened against a wall, huddled together: it was very human, and it kept me sane through it all. It gave me the sense I have even now that a film is more than a film. It is life. That’s where my love for it comes from.” Quo Vadis, Aida? is not, she says, against the UN, though she believes its failings in Srebrenica were extremely grave: “On the contrary, it’s about how to make it stronger, and more able to protect human rights.” She believes that people talk too glibly about war. “I’m afraid that if Srebrenica was happening at this moment, the outcome would be the same. Europe is more disunited now, and rightwing forces more in evidence. If this were the constellation of political powers, no one would lift a finger to help the Bosnians – and this is what is scary. We say never again, but there’s nothing behind our words. Bosnia is still considered ‘other’ in Europe. I was at a gathering where the European Film Academy president said that there had been no war in Europe for 70 years, and all I could think was: ‘Were the 100,000 people who died in Bosnia not Europeans?’ But we don’t count.” In Bosnia, she believes, no one won. “The fascists are still around us. The victims and the perpetrators live alongside one other, because only the big guys were sentenced. That is very hard, and I hope my film allows people to talk about it – about the fact that peace doesn’t just come like lightning to burn all the bad things down.” Quo Vadis, Aida? is on Curzon Home Cinema from 22 January",film
"Did the closing episode of The Mandalorian’s second season just give us the final appearance of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker in Star Wars? If so, the return of the original Jedi knight to carry away Baby Yoda to a future under his care, looks like a fitting farewell to the boy from Tatooine who destroyed the evil Empire. Especially as his last hurrah as a force ghost in the appalling The Rise of Skywalker let the side down. Yet what if this isn’t the end, but rather the beginning? Disney-owned Lucasfilm currently has a problem on its hands, one that Hamill and an army of CGI technicians are more than ready to handle: Star Wars fans can’t wait for the umpteen new TV shows that are due to spin off from The Mandalorian. Efforts based on Obi-Wan Kenobi’s middle years, Boba Fett’s later period and Ahsoka Tano’s post Clone Wars antics are perhaps the most heavily anticipated – but there is very little interest in more Skywalker clan-linked efforts of the kind that fuelled the space opera saga for nine movies after JJ Abrams inadvertently Death Starred the entire franchise last time out. This is largely a good thing. It was the relentless focus on the big beasts of the original movies that ultimately destroyed the sequel trilogy, specifically the decision to bring back Emperor Palpatine as a laughable zombie version of himself who proceeds to magic up a new Imperial fleet with a flick of his fingers. Strange we never heard of that particular Sith trick before. On the other hand, Hamill remains relatively unaffected by the abject failure of Rise of Skywalker. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, the Star Wars sequel in which Luke had the largest role, will almost certainly go down in posterity as the best film of the trilogy now that Abrams’ earlier The Force Awakens has been so badly tarnished by the director’s subsequent efforts. It explored fascinating and unexpected themes, such as the idea that Skywalker might find failure in his middle years having experienced nothing but relentless victory in his youth. But even if we don’t want to see those sad events played out in new movies, there are still decades of Luke’s life to explore, and it appears we now have the technology to experience them with the saga’s original actor in situ. IndieWire reports that Hamill was on set to play the digitally de-aged Luke in that final scene where Baby Yoda is passed to his new mentor, though it appears that Max Lloyd-Jones starred as the Jedi knight for the action sequence in which Luke thrillingly destroys a platoon of mechanised dark troopers. So why not bring Hamill back in a new movie? The Mandalorian has proven beyond doubt that there is ample room in the Star Wars galaxy for new adventures outside the traditional timeline – it operates entirely in the wake of the Rebels’ victory over the Empire in Return of the Jedi, a period before the rise of the First Order that was not previously considered to be fertile territory for the long-running saga. Recasting the role of Luke is one option, but that approach didn’t work out for the middling Solo: A Star Wars Story. Bringing Hamill back, especially given how spot-on the digital de-ageing looked for The Mandalorian, is surely the more palatable option. There might even be room to bring back a de-aged Harrison Ford as Han Solo for some brand new adventures with his old pal. Disney+ might be the obvious vehicle. But only the multiplex delivers the kind of budget that would allow Lucasfilm to put together the technical team needed for such an ambitious approach, and besides, Disney already has 10 TV shows in the works. Of course, some might say that the studio should leave well alone – that Hamill’s iconic performances in the original trilogy shouldn’t be stained by the possibility of future appearances not hitting the same heights. But we live in the Covid-era, in which the inability of mankind to do much else but sit in front of the telly most evenings means we demand more content than ever before, and the idea that popular characters and sagas won’t be recycled for the entertainment of the masses is naive. That spaceship has most definitely left the dock – hell, they are even bringing back Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. The best we can hope for is that new adventures live up to the excellent standard of The Mandalorian, and few would argue that Luke’s return ended up being the highlight of the entire show so far.",film
"Released in 2016, Jane Harper’s debut novel, The Dry, evoked a sense of sundried desperation and El Niño-inspired unease that felt as familiar to many Australian readers as the book’s genre trappings (its tagline, “a desperate act in a small town with secrets”, could apply to anything from Twin Peaks to Top of the Lake). The book hadn’t even hit shelves when producer Bruna Papandrea and screenwriter-director Robert Connolly started planning the film. Papandrea is perhaps best known today for adapting Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies for HBO, which swapped Sydney’s northern beaches for affluent, coastal California – but there was no separating The Dry from its western Victorian backdrop. “It just lends itself to mystery and suspense so well because you do have that undercurrent of danger in a lot of locations,” Harper says. Whether set in state forests, coastal communities or great, thirsty expanses of agricultural land, her four novels to date pick up on the duelling sensibilities of romanticism and dread that have recurred in Australian storytelling since colonisation. “It’s quite easy for things to go wrong quite quickly, which is a real gift for a writer.” The Dry, which opens in cinemas on Friday, follows off-duty Australian federal police detective Aaron Falk (Bana), who is reluctantly dragged back to his fictional hometown of Kiewarra after his childhood friend is found shot, dead along with their wife and son. The current case, and Falk’s presence in town, are complicated by his own implication in the death of another friend, Ellie (BeBe Bettencourt), decades earlier. Before making the film, Connolly hit the road with Bana so the pair could immerse themselves in the world of the book. “You drive one, two, three hours out of Melbourne, and by the time you cross four you’re into the Mallee region and the landscape changes immensely,” Connolly says. “I fell in love with it; it’s the most beautiful, extraordinary place. But it’s tough … you feel this muscular, tough lifestyle of the landscape set against its beauty.” In this tension, Harper’s characters inherit a settler narrative of pioneers carving hard-won homes and livelihoods from an often inhospitable, alien outback. It’s also part of a nation-building mythology that helped launder the realities of dispossession and environmental degradation on unceded country. (The Dry’s story of a complicated small-town homecoming rings very differently to that of Wiradjuri author’s Tara June Winch’s The Yield; in the film, a retired farmer, played by Bruce Spence, laments without irony how the automation of agriculture could all but clear the region of its people and communities – imagine that.) Like the novel, the film’s slow-burning plot crackles with other 21st century pressures and anxieties that seem ripped straight from a Four Corners report. While the apparent murder-suicide that initially draws Falk back home echoes all-too-common acts of male-perpetrated family violence, Harper’s books are also peppered with corporate crime, revenge porn, gambling addiction, crippling debt, preyed-upon backpackers and toxic masculinity that sweats into hi-vis and private school uniforms alike. Onscreen, Connolly frames Harper’s characters like ants set against the vastness of the landscape – and the scale of their problems. “Something Eric and I talked a lot about early on was not judging the characters that live in that world,” says Connolly, who also drew inspiration from Roman Polanski’s similarly water-driven whodunnit Chinatown. “There’s a version of these stories that’s like Deliverance – ‘urban character gets stuck in dark, horrific regional place’ – and that wasn’t our intention. We had to look deep into the heart of these damaged characters and the tough luck they’ve had, and find the humanity.” For Harper, that humanity was grounded in her 13 years as a print journalist. “It gave me a really good ability to listen to people’s stories and try to find a human element behind the headlines.” Inevitably, the greatest of the pressures facing these characters are drought and fire, both worsened by a changing climate that, counter to the denial of federal ministers in Akubra-and-moleskin cosplay, is evident on the land. Like its source novel, The Dry ties into a wave of recent local literature from Alice Bishop’s A Constant Hum to Jennifer Mills’ Dyschronia that reflect upon the impact of ecological disaster on small communities. “When I moved back to Australian in 2008 I got sent on a fire safety course as a reporter, so I could be safe in the event that I would have to go out and cover a bushfire,” Harper says. “I was stunned by what I saw and learned – I’d never seen that portrayal of fire. How quickly it goes from OK to deadly in the space of minutes, that’s always stayed with me.” Connolly says: “The big image of the film is Aaron standing in a river that’s now completely dry and remembering himself 25 years ago, swimming with his friends. It’s kind of devastating imagery. “Climate change and its impact on the land were present with us all the time,” he adds. “We were filming out in a part of Australia that is doing it really tough. Beulah, the town [on the poster], has drinking water issues. It’s ever present. Farmers are growing different grains than they used to because there’s not enough water, they’re adapting.” Much has changed since filming was completed in 2019. After the carnage of last summer’s bushfires, Australia is now entering a typically wetter (if still record-breaking) La Niña period. Worldwide protests have seen the very nature of the cop-centric crime drama reappraised. And now The Dry hits cinemas during a different kind of dry spell, as one of few new releases on what is typically one of Hollywood’s biggest days of the year. “We really tried to make this kind of, we call it, ‘hyper-Australian’ cinema,” Connolly says. “A big Australian film: big landscapes, big stories, music, stars – one that brings Australian audiences to the cinema to watch.” A year of lockdowns might also grant the film an edge neither Harper or Connolly could have scripted: only in 2020 could 117 minutes of a maskless Eric Bana freely travelling around the Victorian countryside also qualify as escapist fantasy.  The Dry is in cinemas from 1 January ",film
"Even in a year that has made us numb to strangeness, it’s been a funny old December: a festive season largely without festivities, while many will be spending Christmas apart from their usual crowd. With that in mind, the usual seasonal viewing options – those extravagant Christmas films that pile on the tinselly cheer – may feel out of step with the collective mood. A time, then, for Christmas films that permit a little wintry chill, some room for loneliness or pensive melancholy. Or exquisite misery, if you feel like plunging into the anti-Christmas genre at its most extreme with Mon Oncle Antoine – a Canadian classic that I hadn’t seen until recently. Made in 1971, Claude Jutra’s film is an unsentimental coming-of-age tale, following a Quebecer teen through about the least jolly Christmas Eve imaginable, as he assists his undertaker uncle in the collection and eventual rescue of a dead body. If that sounds solemn, it is, but there’s hard-won humanity amid the austerity, and Jutra has an eye for crisp, severe beauty. It’s also free to view on YouTube, thanks to the National Film Board of Canada’s marvellous archival channel. Dialling up the warmth several notches, Bill Forsyth’s wistful, gently absurd Comfort and Joy (1984; on Amazon Prime) begins with a breakup, as Scottish DJ Allan “Dicky” Bird (a droll Bill Paterson) is left single days before Christmas – but not wholly alone, as he finds himself improbably tangled in a turf war between rival ice-cream vendors. On its release, the film was seen as something of a letdown after Forsyth’s previous films, but time has been kind: it glimmers with home and kinship against bleak odds. You could pair it with either of two films about the unexpected consequences of one’s lover departing at Christmas: in both Lynne Ramsay’s mordant, oddly rapturous Morvern Callar (2002) and Zach Clark’s eerily deadpan White Reindeer (2013; both on iTunes), the young heroine’s partner abruptly dies, making for a holiday season of sudden independence and surprising escapades. You could say something similar for Tom Cruise’s nasty yet cathartic yuletide odyssey in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (1999; on Microsoft Store) – a weirdly evocative film that captures the silly season in all its sometimes alienating excess. Staying in New York’s sinister underbelly, Allen Baron’s 1961 thriller Blast of Silence is short, shadow-striped and razor-cut. A neo-noir tracking a hitman going about his business between Christmas and New Year, it’s niftily nestled in the Internet Archive. Nearly as minimalist, though a lot more colourful, Sean Baker’s iPhone-shot gem Tangerine (2015; on Google Play) has already attained seasonal counter-classic status with its jangly, touching study of two transgender sex workers spending the holiday together on the streets of Los Angeles. All of which isn’t to say the alternative Christmas film can’t partake of a little swooning romanticism. I’ll be rewatching Wong Kar-wai’s 2046 (2004; on Amazon) this coming week, bathing in the saturated, satiny colours of a time-shifting puzzle in which Christmas – and the lost loves and unsuccessful trysts that congregate around it – is the one constant. But I’ll be following it up with Todd Haynes’s dreamy, crystalline Carol (on Prime), a red-ribboned Christmas romance in which heartbreak does lead to the brink of ecstatic reconciliation: two people, alone against the world, heading into a new year and future together. What more do you really need to get through the holiday? The Prom (Netflix, 12A) The latest product of Ryan Murphy’s relentless Netflix content deal is also the first feature film he’s directed since 2010’s Eat Pray Love, and proves he has a better head for episodic TV. Adapted from a modest Broadway musical, this glitter-assaulted trifle centres on a vain quartet of New York stage luvvies, descending on a bigoted Indiana town to help a marginalised lesbian teen attend prom. Initially announcing its intent to satirise empty celebrity activism, it proceeds to fall into exactly that trap itself, with wet self-help songs, preening star performances from James Corden and Meryl Streep, and a forced air of sub-Glee gaiety – undercut by the film’s palpable confidence that it’s Really Helping People. The Macaluso Sisters (Curzon Home Cinema) Playwright-turned-film-maker Emma Dante’s charming, lace-delicate second film premiered in competition at this year’s Venice film festival, where it was overshadowed by beefier competition. So it’s a surprise and a delight to see a UK release for this deft, moving tale of sisterhood across multiple decades, which most impressively traces and braids the life stories of five women in under 90 minutes, its melodrama never feeling forced or compressed. Small Axe (BBC, 15) They’re all available free on the iPlayer, of course, but if you’re a physical media completist – or are Christmas gift-shopping for one – the five films making up Steve McQueen’s extraordinary television project have been gathered into a single DVD box set. Foregrounding London’s Caribbean community on a scale never previously seen on screen, it’s a rich, raging, celebratory quilt – in particular, Lovers Rock gives us the feverish party hit that this December has been missing.",film
"Ellen Burstyn is struggling to make herself heard above the sirens that are screeching across the city. “I live on a road that’s very popular with police cars and ambulances,” she says down the line from New York. She had been trying to tell me about the Oscars when she was interrupted by the racket. If she is nominated in March – and, with the odds of her winning best supporting actress currently at 5/1, she almost certainly will be – this would make her the Academy’s oldest acting nominee, having turned 88 this month. “At the moment, it’s Chris Plummer,” she says excitedly. “But I would beat him by 42 days! What a great crown that would be to wear.” If her performance in the Netflix drama Pieces of a Woman wins her a nomination, it will be her seventh. Over the last 50 years, Burstyn has been recognised for her portrayals of a jaded wife in The Last Picture Show; of a mother whose child is demonically possessed in The Exorcist; and of a widowed waitress who hits the road with her young son in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. In Same Time, Next Year, she played a married woman who meets annually with her lover; in Resurrection she was a car crash survivor who acquires healing powers; and in Requiem for a Dream she starred as the mother of a junkie who becomes an addict herself. Her sole win was for Alice, where the range of her performance still astonishes, running from distress and desolation to joy and outright comic pizzazz. Busy on Oscar night with the Broadway run of Same Time, Next Year, she sent Alice’s director Martin Scorsese to collect the award in her stead. In truth, she was relieved not to go. “I’m never really comfortable there. Everyone in borrowed gowns, smiling down the red carpet and being interviewed about, oh, I don’t know. But it’s not this kind of conversation, I can tell you. ‘Whose dress are you wearing? Whose diamonds?’” Attending is fine, she thinks, if the odds are against you. “I’ve gone other years when I felt more confident that I wouldn’t win. Whereas with Alice, I was not surprised that I won.” She lets slip a naughty laugh, perhaps realising that this might come across as less than humble. Her rivals at the 1975 ceremony included Gena Rowlands for A Woman Under the Influence and Faye Dunaway for Chinatown. The competition will be stiff again if Burstyn is nominated next year, as she is likely to be up against Amanda Seyfried for Mank, and Olivia Colman for dementia drama The Father. It was Burstyn who picked Scorsese to direct Alice, back in 1973 when her stock was far higher than his. Warner Bros, dazzled by how good she was in the dailies from The Exorcist, offered her any script she wanted. Seizing on Alice, which had once been proposed as a vehicle for Diana Ross, Burstyn then selected Scorsese, fresh from Mean Streets, to lend the project his freewheeling, improvisatory energy. Now, in what might be interpreted as a pleasing act of reciprocation, the director has lent his name to Pieces of a Woman as executive producer – “To make sure the film gets seen”, as Burstyn puts it. She plays Elizabeth, a steely matriarch with a clenched and joyless smile, who pressures her grieving daughter Martha to testify against a midwife after the death of her baby. Hair lacquered into a kind of crash helmet, Elizabeth charges head-first at life, refusing to allow fate the upper hand. The film’s indisputable highlight is a ferocious, eye-popping exchange between mother and daughter. As Martha, played by Vanessa Kirby, wavers over appearing in court, Elizabeth tries to tip the scales with a story about her own past – about her birth, in fact, during the Holocaust, when a doctor advised her mother to simply throw her away. “That speech kept growing,” she says. “Before I did my take, Vanessa said, ‘Convince me.’ Because her character had been resistant to the idea of court. I did the speech the way it was and then, just as I finished, I had the realisation that I had not convinced her as needed. So I carried on talking, and I did that part about, ‘Speak your truth, tell them how it is for you.’ How I said it, I don’t remember. It just came out of me. I was in the scene, you know? The fiction was the reality at that point. When I got to the end, I felt I had, in fact, made her want to go to court.” In her 2006 memoir, Lessons in Becoming Myself, Burstyn explains that her preparation for any role involves “taking an elevator down to my inner archive, where I quietly flip through the files until some memory rises up and offers itself”. What did she find down there that was relevant to Elizabeth? “You know, I never talk about that,” she says. “If I do, it loses its power. Personal memories are like tools I can call on for help. If I give it away to you, it won’t work for me any more, so I won’t answer that.” The elevator doors close firmly on the subject. She will confirm, though, that she has never resorted to the sort of harsh tactics that Elizabeth employs, swatting obstacles away with her chequebook. At one point, she tries to bribe her daughter’s partner, played by Shia LaBeouf, to leave town for ever. “I doubt I would ever do that,” she laughs. “It would have to be extreme circumstances.” Speaking prior to the recent allegations about LaBeouf’s abusive behaviour, Burstyn is full of praise for her co-star. “Shia is so fierce about being real. He isn’t standard issue.” I remind her that he once appeared on the red carpet at the Berlin film festivalwearing a paper bag with the words “I Am Not a Celebrity” daubed on it. “Oh, I read about that,” she says. “I never quite understood it.” Has fame ever been a burden for her? “I’ve never been one of those celebrities who got chased down the street by shouting throngs. People are always very nice to me. It hasn’t been at all unpleasant.” The same can’t be said of her life. Burstyn’s childhood in Detroit was marked by abuse of every kind, not least from her violent mother. “I’m surprised by how much I miss her these days, having had such a difficult relationship with her,” she says. “I have the impulse to call her very often. I say it out loud sometimes, ‘Mom, I wish I could call you.’” What would she say? “I think it’s just to go back over the past. I wish I could’ve been more helpful then and understood her point of view, rather than resisting. It would be nice to be able to talk to her about that now. And I do talk. I talk to the mother that lives inside of me.” How did the way she was raised affect her own parenting? “Well, I remember when I was a child having a mental notebook where I would say, ‘I’ll never do that when I’m a mother.’ I would make notes about what a good mother should and shouldn’t be. I think my son would tell you I was a very good mother. I’m sure if my mother and I could sit down and talk about it today, she would say she was sorry. Years later, when I was already an adult, I talked to her about being hit so much. I told her this was not a good thing. She said, ‘I’d never do it again, I’ll tell you that. Not now I know how much trouble it caused.’” She pauses. “I’m glad she understood that before she left.” Learning to “abide trouble and suffering”, she says, has stood her in good stead as an actor. “Otherwise you’re afraid to haul up those uncomfortable things in your work.” She trained at the Actors Studio in New York in the late 1960s after realising that she didn’t want the glitzy, fluffy star roles that lay ahead for her on the path she had been following for 10 years. She craved the tough stuff. She didn’t have to be Debbie Reynolds: she could be Marlon Brando. Burstyn is still intimately involved with the Actors Studio. In fact, she has to field a call from one of her co-directors in the middle of our conversation, to discuss an upcoming board meeting. “Hold on, I’m getting a call from Alec Baldwin,” she says. “Don’t go anywhere.” Her stint there, under Lee Strasberg, led directly to the string of films, including The Last Picture Show and The Exorcist, that transformed her career – and the whole of US cinema. If she is rarely invoked alongside Warren Beatty, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino as one of the faces of the American new wave, it can only be because she is, rather inconveniently, a woman. Casual moviegoers can recite those very masculine monologues from Taxi Driver, Five Easy Pieces or Network. Less familiar but every bit as scalding is the scene in The King of Marvin Gardens, from 1972, in which Burstyn offers her makeup, clothes and a few freshly-snipped locks of hair to a bonfire on the beach at Atlantic City. “They’re made out of mink hairs, did you know that?” she says as she sprinkles her false eyelashes on to the flames. “For 20 years, I’ve been wearing animal hairs on my face.” The sight of a woman dealing fearlessly on screen with age, decaying beauty and disappointment was a chastening one, more uncomfortable for many than the male equivalent. Burstyn’s experiences also prove that a woman has far less cultural credit in the bank when things go awry. All the industry clout she had built up during the 1970s evaporated after a pair of box-office flops: Same Time, Next Year and Resurrection. Two strikes and she was out, more or less, consigned for around 15 years to television, in the days when this was not a prestigious place to be. “That was it, girl, you know!” she said in an interview in 2000. “It’s a sin to have your films not make money.” Audacious directors who grew up on her work came eventually to the rescue, calling on her unusual capacity for being both benign and barbed, in films as diverse as The Yards, Requiem for a Dream, Interstellar and Wiener-Dog. She has had few opportunities, though, to be as loose and funny on film as she was in Alice. There has been plenty of slush in her career (The Spitfire Grill, Playing by Heart, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood) but a distinct dearth of laughs, unless you count the preposterous remake of The Wicker Man, where she presided gleefully over the torture-by-bees and eventual immolation of Nicolas Cage. The vital thing is that she survived Hollywood, a place she once described as a “hamburger machine”. How did she avoid being turned into mince? “It was never really my intention to be a movie star,” she says. “I always wanted to be as good as I could possibly be. That kind of goal leads you in a different direction to wanting to be a star, which can be a frightful experience. The fact that I’m still working at 88 tells me I did what I wanted to do.” The sirens have stopped wailing now. Calm settles over the city.",film
"Heroes Don’t Die is the second recent film – after Quentin Dupieux’s absurdist Deerskin, also due in the UK in 2021 – in which French high-flyer Adèle Haenel gets behind a camera to soothe a wounded male ego. Here she plays film-maker Alice, who decides to humour her friend Joachim (Jonathan Couzinié) who, after being collared in a Paris street by an angry Slav, comes to believe he is the reincarnation of Zoran, a Bosnian soldier who died on 21 August 1983 – the day he was born. The pair pack the digicam and head Balkans-ward to track down the truth. Debut director Aude Léa Rapin, co-writing with Couzinié, reaches for Nouvelle Vague-like sprightliness with this meta-filmic setup. But it has the unfortunate effect of spotlighting Heroes Don’t Die’s self-regard and hesitancy over what form to take. If it’s satirising first-person documentaries, it doesn’t keep that subject in sharp focus. The character-study element, as Alice begins to doubt Joachim’s sincerity about his belief in reincarnation, feels expedient. It engages only sketchily with Bosnian history: it situates its story in Bratunac, the next town over from Srebenica. This tempting proximity to seriousness, when a war widow draws parallels between her and Joachim’s situations, leads Rapin towards borderline misjudged musings (“It’s good to tell yourself stories.”) Haenel, the film’s moral centre, is capable of both the Clintonian hauteur she showed in Portrait of a Lady on Fire and a gabbling, caffeinated over-seriousness used to fine effect in 2018 French comedy hit En liberté!, but this film leaves her dashing between the two poles. True to form, though, for the film’s slightly maddening inconsistency, in the final 10 minutes – as Joachim encounters a peasant woman who may or may not be the dead soldier’s wife – a gripping, almost wordless scene delivers pathos, thematic depth and a poetic kick from a glorious Bosnian hillside all at once. Otherwise, it is a largely frustrating exercise; sometimes history is best left in the backdrop. ",film
"“India is two countries in one,” our hero Balram observes in The White Tiger: there is an India of light, preserve of the rich and powerful; and an India of darkness, where millions toil in poverty. The White Tiger is a vivid study of caste and servility, as Balram (Adarsh Gourav) ingratiates his way into the service of a wealthy family, until he realises he is consigned to reside in the darkness. “And don’t believe for a second there’s a million-rupee gameshow you can win to get out of it,” he says, in a dig at that other fantasy of Indian class mobility, Slumdog Millionaire. There is rarely a magical mechanism by which people are lifted out of poverty, but the movies are often happy to peddle that notion. We would be kidding ourselves if we thought The White Tiger’s class/caste analysis only applied to India. Elsewhere, it is either better disguised or presented as a fact of life, especially when it comes to stories about servants. The Hollywood equivalent to Slumdog would be a Cinderella fantasy such as Maid in Manhattan, in which Jennifer Lopez’s lowly hotel cleaner is whisked into the light by senator Ralph Fiennes. Nor is there much difference between Balram and, say, PG Wodehouse’s Jeeves, or the dozens of other downstairs domestics in British period fare such as Gosford Park or even the recent Bridgerton. They might detest their overlords but they know their place – usually serving tea in the background. It doesn’t have to be this way. The White Tiger readily brings to mind The Servant, Joseph Losey and Harold Pinter’s subversive 1963 study of a sly manservant (Dirk Bogarde) who steadily takes over the Chelsea home of his upper-crust employer (James Fox). Similar tales abound in European cinema: Losey’s follow-up The Go-Between for one, or Diary of a Chambermaid – following a young woman’s ordeal at the hands of the haute bourgeoisie. Jean Renoir filmed it in 1946; Luis Buñuel turned in a more unsettling version in 1964; there was also a 2015 remake. France’s infamous Papin sisters – maids who murdered their mistress in 1933 – inspired a host of works including Jean Genet’s play The Maids (Glenda Jackson and Susannah York starred in the 1975 film), Sister My Sister, and Claude Chabrol’s terrific La Cérémonie, starring Sandrine Bonnaire and Isabelle Huppert. Then there is that masterclass in British servility The Remains of the Day, in which Anthony Hopkins’s terminally repressed butler rues a lifetime of loyalty to a Nazi-sympathising toff (Fox again). Many of these stories are conveniently set in the past, which makes The White Tiger a dangerous modern rarity, although last year’s Parasite struck a very similar chord. Let’s not pretend the gap between the haves and have-nots has narrowed. Maybe the movies have some catching up to do.",film
"On 23 August 2007, Lindsay Lohan issued a statement to TMZ in the Hollywood dialect of professional contrition that hints at behind-the-scenes PR damage control. In its 11 brief sentences, she makes a plainspoken admission that she’s “addicted to alcohol and drugs”, that her destructive behavior is no one’s responsibility but her own, and that she’s ready to take the steps required to get her back on the path to wellness. While not quite a turning point for her career, which has remained stagnant over the past decade-plus of self-referential screen roles and regrettable pop singles and swiftly shuttered Grecian nightclubs, that press release did provide a fitting coda to the odd and sordid tale of I Know Who Killed Me. Released one month earlier, the mid-budget slasher vehicle for Lohan was derailed again and again by her personal life, even as its text was inextricably bound up in the same. Though DOA at the box office upon its critically savaged theatrical run, this widely, wrongly maligned film has been embraced by a growing mini-cult attuned to its aesthetic of surreal artifice and grim interplay with real life. We appreciate the irony of a woozy-headed meditation on the luster and tragedy inherent to the classic celebrity-in-peril archetype – which its star could not appear on Leno to promote due to a DWI arrest earlier that week. The troubled production process involved working around its leading lady’s mandate to spend 30 nights at the Wonderland rehabilitation facility, bouts of the often-euphemistic Tinseltown ailment “dehydration”, a not-at-all-euphemistic appendectomy, an infected surgical incision, and a paparazzi presence so relentless that a few shutterbugs ended up in the background of some shots in the finished film. But the baggage she dropped off at set only served to deepen and enrich the subtext of a stealth noir gem, one that gestures to a long-bygone era of movie stardom through the framework of a cheaper and dirtier sort of serial killer thriller. As a girl nextdoor seemingly transformed overnight into a vamp with a cigarette-rasped voice and formidable pole-dancing prowess, she brings the thought experiment of “what if Barbara Stanwyck had been fed through Disney’s wringer as a child?” to life in exhilarating fashion. Lohan is first introduced as Aubrey Fleming, the wholesome kind of all-American high schooler who still takes piano lessons and stops her boyfriend at second base. Aubrey promptly falls victim to a psycho with a predilection for using dry ice to peel off layers of skin like lasagna sheets, except that Lohan returns soon after on the side of the same road Cloris Leachman ran on to in Kiss Me Deadly. When she wakes up in the hospital short an arm and a leg, she insists that she’s femme fatale Dakota Moss, the hard-living daughter of a crack addict. The link connecting these two women goes beyond being the figurative yin to the other’s yang, and beyond the kooky Corsican-sister explanation for why Aubrey and Dakota have matching wounds. They constitute a hysterical parody of the cautionary tale projected on to all young women, teenaged starlets in particular, that their virginal innocence can be tarnished into slatternly moral dissipation with one wrong move. Director Chris Sivertson works in a lurid playfulness, offsetting the gratuitous gloved-hand gore some have likened to giallo with a tone of wry melodrama more redolent of the soap opera from Twin Peaks, another of his professed influences. He lets the Aubrey/Dakota duality bleed into the fabric of the film by using the combatting colors blue and red the way others might use black and white, rendering shadows as luminescent splotches and fading out between scenes not to literal darkness or light, but to hues suggesting an elemental good and bad. Lohan’s enacting a fame-ritual dating back to the entertainment industry of the 20s and 30s, gamely being the madonna and whore the tabloid-readers of the world demand she be, if only to show how absurd and outmoded the dichotomy is. Much of Lohan’s post-dry-out work has attempted to play on her public persona, to less than encouraging levels of success. (The less said of her addled, scantily clad, gun-toting nun from Machete, the better.) But for a minute there, it looked like she might have a future as a more skillfully scare-quoted version of herself, still possessed of the canniness and precocity she showed as a rising talent in The Parent Trap and Mean Girls. A close-minded America dismissed I Know Who Killed Me as working nadir of a woman hitting her own rock bottom. Little did they realize they were getting a glimpse of the Lindsay that could’ve been.",film
"Anger burns a hole through the screen in this stark monochrome picture from veteran director Andrei Konchalovsky: a gruelling re-enactment of the hushed-up Novocherkassk massacre in western Russia in 1962, when Red Army soldiers and KGB snipers opened fire on unarmed striking workers, killing an estimated 80 people. It was a day of spiritual nausea for the Soviet Union, which had only just entered Khrushchev’s new de-Stalinised era of supposed enlightenment – a postwar civilian bloodbath that was the Soviets’ Sharpeville, or Kent State, or Bloody Sunday, or indeed the Corpus Christi massacre in Mexico City that featured in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. Yuliya Vysotskaya – a longtime Konchalovsky player – plays Lyuda, a Communist party official and single mother who lives in a tiny flat in Novocherkassk with her 18-year-old daughter Svetka (Yuliya Burova) and grizzled old dad (Sergei Erlish). There are terrible food shortages, yet Lyuda is a loyal and uncomplaining party member who not so secretly pines for the good old days of Josef Stalin, when the Soviet Union was bathed in glorious wartime destiny and when things seemed to be better all round. Now she is having a furtive affair with a cynical and bleary married committee official who doesn’t even seem to like her very much. To the party’s uncomprehending disgust, a strike is triggered by exhausted workers’ rage at the sudden issue of lowered wages and food price rises and the party’s fatuous claim that this lethal combination will ease pressure on state finances and, therefore, create more plenty in the long term. There is horrifying chaos and slaughter: Svetka goes missing, and Lyuda embarks on a desperate quest to find her, dead or alive. What’s worse is that she has a party-loyalist reputation for endorsing precisely this kind of cruel crackdown and must suppress her secret anguish about her missing daughter and give an address to the party faithful beginning with the greeting: “Dorogie tovarishi!” (“Dear comrades!”) Konchalovsky clearly shows the incompetence, paranoia, bureaucracy and secrecy that created this mass murder. I found myself thinking about Craig Mazin’s recent TV drama Chernobyl. The same instincts are on display: to shut down the city, to cover everything up, smother everything and fail to understand. There is here an intense regional dislike of Novocherkassk and the whole area as the home of the untameable Cossacks and peasants. Lyuda’s father has grim memories of retributive local killings, and he reflects grimly on Mikhail Sholokhov’s And Quiet Flows the Don and its bitter vision. So much of the film’s pain is in that single word: comrade. (Lyuda keeps finding herself singing a rousing patriotic song from the movie that’s just been on TV: Grigory Alekandrov’s Spring, with its earnest chorus of, “Oh comrades, protect your motherland at all costs!”) The word denotes equality and brotherhood and anti-hierarchical idealism that does away with caste and class. In fact, the word functions as a sentimental kind of denial about the vertical structure of power everywhere, with everyone afraid of people above them – but also people below, who could snitch, or suddenly be promoted over them. There is a chilling moment after the massacre when a bewildered young woman is curtly told to sign an official document confirming that she will never reveal to anyone what has happened, but is then taken away, apparently to be executed, when the KGB official decides her behaviour at their brief interview has been unsatisfactory. This woman’s fate is, however, even stranger and scarier than we think. So the drama continues with officialdom blandly declaring that there will be a party with dancing that evening at 7pm, apparently to expunge any ill feeling, and also, given that the blood cannot be washed away from the asphalt and has somehow baked redly into it, a new layer of asphalt must be placed over it. On top of all this, Konchalovsky places an unexpected ending with its layer of bleak irony; it is a passionate drama of fear and rage.",film
"Stanley Kubrick’s enigmatic film 2001: A Space Odyssey has posed a puzzle from the first. The unsettling story of a manned space journey to Jupiter, it continues to intrigue audiences 50 years after its release. But now, thanks to a small British record label, a “lost” original song, commissioned especially for the film but never used, is winning admiration from fans for the way it catches the flavour of a cinematic one-off. “I gave the song what I believe is its first airplay on my Scala Radio show a few weeks back,” said Mark Kermode, the Observer’s film critic. “Audience reaction was utterly polarised, but I have the suspicion it will become a cult favourite. It is very ear-wormy.” Speaking to the Observer from California, the song’s composer, Mike Kaplan, a film-industry veteran and Kubrick’s former long-time publicist, said he is astonished to find a piece of music he put his heart into all those years ago is belatedly gaining airtime following its release as a single a few weeks ago by Bristol-based Wave Theory Records. “I know it doesn’t sound like anything else, and I am not sure how I managed to work it out,” said Kaplan, 77. “I could never do it again. But it is great to hear it being played.” The publicist was challenged to write the song, 2001: A Garden of Personal Mirrors, during a meeting with Kubrick and MGM records after they had all listened to the demo tape of another song that had been intended to help promote the film. Declining to use the downbeat tune, Kubrick turned to Kaplan, who he knew wrote music and who he felt understood his film: “I hear you write music. Why don’t you write something?” he said, according to Kaplan. After moonlighting on his day job to compose the song, Kaplan had it professionally mixed and sung by folk performer Naomi Gardner. “The intent was to capture the different responses 2001 was generating from audiences and the media, the many levels of interpretation and appreciation, from its hypnotic visuals to its metaphysical illuminations. We also wanted to instil curiosity among audiences who had not yet seen what was becoming a cultural phenomenon,” Kaplan has explained. He wanted to emulate the success of the quirky hit MacArthur Park, featuring Richard Harris, but when he played it to Kubrick the tinny reproduction on a portable machine did it no favours. Although the great director liked the title, he said he could not imagine it becoming a hit. The two friends never discussed the song again, although they continued to work together closely on A Clockwork Orange. Another composer, Alex North, also wrote a score for 2001, but Kubrick ultimately went for a classical work, Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra. Kaplan first met Kubrick in 1968 in a projection booth, where the director was told that the team promoting 2001 were having a hard time working out how to sell it to audiences. “We were confronted with a metaphysical drama encompassing evolution, reincarnation, the beauty of space, the terror of science and the mystery of mankind that required critics and audiences to surrender to its unique rhythms,” Kaplan explained. “With a visual narrative that jumped millennia, the 161-minute epic [original running time] contained only 22 minutes of dialogue.” After a two-hour discussion about the film, they shook hands and a long friendship began. The composer Dan Jones, founder of Wave Theory Records, said: “Attempting to write any music for Kubrick would be a daunting task, as Alex North – and now we discover Mike Kaplan – were both to discover. I was immediately struck by Mike’s song. It exudes the spirit of the time of its creation in New York. Both North’s atmospheric score and this celebratory single stand on their own musical terms, revealed years after their creation; and both of them give clues to the complex creative interactions that Kubrick’s films distilled.”",film
"Cinematic rethinks of classic fairytales, especially Red Riding Hood, are a micro-genre about as exasperating and banal as the “year X called and it wants its Y back” joke. In Hunted’s case insert, 1985 for X and “postmodern feminist trope” for Y. Nevertheless, this uncomfortable but adroitly executed horror version in which a young woman is chased through the woods by toxic male monsters is pretty good stuff: unnerving in the right ways and flecked with colourful, unexpected specks of wit. In what presumably must be rural Ireland given most of the supporting characters’ accents, Eve (Lucie Debay, feral and fierce) is a bit of an outsider, a French woman stuck in the middle of nowhere supervising the construction of a housing estate. A chance visit to a local bar brings her into the orbit of a charming, vulpine-featured nameless stranger who sounds American but is actually played by the French actor Arieh Worthalter. After he saves her from the aggressive attentions of another guy (Ciaran O’Brien), Eve lets down her guard only to find herself kidnapped by a psychotic, sadistic misogynist. Even worse, he’s a psychotic sadistic misogynist with a movie camera, and we all know how evil they are. From there on out, the rest of film is the narrative slap and tickle of escape-recapture as Eve, dressed in red duffel coat, tries to get away. She is in an ancient, soggy forest where there are a few other characters wandering around, ready to fill the roles of grandma and woodsman. But director Vincent Paronnaud, working from a script he co-wrote with Léa Pernollet and David H Pickering, adds a few kinks that divert the story from the tracks laid down by the fairytale origins. Thankfully, we only see glimpses of the footage of tortured women on the hideously believable nemesis’s camera, so ultimately the movie – just about – feels more like a critique of the character’s woman-hating mindset rather than a vehicle for it.",film
"British illustrator and visual-effects director Gavin Rothery makes his feature debut with this artificial intelligence thriller: a tale of love, death and robotics that has some nicely creepy moments. Set in 2038, it centres on lonely computer scientist George Almore (Divergent’s Theo James), who is holed up in a remote research facility in Japan secretly working on an android version of his wife Jules (Stacy Martin); she has died in a car crash. His prototype, J3 (also played by Martin), is his closest yet to the real thing: a highly advanced humanoid with spookily pale skin who looks like she might be the ghost of his dead wife. Poor old J1 and J2, his earlier, clunkier prototypes: they look on bitterly as the newer, sleeker model gets all George’s attention. The movie opens with sweeping helicopter shots over a snowy forest. Inside the concrete bunker-like facility, Rothery works wonders with a modest budget (he was behind the look of Duncan Jones’s Moon), creating an ungimmicky nearish future that looks a lot like today. When George’s corporate bosses threaten to pull the plug on his research, he hurries to put the finishing touches to J3 – a task involving the contents of a fridge-like archive unit containing his dead wife’s consciousness. George is surrounded by the robot versions of Jules. J1 is boxy, non-verbal and baby-like. J2 is a little more advanced: she can speak, and behaves like a teenager, huffing jealously when George removes her legs to give to J3. In the end, George is playing God – creating a woman not from a rib but electrical components and computer programming. The script’s take on this is romantic: here is a man who’ll do whatever it takes to be reunited with his wife. I couldn’t help finding it a bit more sinister; when J2 misbehaves, George orders her back to her docking station. He is in control. (Anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch.) And the final ta-da revelation felt a bit contrived. Still, Archive is refreshingly non-cerebral – and that’s a compliment. It’s a sci-fi movie that wants to entertain, not deliver a lecture on AI.",film
"The FBI’s secret campaign of bugging, harassment and defamation against Martin Luther King Jr in the 60s is the subject of this startling but sometimes frustratingly reticent and guarded documentary. This poisonous dirty-tricks campaign continued until King’s assassination in Memphis in 1968, a murder that the bureau was somehow unable to prevent, despite its fanatical round-the-clock surveillance of King as well as its loudly proclaimed dedication to crimefighting. It is now a matter of record that King was a flawed human being and had extramarital sex, but this is an enduringly mysterious part of his public image. (Even Ava DuVernay’s very fine biopic account of King in her 2014 movie Selma, starring David Oyelowo, tactfully romanticises these indiscretions.) The bureau’s audio tapes of alleged meetings in hotel rooms were finally, in 1977, handed over to the National Archives by order of a federal judge but sealed – they cannot be released until 2027 at the earliest. What exactly will they prove? Anything at all? All we have right now are the typescripts of the agents’ highly subjective summary reports. This film from Sam Pollard, based largely on the work of Pulitzer-winning historian David J Garrow, shows how bizarrely toxic and dysfunctional the FBI’s campaign was, an ongoing secret war that involved running informants within the civil rights movement – a painful and even tragic aspect of this history that probably deserves a documentary of its own. Bureau director J Edgar Hoover was incensed by King’s leftist associations, and by his international celebrity, especially after he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1964. After chancing on evidence of his adultery, Hoover hoped to use this to undermine him, and with extraordinary spite circulated the tapes to King’s wife Coretta and even to church leaders and the press, apparently hoping (in vain) that someone would go public. There was even a suggestion that King was present at a rape – and this film, very gingerly indeed, comes close to hinting that there might one day be a #MeToo case to answer. But wait. Where is the proof here? Where is the naming of names? Surely the bureau, with all the dark powers at its command, could have induced one of King’s alleged mistresses to come forward and go public? Apparently not. It is a question that this film does not fully address, although it certainly gives us a queasily detailed picture of Hoover’s pure paranoid nastiness.",film
"When it comes to TV, Star Wars is sitting very pretty after the enormous success of Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian, a space opera tour de force that has completely re-routed Disney’s vision for its long running saga. All of a sudden, we are due to see multiple enticing spin-offs centred on characters including Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano and Cara Dune, which will eventually culminate in a grand crossover event involving the soft-hearted bounty hunter. Star Wars’ number one rule – that members of the Skywalker clan must be at the heart of all major events – has been Death Starred in less time than you can say: “Great shot kid, that’s one in a million!” But how about the big screen, where Star Wars began, and where – until very recently – it was always imagined the saga’s most vital moments would play out? Here, we find ourselves in a very different place, with the once promising sequel trilogy having ultimately disappointed due to a lack of fresh thinking and an approach to macro-storytelling more chaotic than a box of angry Krykna. This week we got the titbit of news that Marvel supremo Kevin Feige’s long-mooted Star Wars movie is still moving ahead, with Rick & Morty producer Michael Waldron now on board to write the screenplay. Waldron is also writing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and is head writer on the upcoming Disney+ series Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston’s prince of mischief. In short, he’s being trusted with a whole heap of Disney-owned properties. Then there’s Rogue Squadron, the starfighter spin-off that Wonder Woman’s Patty Jenkins was recently tapped to direct, about which little is known other than it looks like another off-centre project. Finally, of the movies still thought to be on Lucasfilm’s current slate, there’s another untitled film from Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi, about which very little is yet known. We do have – back on TV – upcoming shows based on the early lives of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Lando Calrissian. So it is not as if the Skywalker clan and their pals have been completely scrubbed from galactic history. But it would be a shock to see any of these films continuing where the messy and disappointing Rise of Skywalker left off. There was a sense, watching that movie, that Disney-era directors of Star Wars had become trapped by the overwhelming legacy of 40-plus years of space opera shenanigans, to the point that it made more sense to wipe the slate clean and start again with fresh story arcs, free of the terrible pressure inspired by legions of fans watching one’s every move. That’s precisely what Rian Johnson’s proposed new Star Wars trilogy was once intended to do, prior to The Mandalorian changing everything. The Last Jedi film-maker was announced in November 2017 as the director of a new triptych set in an as-yet-undiscovered corner of a galaxy far, far away. But very little has been heard about these movies since October 2019, when Johnson cryptically told Entertainment Tonight he would still be “thrilled if it happens”. That’s a pity, for divisive as The Last Jedi turned out to be, it was still the only film in the sequel trilogy to really try to shake up the saga. The worry is that Johnson’s ideas might no longer sit in the sweet spot where Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy currently sees the saga going, which seems to be centred on either the Mandalorian-verse or fan-friendly nods to supporting characters from the original trilogy. The basic plan seems to be a shift into what we can only refer to as a kind of Hollywood populism: taking anything that has worked in previous Star Wars ventures and expanding on it. This is why Donald Glover is returning as cocky smuggler Calrissian (as pretty much the only character in Solo: A Star Wars Story that fans really took to), and Rogue One’s Diego Luna is back as Cassian Andor for his own Disney+ spin-off. And yet, if the future of Star Wars is to match its glorious past, we need something more than this cosy, reactive creativity. We know nothing about the grand plan for the big screen – will all these new movies exist within the same timeline, so that their major players can be brought together Marvel-style for another grand space opera smackdown? Or will Star Wars remain content to play out in the margins for the time being? For those of us who witnessed the mess Lucasfilm made of the over-ambitious sequel trilogy, such short-term thinking might seem a safer bet than the alternative. And yet at some point the Disney-owned studio will need to find a way to mirror the success of the original trilogy by telling a multiple-episode tale that transports us once again to the whirling, mesmeric cosmic playground of our dreams, to a galaxy that seemed creatively limitless. It doesn’t seem like too much to ask – just don’t bring back Emperor Palpatine yet again or we’ll have to feed you to the krayt dragon.",film
"“Give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man.” Aristotle might well be pleased that his maxim was the inspiration behind one of the most celebrated TV documentary series of all time – now the legacy of director Michael Apted, who has died at the age of 79. Tony Walker, who appeared in all nine of the award-winning Up series – which charted the lives of 14 British children from 1963 with Seven Up, through to their 60s, with last year’s 63 Up – led tributes to Apted yesterday. The former taxi driver from east London said Apted, who died on Friday, was “like a family member to me. I loved the man dearly and I’m quite devastated at his passing.” Thomas Schlamme, president of the Directors Guild of America, described apted as a “fearless visionary as a director”. He “saw the trajectory of things when others didn’t, and we were all the beneficiaries of his wisdom and lifelong dedication.” He added: “Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn [his] passing.” The producers of the James Bond film franchise paid tribute to his ability to move “effortlessly and successfully between all genres”. In 1999, Apted directed The World Is Not Enough, starring Pierce Brosnan. “He was beloved by all those who worked with him,” tweeted Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. Apted was born in 1941 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, later moving to London with his family. As a teenager he developed a love of cinema, describing watching Ingmar Bergman’s Wild Strawberries as a “road to Damascus moment”. After studying at Cambridge, he joined Granada where he was asked to find children to take part in a one-off documentary. Among the 14 chosen were three boys from a prestigious private school, a boy from a small farm in the Yorkshire Dales, a London boy – Walker – and an east London girl. The show was an early forerunner of reality TV, but focussed on social history and inequality rather than fleeting celebrity and vacuous challenges. It was a success but no further shows were planned. A casual inquiry about the children’s progress led to 14 Up in 1970, this time with Apted as director. He directed all subsequent series. He also worked on Coronation Street in the 1960s, and directed the country music classic Coal Miner’s Daughter, starring Sissy Spacek as singer Loretta Lynn in 1980. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, with Spacek winning best actress. Apted’s movie credits included Gorillas in the Mist, Continental Divide and Critical Condition. His final film was the 2017 thriller Unlocked, starring Orlando Bloom, Michael Douglas and John Malkovich. But the Up series, which won three Baftas, was his most enduring work. It starkly illustrated the differences in life opportunities for children depending on their backgrounds, and charted the personal challenges and traumas faced by participants. Kevin Lygo, managing director of ITV, which broadcast Up, said the series “demonstrated the possibilities of television at its finest in its ambition and its capacity to hold up a mirror to society and engage with and entertain people while enriching our perspective on the human condition. “Michael’s contribution to film and programme-making continues to be felt and he will be sadly missed.” George Jesse Turner, a cameraman who filmed all but the first two series, told the Observer last year: “It was about class in the beginning, but it was not done scientifically, in the way it would be now. It was quite random, simply going to schools in London and Liverpool and the Lake District.” Apted, he said, was “good to work with. When we go out to film, he is never one to say he would like a particular shot. He leaves it to me.” Walker, now 65, whose childhood ambition was to become a jockey, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that, when he was chosen for the series, “I was a sort of street-urchin kid. I was just excited that the cameras were on me at the time, and I never knew what the implications were. “Most of all, Michael gave you that warm feeling. it was like a Catholicism, every time I heard his voice. it was like going to a psychiatrist… [I had] complete trust in him. I’m really sad, I’ve known Michael for all my life really, but for seven years.”",film
"Graham Greene famously declared Patricia Highsmith “the poet of apprehension” in the foreword to her 1970 short story collection Eleven. There’s no better way to describe the American writer, whose psychological thrillers meld gliding literary cool with a jangling morass of nerves – a combination, in turn, that film-makers have been trying to translate since the middle of the last century. This coming Tuesday marks the centenary of Highsmith’s birth, and her allure to screenwriters remains undimmed in 2021. A glossy new Ben Affleck-starring film of her novel Deep Water, the first film from Adrian Lyne in 19 years, is scheduled for August, while a TV version of Ripley, starring Andrew Scott as her most adaptable character, is in the pipeline. They’ll join a large and variable roster of Highsmith screen adaptations, ranging from cast-iron classics to mouldering B-movies. It’s no easy subgenre to enter, the bar having been set impossibly high right off the bat – by Alfred Hitchcock, no less, whose perfectly sinuous film of Highsmith’s debut novel, Strangers on a Train (on Amazon Prime), released just a year after the book’s 1950 publication, surely played some part in cementing her own elegantly nasty reputation. A murder-swapping mystery shot in woodcut-sharp monochrome, it still finds room in its skin-tight plotting for hovering waves of queer energy. Hollywood wouldn’t attempt Highsmith again for some time, but in the 1960s, European cinema entered a long-term love affair with her work – beginning with René Clément’s pristinely chic Plein Soleil (Amazon), an adaptation of The Talented Mr Ripley that kicked off an ongoing, international tangle of further Ripley tales and interpretations. Clément’s oblique, sun-bleached introduction to identity-thieving serial killer Tom Ripley (played, never more beautifully, by Alain Delon) has little in common stylistically with Wim Wenders’ Germanic, foggily atmospheric The American Friend (BFI Player), which bathes Ripley’s subterfuge in a coffee-stained 1970s palette, nor with Anthony Minghella’s marvellous The Talented Mr Ripley (1999; Chili), the starry, glamorous classicism of which only briefly disguises its perverse, inky heart. Less celebrated but fascinating, Liliana Cavani’s 2002 film Ripley’s Game (iTunes) revisited the turf of Wenders’ film with less wintry ambience and more slithery, Malkovich-headed madness. That these films are so disparate only feels right: Ripley’s screen legacy is as shape-shifting as he is. Other, non-Ripley European spins on Highsmith are thin on the ground in the streaming realm – or were, until I stumbled upon Church of Film, a Vimeo streaming service set up by a Portland-based repertory cinema project of the same name, dedicated to the rare and the little-screened. There, you can find a Highsmith mini-festival including Claude Chabrol’s slinky nightmare of male obsession The Cry of the Owl (1987); a chilly earlier dip into Deep Water (1981), ideally cast with Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Louis Trintignant; Claude Miller’s unfussy but satisfying This Sweet Sickness (1977), starring a young Gérard Depardieu; and, heading back to Germany, a brisk, stern, Oscar-nominated adaptation of her wrongful-imprisonment story The Glass Cell (1978) that Highsmith herself rather approved of. More recently, as highlighted last month in this very column, Todd Haynes’s swoon-worthy Carol (2015; Amazon Prime), adapted from Highsmith’s one outright lesbian-themed novel, holds the gold standard. It’s not quite rivalled by such honourable attempts as Hossein Amini’s sexy, gorgeously dressed period runaround The Two Faces of January (2014; Google Play), nor by the diverting but low-impact A Kind of Murder (2016; Microsoft), nobly led by Patrick Wilson. But in cinema, even medium Highsmith has it pleasures. Expect many more variations over the next hundred years. My French film festival (Curzon Home Cinema) The annual online festival dedicated to new voices in French cinema is under way until mid-February, and should find a larger audience than usual in lockdown times. This year’s lineup mingles shorts and features, youthful comedies with oddball ghost stories and more: the names are largely unfamiliar, so taking chances and diving in is the way to go here. Working Girls, a study of border-crossing sex workers that Belgium has entered into the Oscar race, merits a second glance. If you want guaranteed greatness, meanwhile, a classic slot has been reserved for Jean Cocteau’s dreamy Orpheus. Archive (Amazon/iTunes, 15) British director Gavin Rothery has a background in graphic design and visual effects, which is plain to see in the gorgeous, steely surfaces of his debut feature, well-led by Theo James as an isolated AI scientist trying to digitally resurrect his wife. There’s much promise here, but the shadow of Ex Machina looms too large over it. Away (iTunes, U) Now available digitally after its cinema release in August, Latvian animator Gints Zilbalodis’s beautiful, thoughtful long-journey-home adventure is a rare children’s film with a healthy dose of surrealism and melancholy: consistently endearing, never too cute. Relic (Signature, 15) Australian writer-director Natalie Erika James’s debut is one of a run of recent films to address the trauma of dementia, though its approach is bracingly original and moving. A sharp, tingling horror film that fashions fading memory as its own kind of haunted house, it walks a tricky line with tact and style to spare.",film
"Name: Samantha. Age: 64. Not your 64. Hollywood 64. Call it 48. Appearance: No. What do you mean “no”? She’s not appearing. In what? Also, who’s Samantha? O tempora! O mores! How quickly we forget and the cultural discourse moves on. That doesn’t help me. There was a time when it would no more need explaining who “Samantha” was than that the sky is blue or grass is green, such was the fame of Sex and the City and its quartet of fast-living, quick-loving and heavily brunching heroines. Oh, them! Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha! There you go. So, what has happened to her? Please can it be the wiping of her line “Lawrence of my labia” in the second SATC movie from the global digital record? Alas, it is not. Rather, it has been announced that SATC is to return in a series called And Just Like That… It will be 10 half-hour episodes following the gals as they adventure through life, love and more brunches in their 50s – but without Samantha. They think there’s a show without Samantha? There’s not even a decent brunch without Samantha. Where’s all the angst-free sex and non-neurotic light relief going to come from? Whose stupid idea was this? Take it up with Kim Cattrall. The actor declined to return to her role. Don’t tell me – she left a Post-it note on Carrie’s laptop screen saying: “I’m sorry – I can’t. Don’t hate me.” That would – pause to spit on the memory of Berger – have been excellent, but no. She simply refused (apparently repeated) attempts to bring her back to the fold. I assume the long-rumoured animosity between Cattrall and her co-star Sarah Jessica Parker is behind this decision. Or is it just the fear of being made to say something like “Lawrence of my labia” again? Most people are assuming the former, although I’m sure they would have just as much sympathy for the latter. We might, incidentally, do away with the “long-rumoured”, thanks to Cattrall’s 2018 Instagram post, aimed at Parker, about “how cruel you really were then and now”. Yowch. Quite. I suppose she doesn’t need the money, either. Or the work. Cattrall has been probably the busiest of the SATC stars since the show ended, carving out a second-act career primarily in the UK on television and on stage, appearing in some prestigious stuff. I still cannot help but wonder if it’s a doomed venture without her. It’s 2021. It matters not a jot either way. Do say: “I look forward to as complex, fresh, funny and fearless an examination of the sixth decade of womanhood as the original SatC provided for the fourth.” Don’t say: “Sponsored by Vagisil.”",film
"Model-turned-actor Ruby Rose (Orange Is the New Black, John Wick: Chapter 2), is utterly mesmerising to look at – with her lush lips, perfectly shaped eyebrows and macho tattoos – but so far the jury is very much out on whether she can act more than merely adequately. This action vehicle doesn’t exactly strengthen the case for her defence, although she moves with impressive grace in the actiony bits when required in closeups that show her character, Ali, whupping bad guys’ asses. Rose is meant to be a former marine, haunted by a botched assignment that cost the lives of a family she was protecting. In the film’s present tense, she takes a job as a doorman – shouldn’t it be “lobby attendant” or even “doorperson”? – at a posh New York City building, only to wander accidentally into a heist that goes very wrong. A strangely immobile-featured Jean Reno offers an almost self-parodying turn as the snobbish yet brutal French mastermind of the criminal gang, who are looking for paintings looted by the Nazis years back. Ali must protect the husband (Rupert Evans), teenage son (Julian Feder) and irritatingly spunky daughter (Kíla Lord Cassidy) from harm – which involves a lot of skulking in the building’s secret passageways, making for a mostly one-set shoot that looks like it saved a lot on budget. Director Ryuhei Kitamura, whose career began with pulpy horror fare, directs with efficiency but a seeming total lack of awareness of how silly this all looks from a distance. There’s little humour or invention to leaven the deadened inertness of the script.",film
"One thing is certain: vanilla ice cream was eaten. The rest? If only we knew. The year is 1964 and activist Malcolm X, singer-songwriter Sam Cooke and American football player Jim Brown gather in Miami, Florida, to cheer boxer Muhammad Ali – then Cassius Clay – to his first world heavyweight championship. No celebration is planned because he was not expected to win, so the four repair to Malcolm’s hotel room in the segregated African American part of town. Their little-known meeting intrigued writer Kemp Powers when he read about it in Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties, a book about the intersection of civil rights and sport by Mike Marqusee. “It was like a tossed-out paragraph and it’s one of those things where you stop and go back and go, wait, what?” Powers recalls in a Zoom interview. “That sparked a great deal of interest because they were probably four of the most iconic black men to me in my life at that time, so I set about doing a lot of research because I wanted to know how they all met one another.” A journalist at the time, Powers had to endure pre-internet research involving long-distance travel to hunt out-of-print biographies and obscure VHS recordings. Efforts to contact Brown – still alive today – and Ali were unsuccessful. The events of that night remained tantalisingly elusive. What was a curse for a journalist, however, proved a blessing for a playwright. When he switched careers to creative writing, Powers saw the story’s potential in a new light. “It seemed like the very thing that stopped me and stymied me researching the book, which was I couldn’t really figure out too much of what went on in the room, felt like the perfect grist for a stage drama.” The upshot was One Night in Miami, a 2013 stage play that earned an Olivier award nomination when it was directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah at London’s Donmar Warehouse a few years later. Now comes a film version adapted by Powers and starring the British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir as Malcolm, Eli Goree as Clay, Aldis Hodge as Brown and Hamilton’s Leslie Odom Jr as Cooke. Most of the action takes place in the secluded hotel room, with the audience a fly on the wall as conversations zig and zag between the trivial and the tragic. Clay, just 22, cocky, beautiful and barely scratched by the big fight, is about to rattle much of white America by announcing his name change and allegiance to the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist movement that worships Allah. Powers says: “When Ali lit the torch at the Olympics [in 1996], he was at the time the most beloved athlete in the world. But in the 60s a lot of the same people despised him like a demagogue. It’s interesting to see the change in the perception, almost to the point where it seemed like it was prudent for people to forget his politics. “He was vocal about things that people would not be vocal about and that was aggressive for someone so young. He was willing to even sacrifice his own career on behalf of those beliefs.” Malcolm was among the most prominent members of the Nation of Islam and the film conveys in him a mix of charm, ferocity and fragility. Powers says: “Malcolm’s philosophy was incredibly powerful and moving to all of those men. When Sam Cooke was killed in a hotel in Los Angeles in December that year, his red Ferrari was parked outside and inside it they found a bottle of whisky next to a copy of Muhammad Speaks. “That little thing says so much about Malcolm’s philosophy and politics getting into the head of this pop crooner: he had a copy of the Nation of Islam paper in his car on the night he died. Those are the details that give me the grist for this story and the relationships.” But the true heavyweight bout of this film does not involve Clay. Malcolm accuses Cooke of indulging in respectability politics, arguing that he should be using his voice “for the cause” of black liberation instead of entertaining mostly white crowds. “You’re a monkey dancing for an organ grinder to them,” he says. Cooke contends that his success as black businessman, boosting the careers and incomes of other black artists, is a form of liberation in itself. Then Malcolm puts Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind on a record player and pointedly asks how it is that “a white boy from Minnesota speaks more to the struggles of our movement than anything you’ve written in your life”. (Cooke did respond to Dylan’s song with A Change is Gonna Come.) As in many strong plays, the author doesn’t choose sides, or rather takes both sides at the same time. Powers recalls: “The joy of seeing it on stage was watching the audience get behind one philosophy and then seeing them have to go [sharp intake of breath] and turn on a dime when the retort made as much if not more sense. Probably the strongest case of that was the fight between Malcolm and Sam where Sam tells a story about the Rolling Stones and his influence on them. “Often in the stage production, by the end of that, the audience would applaud, ‘Yeah, you told him’. And then Malcolm puts on Blowin’ in the Wind and that same audience would sing along and go, ‘Yeah, what he just said’. It was always hilarious to watch that happen in real time because it really never got old and just goes to show that you can look at things from a slightly different perspective and it seems so obvious.” It is a classic tension: activist versus artist. Does a high-profile performer or sportsperson have an obligation to march, protest and use their megaphone? Or is their work alone enough to known down barriers, show what is possible and embody the change they seek? For Powers the question is personal. “Honestly, the fight between Malcolm and Sam, that’s my internal monologue going on inside my own brain on a regular basis. That’s why if we’re successful, people shouldn’t come away feeling one person is particularly right or wrong because the answer is who is right or wrong is situational. “There are some days where the best way I could bring about change and move things forward is to work within the system. But then there’s other days where the system is so broken it needs to be torn down. There are days that call for us to be more like Malcolm X and days that call for us to be more like Sam Cooke. The reality of it is, for a movement to really bring about change, you need some Malcolm Xs and some Sam Cookes.” Within a year of that night in Miami, both Cooke and Malcolm had been gunned down. Powers’ own life turned on a tragedy. When he was 14, playing with his mother’s gun at home in New York, he accidentally shot and killed his best friend, also 14. The friend’s parents forgave him and did not press charges; he was sentenced to a year of counseling; his criminal record was expunged on his 16th birthday. He wrote about the experience in The Shooting: A Memoir in 2004 before embarking on the research that would form the basis of One Night in Miami, which starts streaming on Amazon on Friday. He is already riding high as co-director and co-writer of Soul, the first Disney Pixar movie to feature a black lead character. “I have two movies out right now that I wrote, and one of them is my Malcolm X and one is my Sam Cooke. This is an independent film, just my pure putting my voice out there. Soul is a Disney Pixar film. I’m working within a system and I would like to think that both are effective in different ways and positive and in different ways. My own life in the art that I put out is an example of how you can do different things.” Commentators have inevitably joined dots between last summer’s racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd and the release of One Night in Miami. Malcolm exhorts: “Our people are literally dying in the streets every day.” But Powers resists glib compartmentalisation. “Nothing that I’ve done has been in reaction to any of this. Ultimately, everything that I’m doing is trying to get to the humanity of these characters and, if anything, reveal some universal truths. I’ve always said that hyper specificity should enable us to see the universality in a lot of these themes and I’ve always hated the fact that the humanity of the black characters is often forgotten.” This play about four men, written by a man, is directed by a woman, Regina King, acclaimed as an actor in films such as If Beale Street Could Talk and TV dramas such as Watchmen. One Night in Miami is the first movie directed by an African American woman shown at the Venice film festival. Powers is delighted. “We all have our blind spots and the play is such a testosterone-driven story and potentially the film could have been,” he says. “Regina’s going to be inquisitive about certain things and make certain decisions where I like to believe a male director would probably make different ones. I think her decisions made the film better. “A great example would be the conversation between Malcolm and his young daughter in the film. That wasn’t in the script initially. Regina, through her network of women, reached out to Malcolm’s oldest daughter. She told her about how her father used to leave hidden notes in books and then call and send them on scavenger hunts. “Regina called me and said, ‘That’s so amazing. I didn’t know that about Malcolm, You should write that in.’ And I wrote it into the script. That was a discovery that I genuinely believe would never have been made with a male director.” Malcolm was assassinated in 1965. Had he lived, he would have turned 95 this year. What would he have made of today’s America, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, from Black Lives Matter to the sacking of the US Capitol by a largely white mob? “Malcolm would probably be like, ‘I told you so,’ just like James Baldwin would be like, ‘I told you so’. A lot of these guys, the reason they feel like prophets is because they literally were saying exactly what was going to happen if we didn’t face up to our own history and these problems. And now it’s all exploding.”",film
"Veteran film-maker, screenwriter, theatre and TV director Andrei Konchalovsky’s career is nothing if not eclectic. He co-wrote Tarkovsky’s 1966 classic Andrei Rublev, while his directorial CV ranges from an acclaimed 1970 adaptation of Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya to Venice prize winners The Postman’s White Nights and Paradise, via the Kurosawa-originated white-knuckle thriller Runaway Train and the ill-fated Hollywood buddy cop action film Tango & Cash, from which he was removed mid-shoot. Konchalovsky’s latest (once again feted at Venice) is among his finest work, a harrowing drama set in 1962, in the provincial USSR town of Novocherkassk. Julia Vysotskaya plays Lyudmila (AKA Lyuda), a stalwart party official who served as a battlefield nurse during the second world war, and who retains a nostalgic devotion to Stalinist ideals in the age of Khrushchev. “What am I supposed to believe in if not communism?” Lyuda asks, as her political devotions are challenged in the fallout of a factory strike and protest, to which the army and/or KGB (precise attribution is a thorny issue to be wrestled with) respond with deadly force. As the authorities rush to cover up a state-sponsored atrocity, Lyuda searches for her missing teenage daughter, Svetka (Yulia Burova), for whose life she fears in the wake of terrible violence. The horrifying events in Novocherkassk upon which Dear Comrades! is based (briefly reported in Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago) were not officially acknowledged or investigated for 30 years. Significant, then, that Yuri Bagrayev, who led the investigator’s team in 1992, acted as a consultant on the script, co-written by Konchalovsky and Elena Kiseleva. Meanwhile, Konchalovksy cites films such as Mikhail Kalatozov’s The Cranes Are Flying and Grigori Chukhrai’s Ballad of a Soldier as stylistic reference points for his disturbingly handsome feature, which presents its bleakly crisp black-and-white images in a retro 4x3 frame. Seamlessly blending exterior shots of Novocherkassk with grand sets constructed in Moscow, Konchalovsky creates an utterly convincing air of mounting chaos, brilliantly captured on multiple cameras marshalled by cinematographer Andrey Naydenov. Yet this is no Paul Greengrass-style exercise in frenetic docu-fiction, spurred on by a blur of handheld footage. On the contrary, Naydenov and Konchalovsky opt for an eerie stillness that bizarrely amplifies the film’s impact. Amid the increasingly confused cacophony of unfolding events, the comparative calm of the visuals strikes a horribly threatening chord. Despite the true grit of its historical setting, it’s the personal story of Lyuda’s journey from stoical party hardliner to frantically aggrieved mother that draws the audience in. Vysotskaya is terrific in the central role, capturing both the dreams and disillusionment of a character who strives to repress, rather than express, her emotions, offering a staunch face to the world even when confronting an unimaginable reality. Whether she’s struggling to control her fear in a hospital or in the toilet fending off silent screams, Lyuda’s predicament is made all the more affecting by Vysotskaya’s ability to convey great turmoil with minimal action. Throughout, Konchalovsky juxtaposes wide-ranging events with seemingly insignificant details to dramatic effect. In an early scene, a hole in Svetka’s sock proves no more than a scolding distraction; later it will return in gut-wrenching form, having assumed catastrophic significance. There’s a similar tension at play in the film’s pointed use of song, with patriotic tunes evoked to devastating effect during moments of desperation in a manner that reminded me of Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War. Here, the chilliness of the story is shot through with an unexpected warmth that ensures immediate emotional engagement with distant events.  On Curzon Home Cinema",film
"The year is 1971 and David Bowie (Johnny Flynn) is about to embark on his first US tour. Except he only has a tourist visa and so he’s not supposed to perform – convenient, given that the film-makers were unable to secure the rights to any of Bowie’s original music. Its omission is noticeably awkward, with Flynn doing inert versions of tracks Bowie covered, such as Jacques Brel’s My Death, as a clumsy workaround. The narrative centres around a supposedly formative road trip Bowie took with his American publicist Ron Oberman (Marc Maron), suggesting that encounters with Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground helped give birth to Bowie’s alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Troublingly, flashbacks that look at Bowie’s relationship with his half-brother Terry Burns (Derek Moran) imply that the singer’s family history of psychosis also played a significant part in the creation of his onstage persona. A title card indicates that the film is fictionalised and so perhaps shouldn’t be scrutinised for fidelity. Still, the whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie’s maverick spirit.",film
"With the levels of global hysteria that had built up around the 1999 release of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, it was always destined to disappoint. Initial reviews of the film were actually sort of positive. Critics picked up on the fact that a story about trade taxation was a bit flat, in the same way a date with a bank manager is a bit flat; that the dialogue was ripe; that Jar Jar Binks – the CGI comic relief intended to give the toy companies something to sell – was, unforgivably, not funny. But it had Jedi, spaceship battles, it looked staggering, and the consensus was that it had set up a fresh trilogy fairly ably. Job done, then. Or so it seemed. In the months following the movie’s release, opinion shifted. The wow-factor of the CGI rubbed away, revealing the creaky bones of the film beneath. Questions were asked of the relevance of the CGI aliens’ accents, from the Caribbean patois of Jar Jar and the south-east Asian timbre of the Trade Federation Neimoidians to the slave-owner Watto, who was accused of being equally offensive to both Arabs and Jews. (George Lucas strenuously denied any racial stereotyping, making these elements of the film, at best, bewildering oversights.) Special hatred was reserved for Jar Jar, played by Ahmed Best, and for young Anakin Skywalker (the then nine-year-old Jake Lloyd). In the early days of the internet, both actors were unprepared for the now sadly commonplace levels of abuse the toxic side of fandom can discharge. All of a sudden, The Phantom Menace was loathed. (“I had death threats,” Best said later. “I had people come to me and say, ‘You destroyed my childhood.’”) It would be impossible to stage a defence of the film without at least addressing its faults, which are certainly legion. Jar Jar is the main culprit, but on reflection, he’s little more than an occasional annoyance. He’s goofy. Kids like him. He’s hardly the film’s protagonist. So it’s no great challenge to ignore him. Likewise, the odd “yippee!” aside, Anakin isn’t half as irritating when seen at a cool remove of 22 years after the fact. He’s merely one of an entire ensemble of characters without a single definable personality trait between them. Throughout the film, scenes seem to linger for a few awkward seconds after they should, or cease abruptly without any purpose for their existence having been established. There’s also an uncanny weightlessness to much of the CGI. In fact, from editing to dialogue to plotting, some of the nuts-and-bolts film-making on show is, frankly, baffling. But there is – there is! – a great movie lurking beneath all this. The sheer amount of world-building is remarkable: in one film we are introduced to the whole power structure of the galaxy before The Empire: a Republic, a Senate, a Jedi Council, Coruscant, Naboo and the Gungan city, and we are reintroduced to lawless Outer Rim planets like Tatooine. We see how it all works, and witness actual, jobbing Jedi going about their Forcey business in the inexorable run-up to war. It all whips along at a fair old clip. And the action set pieces are peerless. The pod race is an astounding assault of speed and noise. The land and space sorties are as good as anything the original trilogy managed, if a little inert in their lack of overall stakes. And the lightsaber battles remain the best of any Star Wars film to date. Darth Maul is the coolest baddie Star Wars ever gave us, and the athleticism he brings to the previously stiff duels has yet to be bested. Attack of the Clones features some of the blandest CGI action ever filmed, and a love story so lumpenly delivered it makes you wonder whether George Lucas has actually ever met another human being, let alone courted one. And Revenge of the Sith, while bringing the trilogy to a generally satisfying close, is festooned with the hokiest dialogue this side of The Room. (One climactic scene genuinely features the lines “The Sith are evil!” “From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!”) The Phantom Menace, though, isn’t bad at all. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are excellent. It tells a satisfying, enclosed story. Its action is handled with zip and flair. And, from the death of Qui-Gon to Anakin’s mother giving him up, it even manages to tug on the old heartstrings occasionally. Gungans notwithstanding, it is a very solid Star Wars film. Is it a classic? Goodness, no. But if you haven’t seen it since you left that movie theatre in 1999 with your hands clenched in tight white fists of fury, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. Don’t be afraid. Remember: fear leads to anger …",film
"Jane Harper’s best-selling novel The Dry is one of those books that feels written with a feature film adaptation in mind: a genre narrative (crime mystery-thriller) that’s pacey, plot-driven and full of dialogue, with a central location ripe for cinematic imagery. Extensive use of flashbacks is built into its structure, and they’re even presented in italics as if to say, “This is where the cuts and scene changes go”. Director Robert Connolly’s adaptation is a very gripping and polished film, commandingly performed and directed, with an airtight sense of tonal cohesiveness – despite lots of, well, air in the frame, derived from countless mid- and long-shots capturing barren exterior locations in a fictitious Australian outback town. Written by Connolly and Harry Cripps, the script – like Harper’s book – hinges on dual mysteries: one concerning the recent and the other a distant past; both involving deaths that were potentially but not necessarily murders. Binding the threads together is the protagonist Aaron Falk (Eric Bana), a Australian federal police agent who returns to his fictional hometown of Kiewarra following the apparent murder-suicide of his old friend Luke (Martin Dingle Wall), who it seems killed his wife and child before turning the gun on himself. Clipped introductory images show the aftermath of the incident, leading into location-establishing shots of the town presented in dusty yellowish tones that go on to define the film’s aesthetic. By contrast, brief fleeting visions of Melbourne are rendered steely blue, with Bana doing that thing that actors often do when positioned in skyscrapers: staring pensively through the glass at the concrete jungle around them, with a look on his face that screams “I’m in deep thought”. (Is it possible, I wonder, for characters in dramas and thrillers to not be in deep thought when looking out a floor-to-ceiling window? Is it possible they’re just thinking “I’m hungry, is it time for lunch yet?”) Falk hits the road, arriving at Kiewarra for his friend’s funeral, where the priest mentions a “devastating drought” – his eulogy placing The Dry in a context of Australian films that contemplate droughts (others include the 1920 silent film The Breaking of the Drought, John Heyer’s influential 1954 documentary The Back of Beyond, the Disneyified family movie Bushfire Moon and the recent A Sunburnt Christmas). The dryness in Connolly’s film communicates that things could catch fire at any point: literally, given Kiewarra is a danger area for bushfires, but in other ways too – for instance the mental temperature of the locals, many of whom react in hostile ways to Falk’s presence. The deceased man’s parents (Julia Blake and Bruce Spence) are convinced he didn’t do it and ask Falk to investigate. When he does accusations are thrown back at him relating to the unsolved death many years ago of Falk’s teenage friend Ellie (BeBe Bettencourt). Falk was implicated in her passing, with a general consensus among locals that he lied about his whereabouts on the day of her death. This is voiced throughout the film, shading the protagonist in interesting ways, making him a morally murky figure – far from a clearcut hero, and possibly, in relation to those past events, a legitimate suspect. Falk soaks up the stories, attitudes and personalities of the townspeople, among them Sergeant Greg Raco (Keir O’Donnell), Ellie’s belligerent father Mal (William Zappa) and cousin Grant (Matt Nable), an uncooperative farmer (James Frecheville), the school principal (John Polson) and Falk’s longtime friend and sort-of love interest Gretchen (Genevieve O’Reilly). Bana’s performance delivers a morosely convincing take on the “bad cop” trope, his character also fleshed out through visions of a younger version of himself, played by Joe Klocek, in those regular jumps back to the past. Connolly (whose oeuvre also includes Balibo, Paper Planes and the miniseries Barracuda) understands how heavily the novel relies on flashbacks – a very cinematic device – and calibrates the film accordingly. While flashbacks have literary and theatrical precedents, as Maureen Turim explained in her book Flashbacks in Film (which I plucked from my shelf after returning home from the screening), the term emerged only after the advent of cinema, which provided visceral and decisive new ways to, as Turim puts it, “return to a narrative past inserted in a narrative present”. In this narrative past BeBe Bettencourt is very engaging as Ellie: personable but mysterious, relatable but ghost-like, navigating the outback and the schoolyard with a Picnic at Hanging Rock vibe, as a doomed teen with vaguely apparition-like qualities. All the supporting performances are bang on, adding a psychological intensity implied but not dictated by Stefan Duscio’s cinematography; despite the arid settings the real heat comes from the humans. Harper’s book was skilfully constructed, but has a bit of an airport novel vibe, particularly towards the end – which, loaded with the inevitable red herrings and reveals, feels a little like a box-ticking exercise. The film remains rock solid throughout: taut, tough and tense, matching wide-open spaces with uncomfortably close drama. It’s not the environment that terrorises, as it does in classics like Wake in Fright, but the people who move across it – with their hidden agendas, clashing motives and obscured pasts.",film
"Never Rarely Sometimes Always, writer-director Eliza Hittman’s reticent, watchful film on two 17-year-old girls’ journey across state lines for an abortion, is about as opposite in tone to the incendiary, patronising anti-abortion movement in the US as one can get: understated, devastatingly spare, resonantly attuned to the unsaid, be it pain or the friendship tested by a healthcare system that leaves so many seeking reproductive care on their own. There are numerous ways to go about depicting the obstacle course that is abortion access in the US – HBO Max’s Unpregnant, released this year, routes the same premise into a mostly charming roadtrip buddy comedy – but this is one of the most quietly powerful films of the year in its utter lack of pretension. The Sundance breakout allows the girls’ navigation of the hurdles – legal, financial, logistical, emotional – to compound into a searing portrait of reproductive healthcare in the US that lingers like a yellowing bruise. So much goes unspoken – you don’t hear Autumn (an impressively inward Sidney Flanigan) tell her cousin and best friend Skylar (Talia Ryder) that she is pregnant. Their decision to secretly schlep to New York from their small Pennsylvania town, where state law prohibits abortion for minors without parental permission, is swift, mostly tacit. Nor is there a word on the volatile political environment and legislative assault on abortion access that presaged the film’s release: 12 states enacted a form of abortion ban in 2019, some barring the procedure from as early as six weeks, before many, including Autumn, know they’re pregnant; Alabama attempted to ban abortion outright. Hittman observes this thicket through the eyes of one lost in it: the dismaying search for answers through Google, the condescension and confusion sowed by the town’s “crisis pregnancy centre”, an increasingly common facility that purports to counsel women on reproductive healthcare but in practice advises against “abortion-mindedness”. In New York, the obstacles become more diffuse and surprising – the girls navigate Port Authority, lug suitcases through a subway turnstile, hit up a skeevy yet approachable stranger from the bus for money. Hittman’s vigilant, passive style turns the city into an amorphous, shadowy challenge; midtown is far from unknown to movie-goers, but, under her direction, it becomes unfamiliar and suspect, the girls’ safety a bristling open question. Never Sometimes Rarely Always, which takes its title from the answers on a patient intake form read aloud to Autumn by a Planned Parenthood receptionist in a scene that drew raves at Sundance, is almost too spare in its observance of the girls’ bond and journey. But it’s ambitiously unsettling – I realised in the final scene that I’d kept my jaw clenched the entire movie. Since its release, the reproductive healthcare environment in the US has grown only more hostile with the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, a longtime favourite of the anti-abortion movement, to the supreme court. The court’s strengthened conservative majority will be a generational fight; this film carves out an aching, vivid space in its long shadow, by paying sustained attention to a journey more American women will likely have to take, if they’re able.",film
"This low-budget British psychological horror first premiered at FrightFest all the way back in 2011 but, due to a rights dispute, is only now receiving a wider release. This long delay hasn’t done The Glass Man much harm, thanks to the continuing relevance of its recessionary backdrop and the growing fame of lead actor Andy Nyman, now well known for the 2017 film adaptation of his stage hit Ghost Stories. A clean-shaven Nyman stars as Martin Pyrite, a man whose apparently comfortable, upper-middle class life is falling apart behind the scenes. He’s been fired from his job for reasons that are unclear, amassed a huge amount of debt, and is keeping all this secret from his genteel wife Julie (Neve Campbell). After a traumatic confrontation with his furious boss (Don Warrington) and an avoidant HR manager (Lorraine Burroughs), Martin spends a day deferring the inevitable, chit-chatting politely with shop assistants, while indulging in little luxuries he can ill-afford. It’s a tense and unsustainable situation, which comes to a head when a mysterious debt collector named Pecco (James Cosmo, by turns menacing and avuncular) arrives at the Pyrites’ front door. This Pecco is offering an impossible choice: pay up immediately or become his accomplice for a wild night of unspecified criminal acts. Cristian Solimeno’s script is witty, well-plotted and goes to darker-than-expected places, but his direction isn’t always up to the necessary task of disguising budgetary constraints. The Glass Man looks cheaply and hurriedly made, which is a particular problem when it comes to depicting the supposedly well-heeled surroundings of characters like Martin and his old school chum-turned-movie star Toby Huxley (played by Solimeno in one pivotal scene). The performances are assured though, leading to an appropriately shattering conclusion.",film
"Being able to critique yourself is a good skill. Often when a film has been released I’ll ask: “Did I make mistakes?” When I made The Cotton Club in 1984, people were telling me there were too many black people in it and too much tap dancing. I would say: “But it’s a movie about black people tap dancing.” Years later, I realised I had taken out half of the backstory. It was good to go back and fix that. Life is a great screenwriter. My daughter, Sofia, got such awful, unjust criticism for her performance in The Godfather Part III. She was 18 and was being told she’d ruined her father’s film. It was a deep wound for the poor kid. They were gunning for me, but she took the bullets. Now she is a more famous movie director than me. She got the last laugh! I don’t always want to tinker with movies, only when I’ve had annoyances. I’m lucky enough to own some of the movies I’ve made, so why not? Me and The Godfather are done now. There is more that [screenwriter] Mario Puzo wrote that we never used. But I don’t own The Godfather, Paramount owns The Godfather, and they may well decide to make more films. I feel that I’ve made my trilogy. I have other fish to fry. Releasing a movie is like following a sports team. You always sigh. Relief always follows the release of a movie, even if it’s a feeling of despondency. Film is an illusion. The audience just sees a lot of shadows on the screen. The emotion is in the audience. The trick is giving them something that unleashes that and suddenly they endow the images with their emotion. My theory is, when people say a movie is beautiful, I don’t think it can be unless there is beauty in the audience. Little matters more to me than the environment. We have to save the Earth. But the climate issue isn’t strictly about the Earth. Earth is going to survive, it’s been through many ice ages. It’s about the human race. I think we’re worth saving.  We need to see each other as family. You and I are relatives. You go way back to your first grandmother and mine is the same woman. All humans living today are blood relatives, and therefore we must embrace each other and work with each other and lift each other up. Because we’re family. We’re the human family. I want to make a film about the future. You know the Alfred, Lord Tennyson quote? “For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see, saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be…” That’s the movie I want to make. It would be called Megalopolis. I’m 81 so I hope I have enough years to make it. I want to give the children of the world a vision of the future that is beautiful. That is positive. That is a heaven on Earth, because I really think we can have that. Mario Puzo’s The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is in cinemas now and on Blu-ray from 8 December",film
"Gerard Johnson, writer-director of the serial-killer flick Tony and the corrupt-cop thriller Hyena, both set in London, travels 300 miles north to continue his run of blackly comic dramas. Muscle takes place in Newcastle (not that you’d know it from the cockney accents), where Simon (Cavan Clerkin) has a soul-crushing sales job and a moribund relationship. Can his tough new personal trainer Terry (Craig Fairbrass) guide him towards a healthier, more hopeful outlook? Not likely. Every depressing detail, from Simon’s ill-fitting work shirts to the concrete car parks he walks past on his commute, underline what a colourless existence this is. At first, the choice to shoot in black and white seems unnecessary – until Terry embeds himself further, moving into Simon’s spare room and using the house to host extremely grim sex parties. At this point, the absence of realistic flesh tones is revealed as a blessed mercy; the realistic flesh-slapping sounds are horror enough. This is Johnson’s first film without his cousin and collaborator Peter Ferdinando in the starring role, but Muscle’s two leads prove every bit as tuned into his uniquely bleak vision of male interaction. Simon’s workplace makes the Glengarry Glen Ross office look like a soothing yoga retreat and his gym, a place where reps keep pace with racist banter, is just as nightmarish. (Ferdinando does make a cameo, gruffly warning Simon off at reception, like Cerberus guarding the gates of hell.) The excellent characterisation and exquisitely menacing atmosphere ultimately go nowhere, because the plot seems to drop its barbell mid-set and collapse before reaching any kind of conclusion. Still, Muscle’s darkest joke is rather a good one; that such an earnest effort at self-improvement can go so spectacularly awry.",film
"Cinema audiences were introduced to the terrifying Darth Vader when he appeared through the smoky residue of a laser battle at the beginning of Star Wars (1977). First came the silhouette of his swishing cape and flared helmet, then in closeup the chilling details of his mask – the blank, fly-like eyes, the grille redolent of a mouth with gritted teeth. Ralph McQuarrie drew the original sketches of the character and the costume designer John Mollo made them a frightening reality, but it was the British actor and former weightlifter David Prowse who was inside the suit and behind the mask. Prowse, who has died aged 85, was the one responsible for Vader’s imposing physicality and distinctive sweeping movements, curiously graceful for one so large (the actor stood 6ft 7in and weighed 19st at the time). It was one of the peculiarities of his particular species of fame that while he played arguably the most memorable character in one of the biggest movies of all time, he could still walk down most streets without fear of being recognised. Even his voice would not have given him away: though he spoke Vader’s lines during filming, and was assured by the writer-director George Lucas that he would be required later for the dubbing sessions, it was the American actor James Earl Jones who delivered the character’s dialogue in the finished film. It was decided that Prowse’s thick West Country burr, which earned him the nickname “Darth Farmer” from other cast members, would not have struck quite the right note of menace for an intergalactic villain. Nor did he get to supply Vader’s menacing heavy breathing (that was the sound designer Ben Burtt, using scuba-diving apparatus). And though he performed his share of the light-sabre duels in the first picture, they were mostly handed over to the stunt department for the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). When Vader was unmasked in the latter film, moments before his death, it was the actor Sebastian Shaw, rather than Prowse, whose face was shown, and who got to speak the character’s final words. To add insult to anonymity, this death scene was concealed from Prowse, who claimed not to have been shown script pages during shooting. Such slights were in keeping with his general frustrations about the role. “As Darth Vader, you always feel as if fame and fortune’s coming towards you, but, just as it’s going to hit, it passes you by,” he lamented. “Sometimes in the cinema, I want to yell out: ‘Hey, that’s me up there, that’s me you’re all watching.’” Prowse was born in Bristol and was raised by his mother after his father died when he was five. He was educated at Bristol grammar school and from the age of 12 spent three years wearing a leg-iron because of suspected tuberculosis of the knee, a diagnosis that later proved to be unfounded. At 16 he dedicated himself to bodybuilding and at the age of 25, having worked as a lifeguard and a bouncer, he entered the Mr Universe contest, during which a judge told him he would never win because of his “ugly feet”. He switched to competitive weightlifting and went on to be British heavyweight champion for three consecutive years from 1962. While selling equipment in a gym in the early 1960s, he was approached by an acting agent who invited him to play the part of Death in Don’t Let Summer Come at the Mermaid theatre in London. From there, he moved on to commercials, television series and eventually films. He made an uncredited appearance in the star-studded James Bond comedy Casino Royale (1967), as Frankenstein’s monster, later reprising the role in a more orthodox context in The Horror of Frankenstein (1970) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974). He opened his first gymnasium in south London in 1969; his clients included Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath. He also became a fitness consultant at Harrod’s while keeping his hand in with acting. His most notable pre-Star Wars credit was Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, in which he was the bodyguard to the writer played by Patrick Magee. He starred in comedies including Carry On Henry (also 1971) and Terry Gilliam’s Jabberwocky (1977), and appeared with his future Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher in her mother Debbie Reynolds’s show at the London Palladium in 1974. Shortly before Lucas’s movie started shooting in 1976, Prowse began his 14-year stint as the superhero-like Green Cross Man in a popular series of road safety commercials. His voice was dubbed by another actor for the first two advertisements, but reinstated thereafter. The Sunday Times reported in 1978 that the first two years of Prowse’s tenure helped bring about a 5% reduction in road safety accidents in the 4-11 age group. As part of his contract with the Department of Transport, he toured schools as the Green Cross Man. After playing Vader, Prowse’s acting roles were few and far between. He was turned down for the lead in Superman The Movie (1978), but gave the successful candidate, Christopher Reeve, physical training “I spent six weeks trying to make him look like me,” Prowse said. He performed the same function for Cary Elwes in preparation for The Princess Bride (1987). A hip injury in 1989, as well as arthritis and various health issues relating to his ankle and spine, put Prowse out of action. In 2000, he contracted a blood disease that caused temporary paralysis in his arms. Still he lobbied at every opportunity to be considered for any future Star Wars films, and continued to mourn what he regarded as his slapdash treatment on the earlier instalments. By 2005, he told Empire magazine that he was doing “nothing else” except being paid to fly all over the world attending Star Wars conventions, which made it all the more galling for him when in 2010 he alleged that he had been banned from any future events. “People ask what went wrong with George Lucas but to be honest, I still don’t really know,” he said. “The only thing I’ve been told is I’ve burned too many bridges between Lucasfilm and myself.” One theory is that the director suspected Prowse of leaking in advance of the release of The Empire Strikes Back the revelation that Vader was the father of the film’s hero, Luke Skywalker. Though never formerly politically outspoken, Prowse publicly declared his support in 2009 for Ukip, the UK Independence party. Asked in 2014 what he would do if he ruled the galaxy, he said he would “reintroduce capital punishment”. He briefly managed the Welsh musician Jayce Lewis and wrote an autobiography, Straight from the Force’s Mouth (2016), as well as recording an audiobook version that ran for 540 minutes. In 1963 he married Norma Scammell. She survives him, along with their three children, Steve, James and Rachel.",film
"First-time feature director Ibrahim Miiro hits the ground running with this urban drama set in London; for the first half-hour, at least, it’s a film bursting with energy and adrenaline. Hannah Laresa Smith plays homeless teenager Ally who has recently run away from foster care. In the early scenes showing her chaotic street life, the camera pushes right in, claustrophobically close. Ally sleeps in the cold under a bridge by a canal and washes in public toilets. She earns a few quid as a courier for drug dealer Carol (Sallyann Fellowes), a nasty bully who fakes a mum-like warmth. I watched with an icy sense of dread, my hands clammy. Ally has no idea how at risk she is. A confrontation finally spirals her situation out of control. After being violently attacked, Ally runs off in a panic, leaving behind Carol’s money and drugs. And it’s here the movie disappointingly shifts into a crime opera, with the arrival of drugs kingpin Ilyas (played by Lithuanian actor Gediminas Adomaitis), another black-suited, taciturn gangster in the Euro-baddie tradition. Carol darkly whispers that he’s got links to a human trafficking gang up north. Ilyas gives Carol 24 hours to find the cash – or Ally. Terrified, Ally keeps out of sight. Her mate Josie, a few years older and hardened by life on the streets, suggests prostitution. The only person genuinely looking out for Ally is a lonely elderly man, Frank, (Mike Kinsey), who befriended her, and now turns detective to find her. The story increasingly feels unconvincing and contrived, and the ending is a bit sentimental. But Miiro directs with real confidence; he’s a name to watch.",film
"There’s something deliciously subversive about the backstory to this offbeat horror film, which was made in Canada. Director Justin G Dyck and screenwriter Keith Cooper have collaborated on a long list of treacly, holiday-themed, made-for-TV movies with titles such as A Very Country Christmas, Christmas With a View and A Christmas Village. Anything for Jackson, however, is a riotously gory, impish inversion of all things yuletide, in that it stars sweet-featured elderly character actors Sheila McCarthy and Julian Richings as grieving grandparents Audrey and Henry Walsh, who kidnap pregnant Shannon Becker (Konstantina Mantelos) in order to perform a satanic ritual on her. It’s as if Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, the little old couple who lived next door in Rosemary’s Baby, got to be the stars of their own movie. Audrey and Henry’s goal is to channel the ghost of their dead grandson, Jackson, into Becker’s unborn child. But deals with the devil have a way of going wrong – or throwing up nasty consequences in the fine print, such as demons and ghosts with murderous instincts of their own. Plus, their main adviser on matters demonological is a bitter “incel” type (Josh Cruddas) who lives with his mother and is prone to bitching about the leadership at their satanic church, an outfit quietly run out of the local community centre where members bring home-baked goods for breaktime. Dyck and Cooper turn this almost comical premise into an interesting work that treads the line between genres with agility. There’s a satirical streak, sure, but the devil’s forked tongue stays mostly in the film’s cheek, and in many ways it’s also a conventional horror pic. That means the usual quota of jump-scares and visual effects-created scary monsters, such as a contortionist ghost with a plastic bag tied over his head or a mad woman who keeps flossing the teeth, one by one, right out of her mouth. At the same time, there’s a streak of affecting drama that emanates from the main pair, a well-to-do couple scarred by tragedy who ultimately want to do something good but by any means necessary. Altogether, it’s a richer devil’s brew than you would expect, crisply edited and moodily shot – even if the last act doesn’t quite hit the spot.",film
"Just when you thought you were out … he pulls you back in. Francis Ford Coppola has presided over different editorial remixes of Apocalypse Now, and now he’s done the same with his little-loved The Godfather Part III from 1990: with new edits and a new title. He and co-writer Mario Puzo have removed the “threequel” stigma by renaming it The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, but, at 158 minutes (compared with the 175 and 202 minutes of the other two films), it’s hardly short enough to be a coda and doesn’t function structurally as such. Rightly or wrongly, it is exactly what the original title declared it to be: part three, the third act in the life of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who in his 60s tries to go into respectable business by bailing out the Vatican’s financially embarrassed bank. He thereby becomes a businessman of enormous power, somewhere between Faustus and Mephistopheles, yet also a vulnerable target for shadowy conspirators. There are a number of little changes to the original, the most important being at the very end, which might baffle those wondering about that new title. This change could imply that his real death was the emotional or spiritual death that happened on the steps of the opera house in Palermo, or even much earlier than that. Michael is drawn back into mob violence ostensibly because he gets involved in a quarrel between Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), the boorish boss of the casino he sold off, and his nephew Vincent Corleone (Andy Garcia), son of the late Sonny, played in G1 by James Caan. Naturally, Michael sides with Vincent, with awful results. But it isn’t just this. Michael realises that the supposedly legitimate world of business and politics he has been yearning for all his life is just as brutal as the mob, and Michael comes to play a key role in cheekily fictionalised versions of two real events: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the 1982 murder of the Vatican-connected banker Roberto Calvi. This film was derided at the time as a shark-jumping mess: choppy, convoluted, anti-climactic and with an underwhelming performance from the director’s daughter, Sofia Coppola, as Michael’s daughter Mary. It undoubtedly feels stuffy compared with Scorsese’s GoodFellas, which came out the same year and was much more vibrant than Coppola’s rather stately and self-consciously Shakespearian tale. (Amusingly, Scorsese’s mother Catherine had a cameo in both films.) Well, some critical revisionism is in order. Admittedly many scenes in this film are obvious retreads of key scenes from part one: the initial party set piece in which Michael receives visitors in his sanctum, and the final sequence, in which cold-blooded hits are intercut with a public event. But they are intended as “mirroring” events, full of dramatic irony and ill omen. This film has ambition and reach: maybe the conspiracy-theory stuff from the real world feels forced, but it gives a kind of surreal vividness to Michael’s endgame. His audacious “confession” scene with the cardinal who will become Pope John Paul I is outrageous in a way, but also melodramatically inspired. And Sofia Coppola isn’t as bad as all that. She brings a mopey callow yearning, as well as unresolved sexual tension to her forbidden love affair with her cousin Vincent. (And of course has proved herself as a director many times over since then.) I’m not sure how much, if anything, Coppola’s re-edit does for the film, but it’s worth a watch.",film
"Paul Greengrass’s latest film is based on the western novel by Paulette Jiles, about a girl returning to her family in 1860s Texas after being kidnapped by the Kiowa tribe. Helena Zengel plays the girl, Johanna, and Tom Hanks plays the man who must look after her: Captain Kidd, an ex-army veteran who makes a living reading aloud from newspapers to illiterate townsfolk, and who is now in the middle of a very big news story.   Released in the UK on 1 January Pitch Perfect producer Kay Cannon now directs this new live-action reboot of Cinderella, with James Corden as co-writer. The Grammy-nominated singing star Camila Cabello takes the leading role of Cinders, yearning for her prince. Idina Menzel plays the evil stepmother, Britain’s Nicholas Galitzine is the handsome Prince Robert, and Broadway star Billy Porter is Fab G, the genderqueer Fairy Godparent. (There is no word yet on Buttons, but surely Christopher Biggins is available.)   5 February This much-liked Australian romcom gives us the story of Ellie, a high-school high-flyer who aces her academic work but can’t figure out a way to talk to Abbie, the girl with whom she’s hopelessly in love – or ask her to the prom. Then a miracle happens: her dead lesbian aunt Tara returns as fairy godmother to offer plain-speaking advice from beyond the grave, but she hasn’t dated since the 1980s, and Gen Z dating norms aren’t easy for her to grasp.   5 February David Chase has co-written a prequel movie to his classic HBO series The Sopranos, featuring Michael Gandolfini as the young Tony Soprano – Michael being the son of the late James Gandolfini who played the New Jersey crime boss when the show was in its pomp. Corey Stoll plays the young Uncle Junior and Billy Magnussen is the young Paulie Walnuts. But who will be playing the ruthless young matriarch Livia Soprano?   12 February Lee Daniels’ new biopic of the great jazz singer Billie Holiday, played here by Andra Day, probes the way she was harassed by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, especially after she released her searing song Strange Fruit, about racism and the lynching of black men. The drama takes as its jumping-off point the sensational assertion from the British journalist Johann Hari that Holiday had an affair with a black undercover officer called Jimmy Fletcher, who had been assigned to arrest her. (Previous studies had suggested there was nothing more than a brief friendship.) Fletcher is here played by Moonlight’s Trevante Rhodes.   12 March As an actor, Emerald Fennell was the sensual and worldly Camilla Parker Bowles in The Crown, breaking the heart of Josh O’Connor’s Prince Charles. Now as a writer-director, she has created one of the most talked about films of the year – an icily subversive rape-revenge parable. Carey Mulligan plays Cassie, who likes to fake blacking-out drunk behaviour on the weekends, just to see how far her nice-guy dates will go with someone who they think can’t resist and won’t remember in the morning. It’s a challenging and provocative movie, and Mulligan is being tipped for silverware greatness.   12 February Frances McDormand delivers the performance of her career in what may well be the film of the year, from director Chloé Zhao. Nomadland is a docu-fictional movie about the American phenomenon of “nomads” – the sixtysomethings whose financial security and chances of retirement were shattered by the 2008 crash and who now roam the country in campervans looking for seasonal work. McDormand plays a fictional “nomad” and Zhao stages wonderfully conceived encounters with the real thing, while on the road. Moving, insightful, superb.   19 February A true-life legal thriller that may be a rival to Aaron Sorkin’s confrontation classic A Few Good Men. Kevin Macdonald directs the drama, which is based on the bestselling memoir Guantánamo Diary by Mohamedou Ould Slahi , who was imprisoned in Guantántamo Bay for over 10 years without trial. Tahar Rahim plays Slahi himself and Jodie Foster and Shailene Woodley are his defence lawyers Nancy Hollander and Teri Duncan, and Benedict Cumberbatch plays the ferocious prosecutor Stu Couch who comes to have qualms about evidence acquired under torture.   25 February Oscar-winning documentary-maker Bryan Fogel takes on the grisly assassination of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi Arabian journalist was the reformist critic of the government who in 2018 entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain papers relating to his marriage, but was murdered and dismembered so that his corpse could be discreetly removed. The Saudis’ nervous allies, including the UK, are reluctant to make a fuss about this important Middle East ally and arms purchaser. The film is reputed to have sensational new audio-tape evidence about who ordered the murder.   5 March Anthony Hopkins gives a much-acclaimed performance in this film, based on the original French stage play by Florian Zeller, and now directed by Zeller with a new English screenplay by Christopher Hampton. Hopkins plays an old man who is descending into dementia – to the horror of his daughter and carer, played by Olivia Colman. The story is told from his bewildered and terrified viewpoint, as people and places morph into each other as if in a nightmare.   12 March The 007 brand has been a bit tarnished lately, with the new James Bond movie abruptly pulled from the cinema schedules in the autumn (for the second time) and many cinemas blaming this letdown on their temporary closure. At any rate, here it is: Daniel Craig is hanging up his tux and sky-blue swimming briefs and bowing out of the 007 role with his latest Bond thriller, which has been delayed twice due to the lockdown. Veteran Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have teamed up with Fleabag legend Phoebe Waller-Bridge for what is purportedly a funnier, savvier Bond for Craig’s last hurrah.   2 April Those people who still associate John Krasinski with the fresh-faced Jim Halpert from the American TV version of The Office perhaps need to catch-up with the brilliant sci-fi futurist nightmare A Quiet Place from 2018, for which Krasinki was co-writer, director and star. In the story of a world menaced by blind alien monsters with super-strength hearing, Krasinski played opposite his wife Emily Blunt. Now he is back with the sequel.   23 April One of Britain’s brightest movie talents, Edgar Wright, returns with a psychological London horror with a time-travel theme, avowedly in the classic style of Nic Roeg. Set both in the present and in the glamorous and yet seedy world of swinging 60s London, it’s co-written with smart new talent Krysty Wilson-Cairns (who also co-scripted 1917 with Sam Mendes). Anya Taylor-Joy stars, and there’s some connoisseur-60s casting with the appearances of Terence Stamp and Rita Tushingham. Iconic, but now sadly departed stars Diana Rigg and Margaret Nolan gave their final performances in this film.   23 April Cate Shortland, who made the great Australian film Somersault, now directs this big-ticket superhero movie, in which Black Widow from Avengers takes centre stage in the 24th MCU film, a debut for which Marvel fans have long been yearning. Scarlett Johansson returns as the former FSB agent Black Widow (that is Natasha Romanoff), after the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which she is isolated and must fight to survive. The film brings in Florence Pugh as an ally of Romanoff’s and also Rachel Weisz is Melina Vostokoff, her handler from the world of espionage.   7 May Lin-Manuel Miranda is the composer and lyricist who became a titan of American musical theatre with his Broadway smash Hamilton. Now he is back with 11 new songs, in this bold new animated tale on a Latinx theme, about a capuchin monkey who has a passion for music and a thirst for adventure, and makes an exciting and dangerous journey from Havana to Miami to fulfil his dream.   4 June Whoever it is you were gonna call, you’d better call ’em again. This new Ghostbusters is a conventional threequel, effectively a follow-up to Ghostbusters 2 (and so standing apart from the recent gender-switch reboot). Thirty years on from the original story, two children and their single mom discover their link to the original ghostbusting heroes. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver reprise their roles; sadly, Harold Ramis died in 2014.   11 June Still speedy, still needy, still eerily boyish, Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell returns in this present-day sequel to Top Gun. The legendary US navy pilot played by Tom Cruise could be piloting a desk by now, but he prefers to be a badass warrior of the skies. Jennifer Connelly is now Tom’s love interest, a mere nine years his junior. Miles Teller plays Rooster Bradshaw, the son of Goose Bradshaw from the first film, who was played by Anthony Edwards. Could it be that this film will finally include the homoeroticism famously imagined by Top Gun superfans Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino? Probably not.   9 July It’s over 20 years since M Night Shyamalan bowled us over with The Sixth Sense, and despite some very rocky moments in his career – and supremely dodgy films such as Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender – he has never quite vanished from the scene. And now he is back with a high-concept supernatural mystery thriller of the sort he loves, based on the graphic novel Sandcastle, by Pierre Oscar Lévy. A bunch of tourists happen on a staggeringly beautiful seaside cove, but somehow can’t find their way out, and make an awful discovery: they are ageing a few years every half an hour.   23 July Here is the movie version of the British TV comedy People Just Do Nothing, starring Allan Mustafa, Asim Chaudhry and Hugo Chegwin, all about the radical pirate radio station in Brentford, transmitting drum and bass and garage – the legendary Kurupt FM, run by MC Grindah and DJ Beats. Now, after a period of creative stagnancy, the main players of Kurupt FM are astounded to hear that some of their music has been on a popular Japanese TV gameshow – so our heroes travel to Japan to get the money and acclaim that is rightfully theirs.   13 August Veteran British director Adrian Lyne returns to the movies after a long absence with a psychologically tense erotic thriller – perhaps something to compare with his 80s masterpiece Fatal Attraction – starring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas. Deep Water is based on the 1957 novel by Patricia Highsmith. A man trapped in a loveless open marriage has reluctantly agreed that his wife can have lovers as long as she does not desert the family home. When one of these lovers is found murdered, the husband thinks it would be a good idea to put around the rumour that he killed this man, in order to deter his wife from straying any more.   13 August Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary, about the making of their final album, Let It Be, has the blessing of the surviving members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and it has been conceived as a creative riposte, of sorts, to the Michael Lindsay-Hogg film that showed rancour and acrimony. This will re-edit the footage and show new material to show the good feeling that McCartney and Starr say they remember. More startlingly, Jackson will reportedly use the transformative digital techniques that he applied to his first world war film They Shall Not Grow Old.   27 August Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman … Jordan Peele (the author of Get Out) has co-written this ingenious new film in the Candyman horror franchise – originally based on the Clive Barker short story, from 1984; the director and co-writer is Nia DaCosta. The grim Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago, where the Candyman would appear to anyone who repeated his name five times in the mirror, is now all flashy, upscale apartments and condominiums. But the Candyman is not to be gentrified out of existence as easily as that.   27 August This is an epic new adaptation of the classic SF novel by Frank Herbert from 1965 – the first of two projected movies that will cover only the first half of the book. It takes some chutzpah to take on a movie adaptation last attempted by David Lynch, but this is what Denis Villeneuve has done – having already shown he has the sci-fi chops with Arrival and Blade Runner. Oscar Isaac, Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star.   1 October The intriguing screenwriting team of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener take on a potent true story from medieval France that has assumed the potency of Arthurian myth – and Ridley Scott directs. Damon plays the knight, Sir Jean De Carrouges, who has accused his friend Sir Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) of raping his wife Marguerite (Jodie Comer). The king, Charles VI, played by Affleck, decrees that there is only one way to settle this – a trial by combat between the two men, on the understanding that God will create the just outcome. If De Carrouges loses, Marguerite will be burned at the stake for her false accusation. Criminal justice was exciting in those days.   15 October Chloé Zhao makes her second appearance on this list, as the film-maker lauded for her amazing docu-realist masterpiece Nomadland. This couldn’t be more different. It’s a Marvel superhero film about a mighty race of aliens who have been living on Earth for millennia and come out of shadowy hiding to battle against mankind’s enemy, the Deviants. The project, unveiled at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, features Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and Gemma Chan.   5 November With the politics of identity and ethnicity such a hot-button issue, Steven Spielberg takes on this ageless classic, updated from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, with its immortal Leonard Bernstein score – but will it follow last year’s Broadway revival in dropping the song I Feel Pretty, a move some suspected was driven by contemporary squeamishness about body fascism? Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler are Tony and Maria, the star-crossed lovers, and Rita Moreno, the iconic star of the original film returns in a supporting role.   10 December Once again, Wes Anderson brings his Olympic-level drollery and quirk in a style now endlessly spoofed by YouTube admirers (but never quite nailed). As with The Grand Budapest Hotel (inspired by Stefan Zweig), Anderson gives us an upscale literary-tourist vision of Europe – this time inspired by New Yorker correspondents such as SN Behrman and Mavis Gallant – in which an American paper’s French bureau enterprisingly reports on the 1968 protests in the city of Ennui-sur-Blasé. Stars Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and many more.  Date TBC Lovely, heartfelt performances from Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth carry this intimate movie from actor-turned-director Harry Macqueen. They play Tusker and Sam, a couple in middle age who face their greatest challenge after Tusker is diagnosed with early-onset dementia. They go on a camper-van holiday to the north of England to visit Sam’s sister and come to terms with the fact that this may be their last holiday together.  Date TBC The open secret of Victorian sexuality is rediscovered by director Francis Lee in his tremendous drama of forbidden love in 1840s Lyme Regis. Kate Winslet plays the real-life 19th-century palaeontologist Mary Anning, whose pioneering ideas and extraordinary fossil finds were appropriated without acknowledgment by the male scientific establishment. Saoirse Ronan plays Charlotte Murchison, a young woman whose friendship with Anning soon becomes much more.  Date TBC The hit UK stage musical now gets a film version, with Max Harwood playing Jamie, and theatre director Jonathan Butterell making his feature film debut. Jamie is a lonely 16-year-old at school, a young gay man who is bullied by the homophobes in class and patronised by dull teachers who bristle with uncomprehending distaste at his dreams of being a drag queen, and tell him to get a boring, proper job. The movie shows Jamie battling to make it.  Date TBC  All release dates are UK and are subject to change.",film
"“County lines” is slang for a new UK crime phenomenon that is basically as old as the hills: the targeting of vulnerable teenagers from the big city, generally ones absent from school and without stable family support, and using them to traffic drugs out to the provinces via solo train journeys – an invisibly discreet method – and then traffic the resulting cash back. It’s about drug mules, those age-old human beasts of burden, and about using children as the disposable footsoldiers of crime, which Dickens would have recognised. Henry Blake’s debut movie about all this, developed from a short made in 2017, is focused, compassionate and well-acted: a shocking social-realist drama-thriller. The victim-hero is 14-year-old Tyler (played by Conrad Khan) who lives at home with his mum Toni (Ashley Madekwe) and kid sister. He’s been excluded from school for fighting (Toni was once in trouble while a pupil at the same school) and crucially emboldened to do this by an earlier bullying incident in a chicken shop, when a total stranger stepped in to help him. This was a guy in his early 20s: tough, confident, kindly, clearly the kind of role model that young Tyler hasn’t encountered since his dad ran out on the family. He is Simon, coolly played by Harris Dickinson, who starts giving Tyler lifts in his nice car, letting Tyler see his expensive watch, taking him out for meals and letting him talk about his worries. Soon, desperately overworked Toni loses her cleaning job and Simon tells Tyler he must step up to his responsibilities and be a man: which is to say, Tyler must run drugs down to Canvey Island in Essex on the train and help sell them in a world of Hogarthian violence and squalor. The first “meal” scene with Tyler and Simon is very interesting: it takes place in another down-at-heel burger place. (Later, Blake will show Tyler’s wonderment and intimidation in seeing Simon in a much classier restaurant with his partner and child – and Simon’s intense irritation at this low-ranking subordinate presuming to contact him there.) Simon is grooming Tyler, and allowing him to experience, perhaps for the first time in his life, the pleasure of being listened to and treated with kindness. But the film shows how the conversation is provisional, exploratory. Simon is sizing Tyler up: assessing his suitability for employment. How much responsibility might this kid be given, if any? Interestingly, that first intervention in the chicken shop was not necessarily part of a master plan. Simon doesn’t even remember Tyler when he offers his shy thanks the next day. Getting involved in potentially violent situations with school-age kids that he’s confident of beating in a fight is something that Simon does almost without thinking. But, like career criminals, he can see how to create and enforce the bonds of loyalty, and of course his friendly mask is soon to be removed. County Lines is a film that doesn’t run along the usual rails of a gangster thriller. You might, for example, expect to see cycle-of-abuse evidence, signs of Simon’s own erstwhile innocence or victimhood, and then indications of how Tyler is coming of age in this nauseous business: becoming more ruthless and more professional, or maybe even superseding his boss. Blake doesn’t do that, although he certainly shows how Tyler is becoming more indoctrinated into the world of brutality, a trainee abuser who assaults his mum. Instead, County Lines shows us something realer and more banal.  For all the violence and the machismo, it is the woman who finally has to clean up the mess. Tyler’s mum must look after him, take him to hospital and take the measures necessary to settle his outstanding problems with Simon, who has naturally revealed himself to be the bully-in-chief. County Lines has excellent performances from Khan, Madekwe and Dickinson, and also Anthony Adjekum as Tyler’s teacher Laurence, one of the few people who speaks to him with genuine sympathy.",film
"Here’s an undemanding lighthearted comedy from Switzerland loosely inspired by a real-life spying scandal in the late 1980s, when it emerged that Swiss police had amassed secret files on 900,000 people suspected of dodgy political views. (Handing out leftwing leaflets was enough to make you a target for surveillance.) It’s a movie made for a home audience, I suspect; if you’re unfamiliar with the history, some of the events here feel convoluted and hard to follow. Though anyone old enough to remember the era will recognise the high-street golfing jumpers and creased nylon slacks in a nothingy shade of “C&A greige”. The setting is Zurich in 1989, where Viktor Schuler (Philippe Graber), a good-natured if none-too-bright detective, is ordered to go undercover at a radical lefty theatre. He shaves off his cop moustache, buys a leather jacket and volunteers his services as an extra in Twelfth Night. The trouble is that he struggles to uncover any useful intelligence. The actors turn out to be a bunch of luvvies with fuzzily vague politics. The play’s firebrand activist director is suspected of working for the Russians, but increasingly he looks like your standard issue bourgeois misogynist bully: a man who enjoys the sound of his own voice and humiliates a female actor when she refuses to perform naked. It’s a film with plenty of shots of Schuler hiding behind doors and comically getting the wrong end of the stick. (He is disappointed to discover a Russian that the actors keep banging on about – Stanislavski – turns out not to be a Moscow intermediary.) Inevitably he begins to question the mission and even the ethics of mass surveillance. Has the theatre opened his eyes or brainwashed him? It’s a harmless enough movie for the most part, though Schuler’s relationship with the play’s leading lady – while he is undercover, deceiving her as to his identity – feels a bit iffy after the UK’s more recent “spy cops” scandal.",film
"Warner Brothers has announced that their 2021 slate of releases, including high-profile films such as Dune and The Matrix 4, will premiere on the streaming platform HBO Max. The new hybrid release model will see 17 films launch online for US subscribers at the same time as they are released in cinemas, where available. They will then be available to watch for a month for no extra charge. The films will still receive a standard theatrical release internationally. “We’re living in unprecedented times which call for creative solutions,” said Jason Kilar, CEO of WarnerMedia. “After considering all available options and the projected state of moviegoing throughout 2021, we came to the conclusion that this was the best way for WarnerMedia’s motion picture business to navigate the next 12 months.” Warner’s lineup features major big-budget titles such as Godzilla vs Kong, James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, a long-awaited fourth Matrix film, sequels to Space Jam and The Conjuring and Denis Villeneuve’s new interpretation of Dune, which carries with it a reported budget of $200m. Also included is a string of awards-aiming fare including King Richard which stars Will Smith as the father to Venus and Serena Williams and In the Heights, an adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical. It’s been described as “a temporary plan” but will be a much-needed boost for HBO Max which launched earlier this year and has been struggling to attract subscribers ever since. Fewer than 9 million people have signed up while about 28 million existing HBO users haven’t activated their accounts, which come free with current plans. The news follows a difficult year for the studio, heavily affected by cinema closures as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Warners had tried to revive the box office with the release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet but the sci-fi thriller saw underwhelming returns in the US with less than $60m in the bank. The studio then decided to release tentpole sequel Wonder Woman 1984 on HBO Max on Christmas Day as well as in cinemas where available. It’s estimated that the film will need to make 40% more than Tenet’s global total to break even. “At some point you have to choose to share any love and joy you have to give, over everything else,” Wonder Woman 1984 director Patty Jenkins said at the time. Rival studio Universal recently reached agreements with a number of US exhibitors to show their films while allowing a 17-day window before a digital release. While some cinemas across the US remain open, the two main markets – Los Angeles and New York – have yet to announce when they will follow suit with infection rates rising in both cities. Global box office is set to fall by an estimated 66% in 2020.",film
"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones’s Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There’s the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles – swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be. It’s impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney’s 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks. Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor’s career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland’s closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston. The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams’s Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.  Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there’s winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom – Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor’s preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor’s self-centered “helpfulness” feels earned. But Godmothered’s tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother’s overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes. The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there’s one – co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) – within reach), but its shoehorned revelation – that true loves comes in many forms – is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious – unrealistic in the parts where it’s trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor’s misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle. Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it’s a bumpy, underwhelming ride – not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",film
"There’s an awful lot going on in this new movie from Steven Soderbergh. The title is appropriate: it’s garrulous, elegant, bristling with classy performances from an A-list cast, and Deborah Eisenberg’s screenplay has a theatrical intimacy. But it’s loosely and waywardly plotted, perhaps as a result of having gone through many drafts, though maybe not enough. It is slightly unfocused and uncertain as to where its emotional centre really lies – though there is a charm and a big dramatic finale. The story is mostly set (and economically filmed, by Soderbergh himself) on a luxury liner, , the Queen Mary 2, crossing from New York to Southampton. Meryl Streep plays Alice Hughes, a renowned novelist whose reputation and sales rely chiefly on a sensational early book about the collapse of a woman’s marriage. Her agent (Gemma Chan) takes her out for lunch and has to charm her cantankerous client into going to London to accept a prestigious award; she is also nervous about the fact that Alice still hasn’t delivered her latest manuscript but excited at the rumours that it could be a sequel to the sensational early book. Alice agrees to the trip but very grandly declares that she cannot fly, so her cowed agent suggests the ocean liner alternative, with Alice giving a lecture to get a freebie. Alice agrees, but only if she also gets tickets for three other people: her adored nephew (Lucas Hedges) and her two best friends from college, Susan (Dianne Wiest), a high-flying lawyer, and Roberta (Candice Bergen), who sells lingerie in a department store. Things get tense when it becomes clear Roberta is convinced that Alice’s great first book was actually about her, and that the book destroyed her life. Moreover, Alice’s agent has also sneaked on board, to keep an eye on her author – and Alice’s nephew is beginning to fall in love with her. In some ways, Let Them All Talk is a very agreeable throwback to the cinema’s antique world of love-boat romance on luxury ocean liners – the world of An Affair to Remember, Now, Voyager, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and even James Cameron’s Titanic. There is, in fact, very little movie talk, though in one conversation Chan’s character talks about her love for a certain “comedy of errors”, which would appear to be the French movie Priceless with Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh. I myself am not so keen. Let Them All Talk has two emotional registers. For the older generation, it is the rather wan but droll language of worldly regret, managing the anxieties and disappointments of old age. And Alice and Susan, despite their material achievements, are not free of these. Nor is Roberta – she is angry and trying to maximise this opportunity by nabbing a rich single guy on the ship (a little like Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes) – but her rage, and the real danger that she represents, is muffled by the keynote of gossipy larkiness that is sustained throughout the film and only flares out at the very end. The younger generation is represented by Alice’s agent and her nephew – although there is a serious age gap between the thirtysomething and the twentysomething. There is the opportunity for real passion, real excitement and real heartbreak in this farcically contrived pairing, but it fizzles out and Soderbergh and Eisenberg cut their key conversation before it ends. Of course, everything has to be about Streep, and her character hovers between the grande-dame hauteur she shows to almost everyone and the gentle ditsiness she shows to her nephew. Is she a black-comic dragon or a bittersweet lonely woman? The ambiguity is perhaps not entirely intentional. It is a voyage of adventure, but not really of discovery.",film
"Hugh Keays-Byrne was one of those extraordinary screen presences who didn’t land nearly enough substantial roles, but absolutely astonished when entrusted with the spotlight. The great English-Australian actor, who died this week aged 73, was less a performer than a visceral, wall-rattling force who seemed to summon his own weather conditions. You watched the guy, slack-jawed and kind of terrorised, uncertain whether his performances should be studied in film school or analysed by the Bureau of Meteorology. One person understood this more than anybody: the director George Miller, who cast Keays-Byrne as the principal villain in not one but two Mad Max movies. First the 1979 original, with the actor chewing the scenery as a dastardly gang leader named Toecutter, and more recently the Oscar-winning Fury Road, returning him to the franchise as Immortan Joe – a beefy, bedraggled, pasty-white warlord attached to a respirator fitted with rows of horrible-looking horse teeth and squeezed inside semi-transparent armour. Keays-Byrne will be forever celebrated for his bad-arse and batshit crazy Mad Max performances, though he appeared in many other screen productions, albeit often in frustratingly small roles including the pre-Mad Max biker movie Stone, the berserk Australian western Mad Dog Morgan, the strange exploitation pic Snapshot, director Richard Lowenstein’s excellent feature debut Strikebound, and the spectacular turkey Les Patterson Saves the World. Born in Kashmir, India, in 1947, Keays-Byrne’s resume is dotted with midnight movies but he came from a distinguished background, performing for the Royal Shakespeare Company in England for six years before resettling in Australia in 1973. His Fury Road co-star Charlize Theron took to Twitter on Thursday morning to deliver a tribute: “It’s amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul. You will be deeply missed my friend.” In a post published on Facebook, the legendary Ozploitation director Brian Trenchard-Smith also paid tribute to Keays-Byrne’s acting skills as well his character and temperament: “Hugh had a generous heart, offering a helping hand to people in need, or a place to stay to a homeless teenager. He cared about social justice and preserving the environment long before these issues became fashionable. His life was governed by his sense of the oneness of humanity. We will miss his example and his friendship.” Elsewhere in that post, the director reflected on how he “spent many happy Sunday mornings” with Keays-Byrne and others at a shared house where the actor lived in Centennial Park in Sydney. It was at that house, back in the 70s, that Keays-Byrne – gathered with other recently-hired cast members of Mad Max – phoned the film’s producer to make an odd request. The actors had decided they wanted to live and breathe their characters, who belonged to Toecutter’s disgusting gang. Their approach, they reasoned, involved driving dangerously modified motorbikes from Sydney to Melbourne – in addition to wearing the same clothes and avoiding showering. This kickstarted a period of intensely bizarre method acting I wrote about in my book about the making of the Mad Max movies, Miller and Max, with the actors embracing the grubbiness of their characters on and off the screen, helping fuel the wild energy so crucial to making the film such a distinctive and invigorating oddball. The group completely freaked out the then-barely known and inexperienced Mel Gibson who, co-star and co-feral David Bracks later recalled “didn’t know what he’d stepped into … He thought he was gonna cop it. That we were going to give it to him as a real bike gang and beat him up.” On the set of Fury Road more than three decades later, a virtually unrecognisable Hugh Keays-Byrne continued his wacky method style, remaining in character long after his co-stars had taken a break. One time between takes, Abbey Lee Kershaw (who plays one of Immortan Joe’s Five Wives) made the mistake of staring at the seasoned veteran who, looking utterly grotesque in his costume and makeup and determined to stay in character, stared right back. It is safe to say Keays-Byrne won the staring competition. In a YouTube video recorded during the film’s promotional tour, Lee recounted how this moment had such an impact she “couldn’t breathe and my heart was pounding out of my chest”, so much that “they had to stop the shoot and I had to breathe into a bag”. Many people spoke of Keays-Byrne as a generous and gentle spirit; I lost count how many times I heard words to that effect while researching my book. But there’s nothing gentle or laid-back about his best, biggest, gnarliest performances. The actor had his own style as well as his own gravitational pull; you didn’t so much watch him as experience him. Keays-Byrne will – to borrow from the script of Mad Max – ride eternal, shiny and chrome.",film
"When people think of Sean of course they think of James Bond, but he wasn’t really acting when he was playing that part. In real life, when he walked into a room, he walked like James Bond and he talked like James Bond, which people could find disconcerting. That was because he didn’t change anything about himself, including his Scottish accent, which tells you a lot about the man. Sean was a very tough man in some ways, but very sensitive in others. I first met him in 1971 when he was setting up a charity to help young Scots [the Scottish International Education Trust], wanting me to get involved – he liked how I projected Scotland to the world as a racing driver. He loved his country but realised it had its limitations – even though Glasgow’s fine art is renowned, he knew there weren’t similar opportunities elsewhere in the arts. He understood why people moved away for new opportunities, given he had come from a very ordinary background himself and done that, but he wanted Scotland to thrive from within. He was very proud that people knew him as a Scot all around the world. I’m apolitical but he wasn’t; he wanted Scotland to be independent, and that never left him. After Micheline [Connery’s wife of 45 years] called me to tell me he had died in his sleep, I called the first minister. That’s how important he was to Scotland. I’ve been in some interesting situations with Sean throughout the years. At a charity shooting event at Gleneagles, he convinced the king of Jordan to let Steven Spielberg shoot an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade scene in Petra. He was there with Steven and Harrison Ford, who was a good shot, but Sean – James Bond himself – couldn’t shoot. Sean treated everyone the same and didn’t suffer fools gladly. He had fun with people like that. Not with fans, though – he was always kind to them, never refusing an autograph. And obviously, Sean was very good-looking, so whenever we went out for dinner together, there were always women chasing him, but he’d always be surprised. He never thought of himself as a star. I spent some time with him not long before he died in the Bahamas. He was very unwell then with dementia, which is a very cruel disease – I know this personally, as my wife has had it for several years. It was sad seeing him like that, but there we were, the two of us, lying side by side on his bed. He told me he wanted to watch Sidney Lumet’s The Hill [from 1965], his favourite film in which he’d acted. It’s not well known, but he’s brilliant in it, playing a soldier in a north African army prison. That role meant more to him than all the Bonds. The next day, he asked me again if I’d like to see it as if he’d never asked me before. And so we did. When he died, I wished there had been a run of his films on TV to recognise what he did both for Britain and his beloved Scotland. He was a very dear friend. I’ll miss him very much.

"The last thing anybody ever expected from a Kelly Reichardt film was a big, dripping, golden slab of food porn. Three decades into her career, the American writer-director has become identified with a kind of ascetic purity, both in terms of her own starkly elegant aesthetic and the quiet, marginalised lives she tends to centre on screen. First Cow, her warmly melancholic and generous-hearted seventh feature, doesn’t break from that tradition, yet it serves up surprising pockets of comfort throughout. Let me just say it plainly: First Cow is a film that hinges significantly on doughnuts. Or “oily cakes,” in the film’s 19th-century frontier parlance: big sunny glops of deep-fried dough, eaten hot, drizzled with honey and dusted with cinnamon. Reichardt’s film lingers on the creation of these humble snacks as if gazing upon jewels in a coalmine: you want to reach into the screen and take one, burning your fingers as you do so. The oily cakes are the creation of one Otis “Cookie” Figowitz, a shabby, itinerant cook who earns his nickname before he becomes known for sweet treats. With a thankless job catering to a boorish pack of travelling fur trappers, wending their way through the wilds of Oregon in the 1820s, he generally trades in essentials rather than indulgences, made from what he can forage in an unyielding landscape. Originally from Boston, he has his own “go west, young man” dream, albeit on a sensible scale: to open a bakery in San Francisco. So he confides to the sympathetic ear of King-Lu, a Chinese immigrant on the lam, who becomes his lone ally in an unlikely money-making scheme: selling baked goods to the luxury-starved denizens of the Oregon trail, with milk nicked from a wealthy English landowner’s magnificent dairy cow – the first and only one in the region. Thus does First Cow unfold like an aged, rustic fable or folk legend, passed along to the point that some details have blurred, while any crisp moral has become elusive. Cookie and King-Lu steal from the rich to grow richer themselves and let the community live a little more deliciously: a victimless crime, unless you count that poor, lake-eyed, overmilked cow. Attentive as ever to the mores and strategies of living on the breadline (or indeed the cakeline) and the prickly interaction between haves and have-nots, Reichardt and her regular co-writer Jonathan Raymond (on whose novel the film is based) have made an exquisite, earthy diorama of American capitalism in miniature. It bristles with political aggravation, but is heated by human tenderness and comradeship: played with gentle wit and grace by John Magaro and Orion Lee, the burgeoning relationship between Cookie and King-Lu is rich in queer possibilities too, as their mutual outsider status blossoms into its own intimate bond. Reichardt has never been one to over-burden her films with either words or commentary, and in a year of such fraught political significance for the US, one can frame just about any American film of remote consequence as one for the times. Yet First Cow, set 200 years ago, feels more piquantly so than most: a calm, clear-eyed observation of national traditions of ownership and isolation, the rules designed to keep society’s outcasts out. It begins with a present-day exhumation, as literal bones of the past are tripped upon and brought to light. The historical fiction that ensues makes us ponder how much or how little has changed in the intervening centuries, and how different the prospects for a Cookie or a King-Lu — alone or together — would be in Trump’s America. One thing we know: those doughnuts would still sell like hot, oily cakes. ",film
"Peter BiskindA stone-cold classic from the moment it arrived in 1998. Biskind, a former editor of Premiere magazine, produced a detailed, insightful and immensely readable account of the (until then) relatively neglected achievements of the 70s “movie brats” and their outpouring of masterworks. Both scholarly and popular, Biskind’s book turned a whole new generation on to the Hollywood new wave. Edited by Alison CastleKubrick famously tried and failed to get a biopic of Napoleon off the ground in the late 60s and early 70s; Jack Nicholson and Blow-Up’s David Hemmings were variously in the frame. This doorstop-sized Taschen book is a compendium of Kubrick’s exhaustive research for the project, from script notes to costume designs. It’s a real eye-opener. John PiersonSpiritually the sequel to Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, even if it was published a couple of years before by Pierson (who later discovered The Blair Witch Project). His subject is the 80s indie wave in which he was a sales agent – and in which Harvey Weinstein figures as a baleful puppetmaster. Karina LongworthWith her podcast You Must Remember This, Longworth alerted a new audience to the entertainment value of old-gold Hollywood and its parade of gossip, scandals and forgotten stars. It all gets distilled in this epic account of the producer/entrepreneur/sleaze and his hold over a generation of starlets. Kevin MacdonaldA standout film-biz profile: a biography of Michael Powell’s film-making partner – jointly responsible for The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus – by his grandson, the director Kevin Macdonald. He writes about him with tremendous affection as well as the insight of a fellow professional. Matthew SweetBy some distance the best book about the British film industry I’ve ever read. Starting from its silent days to the sexploitation era of the 1960s, Sweet firmly foregrounds the popular, less feted areas of the industry, rescuing such figures as Pen Tennyson and Anita Fay Tipping from obscurity. William Preston Robertson“Making of” books are 10 a penny, but this one is pretty special – anticipating the future cultishness of the Coens’ “bowling noir”, with lengthy interviews with behind-the-scenes people and discussion of the brothers’ key themes (“howling, fat men” etc) – all delivered in Robertson’s dry, ironic prose. Ethan Coen’s wife Tricia Cooke is on editing duties. Budd SchulbergNovels can offer an interesting angle on the film world. Martin Amis’s Money, for example, was inspired by working on the flop sci-fi yarn Saturn 5, while Christopher Isherwood’s Prater Violet is an account of prewar British cinema. The real prince of industry fiction, though, has to be this 1941 account of the insanely ambitious wannabe Sammy Glick. Frank RoseThis takes backroom industry shenanigans to a whole new level. A comprehensive history of the celebrated William Morris Agency, it chronicles Hollywood from its vaudeville origins to the power-suit era of the 80s and 90s, via the unusual perspective of the dealmakers and power brokers. Julie SalamonA seminal exposé of big-budget Hollywood film-making at its most excessive. Salamon, then the film critic for the Wall Street Journal, was given unfettered access behind the scenes of Brian De Palma’s movie version of Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities, ending up in the right place to chronicle a slow-motion car crash of the highest order.",film
"The directorial debut of Viggo Mortensen, which he also wrote and stars in, is an empathetic but gruelling account of a father-son relationship. Nearing the end of his life, Willis (Lance Henriksen), is losing his memory and much of what redeemed him as a person. What’s left is bilious intolerance and a foul temper, which Willis deploys with a regularity that can feel a little cyclical. This, of course, is the point – toxic encounters between increasingly senile Willis and his gay son, John (Mortensen), are doomed to repeat themselves, no less painful for the fact that they have played out many times before.",film
"A lifelong chronicler of punk and of music’s excessive, transgressive fringes, it’s a wonder that it took Julien Temple as long as it did to turn his attention to Shane MacGowan. The frontman of the Pogues, famous for his ground-glass delivery, the gutter poetry of his lyrics and his fondness for various intoxicants, is a gloriously disruptive subject for a documentary. He once ate a Beach Boys album. But so colourful is his history that this is just a throwaway aside, barely meriting half a minute in this breakneck mosh through his life. Temple has always used archive material playfully; here, it’s particularly riotous, like a chaotic patchwork quilt tacked together by one of Shane’s drunk aunties. As for MacGowan himself? Blurred around the edges, with a terrifying death rattle of a laugh, his beer-soured presence in the film is a glowering counterpoint to the tendency, from some interviewees, to sanctify him as some kind of fallen angel.",film
"I was the child actor in a travelling experimental theatre company, La MaMa. We were the American entry in these summer theatre festivals across Europe and beyond: Italy, Germany, France, Scotland, Finland, Greece, Lebanon, Iran, we did them all. We also did some red countries. I remember thinking: “What is a red country?” I didn’t understand. We went to see A Clockwork Orange in Copenhagen. It was nice to find a theatre where the films hadn’t been dubbed, and it was a hot ticket, so that was probably the criteria. I don’t think that the twentysomething cinema usher realised what Kubrick had in for us when she allowed nine-year-old me in to see it. I remember the scene where they are pouring milk laced with drugs from the mannequin’s breasts. I’m still scarred. I was taken to lots of movies that I probably shouldn’t have seen. I don’t remember the names; I just remember the violence and the sex. It got my perspectives all mixed up. My first impressions into adulthood were that sex and violence were cool and hip. My dad was a drama coach. He had a theatre workshop with John Cassavetes. He also drove a cab. It was a good temporary gig for a single parent to make money in New York in the 70s. He’d say: “You know, I’m portraying the role of a character of a cab driver …” It meant I had a ride because my dad had a car. No one had a car in Manhattan unless it was a yellow taxi. It was just a delight for him to have me ride shotgun. The people who got in the back didn’t seem to mind that there was a seven-year-old kid sitting in the front. We shared a lot of rituals. We’d go for tea and muffins in the morning. He’d drop me off at school and he’d pick me up from the theatre late at night: 11pm was late for a second grader. This went on until I was 13 and I scored my first film [A Little Romance with Laurence Olivier] and I stopped performing at the theatre because now I was going to be making movies, apparently. I was always a Top 40 radio girl. My idea of fun was to go – late at night and at my own peril – to Colony Records in Times Square to buy 10-packs of blank cassette tapes to record off the radio. My goal was to edit out the commercials. My dream was to be a DJ. Now you have 1,000 songs in your pocket and it’s all on you; you can’t blame the DJ any more. It was an exciting time in America in 1976. We were 200 years old and very proud. We’d got rid of Nixon and we had hubris and joy. As Americans we had a sense of humour about ourselves, so our music had a sense of humour that hasn’t been around since. I loved the Isley Brothers and the Spinners. I loved Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel and It Only Takes a Minute by Tavares. We’d do the hustle to Troglodyte and Bertha Butt Boogie by the Jimmy Castor Bunch. Everything had this goofy sense of humour, which was great fun for teenage girls to dance to. When I was 12, it was like the whole world was 12.  I remember seeing The Way We Were with my mother. I thought Robert Redford was the bee’s knees. I think it devastated her. Watching her cry made me cry, even though I was too young to understand all the emotions. The teenage girl in me fell in love with Mark Hamill in Star Wars. When Saturday Night Fever came out, I lost my mind. I remember wailing into a parking meter when I came out of the cinema. That’s how out of my mind I was. I was 13, hormones were a new thing for me, and I finally had a place to put them. I thought it was the coolest, truest indictment of the desperation to be cool. And the vulnerability of somebody who’s so desperate to be cool struck a chord and touched me very deeply. John Travolta so beautifully portrayed that role. It was a bullseye of casting perfection in such a decade-defining blockbuster film. I imagine it was hard to get over that, in terms of: “I’d like to play other parts, please.” I’m always happy when Travolta is afforded opportunities to play diverse roles, because he was so indelibly stamped on that film. I was the perfect age for a lot of the cliche blockbusters, when the industry was learning that they could manipulate the market. They’d never marketed a film before like they did with Jaws. They didn’t have wide opening films before which stayed in the theatres that long. Culture was so much more shared back then. We have such diversity right now. Everything is available to everyone at any moment, so it’s hard to find that shared feeling. I grew up with an amazing love for actors and acting. It struck me as the bravest poetry possible. I didn’t realise how much goes into making a movie. I mean, who sits there and reads the thousands of names that come up on the credits after a movie? You walk out of the theatre but the names are still going. It is such a huge team sport. Robert Redford might look cool, but it took 8,000 people to make that happen. But when you’re 12, you don’t want to see the man behind the curtain. You want to believe what they’re showing you. I saw Taxi Driver with my dad in New York, which was very disturbing. Jodie Foster’s performance is indelible. Flash-forward two years and I was auditioning for Pretty Baby, which was probably the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been in my life. I first heard Marvin Gaye’s Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) in my dad’s taxi. I also fell in love with David Bowie. I can’t quite remember the first domino of when he moved into my bloodstream. I can remember thinking that I was witnessing a phenomenon. He was like a spider, weaving a web of sounds and music and genres. As a child of the 70s, there was an explosion of talent, musical and otherwise. It was a great escape, comfort and bonding experience to enjoy these things with somebody. The music was perfectly wholesome; it got your blood up and made you want to dance. To this day, the same songs still make me want to dance around my kitchen. I committed the whole of Elton John’s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road to memory. One of the first songs my daughter learned by heart was Grey Seal. I sing it a cappella with my girlfriend when we get together. I’ve played three singers in the movies and there’s a reason I didn’t portray them in my own singing voice. It’s not pretty!",film
"Charged with the twin missions of kickstarting cinemagoing post-lockdown (outside the US, at least) and out-Nolanning every previous Christopher Nolan movie, Tenet carries a lot on its shoulders. The fact that it made it into cinemas is an achievement, but does it deliver? The critical consensus has been a qualified, often confused, “yes”, although opinions have differed widely, even among Guardian and Observer critics. One thing all will agree: as well as a fresh jolt of spectacle to revive the flatlining movie business, Tenet provides plenty to talk about and plenty to think about. Too much? Let’s talk about that. Even measured against Nolan’s usual origami plots, Tenet stretches audience comprehension to its limits. The story hinges on the concept of “inversion”. It’s the idea that things can appear to travel backwards in time, though some viewers have struggled to fully grasp this notion, what with Tenet’s reams of exposition, not helped by occasionally muffled dialogue and distractingly spectacular action sequences. The further you get into the plot, the more difficult it becomes to keep track of what’s what and who’s when. It’s like trying to complete a cryptic crossword while reciting the 13 times table backwards while on a tightrope over the Grand Canyon. “Don’t try to understand it, feel it,” Clémence Poésy’s scientist advises our hero, known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington). So were we feeling it? And did we understand it? Tenet’s climactic battle scene is especially challenging. Even though the two detachments of the “temporal pincer movement” are conveniently colour-coded and numerous visual cues are flagged up (the distinctive tag on Robert Pattinson’s backpack, for example), viewers might find it difficult to work out how, when or even if the battle is won, or lost. When you’re rearranging the cause-and-effect building blocks of storytelling like this, you’re always in danger of losing the audience. Many have been happy to just sit back and let the spectacle bombard the senses. Is that enough? Did you get it? And if not, will you go back and watch it again? Perhaps viewing it backwards might help? It’s one thing for Tenet to feel as if it makes sense on the screen, but does it stand up to logical scrutiny? Tenet’s characters repeatedly stress that “inversion” is not time travel – a distinction that conveniently enables the movie to circumvent the pitfalls and paradoxes common to time-travel movies. At least Tenet broaches the problem head-on by bringing up the “grandfather paradox”. It goes like this: If you go back in time and kill your grandfather, does that mean you’ll stop existing? With no grandfather, you can’t be born. And if you don’t exist, there’s no one to kill grandpa in the first place. Similarly, if Washington’s Protagonist had successfully foiled Kenneth Branagh’s plan, wouldn’t Branagh know that in the future, and so try something else? Or conversely, aren’t Washington’s past actions (such as recruiting Pattinson’s Neil) based on knowledge he has gleaned from the future? Other questions abound: how were the “time stiles” built? If only the bullets were travelling backwards in time, why did the things they hit miraculously fix themselves? What happens if someone needs the toilet? Nolan consulted physicist Kip Thorne (who also helped out on Interstellar) to ground Tenet in credible physics, but did they plug all the holes? Strip out the sci-fi elements and Tenet’s set-up is very familiar: glamorous international locations; expensive vehicles; huge action set-pieces; a plot that depends on getting the MacGuffin off the baddies to save the world, not to mention a preoccupation with men’s tailoring. Tenet is a homage to the James Bond movies. Nolan recently claimed to know “as much about the Bond films as Alan Partridge does” (a Celebrity Mastermind showdown surely beckons). He specifically swore off watching any Bond movies while making Tenet, to avoid overlap. Not that it shows, particularly. Nolan’s name is often the first to come up when future Bond directors are discussed; is Tenet his audition? Certainly, he has a command of the action sequences: the explosive airport raid and the reverse-gear motorway heist/chase sequence are both ingenious and exhilarating, all the more effective for their reliance on practical stunts and effects, rather than green-screen computer-aided trickery. Hoyte van Hoytema’s pristine cinematography also gives the visuals a familiar luxurious sheen – especially, when the setting is, say, a villa overlooking the Amalfi coast, or a racing catamaran (Hoytema was also cinematographer for Spectre). Does Tenet up the game for the likes of Bond and Mission: Impossible? Or do we still prefer our thrills old-school and linear? Perhaps we’ll find out when No Time to Die finally hits cinemas in three months’ time. Despite Tenet’s complex plot engineering, it is the human elements that keep the whole thing in motion. Washington, in particular. He’s in some ways a brave choice for such an expensive venture: by no means an established name (his breakout role came in 2018’s BlacKkKlansman) and a rare actor of colour in Nolan’s gallery of overwhelmingly white central characters. His role requires understated charm and soul but also a great deal of physical skill – not least in a painstakingly choreographed fight scene with his “inverted” self. Washington’s co-star Elizabeth Debicki is also a relatively fresh face, best known for roles in Steve McQueen’s Widows, though her star is set to rise with her casting as Princess Diana in series five and six of The Crown. As with Washington, her performance has been largely acclaimed, but is her character somewhat schematic? It is Debicki who does much of what little emoting there is to be done in Tenet, although her defining characteristics seem to be love for her son and marital torment – though she shows some steely cunning under pressure in the latter stages. Pattinson we can almost skip over as a safe pair of hands and a suit-friendly pair of shoulders at this stage. But Branagh’s portrayal of Russian villain Andrei Sator is likely to be more divisive, especially for audiences who last saw him as the heavily Belgian-accented Hercule Poirot. Tenet bravely leads the mission to reopen cinemas but it will almost certainly pay a price for it. Even if it is a huge hit, it is unlikely to earn as much at the box office as it could have done in Covid-free times. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most expensive non-franchise movies ever made, with an estimated budget of more than $200m (£150m). Will we see its like again? And do we want to? For some critics, Tenet is a variation on a theme Nolan has now mined to exhaustion. From Memento to Interstellar to Inception, clever, twisty, time-manipulating stories have sealed Nolan’s reputation, but you wonder how much further he can take them. Has has he reached his own “inversion point”? Does he need to find some new storytelling tricks to which to apply his considerable skills, or are you eager for more? A Tenet sequel, even? ",film
"Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are falling in love in the first trailer for Ammonite, a controversial romantic drama that’s being tipped for Oscars. The film tells the story of paleontologist and fossil hunter Mary Anning, played by Winslet, whose discoveries were often overlooked during her life in the early 19th century. Director Francis Lee, who broke out with the acclaimed gay romance God’s Own Country, received criticism last year when it was announced that his film would focus on a romance that Anning shared with another woman, Charlotte Murchison, played by Ronan. “I do not believe there is any evidence to back up portraying her as a gay woman,” family member Barbara Anning said to the Telegraph, calling the decision “sensational”. Another relative, Lorraine Anning, disagreed saying that “as long as it’s well presented and tastefully done” then it doesn’t matter. Lee defended the decision on Twitter writing: “After seeing queer history be routinely ‘straightened’ throughout culture, and given a historical figure where there is no evidence whatsoever of a heterosexual relationship, is it not permissible to view that person within another context?” Earlier this year, Lee also stated that “it’s not a biopic” but is inspired by Anning’s life and also his research into same-sex female relationships of the period. “The idea of two women actually in a relationship together was just not a thought anybody ever had within society,” he said. Anning’s contributions have recently achieved more attention with London’s Natural History Museum naming a room after her. She was also a candidate to have her face included on a £50 note. Ammonite was set to premiere at this year’s Cannes film festival but will now receive its first screening next month as part of this year’s Toronto film festival. It’s set to be one of the first unveiled contenders for an unusual awards season. Ronan has amassed four Oscar nominations, including most recently for Little Women, while Winslet has won one and received another six nods. Ammonite will be released on 13 November in the US and in 2021 in the UK.",film
"The latest from Canadian arthouse wunderkind Xavier Dolan is the story of two men and one kiss. The men are Matthias (Gabriel D’Almeida Freitas), a rising star lawyer who is starting to question whether his fast-track career is taking him in the right direction, and Maxime (Dolan), a carer for his addict mother who is about to leave behind a life that has rather stalled in Montreal to make a new start in Australia. The kiss is scripted – the pair find themselves roped into a student film by the insufferable younger sister of a friend. But the emotions it unlocks are real and perplexing, skewing the balance of a friendship that has threaded together the lives of both since they were children. Matthias & Maxime is recognisably the work of Dolan, who at 31 has crammed a lot of Quebecois melodrama into a relatively short career. His trademark flourishes are very much in evidence: the high-octane onslaught of dialogue, the dominant mothers and invisible fathers, the speeded up montages – his sly way of taking the most hackneyed of all cinema devices and giving it a punky, irreverent energy – and slick changes of aspect ratio (more on which later). But there is also a tonal shift here. The strident, splintering bitterness of some of Dolan’s earlier films (Mommy; It’s Only the End of the World) is replaced by a softer, enveloping melancholy. It’s not exactly gentle in approach – Dolan’s film-making has always been the kind that snaps and bares its teeth – but it’s more forgiving, perhaps, of the flaws in his characters. One of Dolan’s great gifts as a film-maker is the way he captures the dynamics of discord. The camera latches on to every sniping side eye, every cheap dig that finds its target. There is love lurking in his families, but that doesn’t stop warring siblings and sparring mothers and sons tearing each other apart from the inside out. A combative quality within the wider group of friends around Matthias and Maxime highlights the easygoing, instinctive relationship between the two. There’s a lovely shot early on: Matt and Max are framed in a lit window as they companionably work their way through the washing up, their heads bent together in a small, glowing square in the centre of the frame. It feels almost jarring when another character wanders into the shot. Later on, Dolan employs one of his aspect ratio shifts – the frame stretches like a lovestruck pupil dilating – and places the friends at opposite sides of the widest of widescreen shots. Between them is an endless expanse of beige sofa and a lifetime of unspoken words. These playful frame changes mirror the shifting focus of the film: it’s an intimate portrait of two men who can’t quite bring themselves to admit that their relationship might be more than platonic, but it also has a broader generational scope. These are lives at a turning point: carry on and become their parents (in one of the film’s cruder elements, Dolan includes a grotesque, cackling band of moneyed older women as a cautionary Greek chorus), or plough a fresh furrow. Ultimately, the revelation here is not so much Dolan’s more contemplative approach to film-making, but the subtlety and sensitivity of his performance. Max is sharp and witty, but lacks something of the invincible alpha-bro confidence of his buddies – certainly there’s a vulnerability here that is not evident in D’Almeida Freitas’s more erratic turn as the deeply confused Matt. Dolan doesn’t overplay Max’s diffidence but he does, in a couple of tremendous scenes, lay bare his easily bruised soul to wrenching effect.",film
"The Duke of Edinburgh’s award was designed to address what Prince Philip’s former headmaster Kurt Hahn identified as the “six declines of modern youth”. In his feature debut, Ninian Doff (who has directed music videos for Run the Jewels and the Chemical Brothers) mines black comedy from the misconception that young people lack “fitness, initiative and enterprise, memory and imagination, skill and care, self-discipline and compassion”. It feels like Edgar Wright’s Hot Fuzz and Ben Wheatley’s Sightseers are reference points. Troublemakers Dean (Rian Gordon), Duncan (Lewis Gribben) and DJ Beatroot (Viraj Juneja) must complete their DoE as punishment for setting a school toilet on fire; nerdy Ian (Samuel Bottomley) hopes it will look good on his CV. Lurking in the Scottish Highlands is the Duke (Eddie Izzard), an aristocratic baby boomer who wears a Hannibal-style mask and carries a shotgun. His mission is to teach ungrateful millennials to respect their elders. Hyperactive editing, the jittery rap score and an obligatory acid trip scene grate, but Doff’s social commentary is sharp. Katie Dickie is also drily funny as a sergeant who abandons her search for the local bread thief in the hope of catching an influx of “hip-hop terrorists”.  On Amazon Prime Video",film
"The actor Ben Cross, who has died of cancer aged 72, took the film world by storm in the Oscar-winning Chariots of Fire when he played Harold Abrahams, the British Jewish athlete driven as a runner not just to win gold at the 1924 Paris Olympics, but also to battle antisemitism. A fellow British team member, the devout Scottish Protestant missionary Eric Liddell, played by Ian Charleson, is similarly seen in a quest to combat discrimination. Abrahams wins the 100 metres, while Liddell triumphs in the 400 metres. The two stars shared one of the most memorable opening scenes in film history, among the sprinters on a training run along a Scottish beach, enhanced dramatically with moments in slow motion and Vangelis’s inspirational music. “The water was freezing,” recalled Cross, “and we had bare feet – completely ridiculous. If you spoke to a sports trainer about running barefoot in ice-cold water, they’d ask you if you were mad. But, look, it made for a good opening sequence.” The 1981 film, produced by David Puttnam and directed by Hugh Hudson, won four Academy awards at the following year’s Oscars ceremony. However, despite Colin Welland’s “warning” to Hollywood that “the British are coming” as he accepted his statuette for best original screenplay, the two stars never quite fulfilled the promise they had shown in such a high-profile film – even though they jointly received the Variety Club’s most promising artiste award. While Charleson chose to spend much of his time on stage before his premature death from Aids in 1990, Cross found most of his best roles on television, which utilised his bony features and earnest, sincere air, and said he had no hunger for theatre. “Of all the jobs I’ve been offered, television was the best quality,” he later said. “I haven’t liked most of the films I’ve been offered. Film has the greatest international audience, so you have to be very choosy about what you do.” He had his first starring role on the small screen in The Citadel (1983), the BBC’s 10-part adaptation of AJ Cronin’s semi-autobiographical novel about a doctor who swaps his crusading job in a poor Welsh mining village of the 1920s for a wealthy existence taking care of London society before realising he has sacrificed his ideals. Going from the parochial to the international, Cross headed the cast in The Far Pavilions (1984), a lavish mini-series set in 19th-century India during the days of the British Raj. As the dashing romantic hero Ashton Pelham-Martyn (“Ash”), he played a British officer in love with a princess and battling to understand his own identity, having been orphaned and previously believing himself to be of Indian birth. To prepare for the role, Cross went to the country four weeks before shooting began in order to absorb the atmosphere – just as he had spent three months “training like a madman” for Chariots of Fire. “The man discovers he is English, yet his heart and emotions are very much Indian and he’s accepted in neither world,’’ reflected Cross at the time. “These misfit roles seem to seek me out. I always seem to play people not totally at home in the situation we discover them.” Born in Paddington, London, to Catherine (nee O’Donovan), a cleaner, and Harry, a doorman, Cross was brought up a Catholic and attended Bishop Thomas Grant school in Streatham, south London. Playing the title role in a school production of Toad of Toad Hall brought him laughs – and an ambition to act that was a long time unrealised after leaving home at 15, living in a van and working as a window cleaner. He eventually found jobs backstage, as a carpenter for the Welsh National Opera and property master at the Alexandra theatre, Birmingham. Then, during two years at Wimbledon theatre, watching a different show every week, Cross decided to get himself under the stage lights, successfully auditioned for Rada and graduated in 1972, aged 24. Apart from a handful of TV roles over the rest of the decade, his only screen appearance was as Trooper Binns – described by Cross as a “glorified extra” – alongside an all-star cast in the 1977 war film A Bridge Too Far. However, he began to get attention on stage. During a stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company he took the role of Kevin Cartwright in the world premiere of the Peter Nichols national service farce Privates on Parade (Aldwych theatre, 1977). His singing voice was showcased when he played Wally in the original London production of the Cy Coleman-Michael Stewart musical I Love My Wife (Prince of Wales theatre, 1977-78) and, at the time of auditioning for Chariots of Fire, he was Billy Flynn, Roxie Hart’s lawyer, in Chicago (Cambridge theatre, 1979-80), observed by the Stage as “strong and sly as the courtroom superstar”. His other television roles included Padre Rufino, a Franciscan monk aiding Jewish wartime refugees, in The Assisi Underground (1985), the vampire Barnabas Collins in the 1991 mini-series Dark Shadows, Rudolf Hess in Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial (2006), Prince Charles in William & Kate (2011) and the ruthless Ukrainian mob boss Mr Rabbit in the first two series (2013-14) of the American drama Banshee. The Italian production Honey Sweet Love (1994) gave him a rare starring film role, as a British army officer falling in love in Sicily during the second world war. He was also seen on the big screen as Prince Malagant in First Knight (1995) and as Sarek, Spock’s father, in the 2009 film Star Trek. Cross’s first two marriages, to Penelope Butler (1977-92) and Michele Moerth (1996-2005), both ended in divorce. In 2018 he married Deyana Boneva in Bulgaria, where he had been living for more than 10 years. She survives him, along with the two children of his first marriage, Lauren and Theo.",film
"If there’s one defining image from Nicolas Roeg’s zippy yet cruel adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, it’s that of Anjelica Huston ebulliently pushing a stranger’s baby carriage down towards a cliff edge. While a gory death might then be averted, it’s an almost unfathomably sadistic moment, a shocking act of hate contained within a glossy PG-rated studio fantasy. Even 30 years on, as the line between films aimed at children and teenagers blurs ever more, Roeg’s 90 minutes of mostly unfettered nastiness remains a startling watch, a bitter little fairy tale to keep kids up at night with a fear of torturous death. What makes The Witches so horribly effective, both on page and screen, is that this fear is aimed at a group that children have traditionally been taught to see as safe. It’s not just that the antagonists are women, it’s that they’re women who are made to resemble harmless family friends or neighbours, aunts or teachers, figures we expect to coo over babies, not try to murder them. Hollywood has forever fed into reductive and tiresome stereotypes of women as either mothers or molls, usually identified by their feelings towards kids. We’ve seen in countless films that a woman who loses a child also loses her sanity too, and that women unable to conceive are instead driven to steal a baby from elsewhere. The women we’re shown who don’t want children are usually glamorous femme fatales whose disinterest in motherhood is explained away by a more general sociopathy or unwanted spinsters who have seen their lives amount to nothing as a result. In The Witches, a large cross-section of women didn’t just not want children but they wanted to kill everyone else’s, an unapologetic and bloodthirsty desire for a child-free world. Various feminist critics of Dahl’s book and Roeg’s movie expressed distaste with its portrayal of childless women as murderous hags, although in recent years, some have seen it as more forward thinking and less misogynist in its worldview. Author Caroline Kepnes views it as “a hilarious, feminist commentary on women, work and family” where men are ineffective and women possess more power, something that might prove horrifying to those frantically upholding the patriarchy. In an ingenious, info-packed intro, we’re given a beginner’s guide to witches courtesy of Mai Zetterling’s Helga, who tells her grandson Luke, Parenthood’s Jasen Fisher, how to spot one of them, an urgent lesson that could end up saving his life. They’re foul creatures with square toes and blotchy scalps but wear sensible shoes and wigs to fit in. Writing for the New Statesmen, Jemma Crew views this as a way of the story rebelling against “aesthetic rules imposed on women”, a way of showing how so many are forced into impossible beauty standards by society and how men fear and criticise those who don’t conform. Their aim is to infiltrate without detection so they can kill as many children as possible, but in order to evade capture they must avoid using “knives or guns” and instead find inventive ways to dispatch of bodies. In arguably the film’s most chilling sequence, we see a girl kidnapped by a local witch and then trapped in a painting where she’s forced to live out the rest of her life, alone, doomed, with her family, crippled, watching from outside. It’s one of many staggeringly hopeless notes we’re left to sit with, a trademark not only of the story’s original author Dahl, whose work often delved deep into gleefully nihilistic territory, but of Roeg, a director whose often perverse films were aimed squarely at an open-minded adult audience and who seemed a strange, dangerous choice for a slick Warner Brothers family movie. But somehow, hiring the guy who made a film so filthy that it was shelved and then dumped by scared studio executives before shooting arguably the sexiest sex scene ever to make a film for kids proved to be a masterstroke. Roeg’s deft and entertaining late summer critic-pleaser maintained the sourness of Dahl’s source material while also transplanting the book’s sprightly pace. Sure, children are killed, but that hurtling pace and that Stanley Myers score sure make all that killing rather fun, huh? (Myers was also an unlikely choice, best known for his work on The Deer Hunter). Bar one controversial diversion which I’ll come to, Roeg doesn’t dampen the malevolency of the novel or his unusual, uneasy style, making certain unpleasant scenes that much more unpleasant with clammy, claustrophobic close-ups and unsettling Dutch tilts, shooting it like an adult horror movie, albeit one with goofy comic elements. His careful tonal control is matched by a ferocious performance by Huston as the Grand High Witch, a scene-devouring turn from an actor swiftly seesawing between camp and callous, a scary, funny and sexy villain without a visible shred of humanity. While Jim Henson’s de-wigged witches are monstrously effective (it was the last film he personally worked on before his death), it’s those in disguise that prove more nightmarish, posing as polite and unremarkable representatives for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. So while Huston’s unmasking scene remains a showstopper, there’s something more long-lasting about the surreal image of well-dressed women scouring the Cornish bluffs for a child they want to turn into a mouse. They succeed at downsizing our hero Luke, but he then goes on to destroy this particular coven before setting his sights on witches worldwide. This is where that aforementioned diversion comes into play. A happier ending was written that saw Luke turned back into a boy by a defecting witch who uses her magic powers for good, a spoonful of sugar heaped over the original, darker finale, which saw Luke remain a rodent. Dahl was incensed, and so Roeg agreed to shoot both endings and see which one test audiences preferred. Predictably, the happier endnote won out, and in response, Dahl threatened to take his name off the film, something Henson later urged him against (he still referred to the finished product as “utterly appalling”). It does still clang to end with such jubilation after what’s come before but given how far the film goes in many ways, it’s an understandable sacrifice. In Roeg’s autobiography, he noted that early rushes from the film were far more frightening throughout but after road-testing it on his rather terrified young son, he recalibrated. As an eight-year-old who sat drenched in fear watching it for the first time, too scared and embarrassed to leave the room, what he kept in was enough to cause me night terrors for months after. Ultimately any concessions didn’t matter commercially as the film underperformed despite a string of glowing reviews. But fondness remains, so much so that a remake is due out next year from Robert Zemeckis with Anne Hathaway drafted in as the Grand High Witch and, in a comically Hollywood move, 50-year-old Octavia Spencer playing the grandmother (Zetterling was 65 in the original). There’s an interesting change in location – this time it’ll be Alabama in the 1960s – and Zemeckis has said it will be “a sociological spin” on the story, a head-scratching proposition that we’ll have to wait until 2021 to see play out. Watching the 1990 original as an adult, nightmares long behind me, it’s a relief to see just how justified my earlier troubled reaction was, the product of a vicious little film that even now strikes a far nastier note than the majority of family-friendly studio offerings. It’s very much part of a particular era of darker kids films alongside Return to Oz, The Dark Crystal and Something Wicked This Way Comes, all of which were similar box office disasters, a sign that kids wanted to be amused rather than scared. While my briefly traumatised eight-year-old self might not agree, there’s something important about experiencing at least a somewhat neutered, PG-friendly form of horror at a young age. “Being scared is a rite of passage,” children’s author Joanna Nadin once said, “but a pleasurable one. I don’t see the gain in mollycoddling.” Dahl and Roeg’s portrayal of purple-eyed child-killing sadists might be fantastical but it’s also brutally effective, a salient reminder for younger viewers to be more aware of their surroundings and to use trust sparingly. There’s no straight-laced PSA about not talking to strangers that could have achieved that fear quite so brilliantly as watching a boy get turned into a mouse or a girl get trapped in a painting. The Witches is a scary movie for kids who need scaring.",film
"In this extremely French but quite enjoyable comedy-drama, comic actor Grégory Montel, basically a smiley labrador in human form, plays Guillaume, a divorced, middle-aged Parisian chauffeur. He is striving to make enough money to upgrade to a better apartment so he can have his tween-aged daughter (Zelie Rixhon) stay overnight. Guillaume can’t afford to lose his job, as it is already hanging by a thread due to his having earned several points on his licence for speeding. That makes enduring the hauteur of his latest client, professional “nose” or fragrance designer Mademoiselle Anne Walberg (Emmanuelle Devos), all the more challenging given she expects him to not only drive and carry her luggage, but also help her change sheets at hotels because she can’t stand the odour of the “clean” smelling detergent they’ve used, and take notes for her while she analyses the smell of a cave that needs to be copied for a client. From this cutesy meeting – a predictably antagonistic first encounter – a friendship develops that, admirably for a change, doesn’t end up in quite the place you might expect by the end. In fact, that’s just one of several refreshing surprises. Others include the finely observed writing that limns the relationships between the main duo and between them and supporting characters, such as Guillaume and his smart, observant kid, or Anne and her avaricious agent (Pauline Moulène). But the most interesting thing about the film is its well-researched glimpse into the smell business, a multibillion-dollar industry that spans not just the designing of high-end perfumes for fashion houses, but also efforts to disguise the stink of factory emissions and scents to pump into supermarkets to make people buy more stuff. In passing, Anne mentions that she designed Dior’s J’adore, whose original formulation is actually the work of master perfumer Calice Becker. This film feels a bit like a tribute to talents such as Becker and Christine Nagel (formerly of Jo Malone, now at Hermès) who acted as an adviser for the movie. That attention to detail adds a welcome layer of complexity, making the whole thing a bit like a visit to the perfume department at Galeries Lafayette before a taxi ride on a rainy day in Paris.

"You might think a nation that effectively banned science fiction for much of its history (during the Cultural Revolution, and for other periods) might hesitate before encouraging its film-makers to get their futuristic thinking caps on. But China’s communist government has apparently been inspired by the huge box office success of homegrown space blockbuster The Wandering Earth to issue guidelines aimed at emboldening directors and screenwriters who might be planning a follow-up. Variety reports the official document “highlights how the sci-fi genre fits into the ruling Communist party’s broader ideological and technological goals”, which sounds suitably 1984. (Except that George Orwell’s seminal dystopian tome is frowned upon in China, to the extent that authorities at once point last year stopped social media users from being able to type out its title in reference to an abolition of presidential term limits; strangely enough, the book itself is not banned.) Variety also suggests new Chinese sci-fi films will be encouraged to “highlight Chinese values, inherit Chinese culture and aesthetics, cultivate contemporary Chinese innovation”, “disseminate scientific thought” and “raise the spirit of scientists”. Chinese sci-fi films, the trade paper says, will therefore be asked to portray China “in a positive light as a technologically advanced nation.” The disappointing thing here isn’t so much that Chinese authorities feel the need to intervene in this way – censors have been cracking down on “unacceptable” elements of Hollywood movies for decades. It’s that any local film-makers with futuristic concepts humming away in their subconscious will be so stymied in their creativity. For if there’s any film genre custom-designed to upset rigid politburo thinking, it’s science fiction. A quick glance at the history of Hollywood sci-fi – both recent and past – perfectly highlights the issue. Futuristic quadrilogy The Hunger Games was grudgingly allowed to screen in China (Hengqin island, near Macau, even opened a Hunger Games theme park last year). But it’s hard to imagine any Chinese-produced dystopian effort, especially one featuring an oppressive authoritarian government, getting the green light. Looking further back, we can imagine the ending of 1973’s Soylent Green being cleverly altered so that Charlton Heston realises the ubiquitous, suspiciously meaty foodstuff that keeps Earth’s growing population constantly sated is in fact a tasty vegan treat (rather than … you know), had the film been made in China. Might China attempt its own Star Wars? Such a move would surely be risky given that censors have in the past banned movies in the Pirates of the Caribbean series for featuring swirling spirits; George Lucas’s popular space opera has possibly featured more leading characters returning from the dead as ghosts than any other saga in Hollywood history. How about Back to the Future? Well, China banned Robert Zemeckis’s sci-fi adventure in 1985 due to its depiction of time travel. It’s thought censors have become less rigid in the intervening years, though movies in which modern-day Chinese citizens travel back to the glorious past were still looked down upon as recently as 2011. Avatar? Hmmm ... Bully-boy outsiders invade and take over the territory of an indigenous people, downplaying their culture and exploiting the local resources. If Colonel Miles Quaritch and his cronies had been portrayed by Chinese actors in a Chinese production it’s hard to imagine this concept getting past day one. Mad Max? George Miller’s Oscar-winning Fury Road failed to secure a release in China, though local film-makers did manage to put out a blatant rip-off titled Mad Shelia that borrowed most of the plot. How about kids’ sci-fi? Would Pixar’s Wall-E, in which humans are forced to travel into space because they have polluted the Earth so badly, have been given the go-ahead as a Chinese production? Given the way China has treated its own environmental activists, this one also looks like a no-no. What about Alien? Could a film in which a Chinese team becomes the first human beings ever to come into contact with extra-terrestrial life, only to find itself immediately ripped to shreds by the HR Giger’s “perfect organism” ever find its way into a local studio? Such a storyline doesn’t seem likely to “raise the spirit of scientists” or portray China as a “technologically advanced nation”, though it’s possible Ripley’s mecha-suited victory over the Alien queen in 1986’s sequel might have passed muster. It seems more likely that Chinese sci-fi efforts will mirror the success of The Wandering Earth, about a seemingly Chinese-led (though rendered in the movie as a future “world government”) mission to save mankind by moving the Earth to Alpha Centauri. Not much in the way of controversy there, especially as the planet has apparently fallen into ruin due to an ageing sun, rather than any kind of human-inspired environmental degradation. Because that’s not a hot button topic in any way. We should certainly expect to see very different movies emerging than Hollywood has traditionally released. And maybe that’s no bad thing – at least if you’re happy to see the complete elimination of almost everything that has made futuristic film-making interesting in western cinema over the past few decades.",film
"There are few artists who excelled in working across multiple music genres like Arthur Russell, yet there are many who share his status of relative obscurity. When Russell died in 1992 at 40, due to Aids-related illness, he left behind a body of work that spanned disco, avant-garde, folk, pop, new wave and classical. Yet much of it remained unreleased for years, housed in an overflowing archive of 1,000-plus tapes. In recent years, a treasure trove of posthumous archive-raiding releases have brought Russell’s pioneering and fecund work to light. He’s influenced everyone from LCD Soundsystem to Hot Chip and even Kanye West sampled him on 30 Hours from 2016’s Life of Pablo. Yet when Matt Wolf – director of recent documentary Spaceship Earth – made his 2008 film, Russell was even more of a mysterious cult figure than he is today. Wolf’s film is a tender and intimate look at Russell and his humble journey from the cornfields of Iowa, running away to a Buddhist retreat in San Francisco, before landing in New York’s bustling music scene, of which he became a hugely significant part. Archive footage of Russell performing is about on a par with that of the Velvet Underground, ie sparse. Recorded interviews with him are even rarer. Yet what Wolf’s documentary lacks in visual punch via plentiful archive it makes up for with music and thoughtful editing. A great deal of space is left for Russell’s music to float through the film, from his groove-locked dance floor firecrackers to his scratchy cello pieces coalesced with whisper-in-your-ear vocals. It’s as much a soundtrack to a life as it is a story. The fact so little footage of Russell exists adds to his mystique; even though the film tells the story of a beloved cult musician, bringing his personality to life, there’s still an unshakable sense that he remains something of an uncapturable presence. When Russell died his Village Voice obituary read: “Arthur’s songs were so personal that it seems as though he simply vanished into his music” and Wild Combination runs with this as its cinematic mantra. Russell was a dichotomous character and this is reflected in both the film and his music. He was deeply shy – some went as far to say strange – and some of his more intimate music aligns with this. Yet he was also responsible for making wildly dynamic music under aliases such as Dinosaur and Loose Joints that would rip up the dancefloor at places like the Paradise Garage, the notorious nightclub he loved to frequent and lose himself to the speakers. “He had to be the funkiest white boy I ever met,” says singer and collaborator Lola Love in the film – someone who was no stranger to funk herself as a member of James Brown’s revue. Russell is also presented as someone who was obsessive, perhaps often to his own detriment as piles of unfinished work would stack up due to his incessant need to tweak things. He’s painted as often being difficult and demanding, yet clearly this obdurate artistic vision was what produced such deeply singular music. It’s the breadth and versatility of Russell as an artist – along with the film’s deft tone – that makes Wild Combination such an endearing gem. To follow Russell’s unique path is to dive into the history of New York’s counter culture. He collaborated with everyone from Allen Ginsberg to Talking Heads, and Phillip Glass and Larry Levan. During his tenure as musical director of the downtown avant-garde music venue the Kitchen, he brought in pop and rock groups such as Jonathan Richman’s the Modern Lovers, amalgamating the previously divided worlds of pop and classical. In many senses, Russell was a connecting bridge between these two worlds in New York. He saw no distinction between the so-called highbrow and lowbrow, sharing an equal zealousness for bubblegum pop as he did Indian classical music. Many contributors have endless superlatives for him on camera – collaborator and Modern Lovers member Ernie Brookes views him as being one of the greatest songwriters of all time “up there with the Beatles” – but it’s the moments spent with his parents and surviving partner Tom Lee that really connect, adding a weighty emotional resonance. The film ends with Russell’s parents being asked what would have happened if he hadn’t contracted Aids. “He would have gone far,” his mother says, softly. “Either that or he’d have another 4,000 or 5,000 tapes,” adds his father with a smile.",film
"Something of a curate’s Fabergé egg, this peculiar Russian-made steampunk-lite fantasy feature has some interesting story ideas, entrancing visual effects and lovely sets (a lot of it was filmed in Tallinn’s gorgeous city centre in Estonia, as well as in St Petersburg). But many of the lead performances are painfully inert, exuding less verisimilitude than the story’s computer-generated fairies. Just to guide it deeper into the valley of the uncanny, nearly everyone in the film speaks English but with obviously dubbed voices, so while the phonemes roughly match the mouth movements, it’s a fair bet that different actors (often with American accents) recorded the dialogue in soundproof booths during post-production. That said, this last weirdness creates a kind of verfremdungseffekt, or sense of alienation, which dilutes any remaining realism and thus may be intentional. We can be pretty sure that director Aleksandr Boguslavskiy and his collaborators fully intended to create a magical world that looks all at once medieval, belle époque and 1930s-ish. There, the residents of a town called Fensington live inside a high wall designed to keep them safe from supposedly sinister strangers, a bit like a Maga-hat fantasy version of Yuma, Arizona, but smaller and with more snow. Nearly a hundred years after the wall was built, a father (Eddie Marsan) gives his young daughter a necklace that turns out to have strange powers before he is taken away by officers wearing creepy bronze masks who claim that he is “infected” with some enigmatic disease. The girl, Abigail, grows up to be willowy, wooden-as-a-countertop ex-model Tinatin Dalakishvili, who then falls in with a group of resistance fighters. With masked soldiers snatching civilians in Belarus and the continuing conflict in Ukraine, it’s temping to spy some kind of anti-fascism allegory in this story, but that may be taking things too far. Sometimes a zeppelin is just a zeppelin.       ",film
"‘For three days after the Bataclan, I thought I was dead,” says Ismaël el Iraki, whose debut feature, Zanka Contact, about two lost souls recovering from PTSD, is playing at the Venice film festival. It’s a Wild at Heart-type love story starring Ahmed Hammoud and Moroccan music star Khansa Batma with debts to Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone. A car crash throws together a has-been rocker who has just returned to Casablanca and a streetwise con-artist, who get lulled into the shenanigans of the city’s music underworld. Zanka Contact riffs on the director’s experiences trying to recover from all he witnessed at the Eagles of Death Metal concert at Paris’s Bataclan venue in November 2015, when gunmen massacred 90 people in a night of coordinated attacks by terrorists that left 143 dead and hundreds injured. El Iraki stared at the gunman as he pulled the trigger. The bullet scraped past him. He was preparing to die when the fearless actions of a security guard called Didi saved him. Oblivious to his personal wellbeing, Didi kept returning to the concert hall, leading the injured and distressed to safety. “I saw a hero with my own eyes,” recalls El Iraki, who escaped through the front door of the building.  “I still live surrounded by ghosts,” says the Moroccan-born film-maker who moved to Paris to attend La Fémis, the prestigious French film school where his classmates included Raw director Julia Ducournau. It was there, in 2009, that he made the popular, award-winning short film H’rash. But those happy experiences now seem a world away after what happened at the Bataclan. “One of the things I discovered through this is PTSD is an infectious disease given to you by those who exact violence on you.” The Bataclan concert was supposed to be the first of eight live performances El Iraki was going to attend that week. Motörhead at the Zenith and the other gigs were cancelled, except for one. “I went to Kadavar because I had a ticket, and it said ‘placement libre’ [unreserved seating] on it. I was very afraid, but it was a life-changing experience for me. They brought me back from the dead.” The 36-year-old is wearing a Kadavar “horned goddess” T-shirt inspired by the German power trio’s track Goddess of Dawn as we speak via video. He has big hair that yawns out in all directions and a full beard that makes him look like hip-hop musician Questlove. He gives a hearty laugh. “I’m more of a rock guy, but if I don’t wash my hair it goes into dreadlocks. And that’s not me. I love funk, hip-hop, rock and roll – but reggae, even when I’m stoned is tough.” El Iraki is sitting in a room in his apartment in Paris that houses his extensive vinyl collection, and he feigns embarrassment when he moves the webcam to show how many are soundtrack albums. As a youngster in Rabat, film music records would often arrive months or years before the film made it to cinemas. So, by the time Jurassic Park came out, he recalls being very familiar with its soundtrack. That he still has the air of someone who is the life of the party is testament to the work he undertook at behavioural treatment centres after the attacks. “They make you relive what happened to you, again and again. They provoke it. What you realise is that is not a bad memory, it breathes in the present, and the goal is to make that thing become a memory.” An open letter on El Iraki’s Facebook page went viral when he criticised Eagles of Death frontman Jesse Hughes. The pro-gun Trump-supporting Hughes had condemned Islam in an interview using the type of abhorrent language found in Jewish-conspiracy rhetoric. An atheist himself, El Iraki adds: “The problem is that we are all part of many groups, and he doesn’t see the bigger group. You’re a skater, a Mexican food lover, a Dostoyevsky reader and you’re also a Muslim. You’re not just brown or whatever.” When he started making Zanka Contact, El Iraki says it was about a man who was present during a terrorist attack. But he realised: “That was too close to news material.” He wanted to steer clear of a story focused on violence; he criticises the media reporting of terrorist incidents as overly preoccupied with the violent spectacular with too little focus on the resilience of the victims. El Iraki wrote a symbolic fairytale about recovering from trauma. “It’s still there. You are fucked for life but can learn to live with it. At the heart of the movie is this couple with intersecting traumas and how they can help each other.” What happened at the Bataclan became more peripheral and symbolic to his film. Kadavar is the band playing a rock concert. “Unfortunately, there are a lot of things from the Bataclan days, a lot of visions and nightmares exorcised in a movie.” The creation of the titular song is a cathartic moment for the characters, and a reflection of the director’s own journey. “The main thing for me,” says El Iraki, “was to never lose my love of music because of this violence.”",film
"A specialist in fantasy and the supernatural, Mexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro was born in Guadalajara in 1964. He worked as a special effects makeup designer, before making his directing debut with 1993 vampire story Cronos. He went on to make two highly acclaimed supernatural films in Spain – ghost story The Devil’s Backbone and Pan’s Labyrinth, which sets a fantasy mythology against the background of the Franco dictatorship. His work in Hollywood includes two Hellboy films, Japanese-themed robots-v-monsters epic Pacific Rim and gothic drama Crimson Peak. The Shape of Water (2017), a love story about a woman and an amphibian being, won multiple awards including Oscars for best picture and best director, and the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival. He is preparing a stop-motion version of Pinocchio, with voice artists including Tilda Swinton and Ewan McGregor. He also recently launched Wizards, the third of the Tales of Arcadia trilogy of children’s CGI animation series, currently screening on Netflix. And he has just published a new fantasy novel, The Hollow Ones, written in collaboration with Chuck Hogan, his co-author on book trilogy The Strain, which also spawned a TV series. Set in modern-day Manhattan, the early 60s deep south and Elizabethan England, The Hollow Ones introduces immortal occult detective Hugo Blackwood – named in tribute to the fantasy writer Algernon Blackwood. Del Toro talked about the novel and other projects over the phone from Toronto, where he has just resumed work on his feature film Nightmare Alley, production having halted in March because of the coronavirus lockdown. Starring Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett and Willem Dafoe, it is based on the 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham, and tells the story of the relationship between a crooked carnival worker and a psychiatrist. The Hollow Ones is a very strange genre hybrid. It starts off feeling like a Jack Reacher crime thriller, but then you bring in your character Hugo Blackwood, a Van Helsing-style demon hunter.This is a mix that goes back quite a while, starting with the [19th-century] Irish writer Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, who was one of the best ghost story writers. He came up with a character called Dr Martin Hesselius, who was in certain ways an occult investigator. Then Algernon Blackwood created a genre with John Silence, a physician slash psychic detective, for the first time merging procedural and supernatural happenings. That continued during the pulp literature era – it’s a very strange subgenre in horror fiction. You’ve dedicated the book to old-school horror/fantasy writers – Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, Arthur Machen. What is it about the Edwardian/Victorian imagination that excites you?What I like about Blackwood is that in his stories, the supernatural is a given – unlike, say, The Hound of the Baskervilles, where you have a very eerie atmosphere and legend and lore, but then you discover the more natural, prosaic causes of the case. With Blackwood’s John Silence stories, you’re not going to discover that it was a band of smugglers disguised as ghosts – you’re going to face the actual supernatural. There’s a note at the start of your book claiming that grave robbing is a major phenomenon in New Jersey. Really?Yes, that was the origin of this whole thing. I saw a newspaper story that detailed how they found human remains in a cauldron in a garage, and the police were linking it to grave robbing. I started researching, and found that grave robbing for occult purposes was almost reaching epidemic proportions in New Jersey. I thought, this is interesting – we can bounce back between that and Mesopotamian entities and a detective that you can summon on Wall Street in modern times. Your story deals with certain difficult areas of American history – the deep south, slavery, the Klan. Given the heightened sensitivities around such themes at the moment, do you worry people might feel that these are not topics best suited to genre fiction?Well, we started writing it five or six years ago. I think [African American FBI man] Agent Solomon is a really strong character in the book. The book is talking about evil in many forms, not just the supernatural form, but the human perception of it. I think fiction can work to address the real world. You have to be mindful of these things; the combination has to be done carefully – the horror and the idea of an America that is still characterised a lot by these things in the past. You’re a very active Twitter user, mixing your cultural enthusiasms with political comments. For example, you’ve mentioned the recent death of Giovanni López, killed after being arrested for not wearing a face mask in the state of Jalisco.That is sadly not an isolated case, it has happened in other states in Mexico. The reality that it’s revealing is a very tragic fact that we live with every day in Mexico, which is the meshing of the police with the criminals – it’s almost a complete symbiosis. The way you react in Mexico to the police is with immense wariness and distrust. This is just one of the cases that evidenced the almost insane paradox of somebody during a pandemic being hurt or killed by people who are supposed to be enforcing health laws. What do you enjoy about social media?You have to use it carefully. In my life, I’ve fused those things that I love artistically with the things that I believe politically – that’s true of my movies, it’s true of my Twitter account, it’s true of my daily life. I think what I have to do with social media is to point people in the direction of plays or movies or images or image creators that can enrich them, and that may not be well known. I try not to participate in chipping in on scandal or divisive pillorying. I try to use it as a positive, enriching platform. You’ve recently tweeted about rereleased silent films, new Mexican movies… What have you been watching of late?I could tweet 20 times a day – I’m very careful not to, because there’s a part of your life that needs to remain only for you. But a couple of days ago, on Gene Kelly’s birthday, I watched four of his movies, and not the ones you’d imagine – The Pirate, For Me and My Gal… Much of my time is spent rewatching – say, a Douglas Sirk melodrama or thriller, like Sleep, My Love. With the pandemic, my habit has been to screen at least three movies a day. I was in lockdown for many weeks in Toronto first, completely quarantined and socially distancing, and then in California, for an equal amount of time. Without having to go to the office, you have 18 hours, and you can dedicate nine hours to work, and nine hours for three movies, and still have time to take care of your basic needs. It’s a blessing to have the time. I’m very lucky to be able to work from home, so I try not to waste it. What about your animation series, Tales of Arcadia? What led you into that area?I wanted to cater to a family viewing experience, the way I had it when I was a kid. I grew up with the anime of Osamu Tezuka – in Mexico in the 60s, we were invaded by Japanese anime. I remember watching Astro Boy – it’s a very melancholic story, you know, and Tezuka in general has that feeling. I thought, could we do the classic “hero’s journey”, but use it to talk about loss? You’re also adding your stop-motion Pinocchio to a long list of versions of the tale. And you’re well known to be fascinated with Frankenstein – so will your Pinocchio be a kind of Frankenstein story?To me, they’re not exactly the same, but they’re similar. They are both creatures that are created and thrown into a world that they have to figure out on their own. They both have a moral, spiritual journey. I thought Pinocchio could be a great opportunity to talk about disobedience. Obedience isn’t a virtue, it’s a burden. Disobedience is the seed of reason – it’s a desirable way to gain your own soul. I thought this could be an interesting background for Pinocchio, if we set it during the rise of Mussolini – an interesting time for a puppet that refuses to obey. What can we expect from Nightmare Alley?There was a moment in American letters in which this underbelly of modern America started to be addressed – a lot of that congealed around noir writing, the pulp detectives and novels. But there are other pieces of writing, like The Day of the Locust, They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? and Nightmare Alley, that address this intersection of the modern and the visceral in a very interesting way. The original novel, when it was written, was right at the crossroads of the modern notion of psychoanalysis, kind of jamming that with the occult powers of the tarot, and the idea of travelling carnivals and spiritualism used to defraud the gullible. It’s a really interesting mixture of things – I don’t like things straight, I like to combine things that in theory should not go together. Like a post-civil war struggle in Spain and fairytale; or a mix of a Douglas Sirk melodrama with an amphibian god and a sexual-awakening love story.",film
"This crass, macho movie is an LA police drama with an unreconstructed 1970s mentality. Its heroes are tough-guy white cops with chevron moustaches who’ll smoke on duty if they damn well please, and to hell with the regulations. The only significant female character is a drug addict who allows a pimp to sell her daughter to a drug gang. African American men mostly appear cuffed and face down on the bonnet of a patrol car. And its sympathy for white lawmen who play fast and loose with the rules – especially at a time when so many unarmed black men are dying at the hands of white officers – feels shamefully irresponsible. The drama takes place over one night in the squad car of fresh-faced beat cop Nick Holland (Luke Kleintank) and his grizzled partner Ray (Thomas Jane). Ray’s primary lesson to the rookie appears to be versing him in cliched cop talk (“There’s the world inside your cop car, and everything else”). The pair make a handful of run-of-the-mill arrests while Ray attends to a personal matter: investigating the disappearance of his dead partner’s eight-year-old daughter. Inevitably, justice and the protection of women and children will require him to skirt the rules. To hammer home the point that Ray is a good guy, writer-director Joel Souza gives us a dirty cop, Jack VanZandt (Josh Hopkins), a speed-freak knucklehead who rampages around the city beating the living hell out of anyone who looks at him funny. This is mediocre, mostly forgettable drama, but it leaves a nasty taste. You can imagine it screened at the Republican party convention as the warm-up to a law and order debate.",film
"Although this music documentary about Robbie Robertson and the Band is directed by Canadian film-maker Daniel Roher, the great Martin Scorsese takes an executive producer credit and is also interviewed briefly on screen. Sure enough, Once Were Brothers feels a lot like one of Scorsese’s distinctive rock docs, particularly The Last Waltz, his 1978 record of the Band’s last live gig – with crisper digital photography and nearly the same star power in the lineup of interviewees. While there’s no Joni Mitchell or Neil Young, you do get Bruce Springsteen rhapsodising about the Band’s influence and craftsmanship, while sometime Band cronies and collaborators of yore – including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Van Morrison – chip in with reminiscences about the good old days. As in Scorsese’s rock docs, there are reams of archive footage and rare snapshots to swoon over (Dylan’s striped trousers from 1967 never get old), all seamlessly edited together by Roher and Eamonn O’Connor. The terrifyingly industrious Robertson effectively narrates the story and takes centre stage, which is probably right considering how central he was to the outfit. Due credit is also given to the contributions from Garth Hudson as well as the three band members who have died: Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, and above all drummer Levon Helm. The last gets a loving tribute: recognition for his instrumentality to the original lineup, praise for his musicianship and awe for his wildly free spirit. The story about Helm taking a sabbatical in the early days to work on an oil rig off the Gulf Coast is enough to make one nostalgic for a time when musicians were workers before they were celebrities. It’s a little disappointing – if hardly surprising given the period covered – that there are hardly any women interviewed here, or even featured in the flashbacks, apart from Dominique Robertson, Robbie’s ex-wife who offers an interesting side-eye view of the group. But them’s the breaks.",film
"A Kid Like Jake is an earnestly intended, seriously acted film, painful in various intentional and unintentional ways. It is by the TV veteran Silas Howard, who was the first trans director of the show Transparent, and adapted by Daniel Pearle from his own award-winning stage play. But it’s a film that strenuously avoids its own potential for satire or humour, averting its gaze from the #firstworldproblems issue. Claire Danes and Jim Parsons play Alex and Greg, a well-to-do New York couple: she’s a former lawyer turned stay-at-home mom and he’s a therapist. They have a bright, imaginative four-year-old, Jake (Leo James Davis), and like many parents in their milieu, they have allowed themselves to get obsessed with getting Jake into an exclusive private pre-school. This aspiration may sound ridiculous and snobbish but the film asks you to take it – and Alex and Greg – seriously at some level. The couple’s teacher friend Judy (Octavia Spencer) has noted Jake’s love of Disney heroines and dressing up in fairy gowns, and suggests to Alex that on the application form she should really emphasise Jake’s “gender-expansive play” because top-ranking schools are very concerned with diversity. And Alex, however keen she is to get into these elite institutions, has to suppress her conflicted emotions. It would be interesting to see what Neil LaBute or David Mamet would do with such an idea, or if they might present a debate about whether four is too early to be thinking about diversity in these terms. But debate in that sense is resolutely absent here. Oddly, there are hardly any scenes in which the parents interact with Jake (he is offstage in the play) and no one actually says the words “gay” or “trans” (although there is one abusive insult); it’s as if the drama is concerned to mimic the walking-on-eggshells diplomacy of the teaching professionals who have to engage with Alex and Greg. Danes gives it her very considerable best, but there is something weirdly inhibited about this movie.",film
"This is a horror comedy whose two constituent genres, like so much else in this style, cancel each other out: too funny to be scary and yet not funny enough to be funny. Two Heads Creek shows up like a would-be Ozploitation shocker and it’s lively enough, it hangs together and the anti-racist intentions are there. The screenwriter and star is Jordan Waller (who played Randolph Churchill in Darkest Hour). He is Norman, a nervous guy adopted at birth by a Polish woman in Britain along with his uptight sister Annabelle (Kathryn Wilder). Now grown up, the siblings have to deal with anti-Polish abuse from the locals and when they hear their birth mother was Australian they jump at the chance to meet her in her gruesomely named home town in the outback: Two Heads Creek.  They soon discover horrible things are going on, not unconnected with bigotry of the sort they’d hoped to leave behind: the movie riffs cheerfully on the Australian government’s international reputation for providing immigrants with what a former British prime minister called a “hostile environment”. The chopping and the splattering and the fine blood spray over appalled faces begins and the movie is targeted at a customer base who believe that this kind of thing is just automatically hilarious. They are things I find unhilarious and the all-important context here makes no difference to the unhilarity. Walker and Wilder sell it gamely enough – but it’s the sort of movie you need to smoke your body weight in weed to enjoy.",film
"With The Mole Agent, Maite Alberdi set out to make a film noir documentary about a spy in a nursing home. She did not expect it to transform into an aching meditation on isolation and loneliness. The Chilean film-maker told the Guardian she was initially toying with genre and form. In early scenes, she makes you question whether you’re even watching a documentary because of the heightened noir aesthetic – venetian blinds and high contrast lighting. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the octogenarian Sergio Chamy who is hired by a private eye, Rómulo Aitken, to snoop around a nursing home. Gradually, life chips away at the Pink Panther playfulness of the premise, and the film settles into a sombre look at ageing and desperately hanging on to human connection. That journey, which for Alberdi is the accumulation of 300 hours of footage, flies by breathlessly in a 90-minute film. It began with a search for her lead. She landed at Detective Aitken’s office. He’s a former federal police investigator turned middle-aged private eye who had already handled four cases in nursing homes. As a documentary film-maker, Alberdi felt a connection to Aitken’s trade. He waits until he can find proof, just as she waits until the right scene appears before her camera. “I always say my budgets are to pay the crew to wait until the things that we are waiting for happen,” Alberdi said. They waited at Aitken’s office until the right case came along: a client wanted her mother watched to make sure she was being treated well inside a long-term care facility. These cases, Alberdi explained, are common, driven by the guilt of offspring who leave their parents in such institutions. The nursing home private eye, Alberdi said, is akin to the nanny cam. Aitken’s regular mole suffered a hip injury. He had to hire a new one. That led to a hilarious casting … erm … hiring process. We see various seniors in the interview chair responding to the help wanted ad. They’re baffled anyone would want to hire someone over 80. But they jump at the opportunity to break their moldy routines and be mentally stimulated with a new gig. The irony that entering a nursing home would be stimulating was not lost on Alberdi. When it came to that casting process, the documentary director did not take an impartial stance. “I fell in love with Sergio,” she said, explaining that she convinced Aitken to hire the soft-spoken and gentle 83-year-old widower. Chamy couldn’t navigate the camera on an iPhone, which would be deemed an essential skill in nursing home spycraft. The way he fumbles with tech in not so subtle ways lends the film much of its humour. But Alberdi felt he had the right disposition to be the film’s anchor, while embedded for months as the new resident in the senior home. She already had a crew on scene before Chamy’s arrival. The staff were told that her crew was making a documentary about daily life in a nursing home. That turns out to be closer to what the film became, since Chamy soon grew tired of spying. Despite all the deception, the film ended up being far more honest than intended. “Our heart was not in the case,” Alberdi said, explaining how her crew followed Chamy’s lead. Though he found his “target”, made contact and regularly checked in on her wellbeing, his undercover dispatches to Aitken grew less frequent. The gentle spy grew resentful of his boss and the covert job. Instead, Chamy befriended other residents and turned his attention to them. And the documentary became about the long-term care home’s social dynamic. Early scenes show the predominantly female residents watching the cameras suspiciously, reminding each other that those boom mics are listening in on their conversations, as if they too had secret agendas. But eventually they ignore the crew’s presence and carry on, often fawning over Chamy, who was one of only a handful of men in that home. Alberdi explained that the gender breakdown in this particular nursing home is not common in Chile. Men are usually dumped in homes, while women are kept with the children or grandchildren they raised. However, this particular home goes back decades, with a clientele largely made up of women who never married, had children or found their independence with careers. Alberdi pegged the home as a portrait of a patriarchal generation. “Your life makes sense if you get married,” Alberdi said, describing the sentiment that led to many of these women arriving at the home in their 50s, deposited there as though they did not belong in society. In that way, The Mole Agent feels disquietingly similar to Alberdi’s 2016 documentary, The Grown-Ups. That film is a compassionate portrait of young adults with Down’s syndrome who desperately want independence and resent being infantilized. Both films, for Alberdi, are about people that society refuses to integrate. They’re kept isolated because they are deemed too dependent – or rather, too much work. In The Mole Agent, Alberdi homes in on the micro-society the women and the nurses build for themselves, and how Chamy navigates that. In scenes that alternate between humour and heartbreak, he brings them conversation and comfort. He helps them cope, and when needed, stand on their own two feet. He keeps the home’s resident kleptomaniac in check, returning stolen necklaces to their owners with a gentle nod of disapproval towards the amusing culprit. And, if only for a short while, he entertains the amorous eyes of women like Berta. “I would consider giving God my virginity through my future husband,” says the simultaneously pious and randy Berta, who’s been in the home for 25 years. Alberdi’s film is particularly attentive to how Catholicism, patriarchy and female sexuality can thrive at once in this environment. That one line from Berta nails it all. The sadness that throbs throughout the film swells near the end, when the women in the home pour their heart out to Chamy about missing their families and being left behind. With that emotional finale, Alberdi expected her film to inspire a conversation in Chile about the loneliness and depression experienced by seniors. But Covid-19 did that instead. The pandemic forced long-term care facilities across the globe into intensive lockdowns. The ageing population, who are the most vulnerable to the virus, are now no longer able to receive visitors. Their isolation intensified. But the world started paying attention. “I read the newspaper on Saturday and there were pages speaking of depression in old people,” said Alberdi. She sees a silver lining in the current situation. She rarely witnessed a visit or a call from family to residents during her months at the nursing home. But now, during the pandemic, Alberdi said she’s noticed that people are regularly checking in on their parents or grandparents in senior homes. Seniors, who she couldn’t trust to handle iPhone cameras, are now jumping on Zoom calls with their grandchildren.",film
"A maze of a movie, in which the walls are closing in and the exit is through a constantly shifting Escher staircase of a storyline: the latest from Charlie Kaufman blends metaphysical sleights of hand with a mounting chill of choking panic. This is Kaufman’s second screenplay to be based on a novel, but unlike Adaptation’s meta-dissection of the processing of adapting Susan Orlean’s The Orchid Thief, here he attempts to get into the skin, or at least the sensibility, of Iain Reid’s 2016 book. We already knew that Jessie Buckley is something special. But she’s fully miraculous in the central role of a young woman who has agreed to meet her boyfriend’s parents (a frazzled Toni Collette and David Thewlis) on their isolated farm, even as the snow begins to fall and the angst sets in and she is “thinking of ending things”.  She is introduced as Lucy, but slips into other names (and other clothes and other voices) as the film weaves onwards. Perhaps describing her as the central role is misleading – there’s a friable, mercurial quality to the character that seems to repeatedly crumble and re-form, like a sand sculpture. But the authenticity of Buckley’s performance, which seems all the more remarkable when you think back over it than it does when you are watching her, gives the character a solidity, while the other characters drift around her like ghosts. This is not cinema that leaves you feeling good about things. Nor does it tread a familiar path. But I’m Thinking of Ending Things is one of the most daringly unexpected films of the year, a sinewy, unsettling psychological horror, saturated with a squirming dream logic that tips over into the domain of nightmares. Buckle up for this one and make sure you’ve stocked up on your meds.",film
"Onur Tukel’s 2016 “black and blue comedy” Catfight is catharsis by proxy. It goes without saying that the world is absurd and there’s a lot to be mad about. It’s far from a new sentiment but still, it’s one most keenly felt this year in particular. Pandemics, protests, presidents – it barely scratches the surface of the things we’re getting riled up about in 2020, whether righteously or not. But where to turn to release all that building tension? You watch someone else do it in your stead, of course. Catfight is simple in concept and execution – two entitled, upper-class women meet multiple times over the duration of the film to do little more than beat the absolute living snot out of each other. There’s more to it than that, sure – most glaringly, a pointed if a little boggling indictment of US imperialism and the war on terror, but if we’re being honest, there is nothing so thrilling as watching Anne Heche beat up Sandra Oh so badly that she ends up in a coma. It’s hard to believe that Veronica (Oh), a haughty, wine-fuelled trophy wife to a not-so-secretly closeted businessman, used to be friends with Ashley (Heche), a struggling lesbian artist who berates her baby-voiced assistant and doting wife, alike. But college is a far cry from the cutthroat nature of New York high society and when Veronica sees Ashley working as a caterer at her husband’s party, the smugness she doesn’t even attempt to hide at seeing her old friend fall so low, is truly deserving of the finishing KO Ashley will deal her in under five minutes’ time. But with the final blow does not come absolution, there is no sense of vindication or justice. The film and the actors alike go a long way to conveying the nuances of both women – Ashley is not an underdog dishing out just deserts and Veronica isn’t some black-hearted villainess. Ashley’s ambition and demand for recognition is her worst quality but her desire to start a family with her wife, Lisa (Alicia Silverstone), slightly softens her sharp edges. Veronica on the other hand is sniping and conceited but her ignorance over the state of her marriage and regret over not engaging with her son more bring a needed element of sympathy to the character, due to Oh’s earnest portrayal. Granted, these two women are largely unpleasant but the film makes it pertinent to understand that neither are more or less deserving of support or what hardships await them. And many hardships there are. The next fight, years later, doesn’t take you by surprise like the first one does, but it’s just as brutal. To call it the female version of David Fincher’s Fight Club at first seems flippant but soon feels quite apt. While the men in Fight Club are bored with their lives and seek release in basement brawls, the women of Catfight do not have such a luxury – overwhelmed by what life has dished out, they have hit a limit, with no other choice but to lash out and not without consequence too (as there often are for women). The fight does not bring glory or peace of mind, just heartache and more pain than maybe it’s worth – and what is more womanly than that? Catfight is sexy in title alone – there are no barely clad women pawing and scratching each other. It’s mesmerising but not remotely romantic. These aren’t two well-oiled gladiators stepping to the plate to defend home and honour, they are two big cats, brutish and volatile, swiping at each other’s necks. Their instincts are base and they are out for blood, which they get in abundance. The fights are a cacophony of comic book-esque jabs and hits, interspersed with Beethoven’s Symphony No 5. Both the cracking impacts of the punches and the sheer gall to get involved in a street fight while wearing white jeans will leave you wincing. It’s horrific but feels inevitable, natural, even. There’s little room in Catfight to hash out the morals of wrong and right. Both parties do untold damage to each other, both deal with loss, helplessness and rage – “You remind me of someone” says the orderly assisting Ashley in her physiotherapy at the same hospital Veronica was ejected from two years prior. She snipes at him much in the same way Veronica did – quite frankly, both these women are as bad as each other. But the thought of comeuppance is at the back of this film’s mind, there is far more consideration of the violent act itself, the matter of rage and the ways in which we release it, being the focal point. Which in itself is a thrill to witness. It is unimportant why you’re angry, just that you are. At a time when collective rage has hit a new peak but propriety dictates that regardless of how you’re feeling, no, you really shouldn’t start a fight club to deal with pent-up frustrations (for one, it wouldn’t be social distancing compliant), Catfight gives you permission to feel the upset and simultaneously provides an acceptable outlet. There’s a lot to be mad about in this world we live in, sure, but at least this film isn’t one of them.",film
"In This is Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist of the world’s loudest rock band, surprises the film’s director, Marty DiBergi, with a delicate piano composition that seems far removed from the heavy-metal sludge of songs like Hell Hole, Sex Farm, and Big Bottom. Nigel refers to it as a “Mach” piece – a fusion of Mozart and Bach – and intends it as part of a musical trilogy in D minor, which he calls “the saddest of all keys”. DiBergi thinks the piece is beautiful and asked him what it’s called. Nigel stops chewing his gum momentarily and deadpans: “Oh, this piece is called Lick My Love Pump.” Perhaps the similarities are merely coincidental, but the most important scene in Five Easy Pieces plays out in essentially the same way. Only here it’s Jack Nicholson behind the keys as Bobby Dupea, doing a soulful rendition of Chopin’s Prelude in E Minor, which at a minimum sounds like the second saddest of all keys. Though part of an upper-class family of classical musicians, Bobby hasn’t sat on a piano bench since returning to home to Puget Sound, Washington, but he’s willing to make an exception for his brother’s fiancee, Catherine (Susan Anspach), because he wants to get laid. (That’s another thing he and a rock musician like Nigel have in common.) The performance moves Catherine to tears, just as Bobby intended, but her reaction stirs the contempt and self-loathing that’s always simmering below the surface. He tells her it’s the easiest piece he could think of, and that he played it better when he was eight years old. If she believes it reflects some heretofore masked inner feeling, she is mistaken. “I faked a little Chopin,” he says. “You faked a big response.” That doesn’t mean Catherine is wrong to notice some flicker of soul in that moment – later scenes reveal that he really does feel something for her – but Bobby has spent his adult life trying to extinguish it. He won’t allow her to see the real him, whoever that might be. Fifty years later, Five Easy Pieces still puts us in Catherine’s shoes, puzzling over this charismatic mess of a human being. After spending the better part of the 60s stealing scenes in independent films like Little Shop of Horrors and Easy Rider, Jack Nicholson announced himself as a leading man with Bobby Dupea – and, in turn, introduced a decade where flawed characters like him were possible. In the hands of a lesser actor – or even a very good actor – Bobby could come off as a sour, abusive drip, unworthy of our interest, much less our sympathy. But Nicholson plays the audience like Bobby doing Prelude in E Minor, utterly confident that he’ll seduce us into caring about a man who’s incapable of returning the love he attracts so effortlessly. The timing of Five Easy Pieces is uncanny, coming just after a decade spent by Nicholson in independent cinema – before he was truly ready to infiltrate Hollywood in the 70s. Though the film was distributed by Columbia Pictures, the production company behind it – then called Raybert Productions and later known as BBS Productions (for producers Bob Rafelson, Bert Schneider and Stephen Blaunder) – was a flag-bearer for New Hollywood, which would import the exciting, iconoclastic work coming out of Europe at the time. Rafelson, who directed, and the screenwriter Adrien Joyce (AKA Carole Eastman), who had written The Shooting for Nicholson and the director Monte Hellman three years earlier, made a film of almost radical modesty, a character study with the richness and interiority of a great novel. And as with all great novels, it’s the smallest details that matter. The earliest scenes in Five Easy Pieces set the parameters of Bobby’s blue-collar life around the oilfields of Kern county, California: the grueling physicality of working on a rig; his contentious domestic life with Rayette (Karen Black), a waitress he’s comfortable mistreating; a bowling outing during which he insults Rayette while flirting shamelessly with the women in an adjacent lane. It isn’t until later, when he meets his sister Tita (Lois Smith) at a recording studio in Los Angeles, that we learn that he’s running from his past as a classical pianist of impressive musical stock. When Bobby learns that his distant father has suffered a debilitating stroke, he makes the drive to Puget Sound for a visit. But he’s so intent on separating his past from his present that he deposits Rayette in a motel and heads to the island alone. The big standalone scene seems like an anomaly, with Bobby castigating a waitress for not allowing him to order a simple side of toast with his omelet. His workaround for the restaurant’s “no substitutions” policy is to ask for a chicken salad sandwich sans everything – “I want you to hold it between your knees,” he says of the chicken – and he winds up sweeping the waters across the table in frustration. It’s a funny moment in a film with few of them, but it’s also Bobby in a nutshell: it’s no coincidence that he’s directing his anger toward a woman who shares his girlfriend’s occupation. It’s not out of character for him to combust so dramatically. And, in the end, he doesn’t even get the toast he wanted. But who knows what he wants? Bobby operates by impulse, which allows him to chase short-term desires like bedding women and getting toast with his omelet, but leaves him existentially adrift. Unlike the restlessness in a film like Easy Rider, which looks dangerous and cool and a lot like freedom, Five Easy Pieces is about the terrible uncertainty of being unmoored from any kind of satisfying life. The masterful closing sequence, like an elegant short story in itself, leaves the impression that Bobby will never find one, either. It’s possible to see Five Easy Pieces as representing the fallout after a turbulent decade – akin to the “what now?” final shot of The Graduate – but that would deny the specificity of a film that actively resists making statements. If it was representative of anything, it was the potential of what American film could be.",film
"Inaccurately titled horror film The Unfamiliar purees together an assortment of tired tropes with just enough originality and admirable craftsmanship to make 89 minutes of jump scares and twists visible from outer space reasonably bearable. Its first move is to make us wonder whether main protagonist Izzy (Jemima West), a British army doctor just home from Afghanistan, is really picking up on weird supernatural shenanigans in her rural home or suffering from acute post-traumatic stress disorder. Something definitely doesn’t seem right with her husband Ethan (Christopher Dane) who has suddenly shifted away from studying Polynesian totems (there’s a particularly scary looking one in the baby’s bedroom) in favour of writing children’s fiction. Meanwhile, her pre-adolescent son (Harry McMillan-Hunt) seems to be hiding secrets, and her adolescent daughter (Rebecca Hanssen) is acting just like, er, a stroppy teenager. In a somewhat witty reversal of expectations, CCTV camera footage of what Izzy thought were freaky events with demonic presences reveals nothing is there at all. Or is there? Somehow, it all comes to a climax when the family goes on holiday to Hawaii, which is at least a mildly novel setting for horror hijinks. If director Henk Pretorius demonstrates little more than mere competence in building atmosphere, at least he and his casting directors can spot talent in child actors. Both McMillan-Hunt and Hanssen are genuinely terrific as the troubled kids, projecting ambiguous signals about whether they’re possessed or just hormonal. It’s not entirely clear, but I believe they are supposed to be Izzy’s stepchildren, which makes this an interesting gloss on the usual family dynamics of fairytales, where the stepmother is meant to be the bad guy, not the kids. Elsewhere, Robbie Drake’s creature effects designs are effectively spooky and the use of white contact lenses never ceases to be creepy, however familiar it is as a sign of malignancy.",film
"The premise is the Fantasy Football of drama: imagine a select bunch of historical figures, together in one room, putting the world to rights. Tom Stoppard’s play Travesties (Lenin, Tzara, James Joyce) set the trend, and more recently, Kemp Powers’s 2013 play One Night in Miami imagined a summit between four African-American legends: Malcolm X, Cassius Clay (soon to become Muhammad Ali), football hero turned movie star Jim Brown and soul legend Sam Cooke. In fact, these four really did meet in Miami in February 1964. Powers has now adapted his play for the debut feature by actor and director Regina King (TV’s Watchmen, Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk). King opens out Powers’s drama somewhat, notably in an extended intro, but the action is largely restricted to a single hotel room. The occasion for the meeting is the Clay-Sonny Liston fight in Miami – after which Malcolm X summons the other three to celebrate Clay’s championship win. The guests expect a party, only to find that their sober-minded host intends an evening of “reflection” – with ice cream the only refreshment. The ensuing conversation reveals the tensions underlying a pivotal moment for black America: Clay (Eli Goree) is about to join the Nation of Islam, only to learn that his mentor Malcolm is leaving the movement. Brown (Aldis Hodge) is planning to hang up his helmet and act full-time, while Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr), already a massive soul star, is musing over the meaning and value of his artistry. The most heated moment comes when Malcolm X berates Cooke for not writing a song as politically eloquent as Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind. Soul fans will guess that before long, we’ll hear Cooke performing a number of his own that proved just as inspiring an anthem of its time. King, cinematographer Tami Reiker and designer Barry Robison mount a vivid, meticulous evocation of the period, with locales including poolsides, sports stadiums and the venues where Cooke sings. But the film is above all an enclosed talking piece for four terrific actors. Perhaps inevitably, Goree’s Clay lights up the screen whenever he talks – revealing the acuteness and sensitivity beneath the showmanship – with Hodge’s Brown as a saturnine, sceptical foil. But the meat of the meet lies in the interplay between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke – not least, perhaps, because we know their deaths were just around the corner. British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir is magnetic as the careworn, austere political leader, evoking the tenderness and well-concealed joie de vivre underneath the severity, while Odom’s Cooke shows self-examination as well as radiant insouciance. This is undeniably a very theatrical film, but it never hides that – indeed, it makes the most of a certain claustrophobia. It’s an immensely watchable evocation of a moment when black America was on the verge of an upheaval that continues to resonate, in 2020 as strongly as ever. It absolutely puts you – to coin a phrase of the time – in the room where it happened.",film
"Mathieu Kassovitz’s classic of banlieue rage has been rereleased after 25 years with a new urgency and relevance in the Black Lives Matter era. What comes across now isn’t the “hate” of the title, more the aimless, directionless comedy of three guys hanging around, bantering and squabbling about things such as which cartoon character is the most badass. It is touches like this which make you realise how very 90s it all is, similar to Tarantino and Trainspotting (with a nod to Taxi Driver’s “You talkin’ to me?” scene) but it also has a little something of the French New Wave, the world of Jacques Rivette’s Paris Belongs to Us, all of which influenced the later Americans. It’s a film about which I’ve had fluctuating views. Perhaps as a result of having watched it so much, I greeted the 10th-anniversary rerelease with some grumpy contrarianism. Now I think it simply looks superb. The age of Jacques Chirac’s presidency dawns uneasily (an official portrait is glimpsed in one scene) and in a tough inner-city estate outside Paris, the neighbourhood is waking up to the grim aftermath of a violent protest against police brutality, which has put a man in hospital in critical condition. His friend Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is simmering with rage, threatening to kill a cop with the police-issue gun he’s stolen, a gleaming snub-nose Smith & Wesson revolver; meanwhile, he is hanging around with his friends Hubert (Hubert Koundé) and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) with nothing much to do but wait for the next explosion of rage. There’s a gallery of well-known and (then) up-and-coming French actors in smaller roles: Vincent Lindon is a drunk bloke who turns up just as the trio is trying to steal a car; Philippe Nahon (who worked on Melville’s classic policiers and later became the totemic “Butcher” in Gaspar Noé’s movies) is the grizzled police chief who tries to break up a rooftop barbecue, Karin Viard is a Parisian art-lover – a rare female presence – and Kassovitz himself has a cameo as a neo-Nazi skinhead. The effervescent energy of this film keeps foaming away under everything; especially under its most amazing sequence: as one guy blasts out music from his decks at the high window of a tower block, Pierre Aïm’s camera ethereally floats out over the rooftops looking down, a moment that departs from the tense mood of the scenes either side of it and has surely influenced the drone camerawork of Ladj Ly’s new banlieue film Les Misérables. (But Kassovitz didn’t have drones in 1995. How did he get that shot?) Of all the figures in La Haine who stand out, the most startling is Vincent Cassel, making his breakthrough in his late 20s, a man on a hair-trigger with a face like an inverted triangle, sharp as a blade. The late critic Philip French described Cassel best, calling him “fiercely uningratiating”. It is Cassel who supplies the rocket-fuel of resentment; without him, Taghmaoui and Kounde might have been simply too laid-back, although again I’m not sure that Cassel is projecting “hate” as such. Our three musketeers are to come across some bizarre things on their travels, including a cameo from Tadek Lokcinski as an elderly Pole in a public toilet who emerges from a stall to tell them all about the importance of defecating regularly. There is also a very shrewd and disturbing scene in which two cops school a younger colleague in violent interrogation and the art of not going too far. The movie is bookended with the famous non-joke about the guy who falls off a skyscraper and, as he falls, people can hear him optimistically murmuring: “So far, so good … so far, so good…” A brutal landing is imminent, the movie implies, a horrible violent reckoning of racial injustice. For 25 years since La Haine came, it seems as if the fall has been continuing and the definitive landing has still not happened, or rather that we get the fall, the landing, then another fall. The violent descent has been contained and normalised. It’s more a case of “So far, so bad … so far, so bad…” La Haine is an unmissable response to an unending emergency.",film
"Max Richter is the genre-defying composer who works for movies, TV, theatre and the concert hall. This documentary by Natalie Johns is about what many consider his magnum opus: Sleep, from 2015 – an eight-and-a-half-hour composition with 204 movements in a plangent, ambient and mellow vein, featuring strings, synthesisers and a soprano, designed to be listened to while you are asleep. Richter has staged many spectacular overnight performances in venues where audiences are provided with camp-beds, and this film focuses on an open-air event in the Grand Park in Los Angeles. Audiences were invited to fall asleep, stay awake, tune in, tune out, and – presumably – traipse back and forth to the loos at 4am. This toweringly quixotic work is Richter’s rebuke to the frantic pace of our modern age (which is itself, arguably a form of anaesthesia), although he confesses that it cost him sleep: it was a supremely uncommercial project that had to be worked on at night, after a full day’s work on the movie music that paid the bills. It is a beguiling film, perhaps because Richter’s work is beguiling. However, it cheats a bit in showing the LA performance; the music we’re hearing appears to come from the studio, not live, something that hits you when you a notice a delivery truck with flashing lights glide in eerie silence behind the orchestra. So, is Sleep any better or different from the thousands of hours of chill-out music being provided by DJs all over the world? Well, it’s up to audiences to decide. I was reminded of a showing of Andy Warhol’s five-and-a-half-hour film Sleep, from 1964 – simply showing a man asleep – during which a member of the audience stormed up to the screen and shouted: “Wake up!”",film
"In November 1970, Dennis Hopper flew from Taos in New Mexico to dine with Orson Welles in LA. Hopper was in the midst of producing The Last Movie; Welles was busily prepping The Other Side of the Wind. Both these productions would later famously combust, but on that evening in late fall, their creators were feeling optimistic, all-powerful. Welles flattered Hopper and said that he should one day play Jesus. They broke bread together in what now looks very much like a film-makers’ last supper. Hopper/Welles is the periodically fascinating, generally exasperating record of that meeting, an unearthed black-and-white home movie in which the two men get drunk and speak their minds on everything from Buñuel to Visconti, John Wayne to the Fondas. The order of the title’s star billing is intentional and unavoidable, since Welles keeps a hand-held camera trained on Hopper throughout and is content to play the role of off-screen interrogator. Flushed from the success of Easy Rider, Hopper had briefly found himself hailed as the saviour of American cinema. This film catches the one moment in his life, perhaps, where he could dare to regard Welles as the junior partner. Playing out of competition at this year’s Venice film festival, the restored footage is an intriguing relic – an offcut, raw copy. There’s something pleasingly voyeuristic about the experience of being allowed behind the velvet rope to watch these blusterers hold forth, although I expect their charms may be limited to die-hard devotees. Others will find it too much of a good thing. Give these two enough velvet rope and they’ll hang themselves with it. Eyes darting, giggling nervously, Hopper angles to turn the conversation to sex. He explains that he only became a director because he “wanted to get some more pretty ladies” but admits that basically all he’s ever wanted is to sleep with his mum. Forced off this topic, he tells a jaw-dropping story about Elvis Presley, making his first film at the age of 21 and believing that everything in the movies was true, that all the punches were real; that all the guns fired bullets. Elvis said that he could handle the fight scenes just fine, but he was concerned because the script also called for him to hit a woman and he’d never actually done that before in his life. As for Welles, he’s opaque. The great man dislikes Antonioni, scorns leftwing activists and claims to have never heard of Bob Dylan. But is this Welles’s own ignorance, or is it an affectation, a pose? Hopper would eventually take a cameo in The Other Side of the Wind and the dinner is at least in part a dress rehearsal, with Welles dipping in and out of character as the film’s main protagonist, a director named Jake Hannaford. “You’re a hard man to talk to, Jake,” Hopper giggles at one point. One gets the distinct sense that the feeling is mutual. This loquacious, long-winded affair works best as a snapshot of two men in time: the callow young gun who’s just struck gold and the legendary old campaigner who remembers all too well how that felt. Welles (or perhaps Hannaford) is interested in Hopper and suspicious of him, too. He grills the man for hours and appears to find him wanting. And the longer it lasts, the more Hopper starts to squirm. He’s unprepared, inconsistent. He’s like a smart-aleck student sitting a university exam. “I’d love the chance to change the world, any way that I could,” he splutters. “Whether it’s movies or whatever.” “How can you say that?” Welles snaps back. “Now that’s a nice smarmy statement meaning nothing. It’s charming and it’s lovable but it makes no sense at all.” And so on they go, as the clock ticks towards midnight. Welles frustrated by Hopper; Hopper tormented by Welles. Wherever these two men are today, one hopes for their sakes that they are not there together.",film
"Sally Potter’s The Roads Not Taken is a sad, painful, self-conscious vignette of a film with forthright performances; it’s a chamber piece in many ways, but with bold flashback excursions that come close to causing its emotional engine to overheat. Javier Bardem plays Leo, a writer in New York who has suffered a stroke and now lives, by choice, in a grim single room, attended by a carer, Xenia (Branka Katic). The only person who still appears to love him is his daughter, Molly (Elle Fanning), who one chaotic day has to take him to the dentist and optician, while dealing (via her cellphone) with a stressful work situation. Meanwhile, Leo is plagued with memories of tragedy back in Mexico with his first love, Dolores (Salma Hayek), and also with a nervous breakdown he appears to have had in his later married life when Molly was a baby – perhaps the origin of his current state. He was spending time on a Greek island, theoretically working on a book, but really in retreat from his new American family, and he became entranced there by a beautiful young woman (Katia Mullova-Brind) – a dangerous, vivid epiphany that in his stricken state he cannot explain or express to Molly, however much he wants to and however desperate she is to understand him. This is a fervent performance from Bardem whose great, bull-like head, pulsing with contained spiritual pain, looms out of the screen. He is the paterfamilias, the sacred monster who exasperates and captivates his daughter and also his ex-wife – a peppery, unsympathetic cameo for Laura Linney. (Surely it can’t be long before Bardem plays Picasso?) The film seems sometimes to be reaching for ideas and moods that it cannot fully encompass, but I loved the rapport between Fanning and Bardem, especially when Leo mortifyingly has an accident at the dentist. Molly lends him her own trousers (she herself is wearing a long coat) and buys them both a matching pair of purple jeans from a discount store.",film
"“There’s a suicide born every minute,” quips cynical sports promoter Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy), as he watches figure eight racing drivers dropping – or rather, flipping – like flies. Indeed, the race, with its entropic intersection, seems like utter lunacy at first glance – a one-way ticket to crumpled steel and fatal injury. Yet there’s something uniquely seductive, even irresistible, about the spectacle: the mesmerising rhythm of crashes and crossovers; the music of purring engines and screeching tyres; the way the dust from the track, intermingled with wispy exhaust fumes, catches the glow of the floodlights; and of course, the aggressively masculine bravado of the winner. That last element in particular is what sucks illegal drag racer Rick Bowman (Richard Davalos) into the community, in Jack Hill’s sinewy and stylish 1969 B-movie, Pit Stop. Initially repulsed by the sight of so much destruction, Bowman eventually agrees to race for Willard after witnessing the maniacal showmanship of Hawk Sidney (a magnetically unhinged Sid Haig), the dominant force in the sport. The maddening grin, the provocative inflections in his voice, the girl on his arm, the air of invincibility – everything about Sidney sparks a competitive combustion that burns away Bowman’s uncertainties. Merciless ambition takes hold of the newcomer – the raging desire to beat Sidney on the track and take everything away from him, to crush the man and his myth, and usurp him as the very best. Jack Hill, like so many B-movie masters, began his career as an acolyte of the legendary Roger Corman, working in various capacities on the 1963 film The Terror. From there, his filmography is splattered with violent invention, from the demented horror comedy Spider Baby, to the swaggering Blaxploitation classic Coffy. Like a sleazy alchemist, Hill transmutes shoestring budgets into cinematic gold, melting down and reshaping scrap metal into distinctive, often beautiful art. Pit Stop, originally titled The Winner, might just be Hill’s best work, a blistering study of the ruthless, soul-shredding pursuit of excellence in the dark art of vehicular carnage. The film is astonishingly immersive, not just in its virtuosic, supercharged racing set pieces (miracles of documentary-style photography, dynamic editing and rear projection), but also in its vivid depiction of the specific subculture that crystallises around these pugnacious petrolheads. Hill’s camera, awash with Austin McKinney’s gorgeous, authentically atmospheric black and white cinematography, affectionately navigates the spaces in which the competitors work and unwind – from the greasy garages in which they tinker with their machines, to the smoky bars in which they drink and dance with their fawning fans. It’s a vibrant ecosystem on the margins of society, teeming with working-class craftsmen and daredevils. And it’s an ecosystem in which Bowman – a cool, solitary hunter – is primed to thrive. A disaffected, thoroughly unsentimental loner who begins the film behind bars, Bowman falls hard and fast for his new vocation, which offers him an ideal balance between adrenaline and tranquillity. There’s the perilous self-expression of the race itself, him against the world, an extreme test of focus and a volcanic outlet for his nastiest impulses. And then there are the interstitial moments, set to the bluesy bass and fuzzy guitars of the psychedelic band the Daily Flash, during which he meditates through the processes of scavenging for parts and suturing his crippled vehicle back together. Routine becomes ritual, and ritual becomes obsession. Bowman tumbles unceremoniously out of his first few races. No matter – return to the garage, rebuild, refine and race again with a vengeance. Davalos is probably best remembered for his debut role in East of Eden alongside James Dean, but he was never better than he is here in Pit Stop. There’s an ominous sort of understatement, even minimalism, to his performance as Bowman – a constant sense of danger bubbling beneath the rigid crust. He infuses the driver with icy discipline, refusing to give anything away beyond a raised eyebrow, smothering emotions in their infancy. It’s a brilliantly controlled display of menace – a descent into remorseless inhumanity always seems only a rev of the engine away. The cost of Bowman’s meteoric rise, of course, is everything – friendship, love, libido and human life, are all wrecked and left to burn in a heap while he races on. Teammates are left to spin out, women are seduced and then spurned, until in the end all Bowman has left is his relationship with Willard, the devil in a suit on his shoulder, constantly whispering in his ear about bigger and better races that need to be conquered. The film’s most haunting image, strangely enough, is of the broken Hawk Sidney – once preternaturally expressive, now appalled beyond words as his ghastly rival walks away into a soulless future. Much more than just a micro-budget car film, Pit Stop is a devastating portrait of the empty shell that’s left behind when every last remnant of human connection is immolated at the altar of winning.",film
"Ostensibly an alternative biography of Laika, the stray mongrel who became the first cosmonaut, this film faithfully tracks her from her time on the streets of Moscow to her lonely demise in low Earth orbit. Incredible archive footage shows us Laika and a number of other dogs being subjected to a relentless barrage of exercises designed to mimic the incredible stress of space travel; it’s hard not to be affected by the footage knowing, as we do, that Laika is being led to an excruciating end. Space Dogs documents a cruel period in human history but the bleak tone the film-makers pursue throughout may not be the best way of dealing with it. It is designed, perhaps, to numb you to the horror of what you are witnessing but the unspeakable acts are presented without comment or context. There’s a secondary narrative here, with Laika’s story interwoven with the tale of a pair of strays navigating the barren streets of modern Moscow. Their story, presumably, is intended to mirror Laika’s intrepid journey, but the unremarkable footage acts as a drag on the film’s momentum. Narration is sparingly employed throughout, which is a shame given the quality of the writing; this is one of those films that could actually do with more exposition and insight. We see, for example, the post-mission project designed to memorialise Laika as a symbol of Soviet ingenuity – but we don’t hear from the men responsible for this state-sponsored torture. A defence of their actions would have given this otherwise beautiful-looking film a third dimension it’s lacking. Laika’s dead body is wonderfully described as a “cosmic flotsam” over the opening credits. It’s hard to shake the feeling that a genuinely arresting documentary was cast adrift somewhere along the line.",film
"The British actor John Boyega has criticised the treatment of characters of colour in the latest Star Wars films, saying they were marketed as important elements in the franchise but were ultimately “pushed to the side”. In an interview published by GQ magazine on Wednesday, Boyega expressed bitterness over how his role as stormtrooper Finn faded in the latter episodes of the trilogy which concluded with The Rise of Skywalker in 2019. “What I would say to Disney is do not bring out a black character, market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are, and then have them pushed to the side. It’s not good. I’ll say it straight up,” he told the magazine. He said fellow actors Naomi Ackie, Kelly Marie Tran and Oscar Isaac had suffered similar fates, while Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley had taken prominence in the lead roles as Kylo Ren and Rey. Boyega told GQ some people would accuse him of “making it up”, but the character hierarchy in The Last Jedi was hard to take. “They gave all the nuance to Adam Driver, all the nuance to Daisy Ridley. Let’s be honest. Daisy knows this. Adam knows this. Everybody knows. I’m not exposing anything,” Boyega said. He said Star Wars didn’t know what to do with characters of colour. “So what do you want me to say? What they want you to say is, ‘I enjoyed being a part of it. It was a great experience...’ Nah, nah, nah. I’ll take that deal when it’s a great experience.” Boyega became a viral sensation in June when he gave an emotion-packed speech at an anti-racism demonstration in London following the death of George Floyd at the hands of American police in Minneapolis. “I’m the only cast member who had their own unique experience of that franchise based on their race,” Boyega said of Star Wars. “Let’s just leave it like that. “It makes you angry with a process like that. It makes you much more militant; it changes you.” In his speech at the Black Lives Matter rally in London, he said: “Black lives have always mattered. We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless. And now is the time. I ain’t waiting.” In a social media post afterwards Boyega added: “I know you’re all thinking, what’s next? Where do we go from here? Because I’m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",film
"As a child in the 1970s, writer-director Claudio Noce stood in the wings while a leftwing terrorist group – the Armed Proletarian Cells – targeted his father, Rome’s deputy chief of police. The trauma, he says, harried him all his life before finally finding a catharsis of sorts with the making of Padrenostro, which competes for the top prize here in Venice. This, Noce’s third feature, marks his moment of unburdening. Unsurprisingly, then, it’s a personal picture, agonised and self-questioning, almost to a fault. Noce’s alter-ego is Valerio (Mattia Garaci), an angelic-looking 10-year-old with a low-grade heart murmur and a penchant for solitary walks and wild flights of fancy. But his immediate surroundings feel horribly real. Wounded in an assassination attempt, his father Alfonso (Pierfrancesco Favino) now carries a handgun in his bag and flinches every time the front doorbell rings. Valerio isn’t sure what has happened or why, which naturally means that we’re in the dark, too. For most of its run, Padrenostro elects to view the harsh adult world from a child’s perspective. It’s like What Maisie Knew crossed with a supergrass gangster film. One day, kicking a ball in the street, Valerio meets a local tearaway, Christian (Francesco Gheghi), and the two become friends. Christian might be described as a fairytale creature, akin to a talking fox or a forest elf. He’s a teacher, a trickster; fun company but not entirely to be trusted. He is also, of course, Noce’s own invention, an aid to self-therapy. In real life the director was Valerio – but there was no kid called Christian. Should this be a problem? Ordinarily not. And yet, crucially, Noce himself seems in two minds as to how to properly fold the character of Christian in with his wider tale. Or rather, he tries to have it both ways, playing bait-and-switch with the audience to the point where one is tempted to throw up one’s hands. The kid has a habit of vanishing like a conjurer’s apprentice whenever an adult shows up, which leads us to believe that Christian’s an imaginary friend or a ghost. But then, wait, now some adults have started seeing him, which either means that he’s real, or that they’re all ghosts just like him. What can’t be faulted is Noce’s sheer boldness and ambition. If Padrenostro winds up as a bit of a mess, it’s a beautiful mess, a glorious mess: gliding from the palm-sweatingly tense scenes inside the family apartment to the sun-splashed coast of Calabria which again may be real, or some golden vision of the afterlife. Watching the film feels like taking a deep dive through the director’s subconscious, stumbling upon locked and barnacled chests perhaps even he has yet to prise open. In one early scene, just after the assassination attempt, young Valerio is handed a Super 8 camera by Alfonso’s best friend. “You want to shoot?” says the friend. “Look, it’s really easy.” And so the kid hoists the thing like a handgun and shoots his mum and his dad and his little sister by the window. Four decades later, he’ll turn the camera around and use it on himself.",film
"All rise for The Duke, a scrappy underdog yarn that makes a powerful case for the rackety English amateur, the common man who survives by his wits with the odds stacked against him. Kempton Bunton of Byker, for instance, is about as far removed from the Duke of Wellington as a frog is from a prince. But now the Duke is trapped behind the wardrobe in Kempton’s tatty back bedroom, which is one in the eye for the British class system and means that Kempton is sitting pretty, at least for a while. Roger Michell’s delightful true-crime caper comes bolstered by a terrific lead performance from Jim Broadbent, rattling about the red-brick terraces of early 1960s Newcastle. His Kempton Bunton is a wannabe playwright and soapbox revolutionary, a man who prefers Chekhov to Shakespeare because he feels that the Bard wrote too many plays about kings. By night he’s sitting up in bed reading books by George Orwell. By day he’s tilting at windmills, squabbling with shop-floor managers and getting under the feet of his pinched, knackered wife. As played by Helen Mirren, Dorothy Bunton is constantly cleaning up the mess left by her husband and her two adult sons. She says: “Be sure to use the coasters. You’re not in Leeds now.” The city of Leeds may be bad in its way, but the real problem is London; it’s taken leave of its senses. Down at the National Gallery, they’ve just spent £140,000 of public money to secure Francisco Goya’s portrait of Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. “An outstanding example of late-period Goya,” sighs the curator. “Some half-baked portrait by a Spanish drunk,” says Kempton. He argues that the cash would have been better spent providing free TV licences for all the UK’s old age pensioners. Kempton, perhaps relatedly, has recently served a brief prison term for not paying his own TV licence. Michell and Broadbent previously worked together on 2013’s excellent Le Week-End, in which the actor played a middle-aged professor in meltdown, drunkenly singing along to Bob Dylan inside a poky Paris hotel. The Duke (scripted by Richard Bean and the BBC’s Clive Coleman) is a more obviously crowd-pleasing affair, precision-tooled but big-hearted. Michell does well in capturing a 60s north-east of belching chimney-stacks and rag-and-bone men; a limbo-land Britain, caught between the end of rationing and the birth of the Beatles. Kempton, one suspects, has both boots in the old world - but he can still dream of tomorrow. What a lovely, rousing, finally moving film this is. The Duke is unashamedly sentimental and resolutely old-fashioned in the best sense of the term: a design classic built along the same lines as That Sinking Feeling, A Private Function or 50s Ealing comedies. In an earlier era, the role of Kempton would have been played by Denholm Elliott or Alastair Sim. Hauled into court to account for the theft, Kempton is finally given the stage he’s been craving all his life. The man is an upstart, a liar, undeniably a crook. But he’s also an idealist, a committed socialist, and it is this side of Kempton that now comes to the fore. He teases the judge, jokes with the jury and explains that he puts his faith “not in God, but in people”. Meanwhile, up in the public gallery, sit his own band of people. The posh young woman who employs his wife as a cleaner. The exploited co-worker whom he once tried to defend. Individually, in Kempton’s view, these people are all just single bricks. But put them together and you make a house. Put them together and you build Jerusalem. ",film
"The directors of seven European film festivals shared the stage at the opening of the 77th Venice film festival to help kick-start an industry that they said was in danger of being usurped by streaming sites such as Netflix because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Venice head Alberto Barbera said film festivals might have a “reduced role” after the pandemic, which caused every major festival to cancel or offer a hybrid of online and physical screenings. Barbera said: “The feeling of watching a film on the large screen with other people is in the very nature of the film industry. We have to support cinemas. Many are still closed today, others will never open again.” The director added that the fight to reopen cinemas and get film festivals back in a physical form was a “battle for civilisation and for culture”. His statements were supported by a letter signed by the directors of seven other film festivals, including Thierry Frémaux of Cannes, and José Luis Rebordinos (San Sebastián) and Tricia Tuttle (London), who will both host physical festivals later this year. Barbera said that the Covid-19 pandemic had given streaming sites the upper hand in the battle for viewers, and that Netflix’s increasing subscriber numbers coupled with the permanent closure of cinemas could be fatal unless the industry showed solidarity. Frémaux, who was appearing on the stage of an event that has been Cannes’ biggest rival in recent years, added that festivals were able to give the industry a “positive thrust”, and that cinema at large needed that support now. He also warned of the ascendancy of what he called “TV platforms” during the coronavirus outbreak and said that streamers and physical cinemas and festivals needed to find a way to co-exist. He pointed to Marvel’s Avengers series as an example of films that worked both as a box-office hit and as a popular streaming option when Disney+ launched last year. Barbera was in defiant mood at the start of the festival, which is his last in charge and is taking place as Covid infections are rising again in Europe. He has defended his decision to host the event even though every other major festival has either cancelled or is hosting virtual screenings this year. As the festival opened, there were queues at nine thermo-scanners placed at entrances to the festival site on the Lido, and anyone with a temperature above 37.5°C was being denied entry. Face masks are mandatory at this year’s event, and other safety measures include socially distanced screenings and a tracking system for attendees. On Wednesday evening, Barbera, along with other festival directors including Carlo Chatrian (Berlin), will officially open the festival with a statement that bills the event as a show of solidarity with the film industry. The directors will insist that festivals are “not mere promotional showcases”, but are increasingly becoming “centres of culture”, and “opportunities for the cultural enlightenment of audiences and for education to beauty and to the richness of the film experience for young people”. Along with the release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, which was the first major film to screen since lockdown measures closed cinemas around the world, the Venice event has now become a touchstone for an industry desperate to recovery. The event, which during Barbera’s tenure has become a rival to Cannes as Europe’s most significant film festival, has fewer stars than usual with Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Matt Dillon and Ludivine Sagnier among international talent expected to attend. This year’s event has a strong UK contingent as Hollywood names – for the most part – stay away, and Venice looks closer to home for film-makers, jury members and actors. Tilda Swinton is being given a lifetime achievement award and stars in Pedro Almodóvar’s 30-minute film The Human Voice, while The Souvenir director, Joanna Hogg, is part of the Golden Lion jury. Documentarian Luke Holland has a posthumous screening of Final Account, his film about the rise of the Third Reich, while The Crown star Vanessa Kirby has two films at the festival – Kornél Mundruczó’s Pieces of a Woman and Mona Fastvold’s The World to Come. British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir plays Malcolm X in Regina King’s directorial debut One Night in Miami, an adaptation of Kemp Powers’s play which was at the Donmar Warehouse in 2016, and is a fictionalised account of the night Cassius Clay (then about to change his name to Muhammad Ali) beat Sonny Liston while surrounded by friends including Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown. The Venice film festival opens on Wednesday and continues until 12 September.",film
"There is a wonderful exchange in Christopher Nolan’s latest film, Tenet, between Robert Pattinson and John David Washington. “Hngmmhmmh,” says Pattinson. “Mmghh nmmhhmmmm nghhh,” replies Washington. Marvellous.  This is how much of Tenet sounded to viewers in cinemas. The film’s dialogue has been criticised by reviewers and audience members for often being impossible to make out. Given how hard Nolan’s blockbuster would be to understand even if all the dialogue was crystal-clear, it is curious that the director has made it doubly difficult to hear the story of a screenplay he supposedly spent five years writing. But it isn’t just Nolan’s films. It’s a much-repeated claim that movie dialogue is becoming harder and harder to hear. What is going on? Mathew Price is a production sound mixer who has worked on The Sopranos and The Marvellous Mrs Maisel. “When they take the sound we record on set and kind of undermix it, it feels like, ‘What did we try so hard for?’” he says. Price believes the problem is partly that modern directors have so many more tracks to play with, causing “track overload”, the result being that “the dialogue gets short shrift a lot of the time”. When he watches films or TV shows at home, he turns on the subtitles in case of clarity issues – he is far from the only one – and will limit the TV’s dynamic range.(In cinemas the dynamic range – the range between the loudest and quietest sounds – is wider than on home TV screens, and, although the sound is compressed in the transition to TV, the range can still be so wide that you are forced to turn up the volume for dialogue, then down again for action.) Is it actually a modern phenomenon? Sound engineer Ron Bochar, who was nominated for an Oscar for his mixing on Moneyball, thinks so. “Think about it: the first few Star Wars [films], we heard them all. We heard all the lines. Listen to Apocalypse Now – you hear everything.” Price agrees: “If you watch old movies, you might hear some sound effects here and there but now they go nuts: somebody’s walking across the room in a leather jacket, you hear the zippers clink and the creak of the leather and every footstep is right in your face.” When television became commonplace in the mid-20th century and challenged cinema’s dominion, cinema needed to distinguish itself; it needed to prove that it could justify people leaving the comfort of their homes. It did so partly by becoming bigger and louder. In an era – and a pandemic – in which home streaming dominates, cinema may be forced to pull out the stops once more. “I think we’re bombarded,” Paul Markey, a projectionist at the Irish Film Institute, says of modern films. “The more expensive movies have got, the more of a bombardment they become on your senses.” For Bochar, the priority is dialogue. Working with other editors, his job is to layer a film with multiple levels of sound. As he adds layers he has to make sure he can still hear the words. “The first thing I do is create a solid dialogue track, and then everything else has to come up to it and not exceed it,” he says. “Somebody wrote the words and actors are saying those lines, so there’s got to be some priority.” He doesn’t know any re-recording artist who would deliberately obscure a story point. Sound effects and music tracks exist on faders that can slide up and down. This means that even “a crazy, batshit scene” with numerous layers of sound is easy for a mixer to control. “It really isn’t a mystery. We know how to do it.” This means that Nolan’s use of noisier Imax cameras in Tenet would not explain the problem, as some have suggested. To complicate matters, there is a disparity between the environment in which the director hears the final mix of a film and the one in which it is screened. Markey says Warren Beatty watched a screening of Bonnie and Clyde when it came out and couldn’t understand why the sound of the bullets was so quiet. The projectionist was turning the volume down. Beatty realised that projectionists, not directors, have final say on a film. Markey says that they could, for example, raise the volume of the dialogue specifically, but they never do – it would mean having to readjust it for every film. As with most problems, every department assumes that another department is to blame. Although many viewers claim that films are getting louder, Bochar says that the opposite is the problem: “All of us in the industry will tell you point-blank that generally every single cinema is playing it lower than it should be.” A studio’s reference level tends to be around 85 decibels, or 7 on the Dolby scale, he says. But cinemas will often play the film at 4 (around 75 decibels). The Irish Film Institute has been playing Tenet at 4, Markey says, because 6 was “ridiculously loud” when tested. Cinemas will not necessarily play a film at the recommended level of 7 if they feel it is too loud. In Nolan’s case, Price and Bochar are confident that the director does it intentionally. In a 2019 Reddit AMA, sound designer Richard King – who has worked with Nolan on seven films, including Tenet – said: “He wants to grab the audience by the lapels and pull them toward the screen, and not allow the watching of his films to be a passive experience.” It’s hard to imagine that Nolan is unaware of the criticism. Price suspects the director wants to make the audience work harder to understand the dialogue; he thinks Nolan believes this will make the film a more immersive, engaging experience. But, Price says, “I think he is the only one in the world who believes that.”",film
"The ghosts of Victor Hugo’s downtrodden 19th-century rebels haunt Ladj Ly’s César-winning contemporary urban drama, a streetwise tale of France’s dispossessed masses, brought once again to the brink of rebellion. Nominated for best international feature at the 92nd Oscars (it lost out to Parasite), it presents a powder-keg portrait of broiling tensions, recalling both the pressure-cooker structure of Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing and even-handed vérité grit of David Simon’s monumental TV series The Wire. Taking care never to paint its complex characters in simple black-and-white strokes, this slips stealthily from astute observation to urgent action, reminding us of Hugo’s maxim that “there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.” We open in a moment of ironic harmony, as tricolour-clad revellers celebrate France’s 2018 World Cup victory, with the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe glittering in the background. But that harmony soon dissipates as our young antiheroes return to Montfermeil, the Paris district immortalised in Hugo’s 1862 novel. “It hasn’t changed much,” observes Stéphane Ruiz (Damien Bonnard), a street-crime cop newly transferred from Cherbourg. His colleagues, dubbed “the two biggest clowns” by the night patrol, are Gwada (Djebril Zonga) and Chris (Alexis Manenti, the film’s co-writer), who describes himself as “100% swine” and who “goes overboard sometimes” in policing “the brutality of the world”. Out on patrol, Stéphane learns of the warring factions who vie for control of these streets; from “the Mayor” (“our very own Obama”) to the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood (“a thug who grew a beard”), all equally reviled by Chris who behaves like a tin-pot bad lieutenant, harassing teenage girls and bullying young boys. The arrival of a travelling circus (“Gypsies, never a good sign”) and the theft of a lion cub bring an air of carnivalesque chaos, with little Issa (the remarkable Issa Perica) being thrown into the lion’s den – literally. Meanwhile, a drone camera piloted by a young peeping tom (played by the director’s son Al-Hassan Ly) offers a god’s eye view of unfolding events, capturing an act of shocking violence that threatens the precarious stability of the neighbourhood. As Salah (Almamy Kanouté) ominously warns: “You won’t avoid their rage.” Building on his César-nominated 2017 short film, Ly’s feature debut (which follows several acclaimed web documentaries) paints an admirably uncliched portrait of banlieue life, as vibrant and diverse as that of Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood. In stark contrast to the monochrome hues of Mathieu Kassovitz’s still-influential 1995 masterpiece La Haine, Les Misérables is shot in vivid colour by cinematographer Julien Poupard, whose cameras snake in and out of the action, with long takes (elegantly edited by Flora Volpelière) immersing us in this tangibly real world. There’s little sense of artifice, as young stars such as Issa Perica lend gripping veracity to scenes that might otherwise have seemed contrived or overwrought. I struggle to recall a more arresting image than that of Issa, bruised and bloodied, bursting into tears in the midst of a harrowing ordeal, only to rise again like a silent wraith in the third act, which plays like an inverted social-realist revisiting of Gareth Evans’s 2011 Indonesian action movie The Raid. A pulsing electro score by French music project Pink Noise adds sparse yet atmospheric accompaniment, with simple looping riffs building tension in key scenes, while more elegiac cues emphasise the strange melancholic beauty of the drama. It’s that sense of beauty – of the possibility of redemption – that prevents Les Misérables from being crushed by the grim weight of the world it depicts. It’s a world in which Ly grew up, and his love of these neighbourhoods, in all their hardscrabble glory, is tangible.",film
"Few directors this century have suffered a more precipitous decline in their critical reputation than Michel Hazanavicius. It was less than a decade ago that – hot off his terrific OSS spy spoofs, and newly flush with Weinstein Company support – Hazanavicius carried The Artist to Oscar glory. However, both his immediate follow-up The Search and Godard biopic Redoubtable were met with near-universal shrugs. The Lost Prince, a family-targeted fantasy sees the film-maker returning to the basics, possibly drawing on his personal experience as a father and bedtime storyteller: it’s very sweet, and quietly corrective not just in centralising a black father-daughter pairing, but plugging them into the kind of storybook universe western movies once deemed off limits to performers of colour. The plot turns on a feeling of being excluded. In a ramshackle tower block on the outskirts of Paris, we find mechanic Djibi (Omar Sy) bringing up Sofia (Sarah Gaye), a 12-year-old readying for her first weeks of big school. As she makes that transition – pulling away from her papa, in the direction of classmate Max (Néotis Ronzon) – Hazanavicius switches between reality and the kingdom Djibi conjures up before lights-out. This is a sprawling, American-style studio lot, presided over by Sy in tight, bright leggings as “The Prince”, a strutting, Fairbanks-like star of the nightly show, who finds himself locked out of his dressing room once Sofia declares that she’s too old for happily-ever-afters. One could easily imagine a director swamping this story’s human aspects with charmless CGI, but Hazanavicius staffs his fantasyland with character actors and grounds the action in the ups-and-downs of Djibi’s cramped flat. Sy provides an affectionate portrayal of a big goofball who might well embarrass his offspring, while Gaye displays an unusual maturity and directness for a juvenile lead. The sense of a family affair is bolstered by the presence of Hazanavicius’ wife Bérénice Bejo as a helpful neighbour. The film is a little well-behaved – success has apparently deprived Hazanavicius of the mischief that made the OSS films such a riot – but there’s imagination, heart and empathy here. Don’t close the book on this director yet.",film
"Who shall save cinema? Not James Bond apparently. There’s been a brand-new Daniel Craig spectacular ready to go since Easter, arguably just the thing to get punters’ actual bums back on actual seats. But Team 007 is wimping out, unwilling to splurge their product irreversibly into some potential new ruinous lockdown – and Disney has suffered a comparable bottle-loss, dumping its live-action version of the Mulan legend on to streaming services. So it’s up to the mighty Christopher Nolan to take the heroic, morale-boosting gamble and open his big new film in cinemas. Tenet is a gigantically confusing, gigantically entertaining and gigantically gigantic metaphysical action thriller in which a protagonist called The Protagonist battles cosmic incursions from the future while time flows backwards and forwards at the same time. There’s a 747 plane that crashes into a warehouse and then uncrashes back out of it, for reasons that are not immediately obvious. The palindromic narrative concept is epitomised by that coolly hi-tech, high-concept title (maybe Nolan briefly considered something similarly resonant like Radar or Noon). With its international locations and stunt set pieces along with all the temporal weirdness, it’s actually quite like a Bond film called No Time To Die To Time No. Of course it’s madly preposterous, and I sympathise with anyone who thinks that abolishing the cause-effect sequence to mess with “time” effectively cancels jeopardy and annuls suspense and moreover runs up against the illogic of what happens when the altered past meets the join of the unaltered present – what this film identifies as the “grandfather paradox”, though without solving the problem. And to some degree, all the film’s explosions (and implosions) are there to divert your attention from this basic insolubility. But for me, Tenet is preposterous in the tradition of Boorman’s Point Blank, or even Antonioni’s Zabriskie Point, a deadpan jeu d’esprit, a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility – but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination. As head-scratchers go, it’s a scalp-shredder, a skull-mangler. But it’s gloriously ambitious and I staggered out of the cinema, plucking off my face mask dizzy with Nolan-vertigo. (People wear face masks in the film also.) It’s also got moments of deadpan wit, surreality and style and Robert Pattinson may have singlehandedly made the double-breasted suit acceptable once more in men’s tailoring. Pattinson plays Neil, a dapper, and slightly louche British intelligence officer in Mumbai who makes contact with The Protagonist, played by a toughly unemoting John David Washington. The Protag, as no one calls him, is ordered by a shadowy American government agency to tackle a new cold war situation: an attack from the future from forces capable of reversing time. Washington is shown guns that suck bullets from the wall when you pull the trigger, an innovation he greets with a kind of mildly disapproving surprise, as if he is watching a TV news item about driverless Ubers. Who is going to make use of this terrifying technology and how is it to be countered? This leads our unnamed hero into contact with a mega-rich Indian contractor (elegantly played by Dimple Kapadia) and a creepy Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) and his tragically poised and willowy wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). It is Debicki who has the most recognisable human emotions here, shouting, crying and even smiling in a way that no one else quite does, and her performance is very strong, though my tiny quarrel with Tenet is that it pinches ideas wholesale from the BBC adaptation of The Night Manager, and Debicki herself is called upon to play essentially the same role. As for Washington and Pattinson, they have to tamp down their natural warmth, though there are hints of what might even be called a bromance. But that is not the point: they are not ciphers exactly, but they are agents. The point is the phenomenal, dreamlike display itself, a vision of the end of the world. Maybe Nolan wants to meditate on the great palindrome of mortality: from dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return. Perhaps Tenet is not finally as challenging as his other temporal disruptor, the early masterpiece Memento from 2000, but there are such amazing moments in it – symmetrically recurring fist-fight scenes, revisited from different viewpoints, in which the combatants are apparently governed by different time-flows: one forward, one backward. It shouldn’t make sense. It doesn’t make sense. What it makes is amazing cinema. Wow.",film
"On the opening day of the Venice film festival, the arrivals are struggling to get their bearings. Things don’t work the way they did in the past. There’s a booking system to contend with and a mask policy to observe. We don’t know the names of many directors on the programme. We can’t recognise our friends and colleagues behind their myriad face coverings. It’s the 77th edition but it almost feels like the first. The new normal is weird; it’s going to take some getting used to. If the Venice selectors were looking for a fitting film to open this year’s Orizzonti sidebar, they could hardly have done better than Christos Nikou’s splendidly poignant and creepy Apples. As luck or fate would have it, this is a pandemic drama of sorts, spotlighting an outbreak of amnesia that afflicts the people of Greece. With a neat stylistic flourish, Nikou sets his tale in an ahistoric, analogue Athens, modern on the surface yet seemingly in thrall to cassette decks and instant cameras. At a time when memories are wiped and histories erased, physical media perhaps provide a crucial link with the past. The latest patient to be admitted to the “Disturbed Memory Department” is Aris (Aris Servetalis), aka Number 14842: a gaunt, bearded man who looks like Daniel Day-Lewis playing the role of Vincent Van Gogh. Aris is initially told to sit tight and wait for his family to claim him. But as the days tick by, the suspicion grows that his family has forgotten him just as completely as he’s forgotten them. Slowly, steadily, the city appears to be losing its connective tissue. Cases are increasing; the people are being rubbed clean. Nikou previously worked as an assistant director on Yorgos Lanthimos’s Dogtooth and he clearly came away infected. Apples, his debut feature, has the same deadpan sensibility and a similar line in mordant black comedy. Its action, moreover, unfolds across a series of unglamorous non-spaces (abandoned swimming baths; forlorn city parks) that might have already cropped up in Lanthimos’s 2011 film Alps. At one stage Aris rides a bus to the end of the line, right into the hinterlands, because he can’t remember his home address. I’ll admit to having a low resistance to – or perhaps a high tolerance for – the so-called Greek Weird Wave, with its reams of affectless dialogue, its unexplained absurdities and its depiction of a planet a shuffle-step removed from our own. But what prevents Apples from becoming a simple Lanthimos copycat is its comparative kindness and its abiding direction of travel. At the neurological hospital, the patients are eventually coaxed on to the “New Identity” programme, installed in fresh homes and encouraged to construct a kind of flat-pack personal history. Where a lesser director might have been tempted to point his tale towards darkness, Nikou – to his credit – adopts a more tender approach. Paired up with Anna (Sofia Georgovassili), a fellow amnesiac, Aris duly embarks on a stumbling route through an accelerated second childhood. This in turn is followed by a whistle-stop adolescence. If Nikou never quite liberates them from the shackles of the movie’s high-concept premise, he at least makes them care about these people and the new lives that they’re building. Apples aid memory. Music throws a lifeline. Towards the end of the film, Aris and Anna set forth on a jaunt out of town. They’re side-by-side and briefly happy – fumbling for the words of a song they can almost recall, at the wheel of a car that might even be theirs. ",film
"Troy Williams had his guard up when Katherin Hervey visited San Quentin state prison, where he was serving a life sentence for kidnapping and robbery. The director was there to record inmates for what would become the restorative justice documentary The Prison Within. Williams was the resident film-maker in San Quentin. He’s also the founder of the San Quentin Prison Report, a media company that produces radio and video from inside, giving inmates a voice and building a dialogue from within those walls. Until he was paroled in 2014, Williams kept an eye out for news and other media organizations entering the prison walls. He told the Guardian how he was wary that media would resort to fearmongering tactics, showing prisoners for what they were instead of who they are, stripping away their humanity and feeding into public a desire for carceral punishment, which favours longer sentences as a deterrent from crime. But Hervey, a former public defender, made Williams feel immediately comfortable. She was there to record a session with the Victim Offender Education Group (VOEG), a restorative justice program developed by the Insight Prison Project. In the film, men convicted of murder gather for unguarded therapeutic discussions. They accept responsibility for their crimes, weigh the hurt that they caused and identify the traumas in their own lives that contribute to their fateful decisions. Heartbreaking stories about abuse, poverty, survival and the loss of loved ones come to the fore. In an astonishing feat of empathy, the VOEG program pairs an offender with a “surrogate victim”, who is a person hurt by a similar crime, whether it be rape, robbery or murder. In tearful conversations, the offender and victim share their experiences and find common ground. In that way, restorative justice serves victims as well as the offenders, helping both heal from trauma to better reintegrate into society. Emotionally, victims are in a prison too. Williams, who is both a talking head and a credited cinematographer on The Prison Within, was a participant in the VOEG program. He later became a facilitator for a number of years. He currently lives in Oakland and, like Sam Johnson and Michael Nelson, other participants from the documentary, became a community leader advocating for restorative justice. Williams owns a company called Restorative Media and has given a Ted Talk on reintegrating back into society. He said he believed in restorative justice before he even knew what it meant. “It gave me a vocabulary for what my heart already knew,” he explained, describing the restorative process as gaining a mastery over emotions. He added that restorative justice has been in practice for centuries within indigenous and African communities, where an offender is held accountable to a village or a tribe. “It’s not like something happens, you just throw this person away,” he said. “You would find a way to reconcile with them.” Hervey and producer Erin Kenway, another former lawyer who practiced in high conflict domestic violence cases, said the intimate stories in their documentary anchors a conversation that stretches beyond San Quentin’s walls and the runtime of a single documentary. “Mass incarceration is this funnel of everything that is wrong,” Hervey told the Guardian, citing race, class and systemic oppression as widespread societal issues that contribute to marginalized people being over-represented in prisons. Kenway told the Guardian that lack of education, health resources and childcare are other contributing factors they didn’t cover in their documentary that also lead to mass incarceration; all are worthy subjects for another film. The Prison Within gestures towards the bigger picture while homing in on intimate accounts. Experts like Sujatha Baliga from the Restorative Justice Project explain how the current prison system in the US is criminogenic. Instead of healing, carceral punishment revictimizes, hurting inmates and their families; continuing a destructive cycle that begins with intergenerational trauma from slavery and colonization. The Prison Within can only touch on how the prison industrial complex operates like a new form of slavery, the argument laid out in Ava DuVernay’s documentary The 13th. The militarization of police is also outside the film’s scope, along with the trauma law enforcement inflicts on marginalized communities. But The Prison Within stays relevant to the current conversation on defunding the police, which has grown louder since the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the US. “We don’t need the overpolicing of communities that may have drug issues,” said Williams. “That’s a public health issue.” Like restorative justice, defunding the police is about healing and breaking the cycle that leads to mass incarceration. Protesters in the US call for divesting funds from a heavily militarized police force that could instead be used for education, mental health and other community supports. But opponents make defunding the police and steering away from carceral punishment sound like stretches of the imagination. Hervey admitted that, like systemic oppression, these systems are so deeply entrenched. Fixing them requires a complete mental and emotional overhaul. “We lock away what we don’t want to confront,” says the actor Hill Harper in his narration for The Prison Within, describing a system that is easier in the short term, but destructive in the long haul. Dionne Wilson is a beacon of hope in The Prison Within. She’s a former rightwing gun store employee whose police officer husband was shot and killed, leaving behind two children. Wilson, whose last name at the time was Niemi, rallied for the death penalty against the offender, Irving Ramirez. She has since been fighting to spare Ramirez’s life and abolish the death penalty. The Prison Within followed Wilson’s unexpected and inspiring transformation. She went from seeking retribution to finding empathy for her late husband’s killer. But while examples like Wilson are proof that humans who try hard enough can embrace the value of restorative justice, there are other examples that show the limits to that capacity. In 2016, NBC Bay Area reported on the impending choice California voters had to make between Proposition 62 and 66, which gave California voters the option to either abolish the death penalty or speed it up. In that report, Wilson spoke in favour of Proposition 62, while Marc Klaas rallied passionately in favour of Proposition 66. The latter’s 12-year-old daughter Polly was abducted, raped and murdered. And he wanted to make sure the man convicted of killing her served his sentence to the end. “We’re talking about baby killers, cop killers, serial killers, spree killers – and sexually sadistic psychopaths,” Klaas told NBC. When opposing restorative justice, media and politicians will prey on the community’s deepest fears while ignoring the humanity of the inmates themselves. California voted for Proposition 66. Even Williams admitted that harming a child would test his own capacity for empathy. “I’m pretty sure my thoughts are going to be not good,” he said. He wonders whether that reaction is conditioning or innate. “I want you to feel the pain that my loved one felt,” he said, describing the very reaction he had when his own brother was murdered. For Williams, time healed. “You have to be in a sad situation to take somebody’s life,” he said, finding the empathy for the person responsible for his brother’s death. “When you take a life, you feel that. That sits with your spirit. I’ve lived that.",film
" The musical biopic has long proved an irresistible format, synonymous with uplifting tunes, against-the-odds triumph and actors imitating famous performers. The genre is sparsely populated in Australian film and TV, however – some notable examples including Shine and The Sapphires, and the mini-series Friday on My Mind, INXS: Never Tear Us Apart and Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You. The latter, which stars Delta Goodrem in the lead role, began with you-know-what scene (“better shape up, doo doo doo!”), making it inevitable that if a Goodrem biopic were one day made – which of course would be called Born to Try – it would require at least one scene featuring an actor playing Delta playing Olivia playing Sandy: an inception of greasy musical goodness. Now we can add to the list director Unjoo Moon’s Helen Reddy biopic I Am Woman. It is a lean and likeable, if slight and a little trite, celebration of the legendary Australian-American singer, feminist and anthem-creator Helen Reddy, shot with a rich neo-noirish texture by Oscar-winning cinematographer Dion Beebe. The film’s emotional essence is reflected in that beautiful, bittersweet line from her most famous song: “Yes I’ve paid the price, but look how much I’ve gained.” The film, on Stan now, is about hard-fought success and breaking the glass ceiling, expressed through the narrative of a wide-eyed hopeful riding the midnight train to chance it in dimly lit venues. The film opens with Reddy (played with wonderful poise and presence by Tilda Cobham-Hervey) emerging from a New York subway in 1966 with her young daughter in tow. The protagonist will soon have cold water poured on her dreams, mansplained to by a music executive who informs her that male groups are all the rage (“you’ve heard of the Beatles, right?”) and insists he “can’t do anything with a female singer”. In the next scene she is at a bar performing I Will Follow Him – that sugary hymn of lovesick subservience – before confronting the manager and requesting a pay increase, to bring her up to parity with the men. This cigar-chomping chump barely lifts his head, responding by telling Reddy that these men have “got families to feed”. You can almost visually observe the unsubtle precision of Emma Jensen’s script, packing in evidence of patriarchal oppression and laying down the faultlines of an experience not just about Reddy succeeding as a woman, but earning, as the performer herself put it, “wisdom born of pain”. Things are a little more subtle in the relationship between Reddy and her good friend, the fellow Aussie expat and gossip columnist Lillian Roxon (Danielle Macdonald), who Reddy worries is unethical and possibly dangerous for her career. There’s also her cocaine-addicted husband and manager, Jeff Wald (Evan Peters), who becomes increasingly domineering as more powder shoots up his nostrils, before ultimately morphing into Sean Penn from Hurlyburly. A key question becomes: when is she going to do the song? The big one?! In one scene Reddy writes on a piece of paper the words “I AM STRONG” and “I AM INVINCIBLE”, causing my mind to snap back to perhaps the most crudely machine-tooled “insight” into the songwriting experience ever – from the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash. (Reese Witherspoon interrupts a hard-partying Cash [Joaquin Phoenix] and yells “you can’t walk no line!”. Cut to the recording studio.) Moon and Jensen don’t need a crowbar in a moment like that, because there is no moment, no sudden realisation. Dealing with the patriarchy is Reddy’s life, and every woman’s life. Despite Cobham-Hervey’s radiant performance, the great singer comes across as a limited presence: more a set of principles than a character, without a single scene in which she behaves unexpectedly or in a way that challenges preconceptions. This comes down in part to a problem common in portrayals of famous people in biopics: speculate too much about them and the portrayal becomes distrustful; speculate too little and it becomes boring. The first performance of the titular track arrives around the one-hour mark – and yes, it induces tingles. Cobham-Hervey maintains a very vertical physicality; the performance seems to exist entirely in her eyes. Moon contextualises the scene, cutting to footage of women’s liberation protests, aligning the film to the raison ‘d’etre of the song: the feeling this is an anthem; a celebration; a symbol of change. All anthems require a degree of simplicity, cutting through the complexities of human experience to create a feeling. The song nails that in three and a half minutes; the film stretches it out across two hours, reducing its impact but retaining its sentiment.  I Am Woman is out now on Stan",film
"A call to boycott Netflix on Thursday over the French film Mignonnes – AKA Cuties – has been launched on social media, over claims that its young stars were portrayed in a sexualised way. The film is directed by French-Senegalese director Maïmouna Doucouré, and started streaming on 9 September. More than 200,000 tweets with the hashtag #CancelNetflix became the top trending topic one day later. A first wave of criticism, in August, led Netflix to withdraw artwork used to promote the film, which was released in theatres that month in France. At the time Netflix said it apologised for having used “inappropriate” images in its promotional material. But on Thursday, broader opposition to some of the imagery came from around the political spectrum in the United States. A petition on change.org calling on users to cancel their Netflix subscriptions currently stands at more than 600,000 signatures. DeAnna Lorraine, a former Republican candidate for Congress from California, tweeted that “Child pornography is illegal in America”. “As the mother of an eight-year old girl, I STRONGLY support #CancelNetflix,” added Beatrice Cardenas, another California Republican. The film, which received a director’s award at the Sundance film festival, tells the story of Amy, an 11-year-old Senegalese girl living in Paris, who joins a dance group formed by three other girls from her neighbourhood to escape the restrictions of family life. “The hypersexualization of girls (and boys) is disgusting,” tweeted Omar Navarro, another Republican politician. “It is morally and ethically reprehensible.”  In a statement, Netflix said: “Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children. It’s an award-winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up – and we’d encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie.” Among the voices praising the movie were American actor Tessa Thompson (Creed, Avengers: Endgame), who said on social media that she found it “beautiful”. “It gutted me at @sundancefest. It introduces a fresh voice at the helm. She’s a French Senegalese Black woman mining her experiences. “The film comments on the hyper-sexualization of preadolescent girls. Disappointed to see the current discourse. Disappointed to see how it was positioned in terms of marketing. “I understand the response of everybody. But it doesn’t speak to the film I saw.”",film
"Martha and Sean Carson are an average Boston couple preparing for the arrival of their first child. They’ve got the ultrasound scans framed and mounted on the wall. They’ve got the big family car that Martha’s mother just bought them. (“Grey like her soul,” jokes Sean.) Everything’s set; the future is all scripted. Then the home birth goes awry and everything else follows suit. Their well-ordered life becomes a veritable long day’s journey into night. Pieces of a Woman is the first American picture from the talented Hungarian film-maker Kornél Mundruczó and showcases a pair of full-blooded performances from Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf. Back in his homeland, Mundruczó crafted such brilliantly strange and potent pictures as White God and Johanna. He’s jettisoned the strangeness en route, but appears to have bulked up for more power. This film roars and rages like a wronged stevedore. Sean works in construction and talks about resonances and particle physics; the way in which certain conflicting vibrations can reduce solid structures to rubble. He’s talking about bridges but he’s thinking about his own marriage. The trauma of his daughter’s death exposes hairline cracks and buried tensions. Martha is from a good family; he is a blue-collar Joe. She is cool and collected; he is a total hothead. On top of all that, they have to contend with Martha’s rich, aged mother (nicely played by the great Ellen Burstyn, with glittering, tragic eyes and a core of inner steel). The old matriarch is constantly pulling strings, waving cheques, offering unsolicited advice. She says: “Martha, if you’d done it my way, you’d be holding your baby in your arms right now.” It takes a village to raise a child, it is said, and in this case a whole city to ensure that one is laid to rest. In between the domestic squalls, Mundruczó turns his camera on a wintry Boston where snow plasters the trees and ice flows in the harbour. It’s a place (paging Cheers) where everybody knows your name and where everyone appears to be at least distantly related, from the brother-in-law who sells the Carsons the car to the cousin who doubles as their lawyer. The midwife (Molly Parker) was at fault and now Boston wants her blood. Martha, for her part, just wants what was lost: her marriage and her daughter. Viewed as an acting masterclass, the film is bruisingly impressive in its way. The principal actors raise the roof; each gets to do their big turn for the camera. But it feels a little schooled, a little staged, like a workshop at the Actors’ Studio; this impression isn’t helped by the over-insistent score, which drops like a lead weight after each full-throated exchange. If Mundruczó’s aim is to lead us through the depths of agony and despair, then we need to feel the couple’s pain in our guts; I never did, quite. Out in frozen Boston, Sean has started self-medicating again, beating a path back to the fags, booze and cocaine as a means of numbing himself against the horror-show of his life. It’s working for him; maybe it is for us, too. When Mundruczó puts in the knife, it registers as a dull throb.",film
"It’s an understatement to say that a lot has happened since the trailer for Disney’s live-action Mulan was released last year, shortly after Hong Kong’s controversial extradition law was put forward, which sparked immediate protests. The ongoing assault on democracy in Hong Kong has dominated international headlines, with the arrests of pro-democracy activists, newspaper editors and government legislators. With its original cinema release put on hold due to the coronavirus epidemic, Mulan is now emerging to a vastly different political landscape. On the face of it, the new Mulan is a missed opportunity for Hollywood to explore Chinese history and identity, a confused and superficial statement about Chinese nationalism. A hodgepodge of Chinese historical mise-en-scène, wuxia-style choreography, cheap orientalism and stilted dialogue, it’s also become a lightning rod for pro-democracy and human rights protests around the world.  I am still an unabashed lover of the 1998 cartoon. It was a film that reflected the complexities of my upbringing as the half-Chinese daughter of a mainland Chinese immigrant growing up in the former British colony Hong Kong. The themes of struggling to fit in, reconciling your own identity, and the pressure of making your family proud were a unique package. The presence of Chinese-American screenwriter Rita Hsiao on the 1998 Mulan writing team seems to have been forgotten: she no doubt helped to create the film’s sense of the second- and third-generation immigrant experience, subtly inserting joyful references to Cantonese culture throughout the film. The new film follows most of the original’s storyline, but major elements of the cartoon have been removed, including the wise-cracking dragon guide Mushu and Mulan’s love interest, Captain Li Shang (today a bisexual icon). They are replaced with a sister with no purpose, a phoenix who doesn’t do very much but looks pretty, and two new villains, Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee), a nomadic leader, and a witch called Xian Liang (Gong Li), who operates as Mulan’s Lacanian “double”. Li ultimately steals the film with several scenes between her and Mulan (Liu Yifei) that prickle with sexual tension as she attempts to turn Mulan to the dark side. But that’s about as close to passion as we get in this film. Perhaps most jarring is the decision made by the film’s four credited screenwriters to strip our heroine of any flaws, bestowing her instead with a mystical “force”. To do this they repurpose an element of Chinese culture known as Qi, which translates as “breath” or “air”. Philosophers describe it as a type of energy or living metabolism in all beings – though not a special, individual power. (Before he died, my Beijing born father used to hug me when I was upset in order to get rid of the “bad Qi”.) In the film, Qi gives Mulan superhuman physical powers. Unlike the animation’s average teenager, who works hard to succeed as a soldier, the new Mulan is ready made. The child Mulan can already wield a sword like a warrior. She can even fly. The fact she holds Qi is repeated too many times to count, even though the film doesn’t explore it in any meaningful way. Other changes are more sinister. China has a tradition of “gǔ wéi jīn yòng” (“Use the past to serve the present”). The Mulan legend has been adapted many times, and the character’s origins have changed to suit. Historians largely agree that Mulan was a member of the proto-Mongolic Xianbei people, who lived in northern China in the 5th century. Over time her nomadic identity has been removed, and replaced with that of the dominant Han ethnicity. So claiming this new Mulan is an “authentic” version of the legend is especially ironic at a time when China is cracking down on Mongolian cultural identity alongside the imprisonment and “re-education” of Xinjiang Uighurs. The film-makers also made no secret that they were appeasing Chinese censors. In the Hollywood Reporter, it was made known that they went so far as to edit out a love scene. However, controversy over this live-action Mulan really kicked off after the lead actor, Chinese-born naturalised-American “Crystal” Liu Yifei, declared her support for the Hong Kong police after they committed acts of brutality against Hong Kong protesters last year. This sparked the #BoycottMulan movement, which, on the film’s release last week, re-emerged in Taiwan, Thailand and Hong Kong, with ongoing protests in other countries. It has also emerged that the film was partly shot in Xinjiang. In a recent roundtable discussion, Disney’s chief creative officer Alan Horn evaded a question over the political implications of Liu’s comments, saying: “It’s not hard to offend somebody somewhere … we’re not political.” But whether Horn or Disney like it or not, the film has become political, and a symbol of Hollywood’s ongoing pandering to the CCP for funding and box office revenue despite the government’s human rights abuses.  What made the original so great was the successful amalgamation of the commercial with the artistic. It did not attempt to be anything but a children’s film, a heart-warming tale of bravery and identity with universal appeal and a strong feminist message. This new adaptation was clearly produced to reap rewards at the Chinese box office and has ended up supporting the Chinese government’s aims. However, it is bogged down with its own glossy, pastiche depictions of ancient Chinese culture – in short, a bewildering piece of cinema, “as mysterious as the dark side of the moon”.",film
"Sometimes it takes the onward march of technology to bring the iconic tomes of science fiction and fantasy to life in their full glory. Peter Jackson’s Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy is a huge improvement on the 1978 Ralph Bakshi version, but how would the New Zealander have managed if he’d only had rotoscope and a few bits of string to work with rather than the laser-honed CGI of Weta Digital? Frank Herbert’s Dune looks destined to follow a similar path, if the first full trailer for Denis Villeneuve’s new adaptation of the iconic space fantasy is anything to go by. The famously lurid David Lynch version, from 1984, is known for being disowned by its director (who battled with studio execs and did not get final cut) and dismissed by the critics, but looking back now it was always going to be a challenge given the fledgling nature of special effects at the time of its making. Villeneuve’s dark and doom-laden take, quite frankly, looks set to consign Lynch’s sprawling misfire to the dustbin of history. Cine-futurism’s current messiah, courtesy of the brain-teasing Arrival and quietly brilliant Blade Runner 2049, looks to have conjured a reading of Herbert’s masterwork that will draw awestruck gasps, deja vu and double-takes from hardcore fans of the books. Timothée Chalamet (as House Atreides scion Paul Atreides) looks like the charismatic, sexy keyboard player from some half-remembered 80s new romantic group whose synthy brilliance continues to echo down the decades, while Charlotte Rampling (as the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam) is tantalisingly freaky in a witchy sort of way - that strange face covering making her heavily hooded eyes even more striking than usual. But what are the Engineers from Ridley Scott’s Alien prequels doing in the movie? Ah, those are the new Harkonnens, the evil, pasty-faced inhabitants of the frightening desert planet of Arrakis, and young Paul’s soon-to-be nemeses. Life was certainly easier in the 80s, when Lynch marked out the nefarious clan by simply making them all ginger. Naturally, Villeneuve has hired Dave Bautista to play Glossu Rabban, the knuckle-dragging nephew of chief baddie Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, for the star of Guardians of the Galaxy and Spectre has become the go-to brute for these musclebound weirdo roles. Baron Harkonnen himself we see only a glimpse of in the trailer, for surely that’s a shaven-headed Stellan Skarsgård emerging from some nasty-looking primeval gloop? Skarsgård will have to go some if he’s to hit the heights of pustule-ridden ferocity reached by Kenneth McMillan in the 1984 version - presumably heart plugs (never in the original books) are out this time around. Hopefully, the foetid whiff of subconscious homophobia will go with them. Why is Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, played with such exuberant, chest-bumping, hail-fellow-well-met heartiness? It’s as if Momoa still thinks he is portraying Aquaman from the DC superhero movies - surely the Game of Thrones star hasn’t just been transported in to remind us of the similarities between Dune’s doomed Atreides clan and the Starks of George RR Martin’s popular fantasy saga? What’s that you say? The Engineer-Harkonnens are not the only inclusions to recall space movies past – the new sandworms that maraud across Arrakis’s deserts now resemble giant, mobile Sarlaccs (from 1983’s Star Wars: Return of the Jedi). But again, they look so much cooler than the Lynch iterations that it’s hard to get too upset over a little monster design pilfering. The story is the same with the scene in which Paul spars with Josh Brolin’s House Atreides master-at-arms Gurney Halleck - suddenly the personal defence shields worn by both look like we imagined them in our dreams, rather than our 8-bit nightmares. Finally, Dune looks like the mad, phantasmagorical world of the novels, rather than a particularly weird episode of Tom Baker-era Doctor Who.",film
"While researching the Australian gold rush of the 1800s, director Roderick MacKay came across an image that immediately jumped out at him: men dressed in turbans and flanked by camels stood next to the bushmen of nascent modern-day Australia. “I stumbled upon images of these guys in traditional garb with the camel trains in the otherwise familiar Australian outback and was just like, ‘What the hell is this?’” says the director. What he’d found was a part of Australia’s history that was largely unknown until recently: the story of the men drawn from all over the British empire – known as “cameleers” – who helped build links between early Australian colonial settlements. Six years after finding the photograph, The Furnace – MacKay’s fictional account of the cameleers and the hostile Australia that welcomed them – has had its debut in the Venice film festival’s Orizzonti sidebar, bringing with it a dose of gritty outback drama to the Covid-19 affected but still glamorous Lido. Set in the late 1890s, when the British empire stretched across the world, MacKay’s film focuses on a young Afghan cameleer (Ahmed Malek) and a gold thief, played by David Wenham (beloved locally for his role in comedy-drama SeaChange, but better known to the rest of the world for his turn in The Lord of the Rings). Part western (there’s one particularly noticeable nod to Sergio Leone) and part road movie, the film has an aesthetic similarity to both There Will Be Blood and John Hillcoat’s The Proposition, as the cameleers are met by the brutal environment of the outback and the callousness of its new inhabitants. The cameleers are treated terribly in the film, and MacKay says atrocities were not unheard of, with witness accounts of summary executions by white Australians. The cameleers, who were largely Persian, Afghan, Turkish, Egyptian and Indian, were given the racist catch-all moniker “Ghans”, and used camels to transport goods across the country. “The men played a really important role in the formation of the country,” says MacKay. “They laid the foundations for the railroads and the telegraph lines and assisted with the opening up of the interior.” Filming took place on the country of the Yamatji Badimia people, a remote part of Western Australia where temperatures rose to 50°C and swarms of flies made shooting arduous – at times, the insects can be seen visibly sucking moisture from the actors’ eyes during takes. The locations were so remote that the production team had to grade the roads so they could transport equipment. MacKay’s own journey to Venice was probably the most convoluted of any of the directors who travelled to the Lido. From his home in Perth, Australia, MacKay travelled first to Qatar before moving on to Rome where, to comply with Italy’s lockdown restrictions, he holed up in an Airbnb for a fortnight before taking a train to Venice. He made the journey with the hope the film can act as a starting point for people wanting to know more about modern Australia’s history – that it might help to create “a more inclusive sense of Australian identity” and spread the cameleers’ story. “I was pretty astonished to have never heard about this before. I’ve not been taught it in high school or university and it felt like a huge historic omission that needed to be corrected,” he says. MacKay says there is “a new willingness in Australia to peel back into the past” and come to terms with it, warts and all, to understand a bit better how the country has arrived at the present. In the film, that history lesson can be stark. Wenham’s character is said to have taken part in the real-life Kalkadoon massacre of 1884, in which hundreds of Indigenous Australians were killed by police and colonists. “It’s kind of the equivalent of the Wounded Knee Creek massacre,” says MacKay. “That is a very mythic event in American westerns and frontier mythologies. But we have massacres on the same scale in Australia, but they’re still not widely known.” Setting the record straight also meant including Indigenous Australians in the narrative. The Aboriginal characters feature heavily and, as they did in real life, embrace cameleers and in some instances invite them to live within their communities. “It makes a lot of sense,” says MacKay. “A lot of the cameleers came from tribal-based cultures, deeply spiritual, nomadic people and obviously, a lot of these traits are shared by Aboriginal people. And then they both received a great deal of prejudice from the colonial Anglo-Celtic community. So that laid the foundation for this bond.” The Indigenous characters speak in the Badimaya dialect, an endangered language because so few people can speak it. One elder who was considered an authority on it died a year before shooting. That meant MacKay had to consult vastly across the community to try and understand the language well enough to use it in the film. “That was pretty daunting having to undertake that,” he says. “But it also made it so much more meaningful.” In the film the cameleers are caught between wanting to return home and knowing the gold rush could bring them vast wealth. For some of the men, MacKay found, that conflict saw them stuck in their adopted country. “A lot of these guys did actually become trapped in Australia because there was a financial barrier in getting back to their homelands,” he says. “There are stories of someone walking into the oldest mosque in South Australia and there are these ancient men there who were the last of that final generation of cameleers.” The legacy of the cameleers can still be found in Australia, says MacKay, in the stories told by their descendants.

"Regina King’s directorial debut stood out at this year’s Venice film festival. There’s the intriguing subject matter: it’s an adaptation of Kemp Powers’s dramatisation of a real-life meeting between Cassius Clay, Malcolm X, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke after Clay’s surprise win over Sonny Liston in February 1964. But there’s another reason: it’s the first film directed by an African-American woman to be selected in the festival’s history. At the event on Monday, King recognised that the success or failure of her film, One Night in Miami, could have ramifications for other black female directors. “It’s interesting because how this film performs will open doors or maybe close doors for more black female directors … that’s how things seem to work,” she said over video link. The issue of gender parity has mostly been obscured at this year’s festival by the Covid-19 crisis, which has meant a more subdued version of the event with around half the number of guests. But last year there was outcry over the fact only two films in competition were made by female film-makers, while in 2020 that number has leapt to eight out of the 18 films in contention for the Golden Lion. King’s film is not in competition, but it stands out as one of a handful of films directed by black women to have ever been recognised at the event. Venice has celebrated male black film-makers in the past: Spike Lee, Ousmane Sembène, John Singleton, Isaac Julien, Antoine Fuqua, John Akomfrah and Steve McQueen have all featured. Black female film-makers have been included too, but in far fewer numbers. The Martinique director Euzhan Palcy won the Silver Lion at the Venice film festival in 1983 for Sugar Cane Alley. Last year in an interview with the Guardian, Palcy said that despite the critical praise in Venice she struggled to forge a career in Hollywood afterwards because her films were seen as “too black”. The first US film directed by an African-American woman to be released theatrically was Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust in 1991. Ashley Clark, a critic and the author of Facing Blackness: Media and Minstrelsy in Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, said the inclusion of King’s film should be celebrated, cautiously. “I hope that this exposure helps to secure future opportunities for King to make films. For all the recent critical reappraisals and exposure for film-makers such as Julie Dash and Euzhan Palcy, neither has had a theatrically released feature film for the best part of three decades,” he said. The importance of festival recognition was highlighted after a recent investigation by the New York Times found that out of 1,034 films in the Criterion Collection, which is regarded as including the “giants of 20th-century cinema”, only nine had black directors. Palcy was the only black female director included. Dr Clive Nwonka, LSE Fellow in film studies and author of the book Black Boys: the Aesthetics of British Urban Cinema, said he hopes that King’s inclusion can act as a wake-up call to the industry. “This moment should influence the entire white film industry: the Hollywood system, the Academy, the studios, the production companies, the distributors, the agents, the festival juries,” he said. “They are the ones who should be looking at this moment and begin to unthink their assumptions and valuing of black women film-makers.” King previously pledged to work only on projects with a 50/50 gender split, during her successful awards campaign for supporting actress for If Beale Street Could Talk, which saw her win at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. At Venice, King – who made the move behind the camera after directing an episode of the TV drama This Is Us – said she was grateful to be part of the festival but was anxious for the film to do well commercially. “A woman will get a shot, and if she does not succeed, that shuts things down for years to come until an opportunity comes again for another woman to get that shot,” she said. “So I am so grateful for our film to be a part of the festival, but I really, really want it to perform well, because there’s so much talent out there and there are so many talented directors.” In 2018, Venice signed up to the 50/50x2020 pledge, which was meant to ensure gender parity on lineups by 2020. It has fallen short of that, but its director Alberto Barbera said the event is “absolutely committed” to the movement. There is no such commitment on racial diversity. Nwonka said black female directors and black women have been left behind within gender equality debates in the film industry. He said the inclusion of King’s film was a huge achievement because it is still so rare for a black film to be recognised at a major festival. “For Regina King’s film to be playing at a festival such as Venice represents a significant moment that will undoubtedly inspire other film-makers who have continued to struggle to find a major platform and recognition for their work,” he added. Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, said King’s inclusion was groundbreaking. She said: “At a festival where women directors have struggled to be programmed even after the festival committed to push for gender parity, King will rightly be the centre of attention as not only a female director, but a black female director – a group that is sorely underrepresented in this industry.”",film
"Lockdown in the UK cost its cinemas an estimated £111m in lost revenue, and their annual income could be down 60% on last year’s. Abandoned filming means there are few enticing titles in the pipeline, and production safety guidelines are hampering new production. If cinemas are to survive while socialdistancing slashes their capacity, they’ll have to fill as many as they can of their remaining available seats. Filmgoers will need to show up in force, whatever their age, gender or physical condition. I’m an ardent film fan; unfortunately, I’m also male and medically vulnerable, which makes me low-hanging fruit for Covid’s scythe. An over-75-year-old is 623 times more likely to die from the disease than an under-45-year-old. Men are over twice as much at risk as women, and a dodgy cardiovascular system doesn’t improve your chances. Of course, we vulnerables have been told to crawl back out of our hobbit holes and do our bit to rescue the economy, including its entertainment sector. I know cinemas are now meant to be Covid-secure. Phone-only booking would save me from jostling at the box office and faecal transmission via paper tickets. Perspex would fence off Munchies-vendors and grubby pick’n’mix would be but a memory. One-way foot traffic would keep people out of my face, with ushers monitoring any infractions. Toilets would be sanitised regularly, and disinfectant would purify armrests. Masks might absorb fellow filmgoers’ coughs and sneezes, while blocked-off seating would ensure popcorn-munchers didn’t spray me with spittle. I could even don full PPE, according to 29 pages of guidance from the UK Cinema Association. Were I still in my salad days, these measures would have left me well-satisfied. However, even the most elaborate of safeguards can’t wholly get the better of SARS-CoV-2. The canny virus refuses to confine itself to the droplets we exhale and the surfaces on to which these fall. Those chunky globules, if not trapped by masks, obligingly hit the deck within the two-metre safe zone after a few minutes. The Covid-infected also emit much larger numbers of smaller, more lung-invasive particles. Primed with slivers of viral RNA, these evil specks agglomerate into a swirling, gravity-defying miasma that infests the air. During two hours in front of the silver screen, this cloud of death would enfold me, thickening with every unbated breath and excited gasp of those around me. Why would an enfeebled greybeard risk such an experience? After a long life much enhanced by cinema’s flickering dreams, I feel I owe the industry. Yet in spite of my generation’s pride in its sense of duty, I’m not going to risk my life just to pay off this debt. I’ll really have to want to go back. A lot. Do I? Back in March, when big-screen deprivation first kicked in, it didn’t seem too bad. Frankly, a home-cinema TV seemed likely to provide a more immersive experience than the teensy screens of the poky Picturehouse I’d come to frequent. Now, I thought, I’ll be able to catch up with all those talked-about box-set streamers. I got plugged into Succession, Better Call Saul and Fargo, and I was knocked out. These shows were brilliantly written and produced. Their characters and plots had time to grow. The movies, with their hackneyed formulas and silly, 90-minute story-arc resolutions, paled in comparison. I soon learned, however, that I’d been seduced by the cream of the crop. The vast bulk of what Netflix and Amazon had to offer turned out to be as dreary, mechanical and repetitive as anything on the big screen. The solution seemed to be to stick with the few shows of real class: after all, they were available in staggering volume. Yet after five seasons of Saul and another five of Breaking Bad, I started to grow sick of Albuquerque and its denizens. The movies may have their franchises, but in the pre-Covid age, they still unleashed copious brand new characters, stories and settings, every single week. I fell back on my pile of DVDs of yesterday’s jewels. Many of them stood up well. I almost wore out my copy of Mathieu Demy’s restoration of Les Parapluies de Cherbourg. But it was no good. Movies aren’t just timeless artefacts; they’re also an expression of their moment. I needed fresh film. By now, I was missing everything from scruffy foyers and over-priced Cokes to Volkswagen ads and spoiler-filled trailers. I even hankered for the body odour and blue glow from the texting nincompoops seated in the row in front. Yet something more was still required. I couldn’t forget the quality of the best of the streamed stuff. I wasn’t going to lay down my life for rubbish. So, what was the multiplex able to offer? The reruns of past classics couldn’t tempt me, sated as I was by my DVDs, yet there didn’t seem to be much else. I might have been ready to die for our cinemas, but the studios wouldn’t even risk their bottom line. The big stuff was being held back, endlessly deferred or re-routed to the theatres’ streaming competitors. And then came Tenet. All credit to Warners for setting the ball rolling and taking the potential financial hit. Here was a picture flaunting scale and ambition. With its 70mm and Imax spectacle, it demanded big-screen viewing. Surely this one ought to lure me back. It certainly lured back many, but we old folks are a fussy bunch. Nowadays, I no longer go for dizzying, pretentious nonsense. In my twilight years, I like a proper story that makes sense. Just another sign of being past it, I suppose. But it means I’ve given Nolan’s masterpiece a miss. Instead, ever more anxiously, I’ve been looking for something else to ease me back. Hope Gap seemed just the ticket for my demographic. Nighy and Bening: bliss. Could this be another Le Week-End or 45 Years? Then I watched the trailer. And somehow, few of the autumn’s prospects seem better equipped to give my timorous soul the shove it needs. Except for one. The building buzz for No Time to Die is quickening my senescent pulse. God knows what Waller-Bridge may have done to the script. Still, as it’s been so many times before, everything’s now down to 007.",film

"Against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement, and with elite universities under attack for their poor diversity records, Somalinimo celebrates the experiences of four Cambridge University students as they seek positive change and find solidarity with each other in what could otherwise be an isolating and intimidating environment. Somalinimo is also a love-letter to Somali culture: with a distinctive visual approach, it takes us inside one of the most traditional institutions in the UK as well as a British-Somali home, while inspiring a new generation to navigate their way between the two. A collaboration between the writer Awa Farah and the film-maker Alice Aedy, it was made with the support of the BFI Doc Society Fund and is being show for the first time on Guardian Documentaries. Why did you decide to make this film together? Awa: In 2018, I was researching the Somali diaspora in the UK. I was becoming increasingly tired of the monolithic, stereotypical depiction of Somalis in both literature and film. I came across Alice’s photography work on Somali women and found it beautifully refreshing. Alice: Awa told me about her time at Cambridge studying an MPhil in African Studies, a place that was not made for people “like her”, but where she carved out a powerful sense of home through the Somali women she met there. We wanted to share that story. Awa and I hoped to make a visually cinematic short film together, exploring what it means to live with the triple consciousness of being part of three marginalised groups – Black, female and Muslim – at one of the UK’s most traditional institutions, Cambridge University. And although Awa, Miske, Hafsa and Samiya’s experiences are unique, the power of their stories lie in their universality. Identity, nationality, race, gender – these are all pressing and timely themes which Somalinimo touches on. We hoped to make a film that unapologetically showcases love for Somalia’s colourful traditions and traditional dress, Blackness and Islam. When making a film about a community that is not your own, there is a particular responsibility to do so with respect and care to everyone involved and how they are represented. As a white director it was important to me to work closely with Awa, the producer and protagonist of the film, at every stage of the film production to ensure it was a true collaboration. Equally important was having strong representation of women and POC behind the camera. What was your creative vision for this film and how did you go about achieving it? Awa: What we initially thought would be a story about Somali women and their experiences at Cambridge became more like a love letter to our Somali heritage. After the interviews, we knew that telling a story that portrayed the richness and colour of Somali culture was just as important as the Cambridge aspect. We began thinking about how we could then visually merge these two worlds with the clothing, set design, architecture, and music, and it all just fell together quite naturally. Alice: Awa spoke powerfully about the way the physical spaces of Cambridge made her feel. It became important to represent those spaces visually; the spaces that could make the women feel isolated, like the dining hall; empowered, like the mosque; a sense of home, like the Somali living room set design. Awa and I wanted all four women to walk through Cambridge in their “diraacs” – traditional Somali dress – as a powerful celebration of their Somali heritage. What inspired you? Are there other films/anything that informed your approach to this project, or that you looked to for inspiration? Awa: Growing up with six sisters, I felt like I had space where I could have honest conversations about everything. I think that so much about the film is about a way of trying to make a home from home. The theme of sisterhood and a sense of comfort is present throughout. In Cambridge, among Black, Muslim, and female communities, I was able to share my experiences. This was a constant source of inspiration for Somalinimo. I was also always in awe of the access work carried out by the fantastic student organisers behind the scenes. Alice: I’m inspired by hybrid, stylised documentaries that borrow cinematic techniques perhaps traditionally reserved for fiction. We built the set design of a traditional Somali home to evoke the powerful sense of nostalgia, and of Somalia (the way the girls’ parents might have spoken about it). The Somali living room visually depicted a sense of belonging – a comfort zone – in contrast to the spaces in Cambridge that could sometimes be isolating. I was interested by how this set design would shape the conversations had between the girls within the space, and their ability to reflect on memory and family. How do you think this film resonates with the Black Lives Matter movement as well as elitism around university admissions? Awa: Since starting to make this film, times have changed a lot. People are no longer waiting around for positive change but are demanding it. There has been a massive drive to get more Black students and those from state schools into Cambridge! But getting students through the door will not be enough on its own. Segments of the film address the explicit and implicit ways elite institutions can feel alienating to Black students even beyond the admission stage. Proactive steps need to be taken to engage seriously with the systematic and structural nature of racism for students from all backgrounds to thrive once they enter elite, predominantly white, spaces. Alice: Since we made Somalinimo, the world has changed beyond recognition. The extraordinary Black Lives Matter movement has served as a poignant reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for equal representation and treatment of Black people in Britain. As storytellers we must play a role in challenging dominant narratives and stereotypes. We must tell positive stories that celebrate Black talent and experience. It’s no secret that elite universities, including Cambridge University, have extremely poor diversity records. The Black Lives Matter movement only served to highlight this urgent issue. I have been inspired by groups like the Black Curriculum, an initiative teaching Black history to 8-16 year olds, and other important campaigns to decolonise the British curriculum at schools and universities across the country. I never set out to make an indictment of Cambridge University, rather a celebration of these four women. However, I do want the audience to finish watching the film with a profound sense that every university is doing itself – and its students – a disservice by having such poor diversity records. What effect do you hope this film will have on the viewer? Alice: I want this film to inspire young women. You can’t be what you can’t see. We want them to recognise themselves in Awa, Samiya, Hafsa and Miske, powerful women creating a legacy for future generations. I hope the film leaves people feeling hopeful. Whoever you are – there is space for Black, Muslim students at elite universities and the viewers of this film can have an important role in carving out those spaces. For a long time, Somali communities have been underestimated and underrepresented in the film industry. Somalinimo’s overarching theme of identity and home represents a new generation of representation of Somalis in film. Awa: Primarily, I hope that young Black, Muslim students from state schools thinking of applying to Oxbridge can watch this film and feel that, despite all the barriers, you still have every right to make it your home and bring yourself fully.

"Steve Buscemi is one of our most prolific actors (164 credits and counting, according to IMDb), which is perhaps why his directorial output seems so comparatively, frustratingly slender. Though augmented by a fair amount of television (including episodes of both The Sopranos and 30 Rock), he’s helmed only four feature films, the most recent dating clear back to 2007. He began modestly, with an inaugural effort, Trees Lounge, that’s about what you’d expect from the indie stalwart: a seriocomic, Jarmuschian character study, laid-back and intimate. His sophomore film, Animal Factory, is a notable step up, bigger and broader and far more ambitious. Based on the novel by Edward Bunker, who co-starred with Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs, it’s a busy, character-driven take on one of cinema’s most durable genres: the prison picture. The story of a long-timer and a newbie, culminating in an attempted escape, it’s easiest to summarize as The Shawshank Redemption – minus all the hope and good feeling. Bunker appears in the film, briefly (like a ghost haunting his own story), co-wrote the screenplay adaptation and is credited as an executive producer – alongside his pal and protege Danny Trejo, another con turned actor, who plays a supporting role. But the focal character is Ron Decker (Edward Furlong), a new inmate in on a minor drug charge. Luckily, he quickly finds an advocate in Earl (Willem Dafoe, sporting a shaved head and well-worn sneer), the kind of resourceful inside man who can get things, and get things done: “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,” explains this big fish in the prison’s little pond. “You need friends,” Earl tells the newcomer, so he shows Ron the ropes, and imparts pearls of prison wisdom like “Inmate’s an insult – convict’s the term solitudes prefer” and “Half of knowin’ how to do time is getting’ the right job”. Ron’s wide-eyed naivety makes him something of an audience surrogate, but Bunker and co-screenwriter John Steppling resist the urge to overwork him as an expositional device; much of their script is about the logistics and routines of prison life, filled with jailhouse lingo and patter (“show pass”, “lay-in”) that’s dropped in and left for the viewer to puzzle out. Bunker also colors the narrative with the kind of details only an insider would know (Earl, needing to pass information while in solitary, communicating with an ally by yelling into a toilet). “I’m just not in my element in here, y’know,” Ron moans early on, but the prison eventually breaks him, as it does everyone. Furlong’s work here is subtle but steady, as he catalogs the close calls and self-preservation that create this slow transition from a tourist to, potentially, a lifer. Dafoe makes a good mentor, convincingly putting across Earl’s hard shell, and finding the fleeting moments to let his cracks show. Earl is an honest man, and he admits that the relationship fills a need for him, without explaining what that need is; maybe it’s a public service, or a wish for connection. Or maybe it’s just a desire to be important to another human being. Buscemi casts Animal Factory with a carefully cultivated mixture of non-professionals and ace character actors, including Seymour Cassel, John Heard, Mark Boone Junior, Chris Bauer, Mickey Rourke (playing Ron’s trans cellmate with earthy humor and genuine humanity), Tom Arnold (playing against type, wide-eyed and shockingly scary) and Buscemi himself, in a short but welcome appearance as a prison official. What’s striking – but unsurprising, considering his background – is how much Buscemi trusts his actors to tell the story implicitly, in pauses, between the lines. He frequently skips dull, obligatory scenes and eschews deadening exposition, letting the emotional narratives of their faces and eyes fill in those blanks. Buscemi is clearly fascinated by the carefully controlled politics of a place like this, which runs on an ecosystem of favors, allegiances, respect and retaliation; he also keys in on how the intense racial divisions contribute to an environment where violence can flare up quickly, and at any given moment. His patient, lived-in directorial style sniffs around the joint so thoroughly and convincingly that it feels like the viewer knows where everything is, and how everything works; it’s tempting to say one could make their way in this facility by the film’s end, but who are we kidding? Earlier this year, Ellen DeGeneres fueled one of several backlashes by comparing self-quarantine to prison. If Animal Factory does nothing else, it makes abundantly clear that the prison experience is, well, nothing like that.",film
"His beauty, his grace, his style, his presence and — until what stunned admirers must now understand to have been the very end — his youthful, boyish openness. These made up Chadwick Boseman’s persona; an actor who had come to be loved among many things for his lightly worn imperiousness, humour and charm as T’Challa, king of the fictional African country Wakanda in the Marvel smash Black Panther. Like many actors who play kings and princes in hugely successful movies or TV shows, the regality rubs off, the royalty is a residue, but he had these things anyway. What makes his death so shocking for me is that I had so loved his performance in Spike Lee’s new film Da 5 Bloods, playing the squad leader Norman, who was killed in action in Vietnam, 50 years before four of the men under his command (played by Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr and Norm Lewis) now come back to present-day Vietnam on a fraught journey into their own pasts. Lee brilliantly recreates flashback jungle scenes for all five, but with the four middleaged as they are now, and Chadwick Boseman’s Norman as he was then, as he was in their memory. He has grown not old as those that are left have grown old: he is still the impossibly handsome and daring young leader who has the tragic military burden of persuading his men not to mutiny because of the racism of the top brass. This superbly conceived performance now assumes an almost unbearable, real poignancy: when I see the poster image of these men taking a knee at Norman’s graveside it is overwhemingly sad. We now know that Boseman was being treated for cancer, and must already have been aware of the possibility that his end was near. It had been Boseman’s destiny, also, to dramatise other African-American icons on his way to becoming an icon himself: in 42, he was legendary Jackie Robinson, the first black American to make it into baseball’s major league. This was a film which notably chose a simpler, inspirational theme over anything more complex and politically contentious, but Boseman’s performance was what supplied the complexity and texture in itself: seductive and determined, intent on surpassing his own loneliness and the prejudice of others. His Robinson was a figure shown being beset by bigotry on all sides, even by some on his own team, but toughing it out without self-pity. Already, he was assuming a kind of superheroism. In Marshall, he played Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice of the United States, appointed to the bench by Lyndon B Johnson, who made important rulings against segregation. The movie dramatises an early courtroom drama, when his Marshall had to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman, and Boseman let rip with gorgeous and extravagant theatrics as the brilliant young advocate. Something of the same physicality and athleticism — and also sexuality — went into his portrayal of James Brown in the flawed biopic Get On Up, which, though it could not quite get to grips with the more unwelcome side of its leading character, had another exquisitely fierce turn from Boseman. In 21 Bridges, he had a more conventional, generic role as a New York cop who in time-honoured style had lost his dad to criminals, and now has to solve a violent gangland crime on Manhattan which he does by ordering all twenty-one bridges connecting the island to the mainland to be closed to cut off the culprit’s means of escape — an interestingly regal move. But of course it was as T’Challa, the gloriously charismatic superhero of colour in Marvel’s afrofuturist adventure, that Boseman imposed his personality on the movies. He was sensitive, handsome and stylish with something introspective, vulnerable and self-questioning in his manner as he assumes the surreal throne. Boseman did it all with such grace that it is an incidental pain for his fans that he never got to reapply these acting gifts on playing Shakespeare on stage or screen. Like all celebrities and movie stars, Boseman was entitled to his privacy, even though through his sheer empathy and lovability, his fans had come to think that they were already part of that privacy, that they knew him. So the news that he also had cancer is such a shock. He seemed — he was — so young, always appearing at least a decade younger than his years. His great movie roles were quintessentially about youth, about the vigour and energy and idealism and having it all in front of you. Boseman now becomes the lost prince of American cinema, who had a glorious and inspirational career.",film
"Every historical drama involves some element of pure invention: maybe it happened like this? Perhaps she said it like that? But Michael Almereyda’s biopic of the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla (1856 - 1943), is rather more open about this process than most. Ethan Hawke, who also starred in the director’s contemporary New York-set Hamlet 20 years ago, plays the under-appreciated visionary. Now, Tesla has a clean energy company named in his honour, is thought to have predicted the internet age, and has been played on screen several times, most recently by Nicholas Hoult in The Current War. But he died in poverty after alienating his wealthy investors and consequently struggling to obtain the funding to realise his grand visions. The contrast between this experience and that of Tesla’s erstwhile employer and sometime rival, Thomas Alva Edison (Kyle MacLachlan), the Great American usually credited with invention of the electric light bulb, suggests itself as an obvious dramatic framework for a biopic. But not this biopic. Almereyda is more interested in anachronism as a metaphor for a man fully out of step with his era; at one point Edison is seen passing time at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair by scrolling through his iPhone. (Curiously, though, the film is a stickler for period detail when it comes to the dimly lit drawing rooms where most scenes take place.) Some amusingly arch performances from MacLachlan and Eve Hewson as Anne Morgan, daughter of the banker JP Morgan, draw out the humour but, as the anachronisms pile up, any attempt to follow the film’s biographical through-thread is frustrated. Intentionally, for sure, since Almereyda is aiming at a deeper biographical truth. To watch Tesla the film is to admire its ambition while regretting its follies. Much like Tesla the man, perhaps?",film
"Four years ago, the Greek film-maker Argyris Papadimitropoulos made a vivid impression with Suntan: a bleakly hilarious Death-In-Venice-type affair set in a seaside resort, featuring a sad middle-aged man who tortures himself with his tragic infatuation with a beautiful young woman on holiday. Here is his follow-up, in the English language, featuring Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes from Marvel’s Captain America movies) and the Irish stage star Denise Gough, with a script co-written by the director with the award-winning British dramatist Rob Hayes (who worked with Michaela Coel on the TV comedy Chewing Gum). Sadly, despite all the talent involved, this is a disappointment: an unconvincing, undeveloped and emotionally directionless non-drama that just goes pointlessly around and around in circles. All of this film’s various moods – erotic, euphoric, tragic – are unearned and despite what is clearly strenuous effort from the performers themselves, the acting is hammy and undirected. It is the story of a love-at-first-sight passion which has to face up to the tough reality of maintaining a relationship once the initial sexy rush is over: in other words, dealing with the “Monday” comedown following the “Friday” of carefree weekend partying. The movie is in fact pointedly divided into a series of sections each repeatedly labelled “Friday” leading to what is evidently to be the deferred “Monday” reckoning. But bafflingly, the relationship in question seems to be always facing terrible crises and brutal Mondays long before this, yet after some shouting and then some carefree laughing, the reset button gets miraculously hit. It is a story which seems to be weirdly without penalty, without emotional consequence. Stan plays Mickey, an American guy in a Greek resort who is earning a living DJing in clubs and composing ad jingles, living a bleary hedonist lifestyle but secretly concerned about the serious musical career he self-sabotaged back in the US and the fact that he never gets to see his six-year-old son from a previous relationship with a Greek woman. Then at a party, he meets Chloe (Gough), a smart, sexy American lawyer who is just coming out of a painful situation with an abusive man. The spark is dazzling. They have nonstop wild sex, leading to waking up naked together on a beach and getting arrested – but it’s all just swept up in the uproarious swirl of their passion. But then they have to deal with their demons: namely, the sinister man that Chloe left behind and the fact that Mickey still has to have a difficult conversation with his ex-partner to get access to his son – a conversation which he leaves to Chloe, like the emotionally avoidant guy that he is. For me, this tense conversation between Chloe and Mickey’s ex-partner Aspa (played by Elli Tringou, who was the bewitchingly unattainable woman in Suntan) is the one moment in the film that truly comes to life. It is the one speck of grit in the oyster, the one scene where something seems to be really at stake, where things can happen with irreversible results. And so it proves – in a way. Aspa icily confronts Chloe with the truth about how lazy and selfish Mickey actually is, but seems to have taken stock of how serious Chloe is. Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into this film: parties, clubs, arguments, embarrassments, sex – and there’s even a full-on romcom rush to the airport. But I never got the impression of a genuine connection between the two stars. There was no chemistry. Gough works hard to make her role count, but she has not much to work with, and Stan is stuck with this exuberant, anarchic hipster role which reminded me weirdly of the cool Rat Pack guy with whom Alicia Silverstone has her terrible date in Clueless. The party feels like it’s over before it’s begun.",film
"Not to be confused with the British period drama of the same name starring Gemma Arterton and Gugu Mbatha-Raw that came out a few weeks back, this Summerland is an American-made coming-out and coming-of-age comedy, low budget but impressively high in concept. The setup posits three Gen Z young adults – straight couple Stacey (Maddie Phillips) and Oliver (Rory J Saper) with Oliver’s best friend, newly out gay man Bray (Chris Ball, also the film’s co-writer) on a roadtrip from Washington state to California to attend a desert-set music festival called Summerland, which looks like a cross between Burning Man and Coachella. The interesting queer twist is that Bray has been catfishing a hunky Christian guy named Shawn (Dylan Playfair) by pretending to be Stacey, convinced that if he could only lure Shawn into meeting him in the flesh he could coax out Shawn’s true sexuality, as yet unrecognised even by Shawn. Meanwhile, Stacey and Oliver are having their own issues around commitment and honesty. The easy, breezy script by Ball, Dylan Griffiths, and co-directors Kurtis David Harder and Noah Kentis (who collectively go by the name Lankyboy) manages to make a few smart, salient points about the fluidity of sexuality for this generation without ever feeling preachy. There is always room for gags about getting mashed on psychedelic mushrooms and the ritual complaints about uptight step-parents who just don’t get it when you borrow their swanky RV for a 1,000-mile journey. All three leads are toothsome but also credible characters with some degree of interiority. There are quite a lot of weird loose ends and a slightly deflationary denouement, but all is forgivable for its earnest sweetness of purpose.",film
"At last year’s Cannes film festival the poet/model/actor/filmmaker Greta Bellamacina revealed she’d been turned away from the festival site by staff because she had her three-month son with her in a buggy – the irony being that her film (she directs, co-writes and stars) is the story of a young single mother struggling to be taken seriously as a poet. Hurt by Paradise turns out to be a drifty, pretentious, London-set drama, though pretty enough, with the smudged eyeliner glamour of an edgy fashion shoot. Bellamacina’s film is self-consciously highbrow: that much is clear in the opening scene in which Celeste (Bellamacina) gets the brush off from a cartoonishly cynical literary agent who tells her that the reading public is only interested in dead poets: “Look at Sylvia Plath!” He suggests turning her poems about her absent dad into a novel. Celeste leaves in disgust, and heads back to her Fitzrovia flat, where she is raising her toddler alone, perpetually broke. Her quirky neighbour, out of work actor Stella (co-writer Sadie Brown), babysits while Celeste writes, and the pair’s odd-couple domestic bliss gives the film its most likable scenes; they have something of the gawky charm of Greta Gerwig’s Frances Ha. But as a female writer with a small child, Celeste fails some basic plausibility tests. For a start, she seems to have all the solitude she needs, with endless time to stare meaningfully out of the window. The film’s grasp of being skint has a strong whiff of privilege, too. Celeste’s sole income source appears to be winning a few quid in poetry competitions (which somehow pays the rent and keeps her in gorgeous vintage-look dresses – though she is frequently seen rummaging in her purse for money to buy nappies or pay the babysitter). And Bellamacina’s decision to use Celeste’s poetry as a voiceover adds to the plausibility deficit: “Do you think you should try and live your life so you have an exciting obituary,” she muses high-mindedly on the tube. For me, the 83-minute running time seemed to drag out into a lifetime.",film
"John Boyega has resigned from his role as a brand ambassador for British cologne company Jo Malone following the news he was cut out of the Chinese version of a commercial he had conceived. Boyega publicly announced his decision on Twitter. “I don’t have time for nonsense”, wrote the actor, in an apparent rejection of the company’s apology on Monday. He wrote: “Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong. The film celebrated my personal story – showcasing my home town, including my friends and featuring my family.” The original commercial, A London Gent, whose narrative Boyega was the driving force behind, shows the actor surrounded by candles on a film set, thinking about his childhood and his family and friends in Peckham. Scenes portray the actor on a white stallion surrounded by pals on BMX bikes on an estate, as well as walking through a local market and dancing in a club. The Chinese version, which stars actor Liu Haoran and features no black people, reuses many of the same concepts, including the structure and the horseplay motif. However, it does not appear to show Liu in Peckham or to be quite so directly autobiographical. The film has since been removed from the Jo Malone website. Earlier this month, Boyega highlighted what he perceived to be systemic racism encountered during his time filming Star Wars. “What I would say to Disney is do not bring out a black character, market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are and then have them pushed to the side,” he told GQ. The actor, who won much praise for his uncompromising protests following the death of George Floyd, also spoke about his experiences handling the racist backlash to his casting in the franchise. In 2015, the Chinese version of the poster for Star Wars: The Force Awakens significantly reduced his character’s prominence.",film
"Stars including Kate Winslet and Mark Wahlberg will be unveiling new Oscar-aiming films at an unconventional Toronto film festival over the next two weeks. The festival, typically viewed as a major stop on the trail to awards, will consist of a combination of socially distanced physical premieres and virtual screenings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Non-Canadian press have been advised to cover the festivities from home. “We began this year planning for a 45th festival much like our previous editions but along the way we had to rethink just about everything,” said Cameron Bailey, artistic director and co-head of the festival. “This year’s lineup reflects that tumult. The names you already know are doing brand new things this year, and there’s a whole crop of exciting new names to discover.” While masks are required within the festival’s main headquarters, where attendees often congregate, they were originally deemed optional while seated in cinemas, a point that led to concern. Organisers reversed this at the last minute, deciding to close all concession stands, meaning masks must be worn during films, following the advice of public health experts. This year, major festivals have created a non-competitive alliance that has allowed them to collaborate and share their slates. That means the romantic drama Ammonite, which was originally scheduled for a Cannes premiere, will now have its first screening at Toronto. The film, directed by Francis Lee (God’s Own Country), tells the story of the underappreciated British palaeontologist Mary Anning, played by the Oscar winner Kate Winslet, in the early 19th century. When it was revealed that the drama would focus on a romance between Anning and a female friend, played by the Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan, despite the lack of historical basis, there was unrest among Anning’s relatives. But Lee has stated that “it’s not a biopic” and is a film about women finding liberation during an oppressed time. “It’s a story about women speaking up, speaking out,” said Winslet. “I think uncovering stories where women were repressed in such a systemic way is highlighting how history has covered up those successes. We’re not going to do that any more, world.” The Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg is hoping to return to the race with the fact-based drama Good Joe Bell from Reinaldo Marcus Green, the acclaimed director of Monsters and Men, and the Oscar-winning screenwriters of Brokeback Mountain. The film tells the true story of a father whose son kills himself after homophobic bullying and his mission to travel the country to warn others about bigotry. “I’m open to however the film needs to be released,” Green said, aware of an unusual awards season that could see a number of hybrid digital and physical releases. “I do hope they will get it out this year, given everything and the election. I think it could strike a nerve.” The festival will also see directorial debuts from actors such as Halle Berry, whose drama Bruised sees her starring as an MMA fighter, and David Oyelowo, whose family fantasy The Water Man sees him starring alongside Rosario Dawson. Other stars with big premieres include Idris Elba, leading the urban cowboy tale Concrete Cowboy, and Rosamund Pike, heading up the thriller I Care A Lot alongside Peter Dinklage. Last year’s festival saw the premieres of the Oscar contenders Jojo Rabbit, Knives Out, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, and Harriet.",film
"Geraldine Viswanathan is a 25-year-old Australian actor and comedian of Indian descent who has appeared in a handful of movie-stealing supporting roles, including Blockers and The Package. Now comes a romcom vehicle for her leading actor talents, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky (whose script credits include Gossip Girl and Grey’s Anatomy). The Broken Hearts Gallery was supposed to be the big romcom of the summer – a little something for the ladies while their beaux piled into Tenet, possibly. Finally arriving in cinemas this weekend, it is something of a letdown: a funny but conventional glossy romcom. But there is no messing with Viswanathan, who is undoubtedly the main attraction. She plays funny and unfiltered Lucy, an art gallery assistant who has a quirky-stroke-creepy collection of mementos from past relationships cluttering her bedroom in a Brooklyn flatshare. She is dating her boss, Max (Utkarsh Ambudkar), an art-world poser whose studious man-bun is a dead giveaway to hidden shallows. After she makes a drunken show of herself at a work event, Lucy is hit with a double-whammy of getting fired and being dumped by Max. The plot is default romcom but Krinksy’s rams her script with smart-relatable lines. “I bet she has an amazing but crazy skincare routine,” whispers Lucy in awe after meeting Max’s impressive new doctor girlfriend. Lucy is a character with Bridget Jones, Sex and the City and Girls in her DNA, but Viswanathan brings something of her own to the role: an excitable sense of fun and fast-talking wit. You feel she has the sharpness for the lines she delivers, and her charisma goes a long way when Lucy meets bland, unthreatening Nick (Stranger Things’ Dacre Montgomery), who is opening a boutique hotel in Brooklyn. Lucy finds her niche installing a gallery in the foyer – collecting strangers’ heartbreak stories and breakup trinkets. Viswanathan has said the only role she expected to play in a romantic comedy as a woman of colour was the best friend; this film is pure romcom fantasy but Broken Hearts Gallery is radical in one important respect: challenging the film industry’s perceptions of what a leading woman looks like.",film
"There are good, sincere performances here, and it is directed with confidence. But I couldn’t make friends with this film because of some social-realist cliches and a contrived, high-concept plot. Nocturnal deserves praise for giving us a third act where so many films, of whatever sort, don’t. But this didn’t feel convincing. Lauren Coe and Cosmo Jarvis do sterling work as the two leads. Laurie is a 17-year-old newcomer at her school in a seaside town; she is doing her best to fit in, and is part of the athletics track team. Pete is a painter and decorator in his 30s who is employed to work on some school outbuildings; he is a notorious philanderer and womaniser who hangs around the sports field and soon becomes obsessed with Laurie, and she – bored with her goody-two-shoes image – starts flirting with a handsome older guy. Their relationship progresses, though platonically, and it seems in some ways more meaningful than Pete’s one-night stands. Pete is strange and obsessively guilt-stricken when Laurie starts frankly suggesting sex: has he developed a conscience? There are some nice scenes and I loved the “silent disco” sequence in which Pete tries dancing with Laurie in a boyfriend-girlfriend “date” scenario, but finally explodes with self-consciousness and walks out. Other scenes were not quite so strong: the one where the two mess anarchically around in the scuzzy seaside amusement arcade feels as if it has been done many times before in films like this. Coe and Jarvis are really good actors. They are selling it hard and the whole film is technically accomplished, but for me the story was glib. ",film
"The English composer Stephen Warbeck won an Oscar for his work on Shakespeare in Love, but has never directed a film before. He makes his writer-director debut, in collaboration with John-Paul Davidson (director of various Michael Palin and Stephen Fry-fronted travelogues) on this whimsical road movie that has little dialogue but plenty of music. Ciarán Hinds stars as the titular hat-wearer, who we meet dining on razor clams and rosé at an empty harbourside restaurant, with only a framed photograph of an unnamed woman for company. He inadvertently witnesses some apparent criminal activity and makes a quick escape in a Fiat 500 (the photo carefully placed on the passenger seat), followed by five angry men in their Citroën Dyane. So begins a picturesque odyssey across the French countryside, the best Provençal driving holiday you’ve never had. It’s a car chase, technically, but a slow one. Certainly, the sense of peril is insufficient to prevent both the pursued and his pursuers from stopping off for a good lunch whenever the mood strikes. And should they happen upon a live jazz band in a charming little town square, or a stranger singing an impromptu opera aria, what’s to stop them just sitting there in the late afternoon sun for a while? All this enjoyment of la belle vie leaves little time for slapstick, but The Man in the Hat is, in any case, more socially adept than his silent comedy forebears. He’s a sensitive listener (Hinds, utilising those melancholy eyes) and the people he meets along the road – the Damp Man (Stephen Dillane), the Biker (Maïwenn) – seem comfortable sharing their own tales of love and loss. It’s a Francophile fantasy that may be too twee for some, but the French tourist board will surely be satisfied.",film
"Bong Joon-ho’s black-comic satire Barking Dogs Never Bite has been re-released after 20 years, and in many ways it could be seen as a thematic forerunner to his Oscar-winning hit Parasite, with its vision of strange people and strange secrets in a basement. But it’s entirely distinctive on its own (bizarre) terms: a film about animal cruelty (loosely inspired by the 19th-century children’s novel A Dog of Flanders by Marie Louise de la Ramée, perennially popular in Korea) and it begins with a huge “no animals were harmed” disclaimer. As well it might. The various moments of dog-jeopardy and dog-distress will have you hiding under your seat – and a certain dog rescue scene is like something out of The Shining. Lee Sung-jae plays Yun-ju, a hapless postgrad student with a pregnant partner. The pair live in a crumbling apartment building whose front doors open outwards – which is to be important in one chase scene. Yun-ju’s worries are compounded when he realises that he is expected to pay a hefty bribe to the elderly faculty professor to get a tenure-track job. The combination of financial anxiety and disillusionment triggers a mental breakdown and he becomes obsessed with a dog in a neighbouring flat whose incessant barking is driving him mad. He decides he has no choice but to kill the unfortunate animal. In fact, his misdeeds are to involve three dogs and bring him into fateful contact with an administrator called Hyun-nam (Bae Doona) who has to press an official stamp on all “Lost Dog” notices. The movie is by turns wacky, farcical and grimly realist. The dogs might bark, but the ones doing the biting are the humans: the lazy, venal, corrupt, depressed, greedy people who have no one but themselves to blame for living a dog’s life. ",film
"An excellent brief documentary about a heroic grassroots political movement whose importance reveals itself more clearly in retrospect with every year that passes.  In late 1970s Britain, fascists and racists were gaining ground and members of the nervously silent political establishment were showing themselves the heirs of Neville Chamberlain and Paul von Hindenburg. A photographer and underground theatre activist called Red Saunders realised something had to be done. He co-founded Rock Against Racism to mount demonstrations and concerts against the far-right National Front and it was the great achievement of RAR to help to bring together the forces of punk, ska, reggae and the new wave – whose fanbases might otherwise be indifferent to each other – to present a united front to counter and mock the ugly bigots. This film confronts some uncomfortable truths: it wasn’t simply a matter of harnessing the innate progressive liberalism of pop music against prejudice. Some of music’s biggest names (Clapton, Bowie, Rod Stewart) were making fatuous pro-Enoch Powell pronouncements – a bleary male-menopausal phase that can’t entirely be forgotten. And some punks were themselves displaying satirical shock-value Nazi emblems that we could have done without. Rock Against Racism channelled all that energy and rebellion, culminating in a glorious free concert in Victoria Park, east London – Britain’s Woodstock. This film reminds you of the visceral power of the Clash and, indeed, the Tom Robinson Band. (Rubika Shah’s film also makes a spirited case for 999 being one of the best and most neglected punk bands.) Perhaps the most interesting case was Jimmy Pursey’s band Sham 69, which had a skinhead following. Sham 69’s appearance on the RAR bill was vital in reaching out to the white working class, who were ripe for NF recruitment. With racism now being becoming normalised in the corridors of power all over the developed world, the spirit of RAR is still needed.",film
"Raised in a good German family, 20-year-old Luisa (Mala Emde) is now in open revolt, part of a different breed of good family. She’s a first-year law student and ardent antifa warrior, determined to defeat a resurgent wave of neo-Nazis in her town. Her parents are part of a local hunting group and like to hang up their kills in the woods – but Luisa is now veggie and wants no part of that world. “A pity,” says her dad. “You were always our best shot.” This year’s Venice film festival has been notably lacking in big studio films and this has freed up space for the occasional rogue interloper or narrow-eyed insurrectionist. And Tomorrow the Entire World, by the German writer-director Julia von Heinz, blasts on to the Lido to tell us about harsh reality and the current field of conflict; a terrain that’s at once under our very noses and impossibly removed from the sunny tourist haunts of Venice. The tale drifts and falters when I wished it would have hit home with more conviction, but that may be partly the point. The struggle is endless, unwinnable. Everybody is compromised. We’re in the city of Mannheim, although it could be any number of others. Von Heinz’s drama unfolds in a no man’s land of underpasses, kebab shops and unclaimed ground. It’s a place of doorstep drinkers and bus-shelter smokers, a place to be fought over by left and right alike. In class, Luisa learns that the German constitution allows for pre-emptive action to be taken against non-democratic groups. But who makes that call? Who decides which group is which? It depends which end of the telescope you’re looking down. On TV, for instance, the newsreader refers to “clashes between rightwing protesters and leftwing protesters” and the blithe moral equivalence – the reductive even-handedness of the comment – immediately sticks in the craw. But, in the case of P31, Luisa’s antifa collective, it may not be entirely wide of the mark. The group is led by Noah Saavedra’s preening, macho Alfa (the name is a little too on-the-nose), who appears to have little interest in ideology and idealism beyond the opportunities they provide to pick fights or get laid. Alfa, by and large, is in antifa for the thrill, and his unconvincing relationship with Luisa is probably the film’s weak link. Or perhaps what Von Heinz is showing is a crucial changing of the guard: the way in which a new arrival such as Luisa – for all her baggage and privilege – can redirect the movement back to its core principles. Tellingly, this is a film full of flawed men. They’re either playing the role of a pound-shop Che Guevara, like Alfa, or living a lonely hermit’s existence like Dietmar (Andreas Lust), a legendary 90s radical who’s now gone to ground. The women, by contrast, are the tale’s true believers. After a scuffle with skinheads, Luisa and Alfa get their hands on a cheap burner phone. This in turn leads them to a Nazi rally by the rail tracks and a mysterious lock-up garage outside town. Proceeding along its stealthy course, Von Heinz’s tense, well-textured film treads a chilly, liminal country. Its activists are bundled in fleeces and scarves, warming themselves around matches and rollies, like soldiers in the trenches of a new kind of campaign. When a pigeon beats its wings inside a darkened multi-storey, it sounds for all the world like a grenade going off.",film
"Linda Manz, who has died aged 58 from lung cancer, gave one of the most haunting child performances in all cinema in Terrence Malick’s 1978 film Days of Heaven, made when she was 15. She played the young sister of a hot-tempered labourer (Richard Gere), who travels with him and his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) picking up farm work across the Texas panhandle during the early 20th century. There had never been a face like hers: bruised, scarred, angular, with a confrontational stare that could soften unexpectedly, she looked at once unformed and prematurely world-weary. “Sometimes I’d feel very old,” she says in the film, “like my whole life’s over, like I’m not around any more.” It wasn’t hard to believe. A casting call for the part had gone out to schools in New York City. “Linda came in because her teacher thought she was a real character,” said the film’s editor, Billy Weber. “When she came in to meet Terry, she looked at him and said, ‘I liked your script.’ He hired her on the spot!” She was, said Weber, “someone who barely knew what movies were. It never got through to her that the people in the movie, the other actors, had names that weren’t their real names.” Her own character had to be called Linda “because that was the only thing she would respond to”. “Linda was instinctively brilliant,” said Gere. “And with anyone with that kind of brilliance, you just give them space. Terry was smart enough and sensitive enough to just let her be. And she’s extraordinary in the film because of that.” If her striking physiognomy and unself-conscious mannerisms were spellbinding, it was her otherworldly narration, which was not in the original script, that helped lift Days of Heaven into a divine class of its own. Malick and Weber had struggled to shape the material in the editing room – Paramount was not shown a cut of the film until 20 months after shooting had wrapped – and it was during this arduous process that the idea arose to use Manz’s musings as a kind of connective tissue. Most voiceovers provide clarity or fill in gaps. This one does nothing of the sort: Manz’s elliptical stream-of-consciousness, given a hard edge by her chewy New York drawl, often goes against the grain of the image, mixing tenses and introducing digressions and non-sequiturs. “They took me into a voice recording studio,” she told the Village Voice in 2011. “No script, nothing, I just watched the movie and rambled on.” One of the most memorable passages of her narration (“There’s gonna be creatures running every which way, some of them burned, half their wings burning…”) was taken from Manz paraphrasing for Malick the Book of Revelation, which she had recently discovered and about which she was eager to tell him. “Her voice and her ability to very nakedly, but kind of pleasantly and poetically, describe her universe is mind-boggling,” said Gere. “This movie would not be that movie without that voiceover, wouldn’t be that way without the quality of her voice, just the timbre of her voice is so interesting.” Malick did not make another film for 20 years; Manz, too, soon disappeared for almost as long. Immediately after Days of Heaven she played Peewee, the plucky, pint-sized girlfriend of a gargantuan skinhead, in The Wanderers (1979), adapted from Richard Price’s novel about 1960s gangs in the Bronx. The writer-director Philip Kaufman was so bewitched by Manz that he created the character especially for her. She was also intensely powerful in her only lead role, in Dennis Hopper’s punk psychodrama Out of the Blue (1980). She played Cebe, a disaffected teenager struggling to reconnect with her ex-con father (Hopper). Whether playing drums on stage, doggedly singing Elvis Presley’s Teddy Bear as her parents’ marriage disintegrates around her or simply idling on the streets gawping at the world, Manz was electrifying. “I think I was Cebe,” she said. She was born in New York, where she attended half a dozen schools. Her father had walked out when she was two; “For a long time, I was always asking people to adopt me,” she said. She was raised by her mother, Sophie, a cleaner, who encouraged her to attend acting classes. Along with Days of Heaven, The Wanderers and Out of the Blue, she also appeared in Boardwalk and as a juvenile delinquent in the sitcom Dorothy (both 1979), which ran for only four episodes in the same year. In the early 1980s, she gave up acting. “There was a whole bunch of new young actors out there, and I was kind of getting lost in the shuffle,” she said. “So I laid back and had three kids. Now I enjoy just staying home and cooking soup.” She married Bobby Guthrie, who was the camera operator who came to Michael Jackson’s rescue when his hair caught fire while filming a Pepsi commercial. In 1997, she made a low-key comeback in Gummo, Harmony Korine’s disturbing portrait of small-town American youth, in which she brandished a gun and tap-danced in over-sized men’s shoes. What she did, said Korine, “wasn’t even acting. It was like the way I felt about Buster Keaton when I first saw him. There was a kind of poetry about her, a glow.” In the same year, she appeared in one scene in David Fincher’s thriller The Game, starring Michael Douglas. As quickly as she returned, she vanished again, leaving a mountainous untainted reputation built on the smallest molehill of work. She is survived by Guthrie and their children, Michael and William, as well as three grandchildren. A third son, Christopher, died in 2018.

"‘No one knows how this history will be written,” a soldier muses portentously in the new Chinese blockbuster The Eight Hundred. If he could see 80 years into the future, he would have the answer: as an epic, effects-enhanced patriotic action movie. While the rest of the world’s cinemas are still in coronavirus recovery mode, most of China’s 70,000 screens have been open since early August, and The Eight Hundred is a sign it no longer needs Hollywood content to fill them. It has been compared to western war movies such as Dunkirk (although there is more than a touch of Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor in there), and so far it has taken more than $400m (£308m) at the box office, making it the second-highest-grossing movie of the year worldwide. The Eight Hundred draws attention to the meteoric progress of China’s increasingly blockbuster-oriented film industry, but also to the Chinese government’s determination to stamp its authority on it. The two might be on a collision course. The Eight Hundred depicts the legendary defence of the Sihang warehouse in Shanghai, where, in 1937, an isolated battalion of Chinese soldiers held out against the invading Japanese for four days and, as the film would have it, “restored the pride of a nation”. China’s film industry might also take some pride in The Eight Hundred. Shot entirely on the giant-screen Imax format (a first for a Chinese movie), it took 10 years to make, with a reported budget of $80m. You can see where the money went. There are huge, often violent action set-pieces. The Shanghai set – a huge project that took 18 months to build – is detailed and convincing, especially the foreign concession area, populated by Europeans and Americans as well as Chinese civilians. The Japanese avoided striking this British-governed area, which was just across the creek from the Sihang warehouse, giving western observers a ringside seat. At this point, China was seeking western support in the Sino-Japanese war, so the Sihang warehouse incident was already, in part, a theatrical exercise. The Eight Hundred’s success is not quite as straightforward, though. The movie was scheduled to open the Shanghai film festival in June 2019, but its release was suddenly cancelled just days before, owing to “technical difficulties”. One of the problems with the Sihang warehouse story is that the resisting Chinese forces were from the nationalist side, the Kuomintang, who were later defeated by Mao’s communists and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. At one point, the soldiers rally round the flag, Iwo Jima-style, as the Japanese try to shoot it down – except the flag is that of the Republic of China (red, with a white sun on a blue square in the corner). It is now the national flag of Taiwan. Last year was the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, so for the ruling Communist party to be glorifying the future founders of Taiwan was not a good look. In a revealing comment, the secretary general of the China Red Culture Research Association, a government-affiliated group, reportedly said of the film: “It is a reversal of history and misleads the audience. If left unchecked, it will certainly deprive the entire Communist party of its historical basis. Once the party’s leadership is lost, the Chinese nation is bound to fall into the deep, miserable abyss of colonised and semi-colonised countries.” The Eight Hundred’s history had to be rewritten. It is impossible to know what was changed, but in the finished movie much is made of the support of the Chinese civilians across the river, who catapult over supplies and lift spirits. As for the troublesome flag, it is usually seen from a distance, and is conspicuously missing its white sun symbol. The appetite for Chinese blockbusters seems to be coming from both directions. “Because Hollywood films like The Avengers still play such a huge role in the Chinese box office, there’s a desire to displace that, or at least to have domestic films which are seen to be of as high a quality, both for the global market in terms of soft power, but also for the domestic market,” says James Mudge, director of the UK’s Chinese visual festival, which has been bringing Chinese cinema to the UK since 2011. Last year, four of the top 20 highest-grossing movies worldwide were Chinese. Leading the pack were Ne Zha, a family animation, and The Wandering Earth, an effects-heavy space sci-fi later picked up by Netflix. Last month, Chinese authorities released a document calling for more homegrown sci-fi, and suggesting such movies should “highlight Chinese values, inherit Chinese culture and aesthetics, cultivate contemporary Chinese innovation”, as well as implementing “Xi Jinping thought”. The document also called for the industry to support research and development in key areas such as visual effects (both The Eight Hundred and The Wandering Earth rely on western expertise for their effects). The bigger China’s movie industry becomes, though, the greater the urge to control the message. In 2018, the Communist party’s propaganda department took direct control of the entertainment industry. That year, the government also carried out a huge clampdown on tax evasion in the film industry, making an example of the actor Fan Bingbing, who mysteriously “disappeared” for three months. She reemerged after making a grovelling public apology and paying a fine of nearly $130m. The Eight Hundred is by no means the first film to find its release suddenly cancelled. Last February, two Chinese movies were pulled from the Berlin film festival: Better Days, a high-school bullying drama, and One Second, set during the Cultural Revolution and made by the renowned director Zhang Yimou. Zhang is an illustration of how fickle the relationship between censor and film-maker can be. In the 1990s, the arthouse darling’s films (such as Raise The Red Lantern and The Story of Qiu Ju) regularly won awards at foreign festivals, even if they were often banned in China. Zhang was gradually brought back into the fold, directing the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Then, in 2013, he was fined more than US$1m for violating China’s one-child policy. One Second seems to have disappeared completely (such disputes can take years to resolve), but Zhang’s career is by no means over. He has other films in the pipeline. “The biggest thing is not the censorship itself; it’s the unpredictability of it,” says Mudge. “The things to avoid are pretty much the same” – chiefly politically sensitive issues such as Mao, Tibet, the Tiananmen Square massacre and Hong Kong democracy – “but if you’re a film-maker or an investor or a producer, and you know that your film could get yanked the day before it’s supposed to be released, even after you’ve spent all your marketing money, it’s a problem.” It is also a problem for Hollywood film-makers, who are effectively playing by the same rules in order to get their product on to China’s screens. In a report last month, PEN America condemned Hollywood’s pro-China self-censorship. “As US film studios compete for the opportunity to access Chinese audiences, many are making difficult and troubling compromises on free expression,” it said. The cravenness could have backfired. The recent controversy over Disney’s Mulan filming in Xinjiang province, where major human rights abuses have taken place against Muslim minorities, led to a media blackout of the film in China, where it was released last weekend. Mulan only just beat The Eight Hundred to the No 1 spot, but its takings are expected to be small. It is dangerous to annoy China’s censors, but it is dangerous to appease them, too. Movie stars find themselves in a similar bind. Mulan star Liu Yifei’s support for Hong Kong police suppressing pro-democracy protests prompted boycotts of Mulan in Hong Kong and Taiwan. But to criticise the Chinese authorities would be career suicide. “It is a hornet’s nest. So why go near it?,” says Yau Yee-ning, a culture reporter based in Beijing. Most stars studiously avoid commenting on anything political, she says, and interviews are carefully controlled. “They have to see the interview questions first, and any they don’t like you have to take out. Any mention of the government or anything a little bit sensitive, they won’t answer it.” Hong Kong’s film industry once dwarfed mainland China’s, but as the balance has shifted, its own stars have been forced to pick sides. Those who have supported Hong Kong democracy have been effectively blacklisted by the Chinese industry, including Chow Yun-fat, Anthony Wong Chau-sang and Chapman To Man-chak. Others, such as Jackie Chan – for decades the global face of Chinese cinema – have sided with the mainland, and against pro-democracy protesters. In 2009, Chan, who has now lived in China for more than a decade, said: “We Chinese need to be controlled. If we’re not being controlled, we’ll just do what we want.” As a result, Chan is now deeply unpopular in Hong Kong, says Yau. “He’s getting more patriotic as the years pass, so Hong Kong people just totally rule him out now, but he’s become an international star so he doesn’t really care.” While the movies are getting bigger and better, China seems to have little interest in exporting its culture. With a home audience of 1.4 billion, the focus is still inward. The Eight Hundred is being released in 33 UK cities and 60 countries worldwide, but none of China’s recent blockbusters has made even 1% of their revenues from foreign sales. For now, it seems, China is happy to be in the position of the soldiers in The Eight Hundred: barricaded in its stronghold, fending off incursions from without, but earning the admiration of the foreigners all the same. Then again, the movie ends with the Chinese soldiers abandoning the Sihang warehouse and the ruins of Shanghai, and crossing the bridge into the bustling, multicultural foreign zone. The symbolism might not be on-message, but this history is still being written.",film
"A great deal of excitement greeted the news, on Tuesday, that Madonna would direct her own biopic, from a screenplay written by the singer with Diablo Cody (Juno, Young Adult). Millions of admirers of the singer’s career as an icon of music and pop culture were joined by dozens of fans of her film career in celebrating the announcement. But what does Madonna helming her own biopic presage for the quality of the movie to come? Initial signs, it must be said, are middling. In producing her own biopic, Madge is joining a recent spate of musical biopics including Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, both of which were produced by their subjects, politely received by critics, in contention for awards, and fared well at the box office. At the start of both films, there were concerns that the movies would lead to a soft-soaping of their subjects: Sacha Baron Cohen quit the Queen movie early on, saying in essence that the film was too much about the success of the band Queen and not enough about Freddie Mercury; he was replaced by Rami Malek, who duly won an Oscar. This stuff pleases the fans, and the acts of mimicry involved invariably lead to plaudits for the actors involved (not least because we all know the celebrities they are imitating, and can therefore easily judge whether the impression is successful), but does it make for great cinema? This writer would argue not. Madonna being so closely involved in the making of her own biopic could go either way: arguably, we might get closer to a full picture of the person behind the fame than ever before, by having her co-write and direct the film; equally, this could lead to an exercise lacking in introspection and self-criticism. The biopic genre hardly flies very high at the best of times: the format lends itself to rather rote storylines revolving around key breakthroughs in the artist’s life, rather than creating a fully artistic proposition, one that might look at the performer from an angle. Not every film should follow this model, of course, but I’m Not There, Todd Haynes’s magnificently awkward look at the life and music of Bob Dylan, was all the more interesting for the way it sidestepped pure facts and splintered the man at its heart into several characters. A further warning sign, of course, comes from Madonna’s previous career in cinema, which has had mixed results to say the least. Though her acting debut in Desperately Seeking Susan met with some enthusiasm, and she won a Golden Globe for Evita, Madonna is also dogged by a kind of cursed reputation as far as film is concerned: she has won a record number of Razzie awards for her onscreen performances in such mediocrities as Who’s That Girl and The Next Best Thing, and her pet project W.E. was savaged by the press. On film Madonna seems to radiate discomfort: she doesn’t lack presence, but she has struggled to commit to a performance, and always seems to come off as more herself than anybody else. There is a paradox here in that Madonna has been probably the most visually arresting artist of her time, and her career and music videos attest to an ability to use pictures really interestingly. She has also shown, famously, an ability to change and reinvent herself over the years, often with the use of the moving image. Directors such as David Fincher, Chris Cunningham and Jonas Åkerlund pop up in her videography; at least three of her music videos (Mary Lambert’s Like a Prayer, Fincher’s Vogue and Cunningham’s Frozen) are iconic works, still known and referenced to this day. All of this, I would argue, bodes rather well for Madonna’s biopic project: her video work, and her efforts to create an iconography of herself, from costumes to her Sex book, are successful because they centre on Madonna herself. For an artist who has always been so resolutely in command of her image, this film offers an opportunity to create a work that adds to her own legacy. It may be that the film we get, while likely to be propagandistic in nature, is madly fascinating in what it reveals of Madonna’s manipulation of image. After all, she is the subject that she knows most about; though her music stays resolutely away from the personal, her videos all centre on herself. That she won’t be acting in this film is a bonus. The film-maker Mark Cousins tweeted about his excitement, adding: “Autobiopics can be great: Jodorowsky, Fellini, Varda, Bill Douglas, Youssef Chahine, Sarah Polley, Joanne Hogg. So many more.” Passing over the fact that these artists had paid their dues as film-makers before getting round to their own lives, there is something to be said for the way the personal can bring out previously unheard of qualities in an artist. Polley’s Stories We Tell is confessional but also slippery, making use of stand-ins and blurring the lines of autofiction: if Madonna uses this as an exercise in myth-building, it may be that her film-making abilities are lifted to new heights.

"I must confess I’ve previously been a little cynical about Toronto international film festival (Tiff) audiences, with their boundless enthusiasm, their jack-in-the-box standing ovations, their need to haul bucket-sized cups of coffee with them everywhere. But gosh, how I miss them this year. The festival in its much reduced Covid-compliant form is a very different beast. The programme is considerably smaller (50 feature films compared with 333 last year) and less starry: the Hollywood studios, which habitually swoop in to test the mettle of their potential awards-contenders, are largely absent. There are no visitors from overseas and just a few physical screenings – in drive-ins, at outdoor screens and socially distanced cinemas in the festival hub. Most of the festival, for most delegates, myself included, has been an entirely digital experience. But while necessary, this mixing up of the formula has served to highlight just what makes Toronto such a vibrant, vital event in more normal times. The lack of the collective sense of discovery is particularly stinging given the fact that there are treasures in the programme that would have been bona fide crowd-pleasers if only there was a crowd to please. Foremost of these is Limbo, the second feature from writer-director Ben Sharrock. Set in the Outer Hebrides, shot in a palette of purgatorial greys and water-logged earth tones, the film brings something of the wryly downbeat humour of Elia Suleiman to this story of asylum seekers, marooned in bureaucracy and stranded on an island while they wait for decisions on their cases. It’s a marvel of tonal dexterity, balancing moments of warmth and humour against stabs of wrenching sadness. In a normal year, this might have prompted post-screening group hugs in the Scotiabank theatre. Traditionally more hug-averse British audiences can catch the film as part of the London film festival programme next month. Also screening in the London programme is Wolfwalkers, a gorgeous animated fantasy set in 17th-century Ireland and created by the team behind The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea. The distinctive animation style, which combines an angularity that evokes the sparse, stylised animals of illustrator Charley Harper with a saturating wash of Celtic mystery, will be familiar to fans of the previous two films. The central theme, which explores the collision between the delicately balanced natural world and the encroaching threat of humanity, has drawn comparisons with Studio Ghibli’s Princess Mononoke. It’s a remarkable work: inventive, agile and driven by the tumbling feral joy of its wolf-girl protagonists. London film festival punters will also get to see another of the most hotly anticipated films of Tiff: a period lesbian romance that unfolds on the drizzly beaches of Lyme Regis, Ammonite is the follow-up to God’s Own Country by Francis Lee. It places Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan (both excellent) in the kind of smouldering but unspoken sexual dynamic that will be familiar to fans of his first feature. The film divided opinion, with some critics put off by the morose dampness of the British seaside backdrop and others thrilled by the picture’s unconventional – and confrontational – depiction of Victorian female sexuality. Relationships come in all shapes and forms at Tiff, but few are as showily chaotic as that of Chloe (Denise Gough) and Mickey (Sebastian Stan) in Argyris Papadimitropoulos’s Monday. I adored this shrapnel-blast of black comedy, which is described by the director as “a romcom gone wrong” – and how! There are moments so mortifying that it hurts to watch (a drug-addled naked moped ride through Athens is real peer-through-the-fingers stuff), but for all the abrasive humour, there’s a kernel of uncomfortable truth lurking in this anti-romance. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the lovely, tentative courtship at the heart of the terrific Palestinian comedy-drama Gaza Mon Amour, by twin brothers Arab and Tarzan Nasser. A 60-year-old fisherman Issa (Salim Dau) is secretly in love with widow Siham (Hiam Abbass), but it’s not until he pulls a very priapic statue of Apollo out of the sea in his net that Issa plucks up the courage to speak to her. Family relationships provide rich material: I particularly enjoyed Concrete Cowboy, in which Idris Elba stars as a member of a real-life community of African American “urban cowboys” who break and ride horses on the streets of north Philadelphia. David Oyelowo’s directorial debut, The Water Man, is a rousing family fantasy adventure that nods to 1980s classics such as Stand By Me. And Cathy Brady’s Wildfire, a tale of sisters set in an Irish border town, is superb: forceful, uncomfortable and fiercely intelligent. And while it might not be the awards launchpad we are used to, Tiff is not without Oscar buzz. One Night in Miami, the feature film directing debut of Regina King, imagines an evening in which real-life friends Cassius Clay, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Malcolm X gather together. King’s deft handling injects energy and urgency into what could have been a wordy collision of egos; it looks like a contender to me. Best feature films Limbo (directed by Ben Sharrock), Wolfwalkers (Tomm Moore, Ross Stewart), Monday (Argyris Papadimitropoulos). Best documentary Enemies of the State, 76 Days. Best performances Nora-Jane Noone and the late Nika McGuigan, Wildfire; Amir El-Masry, Limbo; Shai Avivi, Here We Are; Kingsley Ben-Adir, One Night in Miami. Discovery of the festival Cathy Brady, director of Wildfire. Most resilient hair Chloë Grace Moretz, who remains immaculately coiffed even after dangling from the underside of the wing of a flying plane and fighting a clawed demon in the utterly ludicrous but undeniably entertaining Shadow in the Cloud. Best horse Boo, Concrete Cowboy. Most trenchant political allegory Taiwan’s parliament overrun with zombies in Get the Hell Out; the inherited pain of the Troubles in Wildfire. Most anxiety-inducing moment for germaphobes Kate Winslet pees on the beach, wipes her hands on her skirt and then breaks a pasty in half for Saoirse Ronan in Ammonite.",film
"As a child who grew up in China with little exposure to Disney until I was eight, the idea of a princess marrying a prince and living happily ever after was something entirely foreign. I was more familiar with the fox and snake spirits in Chinese folklore that transformed into beautiful women and sorceresses, and the cross-dressing heroines of wuxia martial-arts TV shows of the 90s. It’s no surprise, then, that Disney’s 1998 film Mulan was more relatable than Sleeping Beauty. Mulan was not only Chinese but had a mission greater than marriage – to save her father and country – and she didn’t need saving herself. For Disney, she was the first “non-princess” who did not end up marrying a prince. It was a mortal’s story: there were no spells or supernatural forces to help her fight her battles, and she did not levitate off rooftops like the wuxia women. Her only celestial remedy was a plump, cheering squad of ancestor spirits and a funny little serpent called Mushu. The emphasis on determination and strength in Disney’s animated Mulan inspired girls like me to work harder and be braver. Her story defied Chinese ideals, which for most of history held up fragility and weakness as the essence of beauty. From the frail and often sick Lin Daiyu in the great Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber to the deformities of “bound feet” that stopped upper-class women walking, patriarchal society had long-fetishised the physically compromised woman. Twenty years on and amid a resurgence of traditional notions of beauty and femininity in east Asia, the live-action Mulan was a chance for Disney to reinvent its “princess” once again and bring to life a mighty Asian warrior. But any hopes I had for a more progressive-looking action heroine were dashed after watching Liu Yifei fail to deliver the physical and emotional realities of being the only female soldier fighting in a man’s war and having to work 10 times harder – a theme, unsurprisingly, relevant today. Her physique is daintier than Zhang Ziyi’s in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon – whose portrayal of a female warrior was itself considered a way to “feminise and glamorise the martial arts” – and the endless flash-cuts to her stunt double during fight sequences also leaves the audience wondering why there was little effort to train her up for the role, fitting in with Mulan’s own transformation from weaver girl to warrior. The truth is that in an industry where “the thinner the better” goes without saying, bulking her up for the part could have had a detrimental effect on Liu’s chances of getting other roles in the Chinese film industry. It also raises the question of whether she was chosen purely as a “vase”, a Chinese term used for someone with a purely decorative effect. With Disney anxious to please the Chinese audience, producers were clearly keen to keep up Mulan’s porcelain perfection throughout the film, ensuring that her large wavy curls blew romantically over her untanned and only slightly soiled complexion. Looking dark isn’t a popular aesthetic in east Asia. Contrast this to Zhao Wei’s 2009 portrayal of Mulan, which more closely resembles a hardy, wartorn soldier. The homogeneity that such narrow standards of beauty have spawned in young Chinese performers is disturbingly striking. From martial arts shows like Eternal Love to fantasy dramas like Love O2O (both available on Netflix) the trend has shifted away from real women’s bodies towards a distinctly thinner, fairer, more schoolgirl-like appearance. A few years ago, a Beijing film director told me that going under the knife had become a rite of passage for aspiring actresses. Facial contouring surgery that shaves the jaw bone to achieve a slimmer, “v-shaped” face has also become popular and has made Seoul a mecca for plastic surgery. Such images have already fuelled a generation of women in pursuit of extreme “waif-like” aesthetics with a loathing for muscle definition. A 2018 paper found that among thousands of female university students, 27% were found to be underweight (classified as having a BMI below 18.5) because of an “ultra-thin ideal” and that the problem was potentially more severe in China than the west. It’s frustrating enough when the Asian entertainment industry propagates such unrealistic images of women’s bodies. When Disney panders to it and projects it to a global audience, it sends the message that looking like a Disney heroine will forever be more achievable than becoming one. Mulan was a chance for Disney to show Asian girls that they could be beautiful and strong at the same time, that there were no shortcuts or stand-in doubles in real life, but they too could join the army or pursue sports and be proud of the muscles they build. For now, you’re better off rewatching the animated Disney version, which will inspire you to dream big.",film
"Time travel has come a long way in a short time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Bruce Banner’s ham-fisted dabbling at the beginning of Avengers: Endgame swiftly quantum-leaping into Iron Man’s full-blown invention of functioning technology mid-way through the penultimate film of the studio’s phase three. But, with the news that Jonathan Majors has been cast as Kang the Conqueror in the forthcoming Ant-Man 3, it’s all about to get even stranger than Scott Lang zipping from the quantum zone to discover his underwear has inexplicably been soiled by his six-month-old self. Kang has the potential to connect the Avengers (or what’s left of them) to myriad other inhabitants of the comic-book world that we haven’t yet seen in the MCU, some of them primed and ready for inclusion following Disney’s takeover of 20th Century Fox. That’s because the supervillain has hopped in and out of multiple time lines from the ancient Egyptian era to the 3oth century, and even as far as the 40th century, like a cross between Zebedee from the Magic Roundabout and Doctor Who, finding ways to mix with the likes of the X-Men, Fantastic Four and even the Young Avengers along the way. How Ant-Man 3 director Peyton Reed deals with him remains to be seen, but Kang could easily be up there with Ultron and Thanos in terms of his impact on the next reel of Marvel movies. The fact he is being introduced in an Ant-Man movie also places Paul Rudd’s size-shifting superhero centre stage, on the mic, as far as the future of the MCU is concerned. In the comics, Kang is originally 3oth-century scholar Nathaniel Richards who discovers time travel technology invented by Doctor Doom (in his own past) and uses it to wreak havoc. (It’s possible Marvel will go a different route here, given Tony Stark is, as far as we know, the inventor of time travel in the MCU.) Perhaps the most intriguing version of the supervillain, as far as the current state of play in the post-Avengers universe goes, is the iteration who travelled back in time (in a 2005 comic-book run) to try to avoid his own nefarious future by becoming a hero instead. Once in the modern day, Richards renamed himself Iron Lad and set about helping to create the Young Avengers, a team of fledgling costumed crimefighters with links to the original team of Earth’s mightiest heroes. This was possible because the Avengers themselves had effectively disbanded, a situation conveniently mirroring that of the current movie universe. Iron Lad even romanced Ant-Man’s daughter, the superhero Stature, before being attacked by his future villain self, who turned out to be none too pleased with his youthful alter ego’s shift to the light. This could turn out to be a useful narrative line for Ant-Man 3, as Stature in the comics is the alter ego of Scott Lang’s daughter Cassie (who conveniently just aged up to a teenager during the mind-boggling events of Endgame). If that all sounds more complicated than Brexit, suffice to say that, by the end of this particular chapter, there’s also a path towards the resurrection of Paul Bettany’s Vision, one of only a handful of MCU superheroes not to make it back after Thanos’s dastardly behaviour in Infinity War. That’s if Scarlet Witch hasn’t already done the business via the forthcoming Disney+ show WandaVision. However Kang finds his way into the MCU, it will be the supervillain’s hectic time-travelling shenanigans that make him interesting. Leaping through the centuries is as much a part of the Kang DNA as binary-inspired mass murder is to Thanos, or wreaking robo-justice on mankind is to Ultron. Remove time travel from the equation and he’s just another blue-skinned, ornately-apparelled, helmet-bonced bad guy. If Marvel Studios sticks with the idea that Doom invented time travel, Kang’s introduction could be even more momentous. Perhaps Kang defeated Doom, stole his technology and wiped him from the timeline, setting up Stark as the new inventor of time travel. In this instance, the finale of Ant-Man could see the gauntlet-wielding supervillain taking his revenge and entering the picture. Maybe he even brings a version of the Fantastic Four that doesn’t make fans of the comic books want to eat their own kidneys out of the void with him.",film
"A monsoon of musical and sexual rapture bursts overhead in this film from director Steve McQueen, leaving condensation-sweat running down the walls and my cinematic pleasure going through the roof. It is co-scripted by McQueen with the writer and musician Courttia Newland, superbly designed by Helen Scott and gorgeously shot by Shabier Kirchner: a novella-sized feature that is part of an interrelating five-film series by McQueen called Small Axe for the BBC. Lovers Rock is an amazing, real-time urban pastoral, set in Ladbroke Grove, west London, over a single evening at a house party in 1980. Young people of first- and second-generation West Indian background show up – handing over a 50p entry fee on the door, paying extra for food and drink from the kitchen, lining up on the stairs for the lavatory, hanging out on the sofas dragged out into the back garden for intimate interludes, and dancing for hours in a rammed front room to the sound system’s sternum-shuddering lover’s rock, soul and reggae. This single night ignites a constellation of sexual sparks in its indoor cosmos, the traditional unspoken eddies of romantic disappointment, same-sex frissons, eruptions of family resentment, violent crises and an extraordinary, building musical euphoria. Lovers Rock is a cine-tab of MDMA, which through continuous immersion gradually, for me, ascended to something like an out-of-body experience. (It really needs to be seen on the big screen.) It’s a case of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning But Mostly Saturday Night. With creative audacity and clarity, McQueen hits the movie equivalent of the impossibly sweet high note that Janet Kay finds at the end of her 1979 track Silly Games, which this film showcases irresistibly. Yet for all the hedonism, there are darker undercurrents, at one remove: a brush with racism and sexual assault. McQueen and Newland leave it up to us to register the tacit associations with the violence that was, historically, soon to follow: the riots, the (still unsolved) New Cross fire. Amarah-Jae St Aubyn makes a great acting debut as Martha, nervously excited about going to the party with her friend Patty, played by Shaniqua Okwok. McQueen’s choreography shows how once there, they have to negotiate their position, judge their status, assess the possibilities, and deal with the gallantries offered by various men. Chief among these is Franklyn (Micheal Ward) and his friend Reggie (Francis Lovehall). It is Franklyn who looks to be the winner in the great game of love over the course of this night, which, in the mysterious zero-sum economy of fate, means that someone else has to be the loser, and that looks like being Patty, discontented with what’s happening for her. Everything and nothing seems to be happening in this film. It is dominated by that one continuous eardrum-melting party scene, which in a more conventional type of drama might have been a sequence lasting five minutes or so at the beginning, and – who knows? – Lovers Rock might yet turn out to serve this function in the Small Axe pentalogy as a whole. The film just offers up a continuous, non-narrative stream of fascination and pleasure in the dance scenes; it is pure intravenous atmosphere, and you are put right in the middle of the dancing, in the sweat and the music and the indoor cigarette smoke. I especially loved it when the DJ put on Carl Douglas’s Kung Fu Fighting and all the dancers, as excited as little kids, assume martial-arts poses. (I can’t help remembering Enter the Dragon from this period with Bruce Lee’s unforgettable demand to his pupil: “We need emotional content!” This film has got just that: emotional content.) And from this extended bacchanal a love story floats free: a pairing that is finally to take us, disorientatingly, outside the party to the Sunday-morning daylight and the wider world in which the characters have to show us their mastery of code-switching and whitespeak and the superhuman energy levels involved in going straight from the party to church. McQueen’s compositional sense is a marvel; the movie’s period and location is evoked with masterly skill, and the romance is wonderful. What a cure for lockdown depression.",film
"There’s a fine line, tonally, between knowing and smug, a line that writer-director Josh Ruben’s ambitiously contained comedy horror Scare Me treads precariously, its story of storytellers telling stories to scare each other almost stumbling over its own ego. But while there are lapses, an overindulgence here and there, Ruben mostly keeps his canny debut feature afloat and us entertained, if not exactly scared … Ruben plays Fred, a bitter 37-year-old frustrated by the fact that his desire to be a writer isn’t quite matched with his actual talent as a writer, hoping that a weekend away at a remote cabin in the Catskills might turn one of his ideas into something tangible. But he can’t move past a hokey logline (werewolves have guns … get revenge?) and his block is further compounded when he bumps into another writer also staying in the area. But the smart, sharp-tongued Fanny (Aya Cash) is a real writer, with a bestselling novel and all, and her success makes Fred feel even more of a failure. Later that evening, during a freak power outage, Fanny turns up on Fred’s doorstep and the two hunker down together, resentment brewing. To fill the time, Fanny comes up with an idea: they will take it in turn to tell scary stories to show off their creative abilities. Fred reluctantly agrees and the night starts to unravel. With such a premise, one might expect a horror anthology, the pair’s unlikely game acting as a framing device for a triptych of separate tales, but given the subgenre’s overexposure in the last decade and how miss-and-hit it so often is, it’s a relief that Ruben keeps us trapped in the cabin with them. It’s up to Fred and Fanny not only to construct their stories but to perform them effectively, a test of acting skills for both Ruben and Cash as well as patience for those with little tolerance for sitting on what closely resembles an actors’ workshop. It’s another fine line to be toed but the pair prove mostly adept at commanding the room as well as providing snarky pointers for each other, an uneasy tension expanding by the minute. The late inclusion of a third wheel (SNL’s Chris Redd playing a horror-loving pizza delivery guy) doesn’t really add much but as the film continues, it becomes clear that simply scaring and amusing us isn’t all that Ruben has on his mind. The character of Fred, who positions himself as a bookish liberal hipster, is quietly angry with a world that’s not given him the opportunities he feels he deserves while Fanny, a woman, has excelled in a way that he could only dream of (she brags that her hit novel is loved by the Guardian, no less). He’s the worst kind of toxic male, the kind who thinks a flannel shirt and a Rachel Yamagata playlist makes him woke, yet buried not far beneath the surface is a familiar stench of incensed entitlement that has him raging at Fanny’s success. How dare she when he hasn’t? Or even worse, how dare she when he can’t? While Fanny might make the odd, deserving jab at Fred’s predicament, she’s mostly encouraging (“Do the work!” she keeps saying) but the good gets buried by Fred’s inadequacy, and as beer and cocaine cloud the lines between fiction and reality, things go downhill. I’d argue that the road to violence could have been a bit shorter, Ruben allowing a little too much flab in what should be a lean little tale, its 104-minute runtime needing some snips to feel snappier. But it works for the most part because of Ruben and Cash and the spiky chemistry they share. Cash, who was a dimmed light in the obnoxiously eye-rolling sitcom You’re the Worst, is having a moment right now, with a deliciously vile performance in The Boys and now this, deftly flipping between light and dark by the minute, a confident, calculated turn that made me curious what she’d be like on stage, the whole film itself feeling more like a production adapted for the screen. While Scare Me doesn’t actually end up scaring us (the stories being told are more “Oh, OK” than “AGH, OK!”), Ruben’s tricky, goofy hybrid does just about enough for that not to really matter, its cabin-fire playfulness proving contagious, a nasty game we might not want to play but will happily watch instead.",film
"As rumours go, the one this week that Nicolas Cage might end up starring as Superman in Warner Bros’ Flash movie takes some beating. There’s every chance it was dreamed up to create waves in the blogosphere on a slow news day. Yet it is tantalising nonetheless, largely because this is just the sort of role no other actor in Hollywood but Cage would take on. He is, after all, the actor who felt he was perfect for the role of Kal-El in Tim Burton’s abortive Superman Lives, despite all evidence to the contrary. The excellent 2015 documentary The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened? even unearthed footage of the actor in costume, revealing a version of the last son of Krypton resembling a cross between Alice Cooper and an extra from Rollerball. And yet herein lies even more plausibility, for we already know The Flash is set to star Burton’s Batman, Michael Keaton, as a version of the caped crusader who Barry Allen meets after crossing into an alternative reality. Given that Superman Lives would have connected to Burton’s Batman films, why shouldn’t Burton’s Superman also appear? The famously comic-book-crazy Cage would surely take this role in a second. He jumped at the chance to voice Superman in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies (2018) and did an excellent imitation of Adam West-era Batman as Big Daddy in Kick-Ass (2010). Never mind that in the comics Superman is shown to be eternally in his 20s or early 30s (thanks to his Kryptonian near-immortality), the 56-year-old Cage would still play him in a heartbeat. The next question, of course, is whether we want him to. There is surely going to come a point in Andy Muschietti’s 2022 film where abundant stunt casting starts to unbalance the narrative. This movie already has Ben Affleck as (another version of) Batman, and there are even suggestions that Christian Bale, Val Kilmer and George Clooney could be asked to return. Suddenly this looks less like an intriguing big-screen adaptation of the bravura 2011 Flash graphic novel Flashpoint, in which Allen breaks the multiverse after using time travel to save his mother’s life, and a lot more like the superhero equivalent of the rather rubbish 1967 James Bond comedy version of Casino Royale, in which seven different versions of 007 appear, including Woody Allen as “Little Jimmy Bond”. There is surely such a thing as too much fan service, and, in any case, it ought to be hard to track down more than a handful of fans worldwide who really want to see Kilmer or Clooney as the caped crusader again. On the other hand, this is Hollywood we are talking about, an industry that almost waved through Superman Lives, a movie about a long-haired, emo man of steel that would have climaxed with a scene in which Kal-El fights a giant spider. And it is Warner Bros/ DC we are talking about, the studio that green-lit Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), a slice of celluloid garbage so pungently rotten that the whiff is still detectable four years later. And yet maybe they could pull this thing off. The Flash could be a car crash waiting to happen, but there is still the nagging temptation to take a quick peek through your fingers at the inevitable, horrifying carnage. As screenwriter Kevin Smith said of Superman Lives: “Now when you think about it, if somebody was to say, ‘Would you like to see a Nic Cage Superman movie?’ I’d be like, ‘Yes, take all my money cos I want to see what that looks like.’”",film
"‘Lockdown has done wonders for me,” says Paul Cronin with a laugh. An English film-maker who lives in New York, he had been working off and on for 14 years on A Time to Stir, a documentary about the 1968 student uprising at Columbia University. Then, after the killing of George Floyd in May, Cronin’s Greenwich Village neighbourhood was transformed. Protesters marched through its streets, statues were defaced, the windows of galleries and banks were smashed, police cars were torched, helicopters roared night and day. It was an extended moment of rebellion and release, terror and possibility. “I’m watching what’s going on from my window and taking lots of late-night walks through Washington Square with all the wildness and craziness going on there.” Struck by the parallels between the archival footage on his computer screen and present-day convulsions, he went into overdrive, only coming up for air after he had completed the film. To describe A Time to Stir as an epic work is something of an understatement: it is 15 hours long, made up from more than 700 interviews that run to 2,500 hours. Cronin collected 35,000 photographs, almost none of which had ever been seen before. Part of what the film chronicles is well-known: campus leftists taking over key university buildings to protest against its role in conducting research that enabled US bombing campaigns in Vietnam. They took an acting dean hostage and occupied the president’s office, where they found cigars with his name engraved in gold. Their insurgency, before it was violently broken up by police, attracted the likes of Abbie Hoffman, the Grateful Dead, Noam Chomsky and poet Robert Lowell, all of whom showed up to signal their support. But Cronin’s film also shines a spotlight on a crucial, but far less celebrated, part of the story: the resistance of a cadre of pioneering black students who were indignant that Columbia, having purchased lots of nearby real estate, immediately reduced the number of housing units available to low-income residents. Worse, it had taken over a city-owned park where, against the wishes of locals in nearby Harlem, it planned to build a five-storey gymnasium with separate entrances for students and non-students. These decisions were seen as social cleansing, a form of expropriation not unconnected with what the US was doing in south-east Asia. Many of the black students thought their white peers were showy and tactically naive. “They were just talking politics,” claims Arnim Johnson, one of Cronin’s interviewees. “It’s a rap session, and then they want to do singalongs!” The relatively novel presence of black students at the university might have assured Columbia’s administrators they were in the civil rights vanguard, but many of the students saw it differently: they recall receiving lighter workloads than their white peers, being astonished at the lack of black faculty members or black history classes and feeling upset at getting stopped regularly by security guards. They were at once hyper-visible and invisible. They knew they had more opportunities – for success, for upward mobility – than their friends and family members back home. They also knew about dogs and whippings and beatings: this made them reluctant to be as showily combative as some of their white classmates. According to Manning Marable, who, before his death in 2011, was a professor of African American studies at Columbia: “The white radicals did not deconstruct white privilege in their own lives.” In the end, those white students were asked to leave Hamilton Hall, the first building to have been collectively occupied. This led to other campus sites, including Low Library where the president had his offices, being targeted by white demonstrators instead. Creating multiple fronts for protesters made it harder to disperse them, but it disappointed those who thought pan-racial unity would be easy to achieve. “In every beat of this film, one sees how different the world looked to black and to white students – and how they handled themselves in the circumstances,” says Cronin. “The entire thing happened because black students decided to throw white students out. They did not want to be out with them. Black students had thought about these issues for years in a way that white students had not.” Coalitional politics, the art of “allyship”, the intersection between race and class: these are controversial topics today. How is it, I ask Cronin, that even though there is a mini-industry dedicated to 1968-ist commemoration, the voices – yet alone contributions – of black students are so hard to make out? “It’s funny. I was asked recently: ‘Paul, how did you get the African American students to talk?’ I replied: ‘I just asked them!’ No one had ever asked them before! They were more than happy to talk. And what they remembered was very important. They told the white protesters: you’re not going to smash up Hamilton Hall. You’re going to leave it cleaner than when you arrived. You’re spilling your shit? You’re dropping your dope on the floor? You’re having a good time? You think this is theatre? No – for us black students, this is not theatre.” To think of Columbia 1968 purely in terms of black and white would be a mistake. One element of its story that Cronin brings to the fore is the importance of Jewish students. They were white, but non-white. Historically, like their black classmates, they had been treated as second-class presences. But by the 1960s, says Carl Gettleman, who helped occupy Low Library, Columbia had begun to resemble a Jewish Ivy League college: “It was in New York, and if a preppy guy went there, he was probably a loser, because if he was a winner he went to Harvard, Yale or Princeton.” According to Cronin, the incoming Jews knew all about alienation and annihilation. “Many of those that arrived on campus in 1964 and 1965 had watched the Nuremberg trials on TV when they were teenagers. Mike Locker [a student activist who published the power-structure pamphlet Who Rules Columbia?] told me: ‘If you take Nuremberg seriously, then you see that if there’s a crime being committed by your country, it’s your obligation to intervene and object.’ These were the children of Holocaust survivors and they had a hunger for justice. A lot of them were ‘red-diaper babies’; their parents were very left-wing and often lower class. Even if they were secular, they had grown up being told stories about Cossack atrocities by their grandparents.” Cronin, who grew up in London, but has dual citizenship through his American mother, says he can barely remember a time when he was not drawn to the febrile politics of the US in the late 60s. “I recently found a cassette of a Radio 4 programme about the 20th anniversary of 1968. I was only 15 when I made it!” In the past, he has collaborated on book projects with Werner Herzog and co-translated the poetry of the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, but the dominant influence on A Time to Stir is that of British TV documentaries. He says: “I grew up watching a lot of Brook Lapping series [the widely respected production company run by Brian Lapping and Norma Percy]: End of Empire, Watergate, The Death of Yugoslavia. I liked the way they took their time, moved chronologically through epic, complex histories, and showed testimonials from incredible eyewitnesses.” Perhaps unusually, Cronin does not talk about his film as being partisan or primarily activist. “There’s another Brook Lapping series, The Fifty Years War (1998) – it’s in six parts and about the Middle East, but I’ve been told it has been used in both Israeli and Palestinian schools. With A Time to Stir, I wanted it to be as fair and balanced as possible. There was no point in making it if we couldn’t hear from both the red bandana-wearing Maoists and the cops who beat them that night.” He was also keen to capture stories before it was too late. “I met a guy who told me that after his mother died, he’d thrown away countless rolls of 16mm film he’d shot of the campus protests. These stories are like knives to the heart. I have the historian’s dread of the dumpster.” The historical value of Cronin’s work became apparent this summer when William Barr, Donald Trump’s widely detested attorney general, gave an interview to the New York Times in which he claimed to have been on the “jock line” in 1968. “This was a bunch of conservative students who took offence at the radicals occupying the buildings. They felt the administration was not being sufficiently gung ho and decided to take matters into our own hands. They physically surrounded Low Library and wouldn’t let food in our out. It was all a bit theatrical. “Barr said he saw 12 people end up in hospital after a fist fight. I thought: that never happened! I’ve talked to enough people and seen enough footage. No one went to hospital that day. A Washington Post editorial used my film to discuss how a big part of the Barr story is essentially about the manipulation of memory. A few weeks ago, Barr was testifying in front of Jerry Nadler, a Democratic congressman who was also at Columbia in 1968. They were arguing about whether it was right to crack down on protesters in Portland. There’s a sense that we’re still fighting the culture wars of 1968.” Frank Guridy, an associate professor of African American studies at Columbia, teaches a class on the same topic as Cronin’s film. He, too, has been pondering its relevance today. “Columbia fashions itself as an activist Ivy. It at least tolerates student activism. It’s part of the brand in some ways. Many of the people here have very little awareness of what happened here at Columbia in the 60s and 70s. But because of Trumpism, climate catastrophe, the police brutalisation happening every single day and everywhere in this country, my students completely get the political imperatives that were driving the black protesters back then. They are feeling an emperilment that is very similar to what was happening 50 years ago. And with the university buying up parcels of land around Harlem’s West 125th Street, there are still the same questions about Columbia’s imperial relationship to its surrounding community and the social displacements it instigates.” I tell Cronin that, for me, the most telling sections of his film concern the white students discovering how intentionally violent and conspiratorial the police could be. “It’s so relevant, isn’t it? So many interviewees told me how terrified they were. They never thought it could happen to them. They had heard about police violence, but never witnessed it personally. And then, when they did, in the words of one person I talked to: ‘We had the dust of radicalism sprinkled on us that night.’ Poof! Bam! That was it! In all sorts of vexed but profound ways, the events at Columbia in spring 1968 set them on a path to thinking about the world differently, how best to work with people from different backgrounds, how to make the world a different place.” A Time to Stir is on Vimeo from 1 October",film
"Hammy and stagey and campy it might be, but The Boys in the Band turns out to have a fiercely watchable soap-operatic intensity, a sustained attack of telenovela craziness, culminating in a full-on anxiety attack from its leading character. It’s based on the 1968 off-Broadway hit by Mart Crowley (who died in March this year) about a group of gay men in New York gathering for a birthday party in an era before Stonewall, before Aids, a time when metropolitan sophisticates sort of tolerated “swishiness” in the bohemian arts scene, and when Gore Vidal was saying, pour épater les bourgeois, that there were homosexual acts but no homosexual people. The play was turned into a film directed by William Friedkin in 1970 and the title is taken from the line in A Star Is Born (1954), when James Mason tells Judy Garland: “You’re singing for yourself and the boys in the band.” Now there is a new version: sleeker and smoother than Friedkin’s, from actor turned director Joe Mantello, and produced for Netflix by Ryan Murphy, whose  miniseries, Hollywood, featured Mantello in an acting role. Jim Parsons plays Michael, a semi-employed writer and closet Catholic worried about money, God and his receding hairline. A former hookup called Donald (Matt Bomer) has come to help him throw a birthday party for a friend in Michael’s exotically bijou apartment (like somewhere Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly might live). The festivities are in honour of ad-man Harold, an outrageously louche and dyspeptic performance from Zachary Quinto. Among the other guests, Hank (Tuc Watkins) is a straight-seeming guy who is leaving his wife and kids to be with Larry (Andrew Rannells), whose promiscuities are driving him crazy. Robin de Jesús is the uproariously queeny designer Emory and Michael Benjamin Washington is an African American student called Bernard. From the very first, there is no relaxation among these people. They seem more like frenemies than friends and there’s a constant static crackle of brittle bitchiness in the air, particularly between Michael and Harold, who in theory should be the most intimate. The atmosphere is even tenser when Michael’s old college roommate phones him out of the blue in a state of near emotional breakdown. This is Alan (Brian Hutchinson), a supposedly happily married heterosexual and family man, who then shows up uninvited; he is disgusted by the open queeniness, but has other more complex emotions as well. The look and feel of The Boys in the Band are different from, say, TV’s 1960s drama Mad Men, whose closet gay designer Salvatore famously leaves his wife and disappears into Central Park. The issues and themes have not been processed and repackaged in the same ironised, indirect way. We are basically getting something direct from 1968. We are drinking it neat, and, although it might seem dated, it is still challenging in 2020 to see a play or movie in which all the characters are gay. These men all gather together like suspects in an Agatha Christie mystery. But there is no mystery, not even, arguably, with Alan. The main event comes with a bizarre and emotionally sadistic game that Michael makes everyone play, when they are sufficiently drunk and overexcited. Each has to phone up the one person from their past with whom they first fell in love, and are still secretly in love. It sounds like a contrived and melodramatic premise for big speeches and flashbacks and that’s precisely what it is. And yet it delivers a punch, simply for being so vehement, so anguished and angered. There are quite a few arch wisecracks. “That’s the pot calling the kettle beige,” drawls Harold, and a weary Michael at one stage confesses: “That’s one thing you can say for masturbation: you don’t have to look your best.” The Boys in the Band appears to come from a more innocent, or at least more naive time, as yet politically unradicalised by Aids and the backlash of homophobia, when the issue was acceptance, a goal that seemed to be matter of gradually changing taste. But it’s still refreshing to watch something which is, after all, a film of ideas, a spectacle in which people speak to each other in extended paragraphs. It is all unexpectedly potent, particularly in the absurdity and petulance and pain that Parsons crams into his performance. It’s a strange, compelling dose of unhappiness.",film
"If James Cameron’s Avatar were a pop song it would be Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, an epic concoction that brings immense joy the first time it is experienced but eventually becomes nulled by its cultural ubiquity. Or perhaps Spaceman by Babylon Zoo, a startlingly popular effort that never got the follow-up it required to make its creator anything more than a cosmic one-hit wonder. Or so we might have thought until this week, when Cameron emerged from the creeping cobwebs of time to announce (to Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less), that Avatar parts 2 and 3 are almost ready. Avatar 2, apparently, is done and dusted, while Avatar 3 is “sort of 95% complete”. We have heard similar rumblings of activity many times over the past decade since the second-highest-grossing movie of all time hit cinemas. That was, of course, a different era: a time when cinema-goers were still excited by the prospect of watching a movie in 3D, and would happily pay through the teeth to do so. It was also before holes the size of the Grand Canyon were picked in Avatar’s plot and it was pointed out that its extraterrestrial setup was a thinly veiled white-saviour narrative and that Cameron had taken most of the story from Ferngully: The Last Rainforest – or was it Dances With Wolves? Avatar has suffered since its 2009 debut because it became not just a successful Hollywood film but the future of Hollywood itself. Its grand scale and ambition meant that every other science fiction movie was judged against it, and often found wanting. Inevitably, this led to Cameron’s radical space adventure being held not just as a cheery two-hours-plus cosmic knockabout to keep the kids entertained, but as a hubristic sci-fi attempt to Answer All Mankind’s Problems. The film-maker has not helped matters by going all Bono on us and trying to insist that the movie’s depiction of human exploitation of Pandora’s natural resources is a powerful commentary on Earth’s impending environmental apocalypse. Nothing wrong with that, you might say, except that David Attenborough does a much better job without employing a gaggle of giant blue space elves to get his message across. Putting all this aside, Avatar remains very watchable. There are freaky yet relatively novel sci-fi concepts: the use of alien bodies that can somehow be inhabited and taken over by humans, even if the whole idea is a little bit icky. Cameron’s vision of Pandoran flora is like a Hawkwindesque fever dream: not since Silent Running (1972) has there been a science fiction movie so fascinated with cool alien plants. And that’s before we even start mentioning the far-out Na’avi themselves, or the many strange, six-legged beasties they interact with via those swishy, USB-optimised tails. Stephen Lang’s Colonel Miles Quaritch is a brilliant baddie, even if Cameron did plagiarise his own Aliens for Avatar’s climactic exo-suit battle. The Canadian film-maker has confirmed the seemingly dead Quaritch will be back (somehow) in the sequels, which will see Sam Worthington’s Jake Sully and Zoe Saldana’s Neytiri travel to other regions of Pandora. Avatar 2 (now due on 16 December 2022) will have a special focus on water realms, with Kate Winslet set to play a free-diving member of a new reef-dwelling Na’avi tribe called the Metkayina. It all sounds suitably intriguing, provided part deux turns out to be a cosmic take on The Abyss rather than Waterworld in space. And it remains to be seen if Avatar’s 11-year absence will inspire new fervour for its sequels, or whether all that time away means Cameron has rather missed the boat.",film
"In On the Rocks, a new movie by Sofia Coppola starring Rashida Jones and Bill Murray, the city of New York appears in what was until recently its customary guise. The bars and restaurants are full, the streets are crowded, and in every scene, New Yorkers breathe on one another with outlandish abandon. “It’s a weird time to celebrate anything,” says Jones, down the line from LA, but there is something about the movie, in which she plays a thirtysomething woman whose life is in freefall, that feels like a tribute to a vanished world. “I had a child and lost my mom in the same period [as filming], and was in very amorphous emotional shape,” she says. That sense of limbo imbues every frame. The film unspools with the dreamlike pace of a Michael Cunningham novel, while Murray’s sardonic wit saves it – as in his previous collaboration with Coppola, Lost in Translation – from ponderousness. The surprise, to the uninitiated, is Jones, who at 44 is at the height of her professional powers, an actor who after years of playing supporting roles in shows such as Parks and Recreation and The Office, assumes the lead with a frank, amused intelligence that reminds us she is a writer as much as an actor. As Laura, she plays a mother of young children who becomes convinced her husband is having an affair, moving between shades of despair, panic and incredulous disapproval, brought on largely by the efforts of her rakish dad – Murray’s Felix – to prove her husband’s villainy. Felix is a charming chauvinist, the kind of formerly lovable rogue who these days would wind up on a word-of-mouth spreadsheet circulating among women who have worked with him. “Those long monologues about why men are attracted to young women?” says Jones. “It’s very hard to pull off in a way that makes you not want to vomit. That’s precisely why it could only be Bill.” Jones knows a few things about charming fathers with outsized personalities. Her dad is the songwriting legend Quincy Jones; her mother was the actor Peggy Lipton, who died in May last year, less than a year after the birth of Jones’s son with Vampire Weekend musician Ezra Koenig. It was a strange experience, says Jones, trying to focus on acting through all this, although in an odd way she found it suited her state of mind. In the case of both grief and new motherhood, “it takes so long before you remember who you are”, that you inhabit an indeterminacy “that is probably good for acting? Maybe not for other jobs, and definitely not for writing. But I didn’t know if I was coming or going, which was the perfect place for me to be, with filming.” This is, perhaps, a mark of the fact she cares less about acting than writing, or rather sees the latter as a refuge from and rebuke to the frustrations and inadequacies of the former. As a child, Jones never wanted to be an actor. Her parents raised her and Kidada, her older sister, in California, in what she now thinks of as a halcyon period in which they were encouraged to follow their own interests. “I never felt pushed in one direction in terms of career, or subjects in school, or friend groups, or anything. I felt they were just kind of amused by me and happy to have me around,” she says. “I probably have a bit of a golden wash over my childhood, but my parents did a good job of really creating this little micro-universe for me to thrive in.” The result was that Jones went to Harvard to study philosophy and religion, and wanted to be a lawyer before she joined various student theatrical societies and discovered a love of performing. What she did not love, however, was the world of professional acting after graduation, which entailed more time spent “making sure you get to the audition place without sweating off your face on the subway” than delivering lines, and partly due to the inevitable years of grinding through bad material. “You have to do a good job with lines that are not all that great, for a part that you may not want. It’s a long time before you get to do something like work with Sofia, or write something for yourself, or work with David Fincher.” In 2010, Jones appeared in The Social Network, the Fincher-directed biopic of Mark Zuckerberg, but it would be another two years before she won a lead role – in the comedy-drama Celeste and Jesse Forever – and that was in a movie she had written herself. Writing was always a refuge, she says, a way to claw control back from an industry in which young female actors have little say over how they appear. “Acting is hard because you’re being told ‘no’ all the time, which is so demoralising, and then, God forbid you should have any standards about the kind of work you should be doing. You’re not saying yes; people are saying yes to you and you’re at somebody else’s whim all the time.” It was lovely, she says, to be at Coppola’s whim, but early on in her acting career, Jones realised it wasn’t for her, at least not full-time. “There are actors who love the craft of it so much that the other stuff disappears for them. Those are the people who are perfectly suited for the job. But if you can’t feel satisfied with just that, then you are going to end up feeling a bit lost.” Not that writing isn’t without its frustrations. Celeste and Jesse Forever was the first screenplay Jones and her writing partner, Will McCormack, had ever finished, a pitch-perfect comedy that, after an initial bidding war over the script, took two years to get made after three successive companies that bought it went bust. In 2016, Jones wrote an episode of season three of Black Mirror. (It was Nosedive, the brilliant episode directed by Joe Wright in which a woman called Lacie loses her temper and triggers a terrifying domino-run of bad personal ratings online that eventually ruins her life.) A year later, Jones and McCormack joined the writing team for Toy Story 4, both leaving the project before completion, citing a culture at Pixar where “where women and people of colour do not have an equal creative voice”. It was a brave move, echoed two years later when Emma Thompson wrote an open letter explaining her resignation from the animated movie Luck, after the production hired John Lasseter, a former head of Pixar who is dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct. “Her letter was brilliant,” says Jones, who found herself able to speak out in similar terms because of what she calls her “good sense of self” and an upbringing in which politics were important. “My parents were an interracial couple living in California in the 70s. Loving v Virginia passed in 1967, before which it was illegal for a black and white person to get married – six years before they had my sister.” Her parents had an idea of the value of raising kids in a diverse community and “had friends of all different backgrounds, and ethnicities, and the thing they had in common was the love of being creative”. It still took a while for her to find her voice. “I think, like so many women in Hollywood, you grow to accept a level of discomfort around work, and especially with men, that is not OK. We just accept that that’s the way the business is and that there is something inherently sexist in Hollywood going back to Fatty Arbuckle. I think every actress would say there’s been a time or moment when they didn’t quite feel comfortable. Earlier in my career, I wouldn’t have said anything and I didn’t say anything.” As she got older, however, she felt increasingly that “it’s important for me to challenge my assumptions around authority, and equality, and where I’m ‘allowed’ to speak up and admit that I’m not comfortable in situations”. One of these was working for Pixar, a company that suffered “from deep, systemic intolerance, or top-heavy patriarchy, or top-heavy whiteness, in a way that has informed the things that they’ve made, and the way they hire and promote people. It looks like Pixar is trying to promote more female directors and to have more directors of colour. But at the same time it’s appalling that, out of 20-odd movies, one was directed by a woman – and she was fired! [Brenda Chapman, halfway through making Brave.] That’s not a mistake; it happens through complacency, and I felt the need to plainly state that. I didn’t want to condone it.” If she found her voice, says Jones, it was thanks to a self-confidence that came from her parents. She was lucky; she got the best of her dad, who had been married twice before he met her mother and had five other children. “And my dad was a different parent to each one of them. I think my older sister would say he was never around. He would admit that. I have siblings who grew up in Sweden, when my dad and their mom got divorced, and they came to live with us eventually, but my dad was around a lot [more] for me, and I feel very grateful for that. And it’s just circumstantial; it was dumb luck. He happened to be at that place in his life, and I happened to be born. I do think that shaped who I am.” On the Rocks features a tender depiction of a father-daughter relationship, but in spite of its sweetness it’s not a film without politics. In one scene, a cop pulls over Jones and Murray, who sweet-talks him out of issuing a ticket. It was a scene Jones and Coppola discussed at length before shooting. A wealthy old white man charming a cop after a traffic stop lands differently these days from how it might have done a year ago and both women felt it was important to acknowledge the shift. Turning to her father, Jones’ character says drily: “It must be really nice to be you.” On the Rocks is in cinemas from Oct 2 and on Apple TV+ from Oct 23",film
"The team behind 2016’s eye-catching indie Chubby Funny – producer Helen Simmons and director Harry Michell – return with another agreeably off-beam comedy, this time with a starrier cast and a goofy, Four Lions-ish premise. It’s the tale of sibling Christian hitmen who, envious of the column inches logged by rival fundamentalists, set out to kill a Dawkins-like author at a literary festival in Ilkley. Tim (Harry Melling) is the childlike younger brother, ill-suited to grisly murder; the uptight Vic (Tom Brooke) an unrepentant sociopath. Their target (Roger Allam, master of glib dismissiveness) need not worry unduly: an astutely timed prologue shows our would-be ruthless killers stalking a rambler who looks just enough like Allam for the first of several terrible mistakes to be made. The pacing of that opening instantly elevates Michell’s film over a half-dozen recent British crime-comedies. We’re heading towards a set-piece that’s the Yorkshire Britpic equivalent of Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation’s opera-house assassination, while the gags allow supporting players to dig in and make an impression. Anna Maxwell Martin is formidably sarky as a detective aghast at having to enter the artsy-fartsy literary scene; Derek Jacobi has a classy cameo as a priest who justifies the hit with chilly mouthfuls of scripture; Matthew Steer’s brisk, funny sketch of the spineless festival chief will likely cue cringes of recognition in some quarters. Having the action observed by a roving male voice choir – representing the C of E’s safe centre ground – looks like a cheeky crib from the Icelandic hit Woman at War, but it’s a solid evening’s entertainment, assembled with an assurance rare at this budgetary level. Norwegian-born cinematographer Sverre Sørdal provides attractive glimpses of the moors (still under-utilised as a Britfilm resource), while sharp editing serves both the comedy and thriller aspects. Simmons and Michell, blessed with good ideas and the craft to do them justice, are building a notable filmography on the margins: let’s hope the industry’s moneymen are watching.",film
"Last month, the US Senate intelligence committee published over 1,000 pages of findings on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In a different world – or, at least, a more sane one, the kind oriented away from the distrustful chaos desired by Russian intelligence – the bipartisan report would have landed with the frisson of anticipation surrounding the Mueller report in April 2019. But in a hyper-polarized, disaster-numbed nation, its relatively damning findings faded quickly under at least seven layers of justifiably frantic news cycles. Agents of Chaos, a two-part investigative HBO series on Russian interference in the 2016 election, confirms some of the most damning findings of the Senate report – for one, extensive contacts between the Trump campaign, particularly former manager Paul Manafort, and “a cadre of individuals ostensibly operating outside of the Russian government but who nonetheless implement Kremlin-directed influence operations.” But the series, from Oscar-winning film-maker Alex Gibney, also visualizes, with first-person interviews from some of the major figures, what the rare bipartisan consensus (on facts, not narrative) cannot: the diffuse, dubiously quantifiable efforts by the Russian government – sometimes tightly organized, sometimes slapdash – to sow chaos in Ukraine and then America, the profit motives which compelled bumbling Trump figures into a “collusion” of mutual interest, and the head-spinning vertigo for average American consumers over what even happened four years ago. “There’s tremendous pressure to make sense of it quickly, rather than saying, ‘Something happened, but we don’t know yet what it means,’” Gibney told the Guardian of the drive since 2016 to pin down an easily digestible, solid narrative of Russian interference. “People would jump very quickly to say, ‘This is what it means’. And I think it’s that search for quick meaning that lead so many people down the road to conspiracy theory.” Agents of Chaos finds no single story, operation, locus of blame, or clear measure of impact by the Russian government. Instead, it explores a common purpose employed by both Russia and pro-Trump players in the US, sometimes in tandem and sometimes covertly. “Using chaos to amass power,” said Gibney. The four-hour series takes a broad look at Russian interference, delineating strategies that often get conflated into one enemy – an oil slick of reports and testimony difficult to pin into verifiable coherence. Gibney classifies efforts by the Russian government or Russian business interests – given the top-down structure of corruption in the country, it’s difficult to discern the two – to sow chaos in America into four categories: disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia’s Internet Research Agency, the so-called “troll factory” which injected divisive meme campaigns and partisan accounts into American social media discourse; sophisticated cyber-attacks, such as the one by the GRU, a Russian government intelligence agency, which leaked Democratic National Committee emails in 2016; Russian hackers’ infiltration into state election systems, which are criminally out of date and vulnerable to manipulation; and stoking an information system primed for outrage by widely broadcasting and encouraging support for an inexperienced showman and would-be oligarch named Donald Trump. The connections between Trump and Putin, explored in the second episode, constitute a “seduction between two like-minded people,” said Gibney, rather than the now-fraught word “collusion.” Trump initially was after a Moscow tower deal. For Putin and the Russian political system, a destabilized America is a less powerful one. “It’s all about greed, and avarice, and corruption,” said Gibney. “The agents of chaos in both countries had common interests.” Agents of Chaos fleshes out a “three-ring circus” of interference efforts with a who’s who of state and security actors, including former employees of the “troll farm” in Russia and a Russian journalist whose investigations into Putin associates earned him death threats, credible security concerns, and a severed bull head delivered to his office. Gibney interviews several top-level intelligence officials, such as lead prosecutor of the Mueller investigation Andrew Weissmann, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, former CIA director John Brennan, and Celeste Wallander, the former National Security Council director under Obama and a Russian foreign policy expert. Private investigator Glenn Simpson, who authorized the controversial and sensational dossier by Christopher Steele, speaks to Manafort’s shady connections to a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska. And now-familiar names from the Trump orbit, including disgraced adviser Carter Page and Felix Sater, the Russian-American businessman determined to build a Trump tower in Moscow, offer their versions of the mess. For those who have their finger on each sluggish inch of the Trump campaign’s overtures to Russian interests – so much as hard evidence exists for a connection whose symbiosis required no explicit statement of purpose – the series will answer or explicate on outstanding questions: that the FBI’s investigation into Russian cyber-attacks began in 2014, with evidence of its activity in Ukraine, not in 2016; that security officials under Obama considered significant counter-measures to Russian hacking, including releasing sensitive information on Russian officials, but ultimately decided against it; that the FBI’s investigation into Trump officials began as a reaction to reports that the campaign knew about Russian hacking of the Democrats when only the FBI was aware of the attacks. But for the many viewers who know “Russian interference” as a frustrating and slippery murk, one difficult to parse without particular expertise, Agents of Chaos offers a crash-course – a four-hour lecture series that attempts to see Russian cyber-security, America’s vulnerabilities, and missed opportunities clearly. “The Mueller report tried so hard not to tell a story that it failed,” said Gibney. “Because it just presented facts as if it was one magnificent phone book, and the phone book contains lots of facts, but it doesn’t have much of a story.” Which isn’t to say Agents of Chaos finds conspiracy so much as evidence of mutual greed, and a literacy of the hunger for power; many in the Trump orbit’s goal was “just to make money,” said Gibney, “and in pursuit of that, they end up doing a lot of things that people misinterpreted as being somehow policy-based or enmeshed in some kind of spy game.” The efforts by the Trump campaign, from George Papadopoulos to Manafort to Page, are more bumbling and obvious than a 1,000-page, buttoned-up Senate report would suggest. “It’s both more ridiculous and more corrupt than I had originally thought,” said Gibney of the Trump associates. “I thought of it initially as a John le Carré novel, but it turned out to be more like the Godfather, or the gang who shouldn’t shoot straight.” Agents of Chaos finds the Russian efforts, as well, to be both more scattershot and insidious than many would assume. “People are always looking for the strategy,” says Wallander in the second episode. “That fundamentally misunderstands a Russian operation. They seed multiple elements, and then they go with what works.” Arguably, what worked best is the entrenchment of the perception that Russia could have a consequential impact on America’s election. As the New Yorker argued this month, the loose murk of the Russian meddling story, which easily lends to conspiracy and distrust, is more important than quantifiable impact. Regardless of debates on quantifying impact, “if the goal is disruption and confusion, then being seen to affect outcomes is as good as actually affecting outcomes.” Which is why Gibney ultimately directs Agents of Chaos, and the lessons of the 2016 election for 2020, back to American soil, and its crumbling institutions. In 2016, “our institutions – the press, a sense of the rule of law, and a bifurcated, belief-based, tribal political system – had become so dysfunctional that were ripe for the picking,” he said. “Unless we start fixing some of these problems, we’re done.”",film
"Michael Lonsdale, the French-British actor whose best known role was the villain Drax in Moonraker but who also appeared in a string of films by auteur directors such as François Truffaut, Jacques Rivette and Alain Resnais, has died aged 89. Lonsdale’s agent, Olivier Loiseau, confirmed to Agence France-Presse that the actor had died at his home in Paris. Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson said in a statement: “He was an extraordinarily talented actor and a very dear friend. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.” Born in 1931 to a British military officer and his French-Irish wife, Lonsdale and his family spent the second world war years in French-controlled Morocco, before moving to Paris in 1947. Originally hoping to be a painter, Lonsdale studied acting with Tania Balachova, and began performing in the 1950s. His bilingual abilities allowed him to take roles in both French and English-speaking films: early roles included a priest in Orson Welles’s adaptation of The Trial (1962) and resistance member Jacques Debû-Bridel in René Clément’s Is Paris Burning? (1963). In 1968 he achieved a breakthrough with two Truffaut films: The Bride Wore Black and Stolen Kisses. In the former, he plays one of the men killed by Jeanne Moreau in revenge for her husband’s death, and in the latter a shoe-shop owner whose wife Antoine Doinel falls in love with. Lonsdale then made inroads into mainstream Anglo-American cinema, playing the investigator on the trail of Edward Fox’s hitman in The Day of the Jackal (1973), and in 1979 the creepy Hugo Drax in the Bond blockbuster Moonraker, alongside Roger Moore. His distinctive appearance and voice ensured he was cast in a wide variety of roles, including a masochist in Luis Buñuel’s The Phantom of Liberty (1974), embassy attache Anton Grigoriev in the 1982 TV series Smiley’s People and a French diplomat in the Merchant Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993). Lonsdale was a devout Catholic, having been baptised at 22 and joining the Charismatic Renewal movement in the 1980s. He would go on to play a string of religious figures, including the abbot in the successful adaption of Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose (1986) and a Trappist monk in Of Gods and Men (2010), for which Lonsdale won a best supporting actor César.",film
"Bill Murray amiably shows up on autopilot for this high-concept, low-octane New York caper from writer-director Sofia Coppola – the title of course playfully combining the specifications for a classy cocktail with a warning of imminent disaster. The film requires Murray to reprise some of his witty, man-of-the-world ennui from Coppola’s 2003 Tokyo-set smash Lost in Translation in which he struck up a friendship with a lonely, vulnerable younger woman, played by Scarlett Johansson – only now he’s a silver fox, playing opposite the estimable Rashida Jones, who is supposed to be his actual daughter. The film itself melds the daddy motif of earlier Coppola pictures (such as Somewhere from 2010) with Woody Allen’s elegiac view of classic Manhattan and the uproarious light-comedy adventures to be had without real consequence in that fabled city. Murray brings his droll, cool affect around with him everywhere he goes in this movie like an opera cloak, and it’s something that only he could bring off. But he always looks as if he could be thinking about something else, and the light sing-song intonations can betoken anything or nothing. It’s amusing in an undemanding way, but like any great comic, he still needs material. Murray plays Felix, an art dealer who has evidently grown wealthy enough not to work terribly hard and live a whimsically irresponsible lifestyle, cruising around New York in outrageously showy sports cars, or being driven everywhere by his loyal chauffeur. He is devoted to his daughter Laura, played by Jones, despite having angered her and wrecked her childhood by cheating on her mom as part of his wayward style. Laura is now married to Dean (Marlon Wayans) whom Felix cordially mistrusts as a rival for his daughter’s affections. But when Laura suspects that Dean is cheating on her with his beautiful colleague Fiona (Jessica Henwick, from Game of Thrones), she incautiously confides her fears to Felix, who then insists on putting the supposedly caddish Dean under surveillance. Soon Laura and Felix are a father-daughter spy duo, snooping on Dean from afar outside restaurants and clubs. Poor Laura needs her dad’s insights into the male roué mind, but the reminder of his own infidelity is increasingly painful. And she is exasperated when Felix wants to goof off their spying job so he can take her to classy joints that were stylish in his day. There are some cheerfully amusing moments, and I’m a sucker for the time-honoured routine when someone impatiently grabs the binoculars from someone else, thus dragging the straps across that person’s scowling face. But really the banter and the elegance needs some substance in the script and it really isn’t here, or not enough of it, and the serious moments seem glazed in a kind of negligent unseriousness. At one stage, Felix has to tell Laura that the younger woman for whom he left her mother has now died, and he is momentarily stunned at the realisation that he has outlived her. But that seems like nothing more than a minor, martini-soaked wobble. As for Laura, Jones isn’t required to get genuinely angry, but she is also too subdued and concerned to get into the spirit of farce. There are some nice minor moments. Felix’s own mother, coolly played by Barbara Bain, is still alive, and in one family scene is instantly alert to the possibility that her granddaughter’s marriage is in trouble. And I liked the performance from Jenny Slate (like Jones, a veteran of the much-missed TV comedy Parks and Recreation) who is someone that Laura has to make polite conversation with at the school drop-off as she drones incessantly on about her emotional life. On the Rocks is naturally indulgent towards Murray. No other approach could work or make sense. He is always entertaining to watch on some level and he gives a nice rendition of the song Mexicali Way. In any case, a real confrontation would mean a tragic fracturing, a tonal shift towards a different sort of film that would unbalance the whole thing. But there is no equivalent of the doomy romantic rapport that Murray achieved with Johansson in Lost in Translation. The movie isn’t on the rocks; it just timidly hugs the shore.",film
"It is hardly believable that there’s yet another Sherlock Holmes ripoff/spinoff – the genre named by the late critic Gilbert Adair “Shlock Holmes”. But here is Sherlock’s little-known rebellious kid sister Enola, invented in 2006 by the YA author Nancy Springer. Jack Thorne has adapted the first volume in her award-winning series and the director is Harry Bradbeer. Millie Bobby Brown (from TV’s Stranger Things) plays the imaginative, brilliant, quirky young Enola. She has grown up alone in the country with her enigmatic widowed mother, Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter), who has homeschooled her in science, literature and martial arts – this is after Enola’s terribly grand older brothers, Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin), have left home. But Eudoria herself disappears, leaving gnomic clues for Enola as to why, and then grumpy Mycroft insists on putting Enola in a stuffy boarding school run by Dickensian headmistress Miss Harrison (Fiona Shaw). So Enola has to escape, solve the mystery of her missing mum and also come to CGI Victorian London, thwarting a reactionary conspiracy to kidnap a handsome young aristocrat (Louis Partridge) who has a crush on Enola. It all rattles along amiably enough. Enola Holmes is the kind of all-star production that might once have been made by the BBC and graced the front cover of the Christmas Radio Times. Brown has a nice, easygoing way with the material, cheekily outpacing her famous brother Sherlock here and there and often doing fourth-wall breaks to smirk at the audience, and I loved Miss Harrison’s steampunky motor car. But there should have been more specifically ingenious deducting and solving from Enola – codebreaking isn’t the same thing. So … is Moriarty’s super-evil kid sister on the way?",film
"From the age of two and a half, Sasha has insisted she’ll grow up a girl. She was born in a boy’s body. In his tender observational documentary, film-maker Sébastien Lifshitz’s (Les Invisibles, Bambi, Adolescentes) spends a year following seven-year-old Sasha and her family as they struggle to navigate her gender dysphoria in their provincial French home town. Cinematographer Paul Guilhaume captures Sasha in widescreen, his camera watchful as she pads delicately across the room in ballet class, growing in confidence and expressiveness with each purposeful step. Her teacher is less generous. The film is as much about Sasha as it is about her fiercely protective mother, Karine, who initially blames herself for having wanted a baby girl. A kind specialist explains that it doesn’t work that way, and that there are other children in the same situation. Heartbreakingly, Sasha squeezes her mum’s hand, her worried face breaking into a reassured smile.",film
"French writer-director François Ozon, 52, is famous for his prodigious output. He directed his first full-length feature, Sitcom, in 1998, and his 19th, Summer of 85, a love story about two teenage boys in a Normandy seaside town, is out in the UK this month. In between, his diverse output includes the musical 8 Women, the retro comedy Potiche, the Ruth Rendell adaptation The New Girlfriend and last year’s By the Grace of God. What were you doing in the summer of ’85?What was I doing? I think I went to Spain with a friend – I can’t remember exactly, I’d have to ask my parents. The film was going to be called Summer of 84. I changed the title because of Robert Smith of the Cure. I absolutely wanted to use their song In Between Days, and he said, “Sorry, but that came out in 1985.” So I changed the title, and he let us have the song. For me, the film’s really about 1984, because that’s when I was 16. This is your 19th film, but apparently it was nearly your first.I read the book – Dance on My Grave by Aidan Chambers – in 1985. I thought, if I ever make films, I’d love this to be my first feature. In fact, I wrote a script with a friend, which I’d completely forgotten about. It took me 30 years to do it, but it was nice to think that now I was making a first film over again. It’s a young adult novel – for teenagers at the time, gay teens especially, it was a revelation, because sexuality is never a problem in it. At the time, the representation of homosexuality in cinema – literature too – was always problematic, it was always about conflict, coming out, transgression, guilt. The book didn’t have any of that, it was just a love story. For years I hoped that Gus Van Sant or Rob Reiner or some other American film-maker would adapt it, and no one ever did. You have two terrific young actors, Félix Lefebvre and Benjamin Voisin. How did you choose them, and how did you get such uninhibited performances?I was looking for chemistry – I wanted people to want to see them together. I had a lot of problems on my earlier films, with actors saying: “I can’t play a gay role.” This time I said: “Do you have any problems kissing a boy?”, and they said no. Young people now have a great fluidity, they don’t have the inhibitions that older actors did. Maybe it’s also because they’d seen films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour and Call Me By Your Name – for them it was all very simple. The film came out in French cinemas in July, after being included in the official selection of a Cannes festival that didn’t actually happen.I was very flattered to be included, but I was sad for my actors. It would have been great for them to walk up the red carpet, but they’ll do that with other films. We had a lot of offers from streaming platforms, but I shot the film on super-16, and I really wanted people to see it on the big screen. I believe in cinemas. If you look at French attendance figures, they’re 50% down from last year but that’s because there are no American films – whereas French films are maybe only 20% down. There’s a lot going on in French cinema at the moment – a lot of variety, a lot of debate, commercial films, auteur films, some very strong personalities, it’s pretty healthy. And there are a lot of film shoots happening in France right now – everyone’s making the most of it, in case there’s another lockdown. How did you spend your lockdown?It worked out quite well, because I ended up in the country for two months. I was worried at first because I’m really a city person, but I got used to it fairly quickly. I made the most of it to read and watch a lot of films, and write a script. But I didn’t watch a single TV series, I’ve had enough of them. I just watched classics – Fellini, Kurosawa… I needed to get back to the essentials. What are you most looking forward to now?I’m looking forward to Covid being over and everyone being vaccinated, so we can take off our masks and life can start again, differently. And I’m hoping that Trump won’t be re-elected, because everyone’s hanging on the US elections, and it’s affecting the whole world, artists included. Everyone wants to know whether the world is going to get worse, or if there’s a chance of things improving. How has the new political awareness of the Trump era played out in France?Did you follow the César awards in February? Roman Polanski winning best director really shocked people, women especially. No one’s saying he’s not a great director – for me, he absolutely is – but giving him a prize at this moment feels like the response of an old world that can’t see how things are changing. But they have a rule that if you win best film, you can’t also win best director – otherwise, Ladj Ly would have won both (for Les Misérables). If you look at the Césars, Roschdy Zem, who’s of Moroccan descent, won best actor, Ladj Ly is of African descent, a lot of women won prizes, so the diversity is there. Do you think about your old films – do any of them keep you awake at night? No, I’m a very bad father, I abandon all my children. (Laughs.) Right now I’m in the present, and the future – what’s past is past. Summer of 85 is released in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema on 23 October",film
"Blumhouse, the production outfit founded by Jason Blum, struck it big with unquiet souls terrorising American domesticity in Paranormal Activity – and not much has changed 11 years later, as the company launches Welcome to the Blumhouse, a diffusion line of eight thrillers in collaboration with Amazon Studios. (Four are released this year, four in 2021.) Here, the unquiet souls are the domestic inhabitants themselves – at least that’s the case in these first two films, which slot more into the psychological thriller category than the pure horror the studio is known for. Veena Sud (showrunner of the US remake of The Killing) offers an accomplished helicopter-parenting noir in The Lie (★★★★☆) – though what beleaguered divorcees Mireille Enos and Peter Sarsgaard engage in when trying to shield their daughter (Joey King) after she murders a schoolmate is probably better described as Black Hawk Down parenting. Sud – with plenty of inexorable tracking shots through the family’s chilly condo – efficiently tightens the screw as the twitchy mother and indulgent father first bicker, then are doomed together by their blood allegiances. In fact, the couple are so blinkered in protecting their offspring that it prevents The Lie from entering more psychologically torn territory that might have made it profound. Instead it’s merely car-crash compelling. Sarsgaard – an actor who often feels like a John Malkovich/Philip Seymour Hoffman crossbreed – can do this kind of equivocating mess in his sleep. But the standout here is Enos: a rictus of scarlet lipstick topped with a battery of compulsive twitches. Less classical but somehow more derivative is Black Box (★★★☆☆), which makes you wonder if Blumhouse is using its TV arm as a dumping ground for concepts that don’t quite make the cinematic cut. There are echoes of Get Out’s Sunken Place in the cutting-edge hypnosis treatment that road accident victim Nolan (Mamoudou Athie) is prescribed to recover his memories. The good doctor (Phylicia Rashad) is sweet-tongued but wearing enough maroon eyeshadow to flag that she shouldn’t be trusted. Faintly redolent of Inception, the therapy triggers unsettling flashbacks filled with blank-faced bystanders and a spider-walking revenant straight out of a J-horror flick. This pageantry registers less than the simple psychological tension that builds – and is ably maintained by debut director Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour and his largely African American cast – as Nolan questions his identity. But Osei-Kuffour – not helped by Athie’s rather stiff presence – can’t fully sell a crucial midway twist that pulls the focus away from the intriguing dynamic between a dependent father and a young daughter forced to grow up prematurely (a promising performance by Amanda Christine). Without any real stylisation to shake up Nolan’s inner realities beyond bog-standard techno-realism, this sunken place has no strong signature of its own – and little to add to the African American experience.",film
"Attack the Block meets A Midsummer Night’s Dream in this good-natured, charming and energetic comedy made by staff and pupils at Graveney secondary school in Tooting, London. It’s directed by English and film studies teacher Pat Sharpe, who coaxes some fantastic performances from her students, most in front of the camera for the first time; even the teatime telly silliness of some scenes feels endearing. It’s set in the fictional school of Midsummer High where half a dozen aliens crash land in the headmaster’s office seven hours before the opening night of the school play. Rufiat Awolope (a sixth former at the time of filming) plays sensible headgirl Helen who can’t decide if she likes swotty Dan (Gus Flind-Henry). Her shallow best friend Charlotte (Ramona Marquez) is seeing Louis (Byron Easmon), who falls for Helen. Scriptwriter Steve Smith wittily adapts the suitor-swapping of Shakespeare’s play to fickle teenagers, with the aliens acting as matchmakers. Trapped in human bodies, these infinitely superior beings take pity on the illogical hormonal teenagers and attempt to fix their romantic dramas. As the extraterrestrials attempt to make sense of their new surroundings the script has some fun. What is this concept of school, one of them asks. Another replies: “It’s where the young of the species are forcibly contained to receive low-grade data that the elders believe will make them functionally effective.” The film is a seriously impressive achievement by the inspiring teachers and kids at Graveney. Certainly, it’s more professionally made than a fair few low-budget films I’ve seen, though I did wonder whether the English department was consulted about using number “7” in the title, rather than spelling it out as “seven”.",film
"This documentary makes a pretty convincing case for the admission of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint into the boys’ club of abstract art, alongside Kandinsky, Mondrian et al. Af Klint was an outsider in her lifetime and when she died in 1944, her paintings gathered dust in her nephew’s attic. (She did her legacy no favours by stipulating in her will that none of her work should be seen for 20 years.) Today, her work is a nuisance to art history: to acknowledge her would require rewriting the entire chapter on abstract art. Born in 1862, Af Klint grew up in middle-class privilege, encouraged by her father to paint. After graduating from the Royal Academy in Stockholm, she worked as portrait painter and illustrator before turning to radical abstract works from 1906. A maverick free-thinker, she was fascinated by modern scientific discoveries as well as by spiritualism and seances, covering her paintings in an esoteric language of signs and symbols. Her mystical beliefs gave the art world an excuse to dismiss her as a kook when the work later came to light. Female art historians and writers interviewed in the film point out that that the history of art is the history of male genius. Women don’t fit the narrative. Their tone of furious resignation reminded me of that #MeToo placard: “I can’t believe we still have to protest this shit.” Depressingly, anonymity followed Af Klint to her grave – literally. After she died at 81 her nephew buried her with her mother and father in a Stockholm cemetery but didn’t bother to update the headstone. Director Halina Dyrschka asks: “How would you ever know she was here?” She could be talking about female artists full stop; yet in a photo taken in her studio, Af Klint looks fiercely present, intense and lively with bright, piercing eyes – you could imagine Saoirse Ronan playing her in a biopic.",film
"Some films are best watched more or less by accident: stumbled upon with little foreknowledge, so we’re led through the story without a compass. Mubi’s curation model often allows for such moments of discovery: their latest exclusive release, Two/One, is a strange, slippery puzzler well suited to a blind encounter. The debut feature from Argentinian director Juan Cabral, it’s a subtle, alluring spin on cinema’s longstanding fixation with double personalities. That genre usually hinges on twins or doppelgängers, allowing one actor to flex as showily as possible. Two/One goes another way, instead exploring the idea of two non-alike men – different in face, body, location, vocation – who nonetheless seem to share a life, perhaps even a soul. In Canada, pro ski-jumper Kaden (Boyd Holbrook) is reaching the end of his career and facing an existential slump; across the globe, in Shanghai, businessman Khai (Song Yang) is professionally successful but starved of real human contact. When one falls aleep, the other wakes; through visual cues and narrative echoes, Cabral builds the sense that their lives are obliviously connected, each moving in rhythm to the other. This isn’t a story that wants you to ask if both men sleep for 12 hours a day, or other such niggling questions: you have to forgo logic to succumb to its ruminative spiritual resonance. Cabral’s film-making is seductive enough to do that: he’s best known as the advertising genius behind the famous Cadbury Gorilla and Sony Bouncing Balls campaigns, so the man knows how to sell you an idea through elegant games of sound and image. There’s enough vivid, glimmering beauty here to make you briefly, forlornly wonder if your own other self is out there. The first film that Two/One made me want to rewatch (via Curzon Home Cinema) was Krzysztof Kieslowski’s still luminous The Double Life of Veronique, which matches the doppelgänger trope to a similarly airy cosmic conceit. As two unacquainted, similarly named women in separate countries whose lives seem curiously fused in the stars, Irène Jacob’s artfully bisected performance brilliantly sustains a pair of distinct but eerily entangled personalities. In the last film he made before switching to full-time Hollywood fare, Québécois director Denis Villeneuve made a disconcerting little entry in this subgenre called Enemy (on Amazon), a cold, crisp psycho-thriller in which Jake Gyllenhaal anxiously stalks his second self around an unforgiving urban landscape – the nature of their connection remains uncertain as the film escalates into (literally) spidery madness. It perfectly complements the bonkers, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin Roger Moore curio The Man Who Haunted Himself (Amazon again), though it’s more sleekly atmospheric. Over on Netflix, in Nacho Vigalondo’s Colossal – among the most winningly bizarre sci-fi experiments in recent mainstream cinema – Anne Hathaway’s alcoholic writer doesn’t seem to have a double, per se, but the Godzilla-like monster raising hell far away in Seoul appears uncannily wired to her thoughts and actions. Much-vaunted in the 1990s but neglected of late, Scott McGehee and David Siegel’s Suture (on Google Play) has two allegedly identical brothers swap identities, causing havoc in their world and with our perception: for we see them as two entirely distinct actors, one black and one white. And I’ve celebrated Jordan Peele’s Us in this column before, but it can’t go unmentioned here: the relationship between its tethered yet mismatched doppelgängers opens up a raging world of post-colonial racial politics. The gold standard (or the emerald-green one, to go by the film’s distinctive palette) of tricksy doubling on film, of course, remains Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (among Netflix’s few classics), which seems to emphasise different slices and shades of dual identity every time you watch it; ditto the overlapping feminine psyches of Ingmar Bergman’s hypnotic, ever shape-shifting Persona (on Amazon), in which the existential merge somehow happens before you know it, even when you know what’s coming. Fragments of both films were clearly on David Lynch’s mind when he made Mulholland Drive (on iTunes), proving himself the master of doubling characters with reckless disregard for time, space and sanity. That’s not the approach for high-concept king Christopher Nolan, who of course has a doubling exercise of sorts in his oeuvre: perhaps his most lavishly entertaining film, The Prestige (on iTunes), plays knotty identity games with an actual pair of magicians, though it falls down a bit when Nolan, being the director he is, has to solve his own puzzle. Two/One, too, is best when it just lets its foggy mystique be: the most haunting double-trouble films always keep something from us. Socrates (Peccadillo, 15) Made on a shoestring and following a gay 15-year-old fending for himself in São Paulo after his mother’s death, Alex Moratto’s impressive, affecting debut makes a good companion piece to recent British standout Rocks as a study of children failed by the adult world. Summerland (Lionsgate, 12)An easy, breezy comfort watch as summer slips away in the rearview mirror, Jessica Swale’s wartime drama about a cranky academic (an ace Gemma Arterton) thawed by the arrival of a child evacuee is attractive and absorbing, though too heavy on dewy nostalgia. Zeroville (Universal, 15) James Franco has directed a catalogue of ambitious misses, but he’s never whiffed as spectacularly as in this unwatchable adaptation of Steve Erickson’s Tinseltown satire, which plays like an am-dram interpretation of Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.",film
"A deeply strange message from the future is what this movie is here to (re)deliver: both post- and pre-apocalyptic, a nuclear-age parable of anxiety to compare with Godzilla. Akira, released in 1988, is the cult Japanese cyberpunk animation from director Katsuhiro Ôtomo, who also created the original manga serial. (It is set in the impossibly futuristic year of 2019, so maybe last year would actually have been the time to rerelease it.) Thirty years on from a devastating explosion that razed the city, a new capital – Neo-Tokyo – has been born: sprawling, chaotic, like the LA of Blade Runner. The city is beset with violence from warring motorbike gangs, and by protesters rioting against unfair taxes. A hatchet-faced army officer says that Neo-Tokyo is “a garbage heap made of hedonistic fools”.  Biker teen Kaneda (voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) is in the middle of a confrontation with a rival mob, when his friend Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki) accidentally crashes into a bizarrely wizened child-goblin figure who has apparently escaped from a top-secret government research facility investigating this race of troll-infants with bizarre powers. Tetsuo finds that he himself now has staggering telekinetic abilities, and becomes public enemy number one for these sinister G-men. He assumes superhuman qualities, evolving into a new entity, a virtual messianic figure for this occult race of uniquely gifted or cursed lab rats. It is Tetsuo’s destiny to discover the truth about Akira, a much-rumoured godhead or wellspring of essential cosmic power that is to be found somewhere underneath the city: it may have been responsible for the explosion 30 years ago. And so the final 30 minutes of the film build to a nightmare of utter destruction – longed-for destruction, in fact, an annihilation that will wipe out this culpable, wretched world. Akira’s strangeness is very startling and sometimes bewildering. But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else.",film
"The cinematographer Michael Chapman, who has died aged 84, had a ringside seat for many of the towering works of postwar American cinema, including Raging Bull (1980), based on the life of the middleweight champion Jake LaMotta (played by Robert De Niro). That film, which brought Chapman the first of two Oscar nominations, was one of four he made with Martin Scorsese; it was preceded by Taxi Driver (1976), the concert movie The Last Waltz and the documentary American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince (both 1978). “His relationship with the camera and the film that was running through it was intimate, mysterious, almost mystical,” said Scorsese, who called him “a great artist”. In Raging Bull, Chapman delineated sharply the different areas of LaMotta’s life. In the ring, he used elaborate camera moves, swooping and rushing, to achieve an operatic, adrenalised effect, while a plainer style was adopted for street scenes and tense pow-wows in cramped clubs and apartments. His work exhibited breadth and grandeur but he could never be accused of prettifying a shot. “It shouldn’t be beautiful,” he said of his craft. “It should be appropriate.” Chapman and Scorsese made Raging Bull in black-and-white to evoke the Life magazine photography and TV boxing broadcasts of their youth. “In our memories, boxing was a black-and-white sport,” Chapman explained, “so it seemed perfectly reasonable to shoot it in black-and-white.” It was Taxi Driver, though, that he considered his crowning achievement. For all its grittiness, this study of a lonely, embittered sociopath (also De Niro) was hallucinatory rather than realistic. “It pretends to be documentary but in fact it’s quite theatrical,” Chapman said, pointing to the use of enigmatic dissolves, heightened colour and unmotivated camera movement, such as the unusual moment when the camera drifts away from De Niro while he is talking on the phone and stares blankly down a deserted corridor. The film’s meagre budget demanded a certain ingenuity. Chapman and Scorsese squeezed into the back of a cab driven by De Niro to roam New York at night, shooting whatever took their fancy. For the climax, in which the camera seems to float across a flophouse ceiling while it surveys the aftermath of a massacre, Chapman cut into the floor of the apartment above so that the camera could track sideways as it peered at the carnage below. Born and raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Chapman was the son of a teacher father and librarian mother. “I was devoted to movies as a child,” he said, singling out newsreels as a particular inspiration. In those bulletins, he saw “airplanes flying, bombs exploding, battleships firing huge cannons. Extraordinarily powerful images of a world far away.” Following his education at the Andover Academy and Columbia University, where according to Chapman “there was a system at that time where you could basically take whatever you wanted and get your degree. I suppose I was an English major or a history major in some vague way”, he was employed as a brakeman on the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. “It was a very chic thing to do in the late 1950s,” he recalled. “Echoes of Kerouac and Ginsberg and all that.” After a brief stint in the army, he married Myriam Brun in 1961. Her father, the French émigré cinematographer Joseph C Brun, objected to his daughter marrying “a beatnik ne’er-do-well” and took Chapman on as an assistant on several pictures, including Who Killed Teddy Bear (1965), a lurid, New York-set thriller cited subsequently by critics as an influence on Taxi Driver. He worked his way up to camera operator on projects with Gordon Willis, the esteemed cinematographer who became his mentor, among them Klute (1971) and The Godfather (1972). Chapman’s first credit as director of photography was Hal Ashby’s salty buddy movie The Last Detail (1973) starring Jack Nicholson, which had a rough-and-ready visual style. “The actual light in the actual locations was far more emotionally evocative than anything I could do at that stage in my career,” he said. Jaws (1975) marked his final credit solely as camera operator. He shot the abrasive Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel as a budding pianist trapped in a life of crime, an inspired remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (both 1978), the lesbian athletics drama Personal Best and the comedy Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (both 1982). For the latter, another innovative experiment in black and white, his footage was intercut with excerpts from Hollywood classics to make it appear as if the film’s star, Steve Martin, was bantering with the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Joan Crawford and Lana Turner. He worked on a second Martin vehicle, The Man With Two Brains (1983), as well as the vampire romp The Lost Boys (1987), Scrooged (1988) and Kindergarten Cop (1990). He also directed three movies: All the Right Moves (1983), a sports drama starring Tom Cruise, the Cro-Magnon yarn The Clan of the Cave Bear (1985), described by Time Out magazine as “Reader’s Digest prehistory”, and The Viking Sagas (1995), which he also wrote. He was reunited with Scorsese in 1987 on the pop promo for Michael Jackson’s single Bad. A second Oscar nomination came his way for The Fugitive (1993), a big-screen adaptation of the popular 1960s TV series. Following his final cinematography credit, on the children’s fantasy Bridge to Terabithia (2007), he taught film at the North Carolina School of the Arts. He is survived by his second wife, the screenwriter Amy Holden Jones, and by their children, Emma and Patrick, as well as by Jonathan and Andrew, his sons from his previous marriage.",film
"Our movie industry was just about keeping its morale steady. It was enforcing perfectly workable rules on sanitising and physical distancing and not subject to those closures taking theatre and live entertainment to the cliff edge. The pilot light of big-screen cinema culture was flickering. But it was still alight. But this is a serious blow. If it is really true that Cineworld will close 128 cinemas, putting 5,500 jobs at risk (and it is not simply a scare-story negotiating ploy leaked to the press alongside the company’s official letter to the culture secretary Oliver Dowden demanding action) then this is potentially devastating. For the first time, everyone in the industry is beginning to entertain the queasy thought: what if our cinema industry is like vaudeville? Or silent movies? Or evensong – that once widespread middle-Britain churchgoing habit wiped out by TV? Is cinemagoing finished? A loss-leader adjunct to the home entertainment industry that’s long been vulnerable to infection? I think the answer is still no. But the other question is: who is to blame for the Cineworld debacle? Big blockbuster movies are routinely nicknamed “tentpoles” for a reason. They keep the whole big top upright. The announcement is that the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, will come out next spring (a transparently vague and unreliable promise) having been already delayed from the spring of this year. It is enraging that Eon (the Bond producers) have lost their nerve so spectacularly, pulling the movie on which the industry had been relying – the big-screen exhibitors that have been supporting and nurturing the 007 franchise since the 60s. It was just as dismaying for the industry that Disney released their high-profile live-action entertainment Mulan to streaming services. But somehow Disney wasn’t stringing us along in quite the same way. Of course, the whole Bond franchise is a business: we’re not talking about a state-subsidised schools workshop tour of Romeo and Juliet. Bond movies are profitable entertainments or they are nothing, and they are produced in an unsentimental way by people who, let’s not forget, aren’t to blame for coronavirus. And yes, of course, Covid-19 might be with us for so long that this proposed delay might not be as significant as it now appears. But that will be no consolation to Cineworld employees losing their jobs right now. And like it or not, those James Bond extravaganzas – enjoyable, exciting, reactionary, daft – are consumed in a slightly sentimental spirit, and the company has effectively been trading, at least partly, on our pride in a globally popular Brit product. Cinema, like all forms of show business, needs chutzpah and courage, and this year the only big-league players to have really shown this are Christopher Nolan and Warner Brothers who boldly released their mega-action thriller Tenet into cinemas. Eon has reportedly been unnerved by the lacklustre box-office numbers for Tenet, and this long delay is apparently their idea of playing it safe. But it isn’t simply that this line of thinking discounts the possibility that No Time to Die could have built on the initial steps taken by Tenet; it is the assumption that everything will pretty much be the same next year. Will it? Or will the Bond delay and the Cineworld closure trigger a wave of anxiety that will undermine so many other areas of the service industry and the economy generally? It could be the wing flap not of a butterfly but a pterodactyl. It is possible that Cineworld might reconsider – and the James Bond franchise itself could reconsider, too. In the meantime, we have to remember that most cinemas are still open and they are showing really good films. “Use it or lose it” is an annoying cliche. But we’re staring loss in the face.",film
"I got a report yesterday saying it was up by…” Sarah Paulson pauses, weighing up whether she wants to reveal the extent of her daily screen time. Then she takes the plunge. “It was nine hours and 52 minutes,” she says, mock-abashed. In a day? She nods. “In a day, yes. Quite terrible. I think it was… doesn’t it break down how much of it was work? There was work on there. So I was doing some of that. But… it’s embarrassing.” We are at the start of another long screen day for Paulson, who is speaking from her kitchen, at home in Los Angeles. Her new dog, Winifred, is curled up just out of shot. “Winnie! Would you like to come and say hi?” she coos, in a squeaky voice. “I’m this person! Who does this voice when I talk to my dog!” Winnie is her first dog in nine-and-a-half years; she has the initials of her old dogs, Alice and Millie, tattooed on the inside of her wrist. “She’s very demanding and she has a lot of personality. She’s recently taken to humping me. She’s my child! Why is she doing this, this 11-month-old, precious little thing? I can’t tell you how upsetting it is. She’s not even 8lb. Her arms clamp around me and I’m like, ‘Oh, stop it!”’ Paulson is a grafting sort of actor, whether she’s playing a conservative protester in Mrs America, a suburban mother who shifts stolen goods in Ocean’s 8, or her nine seasons to date of American Horror Story. But world events have meant that she’s recently been much less busy. “Usually I’m at work and I don’t look at my phone for hours because I can’t,” she says. “But I’m just not as busy. And I don’t seem to have the ability to read right now. My ability to focus is wildly altered in this time.” Instead of reading, Paulson has been watching a lot of television: “In the olden days, back when I was a child, that would be considered a negative, because there just wasn’t a plethora of very vital, really relevant, enriching things to watch.” Television was mostly trashy then, back in the 80s. But “now I just feel like there’s such magical stuff to watch that is not so much about an escapist experience but more about connecting to other people through story.” She has become a fan of Michaela Coel: “I’mtotally obsessed with I May Destroy You. I just think it’s the most astonishing thing I’ve seen in a long time.” Paulson came into her prime in her late 30s – she is 45 now – during this new golden age of television. She has long been a familiar face, both on TV and in film. But in 2012, when she took the lead in the second (and best) season of American Horror Story, as an investigative reporter in an asylum, her career soared. It helps that she’s a fun prospect on the promotional side of things, whether that’s wondering if she is or is not friends with Rihanna, her co-star on Ocean’s 8, or reminiscing about sniffing Cher’s head as a guest on talk shows. Now she is chatty and open – we talk far beyond our allotted hour. She speaks quickly and gives long, looping, contemplative answers. She is more introspective than the goofball you’d expect from seeing her on television or red carpets, more nervy and softly spoken, but also pleasingly no-nonsense. When it comes to acting, though, Paulson transforms into her characters completely. She has played a different character on each season of American Horror Story, from a psychic to the stars to a heroin-addicted ghost, via a headmistress-witch, and both of a pair of conjoined twins. She won multiple awards for playing Marcia Clark in American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson, and her performance saw a readjustment of public opinion on Clark, who had been publicly pilloried for her appearance and ambition throughout the trial and beyond. “There’s no doubt in my mind that that piece had a very positive impact on Marcia,” Paulson says. “And it was a 20-year wait for her to have that righted.” As we speak, the notion of commitment comes up more than once. Paulson was born in Florida, but moved with her mother and sister to New York when she was a child and was raised in the city. She has acted professionally ever since she left school at 18. “I did a play, the requisite Law and Order episode, then I went to Wilmington to do a show called American Gothic. I tend to only do shows with ‘American’ in the title, it’s so weird. American Gothic, American Crime Story, American Horror Story, Mrs America...” She moved to LA when she was 21, but for years she found it hard to admit to herself that the city was home: “Even when I moved here, I wanted an apartment, I didn’t want a house. I rented apartment after apartment until I finally bought a house, which I guess was really a way of saying, ‘I live here now.’” I expected her to say that this was a long time ago, but it was in 2017. “There was something about it that felt too grown-up to me,” she says, smiling. She mentions an actor friend who invested every bit of money she earned in property. “I was just not interested in that at all. When I look back at it, I must have been really resisting the idea of growing up.” Paulson’s mother was brought up by religious, conservative parents, and was a debutante. “But that was not my mother’s way of thinking. She moved from where she grew up to New York with two young children and just lived an entirely other life.” Paulson says she sometimes feels like “a travelling salesman”, which suits her line of work. “I like the pick-up-and-go thing. I like not having to pull anything up by the roots.” Buying the house has given her roots. “It’s a recent growing-up. I have to acknowledge that it’s recent. I have come to like it. But I do continue to look at real estate websites.” We are here to talk about her latest series, Ratched, which reimagines the nurse from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and gives her a rich, fabulous backstory. (After a long discussion about the 1975 film – the patriarchy, institutions and social norms – Paulson says she does not see her character as a villain.) Like American Horror Story, it is from the stable of TV’s production giant Ryan Murphy, and marks another sort of commitment. “Ryan called and asked me, ‘Do you want to do this?’ And I thought, I don’t know that I do,” she says. Netflix commissioned two seasons, and the idea of playing the same character for so long spooked her. “I had to think, was that going to be interesting for me? Not to mention, he asked me to executive produce the thing, and that was something I had never done. It just felt like a big, giant bite to take out of something, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for it.” In the end, the fact that it terrified her is what made her say yes. “It is so odd for someone like me, because I am such a nervous kind of person, prone to anxiety, and I think if I feel terrified to do it, I almost feel compelled, that I don’t have a choice.” So much of Paulson’s recent work is dark and horror-tinged, and requires her to put herself through the mill – she runs from clowns, she is blinded by acid. Yet she admits she is “a generally fearful person”. In real life, she avoids getting out of her comfort zone. “I run from bees. I don’t like planes. But with work, it’s like…” She growls, pitches her voice low. “Give it to me!” She refers to her relationship with Murphy as “the creative marriage of my life”. He tells her his ideas often before he tells his husband, while she says she can “interpret” him with a single word. She isn’t sure why they get each other in the way that they do. “I do think we have some things in common. We were both sort of different [as kids]. We were, I think, both ‘big feeling’ kind of people.” She has asked him why he thinks they work so well, but she has decided that, ultimately, she’d rather not know. “A lot of women wanted the Marcia Clark part. I don’t know why he thought it should be me. Sometimes I think it’s a good thing to not try to understand every gift you’re given, because it could really come down to just, you know, ‘I couldn’t think of another actor I wanted to be on a set with.’” Though she hasn’t had to do it in a while, Paulson likes auditioning; it makes her feel like she’s earned the part. “I haven’t auditioned for something since The Goldfinch – the thud heard around the world,” she says, gamely, of the big-budget Donna Tartt adaptation that didn’t so much soar as fly straight into a closed window. She was a big fan of the book, and fought hard to play Xandra. “I wish the thing had been a mini-series. I think you needed to feel that passage of time, and you can’t do that in a two-hour movie, or however long it ended up being.” She shrugs. “I never saw it.” She isn’t being rude – Paulson never watches herself on screen. When The People vs OJ Simpson finished shooting, she was devastated, because: “I didn’t want that experience of picking the moments where I’m unsatisfied with what I did.” Paulson won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her portrait of Marcia Clark. She had been watching award shows since she was small, and it was a childhood dream to win one. “And to be standing there, with that thing in your hand, looking out at a sea of people, and you go backstage, and it’s a bunch of strangers, then you call your person on the phone, then you’re home or in the hotel room with the thing, and it’s just... this is so weird. It’s not a communal experience, it’s a very isolating experience.” Her partner, Holland Taylor, was away at the time, doing a play, and Paulson says the whole experience was “sort of lonely, in a weird way”. That’s sad, I say. “It is sort of sad!” she says. “I don’t want it to seem just heartbreaking, because it was glorious, it was a very wild time. But in terms of something I could experience, it felt dropped in, like, this really happened to you, you really did this, this was the response to your work, are you taking this in?” She knows it sounds trite, but she says the real reward was playing Clark in the first place. “Everything that happened around it was just icing and gravy and cherry on top, and all that stuff.” Where does she keep those gold statues? “They’re in Holland’s house. I think about bringing them here all the time, but I never do. I don’t know, it’s weird.” I assume she and Taylor, who have been a couple since the beginning of 2015, don’t live together. “But we do live together,” she says. “For the whole beginning of the relationship and the last five years, we have lived together.” They just have their own houses, and spend some time apart during the week. “Really, the change happened during the pandemic, which was: we have an opportunity to protect our relationship by spending some time apart, and I think we should do that. We spend more time together than apart, but we do have several nights a week where we’re talking to each other like this [she gestures at the screen] and we get to do what we want, when we want. Both of us are exceedingly independent people.” As two actors, have they got used to spending large periods of time in different cities, doing different jobs? She laughs. “All of a sudden, we were like, ‘Hey! You’re here! What are you doing here? Get outta here!’ It’s been good.” The internet is wild for Paulson and Taylor as a couple. Whenever they refer to each other in interviews, or on social media, there is a minor explosion of online fuss. “I don’t remember people going nuts about Michael Douglas and Catherine-Zeta Jones, in terms of their age difference,” she says, with an air of resignation, not unkindly, but firmly. There are 32 years between Paulson and Taylor. “For me, that seems to be the predominant interest in my relationship with Holland, what would be perceived by some as the strangeness of it, or the unlikelihood of it. I think people are fascinated by it, because it’s so not typical. Except for if you look around at plenty of well-known or recognisable couples, when they’re heterosexual couples, it just runs rampant, and I don’t see anybody becoming obsessed by those relationships.” On the other hand, she says, if it makes other people feel more comfortable in themselves, fine. “If it allows for more freedom, in terms of the way people think about what’s possible for them, then I’m all for the fandom of it and the excitement around it and the interest in it. What I don’t love, which is sort of a consequence of it being such public knowledge, is that there is discussion about it at all. Believe me, there have been plenty of young people on the internet who have tweeted horrifying things to me about it, and who don’t support it and who are so cruel. So it’s just a bit of a dance. But one I try to not let into my brain too often.” When normal life begins to creep back, the first thing Paulson will do is return to Murphy’s next American Crime Story, which this time is taking on the Bill Clinton impeachment. She will play Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee who secretly recorded Monica Lewinsky confiding in her about her sexual relationship with the then-president. Many saw Tripp’s actions as a betrayal of her younger friend; Tripp said she was acting out of patriotic duty. They were about a week away from shooting when production shut down, and she hopes they will start up again in the next few weeks. “For me, playing her is not an opportunity to revise history, it’s just a chance for me to share the underbelly of something that, if we do it right, will at the very least make it possible for you to go, ‘I understand now, what she was doing.’” Now, what Paulson wants to do is find joy in her job, as much as she can: “Some of the work I’m most well known for is quite dark and quite centred in emotion. And I would love to be able to do that work, and enjoy it, at the same time.” That sounds like a grown-up way to look at it. “I’m trying!” she laughs. “I’m trying to shed the six-year-old, and grow into the 45-year-old. She’s here!”  Season 1 of Ratched is now streaming on Netflix",film
"Its success has been hailed as “extraordinary” – not least because no one saw it coming. The YA romance After We Collided has next to no marketing budget and zero reviews – and has taken more than £1m after just two weeks in the UK. A few weeks ago, it wasn’t even in line for theatrical release. As the box office struggles in the pandemic, the industry has sat up to take note of this grassroots success. It is “completely unprecedented”, says Delphine Lievens, a senior box office analyst at Gower Street. “To do that based on no marketing – it’s a really impressive result.” After We Collided is the follow-up to last year’s After; both are adapted from the “new adult” novel series by the US author Anna Todd. They follow the up-and-down relationship of college students Tessa (played by Josephine Langford) and Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin – Joseph and Ralph’s nephew). Tessa is a headstrong and bookish young woman with parallels – the film insists – to Elizabeth Bennet. Hardin, meanwhile, is a bad-boy Brit whose eminent unsuitability is signposted by his many Ramones tees. Naturally, “Hessa” can’t keep away from each other, as much as their parents, love rivals and life circumstances conspire to keep them apart. Cue maudlin electro-pop. The film rights were acquired in 2014 by Paramount, and the first film, After, was released in 2019, to modest results: a worldwide gross of $70m, of which $12m came from the US. It failed to achieve a cinema release in the UK, and went straight to Netflix. (The platform’s refusal to share audience data means we don’t know how it performed.) You might assume After We Collided would go down the same path, but the film’s producers, Voltage Pictures, struck a deal for independent distribution in the UK and Ireland with an obscure company called Shear Entertainment. Shear secured a first-week run at 47 locations – none, unusually, in central London. Even with that limited release on 2 September the film entered the box office at No 3, with an opening weekend total of £175,000. Other cinemas leaped on this box office life raft, and After We Collided expanded to 378 venues (more than half of all those open in the UK) for its second week – and were rewarded by an 151% increase on the opening weekend. The film’s UK box office gross currently stands at over £1.1m. All this has happened in the face of minimal critical attention – and what little does exist has been almost uniformly negative, with unflattering comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight – “the actors could be mistaken for the undead” snarked one reviewer of After. But the overlap between professional critics and the target demographic of tween and teenage girls is practically nonexistent – and since Todd’s books have a massive global audience, reviews are of limited relevance. Fans say they relate to the characters and find parallels with their own lives. “[It’s] not for people to aspire to have this relationship, as it can be quite toxic at times, but it’s so that we can learn,” explains one. Many appreciate the unflinching treatment of darker material, including sex, drugs, fraught family relationships and trauma. Hessa’s romance – not to mention the online community around it – has helped fans through their own tough times. “It’s a kind of escape from reality,” says another fan. “Jo and Hero”, as the lead actors are known, are singled out by many for their on-screen chemistry. Langford and Fiennes Tiffin may not have the mainstream cachet that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson did as a result of Twilight, but they do reach millions of Instagram followers. The fragmentation of the media landscape means that After has emerged from between the gaps, at once undeniable and undetectable. “Traditional media certainly underestimated the reach and impact of this series,” says Ben Dalton, a reporter for Screen International. Just as EL James’ Fifty Shades trilogy was inspired by Twilight, After began as fan fiction for the boyband One Direction. In 2013 then 23-year-old Todd started writing about an imagined college romance with Harry Styles on the social storytelling platform Wattpad. For nearly a year, she posted a short chapter every day, typing on her iPhone. Driven in part by Todd’s fellow Directioners, After became a viral sensation on Wattpad, drawing 1m readers before she had even finished writing. Aron Levitz, head of Wattpad’s entertainment arm, says fans would gather online ahead of each instalment: “If it was a minute late, you’d see social media explode with people going, ‘Anna, why isn’t it posted yet?’” That dialogue between writer and reader formed the basis for the community now driving its commercial success. “That’s what made it a hit: their love for the story,” says Levitz. Todd’s original stories continue to feature among Wattpad’s most read every years, having now amassed more than 1.5bn reads. Todd’s work is the blueprint by which the films are judged. While some liberties were taken with the plot in the adaptation of After, Roger Kumble – the director of Cruel Intentions, who took on After We Collided – has been praised for sticking so closely to the book. “He really gave us the ‘book Hessa’ that we wanted,” one fan says. “The movie was everything the fans were hoping for,” says another. (The next two, After We Fell and After Ever Happy, were confirmed to be in production this week.) Even now that she has industry backing, Todd calls herself a “fangirl turned author” and credits her success as her readers’ achievement as much as her own. They repay her in kind, talking of “Anna” as a friend and advocating for her work on social media (where most of the films’ marketing budget goes). Their community even has a name: “Afternators” – and they are “as loyal and rabid as any fandom out there”, says Levitz. As one member put it: “When we work together, we achieve.”Voltage president Jonathan Deckter gave credit to “the power of a strategic grassroots social campaign that spoke directly to our film’s target audience in the forum they prefer. Traditional release marketing will always have its place, but as far as Afternators are concerned, they live and breathe social.” In adapting After, Levitz says, Wattpad consulted with readers: “This wasn’t done like most development is done, behind closed doors … It was about keeping them involved, something I think traditional industries aren’t used to.” More typically, he says, audiences are treated as the “commodity at the end of a production line” that culminates with “this big bang, red-carpet moment: ‘I hope they like it!’ But we don’t have to hope anymore – we knew After was going to be a success.” The lesson from After We Collided’s success, says Lievens, is that “no distributor in the UK had identified that there was an audience for this film”. Independent distribution is usually a final resort for films considered too niche for mainstream audiences; and had Voltage not decided to push for a theatrical release, cinemas would have missed out on a cash injection of nearly £1m – from, it’s fair to assume, mostly young women. By contrast, the industry had pinned its hopes on Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster Tenet which, despite half a decade of hype, made only slightly more than After We Collided. The latter’s opening-weekend per-screen average was £4,366 compared with Tenet’s £5,358, despite showing in one-tenth the number of cinemas. Even more impressively, After We Collided also leapfrogged X-Men spin-off The New Mutants in its second week. The result suggests a disconnect between gatekeepers and cinemagoers that, at this desperate moment, may prove costly. The blindspots aren’t just age and gender. Lievens points to the “huge unexpected success” of Fisherman’s Friend, carried by regional audiences in Devon and Cornwall; and the £4.5m box office takings of Rapman’s debut Blue Story. “There were lots of old white men scratching their heads and going ‘Where did this come from?’” At Wattpad, Levitz believes there is fatigue with the old ways of entertainment and it is time for cinemagoers to be promoted to stakeholders. “In a world where more money is being spent on content than ever before, audience is going to make the difference – but the industry is not always used to listening to audience.” ",film
"It is fascinating to find Sir Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, posting on Twitter a scene from Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons to affirm his belief in the sanctity of the law. Since Bolt was a one-time communist, an active supporter of CND and a dramatist who wrote a hagiographic portrait of Lenin in State of Revolution, he and Cox make strange bedfellows. Yet, although Bolt was ready to defy the law in pursuit of a cause like nuclear disarmament, he still saw it, in his own words, as “the essence of organised society”. Cox’s choice of a clip from the film of A Man for All Seasons is highly pertinent but, to understand it fully, you need to know the context. Sir Thomas More has just been confronted by Richard Rich, who is part of the network of spies Thomas Cromwell is using to gather information about him. Once Rich has gone, More is urged to arrest him. More’s response is that what Rich is doing may well be evil but that it’s not illegal. He places his faith in the inviolable integrity of the law. Destroy that and anarchy follows. As More says: “This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast and if you cut them down do you think you could really stand upright in the winds that would blow then?” It’s a powerful message for today. Cox seems to have got the point. As a parliamentarian, he’s not famous for his humility: indeed he appears the antithesis of the More portrayed by Paul Scofield in the film, who was the epitome of quiet modesty. However, when Cox said this week that “the breaking of the law ultimately leads to very long-term and permanent damage to this country’s reputation” he was speaking sentiments More might have understood. Perhaps he could arrange a clandestine showing of A Man for All Seasons for Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, and Suella Braverman, the attorney general, who seem all too happy to cut their consciences to suit the current Tory fashion. But while it’s good to see Fred Zinnemann’s film being used to make a moral point, it started out as a stage play and is only one of many in the 20th century in which the individual is pitted against authority. Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan shows its protagonist taking on the Catholic church and, unlike Bolt’s More, putting God’s law above man’s. Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, dealing with the Salem witch trials of 1692 but highly relevant to the hearings of Senator McCarthy’s House Un-American Activities Committee, shows a hero who sacrifices his life to his principles. And Bertolt Brecht’s Galileo depicts a pioneering scientist who abjures his beliefs when faced with the Inquisition. Bolt’s play, when it opened in 1960, was openly compared to Brecht’s: not always in its favour as shown in a celebrated argument with Kenneth Tynan in the pages of the Observer. But Bolt stuck to his guns and argued that More was right to pin his faith to the primacy of the law, and against those who “were ready to crack it open and let in anarchy to maintain their own advantages”. Not a bad phrase to apply to the age of Johnson and Cummings.",film
"As America’s west coast continues to burn, this Ron Howard-directed documentary tells of the aftermath of the 2018 wildfires in Paradise, California. At the time it was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history. Paradise first entered the international consciousness via a Trumpian gaffe that seemed to encapsulate the administration’s casual indifference to climate change; the president referred to the town as “Pleasure” while touring the devastation. That clip is featured again here, this time utterly drained of even the bitterest humour by the harrowing images that precede it.Footage garnered from emergency response vehicle dashcams and survivors’ mobiles shows the now-familiar ash clouds, orange skies and deadlocked queues of fleeing traffic – no less shocking for that familiarity. In one remarkable shot, four horses gallop away from the inferno, as if having already abandoned the four horsemen in their haste to escape the apocalypse. The irony is stark: Paradise sure looks a lot like hell. It is the small-town heroes who are ultimately the film’s centre, however. These include square-jawed local cop Matt Gates, tireless school district superintendent Michelle John and the town-drunk-turned-town-mayor Woody Culleton (how’s that for living out the American Dream?). At one point the real-life Erin Brockovich even pops up to lend support to a class action suit. These displaced characters from a Frank Capra movie are now just displaced; scattered across the state, living half-lives in motels and trailers, while they await any news.Rebuilding Paradise might easily have blazed with righteous fury, but its conclusions are quieter and bleaker. There are big societal, historical and pyrogeographical reasons why such disasters now happen with increasing frequency. But none of that is the fault of these good people. They just want to go home.

"This debut feature from Channing Godfrey Peoples is lit with pride for Black Texan culture: the BBQ, the beauty pageants, historic black colleges and Juneteenth itself. This is the annual 19 June holiday commemorating the day in 1865, when enslaved black people in Texas were liberated, two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had outlawed slavery. Nicole Beharie (Shame, Little Fires Everywhere) stars as Miss Juneteenth 2004 – otherwise known as Turquoise “Turq” Jones. She is a single mother who scrimps every penny she earns working at the local bar and funeral home, in the hope that her 15-year-old daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) will repeat her glory days at this year’s pageant. This is more than mere vanity: the new Miss Juneteenth will have her tuition fees paid at the historically black college of her choice. For a woman in Turq’s situation, freedom means choosing from a limited set of options, and always with some sacrifice. It means trying to make the best decision under financial pressure and always in the judgmental glare of neighbours and relatives. She dreams of a better life for her daughter, but Kai, like most teenagers, has her own ideas.The beauty pageant has been a means to explore mother-daughter relationships before (Drop Dead Gorgeous, Dumplin’), but rarely with a black woman at its centre, and never with such unhurried specificity. Even as Turq lives vicariously through her daughter, and hitches her wagon to various unreliable men (Insecure’s Kendrick Sampson plays Kai’s father), the realisation slowly dawns that she must find something for herself. For anyone who values diverse storytelling, Peoples’ portrait of a hardworking woman on the up is a tale of hopefulness – and a reason to hope in itself.",film
"Therapist Dr Marianne Winter (Thekla Reuten) hopes to escape her own traumatic past in upstate New York by taking up a position treating troubled children in a remote Scottish town. However, the forbidding Victorian municipal building that houses her new consulting room offers no sanctuary, and she’s soon unsettled by a 10-year-old patient (Elijah Wolf), who claims he can control her actions with his thoughts. Repression (previously entitled Marionette) gamely endeavours to live up to the Hitchcockian promise of its title. It started out as a Dutch-language short by director Elbert van Strien 27 years ago, and here he knowingly utilises all the gothic potential of a new setting. As one visitor to Marianne’s rooms remarks: “Isn’t it a bit depressing? All this panelling, rip that out. You know what you need? Some nice bright white walls, little bit of uplighting.” Van Strien is ably assisted by a top-drawer supporting cast. Peter Mullan plays Marianne’s troubled predecessor, Rebecca Front is her hint-dropping colleague (enjoyable shades of Mrs Danvers), and Bill Paterson is perfectly cast as the practice’s benignly befuddled team leader. Such atmospherics can be a film entire. It’s a shame Repression instead gets bogged down by its big themes, which revolve around a series of undergrad philosophy questions such as, “Does the process of observing reality change nature?”, “Are thoughts like self-fulfilling prophecies?” and “Was there ever really a cat in Schrödinger’s box?” These are all inelegantly spelled out during meetings of Marianne’s book group, which take place in the back room of a pub (more wood panelling). A third-act plot twist is audacious enough to regain our attention, but Reuten and Wolf don’t quite have the charisma to fully carry it off.",film
"Netflix has defended the controversial film Cuties after it emerged the streaming giant is facing a criminal charge in Texas over the movie’s allegedly “lewd” depiction of children. Cuties follows an 11-year-old Senegalese girl living in Paris who rebels against her conservative family’s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a “free-spirited dance crew”. A grand jury in Tyler County, Texas, has indicted the company on the charge of “promotion of lewd visual material depicting a child”. The indictment claims Cuties appeals to the “prurient interest in sex” and the material holds “no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value”.  A Netflix representative told PA: “Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualisation of young children. This charge is without merit and we stand by the film.” The film became a target of protesters after Netflix admitted it had used “inappropriate artwork” to market it on the streaming platform. Netflix subsequently became the subject of more wide-ranging attacks and a campaign for subscribers to cancel their membership. Following the backlash, the company encouraged people to watch the movie before passing judgment. Writer-director Maimouna Doucouré said she considers it to be “a deeply feminist film with an activist message” that is a “mirror of today’s society, a mirror sometimes difficult to look into”. She said she got the idea after seeing a group of 11-year-old girls dancing in a way “you would see in a video clip” during a neighbourhood gathering in Paris. The director said she had spent the next year and a half meeting hundreds of pre-teens to learn about how they felt about their femininity in today’s society, and how they felt about their self-image in the era of social media. The film premiered at the Sundance film festival in January this year, where Doucouré won the world cinema dramatic directing award. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the calls to boycott Netflix would be a “flash in the pan” after some initial success. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall suggestws that some 2 million subscribers had dropped the service in the US and Canada over the last three months, well above the streaming service’s normal “churn” rate, but that the cause was not clear, given that many more subscribers had joined the platform during lockdown.",film
"There’s a moment in The Forty-Year-Old Version when frustrated playwright Radha becomes so enraged by an elderly white theatre producer that she has to be physically prevented from throttling him. He has just suggested that, if she’s unwilling to put a white character at the heart of her play about the gentrification of Harlem, she might like to help out with a forthcoming musical about the 19th-century abolitionist Harriet Tubman instead. It raises the question – how close is the film to the life of its director and star, Radha Blank, who has also spent decades beating at the door of New York’s predominantly white theatre establishment? “I have not actually choked a theatre producer… yet,” she says, “just like I’ve never won a 30 under 30 award and I’ve not had a relationship specifically with a hip-hop producer in his 20s from Brownsville. But that character [D, played by newcomer Oswin Benjamin] is an amalgam of a lot of people I’ve dated, people I’ve met in music, and I tend to skew younger, so that part is true.” Her frankness is both endearing and surprising. We’re five minutes into a Zoom interview about her debut film, which was a sleeper hit of this year’s Sundance festival, winning her the directing award for US drama and a nomination for the grand jury prize. Like its maker, the film is a life-affirming, in-your-face blast of fresh air that is perfectly timed to blow up a storm on the energy released by the Black Lives Matter movement. “It traces the rebirth of an artist with lacerating insight, a great deal of warmth and terrific comic timing,” said the New York Times, noting that its black-and-white palette recalled the iconic New York films of Woody Allen and Spike Lee. Blank cites Lee’s 1986 movie, She’s Gotta Have It, as one of her biggest influences, and a few years ago Lee invited her to join his writers’ room for the TV follow-up, which ran from 2017 to 2019. It was one of a succession of writing gigs in the past decade, including Baz Luhrmann’s The Get Down, about musical youth in the Bronx, and the record industry soap opera Empire, which for Blank put an end to years of grafting away in children’s TV while going nowhere in her first love, theatre. “I have about 12 plays that haven’t seen the light of day and became my writing samples for TV,” she says. “I’m one of the most known unproduced black playwrights. When I have a reading, people turn up. We’re hungry for each other. They need me as a playwright and I need them as actors, but I’ve only had a couple of readings and one major production.” In the film, Radha’s failure to break through is compounded by her 40th birthday and the death of her artist mother. There’s a poignant scene where she and her brother take stock of her mother’s paintings. When she made the film, Blank herself had just emerged from two months “curled in a ball”, grieving for her own mother, who was an artist and “my chief cheerleader”. Radha is “about 65% me,” she says, “but some of my friends are playing my friends in the film and all of the family photos are real: that’s my mom’s artwork, that’s my dad’s music, that’s my brother. So certain elements are very true.” Part of the survival strategy of both Radhas is to reinvent themselves as a comedy rapper, RadhaMUSprime, whose name – Blank says she didn’t realise it at the time – was subliminally inspired by Rodimus Prime, a character in her favourite childhood robot superhero series, Transformers (“There’s a moment from it that I use to open my shows, where RadhaMUSprime is fighting Megatron. I tried to get it in the movie, but without success.”) Unlike Radha in the film, Blank has never freaked out on stage. “Performing at Joe’s pub, in little dives in Brooklyn, in Norway – this was part of my healing,” she says. “RadhaMUSprime as an alter ego really did save me. What I love about hip-hop music is if you have a skill with a pen it really doesn’t matter what you look like. I used RadhaMUSprime to celebrate having a May to December romance, and I have a fat girl sex anthem. In my normal life I’m always dieting, whereas RadhaMUSprime doesn’t care. She celebrates her rolls!” The Forty-Year-Old Version is part satirical howl of rage at racial disadvantage in the theatre, and part love song to New York, where she and her brother were raised as part of an “intentional artist community” whose members spent their downtime renovating dilapidated lofts and storefronts. “I was raised around artists,” she says. “It was nothing for a jam session to start off in our house; for different activists and artists to pontificate in our kitchen, smoking a little weed, and having their arguments until 3am. People l call my aunties and uncles – black, brown, Jewish.” Her father is a jazz drummer from a dynasty of musicians, and her “uncle” Gerry Eastman still owns the Williamsburg Music Center in Brooklyn. “In that place I saw everyone from Cassandra Wilson to Joshua Redman, people who today are jazz luminaries but who were then young musicians in their 20s just trying to figure things out. So creating art was never a question. It was what we did, not necessarily as a vocation.” By the time she got to her teens, Blank began to see the downside of such a lifestyle – “struggling to pay bills, needing a little government assistance, expected to wear the same pair of jeans three times a week. I was a little embarrassed, so instead of becoming an artist I went to business school.” She ended up excelling in all the school talent shows. “It’s something I could not escape, it’s part of who I am. I just had to figure out how to make a living at it,” she says. “Then I came to Spike’s work and thought that’s someone who’s making a living and who looks like me.” As a child, Blank would watch films over the shoulder of her cinephile mother. “The reason I had to shoot the film in black and white is that there’s nothing more New York than a black and white film, and in my own way I’m retrofitting the film back into a canon that I love from the 70s and 80s, telling a story that should have been told all those years ago: this is another [type of] New Yorker. I’m a New Yorker. It’s just that the camera was angled in one direction and we had to pivot it over here.” It was also, she says, about seeing New York’s urban culture through a more sophisticated lens. “Hip-hop is often oversexualised, oversaturated. Black and white brings it to a level of cool and vulnerability that we don’t often see it at.” The film was originally intended to be a 10-episode web series. Her mother’s death, just as she was preparing to shoot the first two episodes, put an end to that – but also raised her sights. “I feel like failure is a great tool in comedy,” she says. “Adversity is a great polisher of the mirror of life.” Mirrors are a motif in the film. “I’m using the comedy and the failure and the adversity to polish the character’s mirror. It’s sometimes obscured, sometimes foggy, sometimes she can’t see her reflection. When a black woman is up on screen she usually fits into maybe five tropes: the sassy best friend, the all-knowing oracle, the hands-on-hips ‘Oh no you don’t!’ type… I’m in favour of the black woman on screen looking into herself. That’s what I’m a champion of.” Though the bulk of Blank’s satire is aimed at the white theatre establishment – the smug producer and the sleek socialite investors – she’s not above a dig at her multi-ethnic peers. There’s a comic riff on a pretentiously mystical black arts scene, as well as a sharp dig at crowd-pleasing hip-hop musicals. Did she by any chance have the work of Lin-Manuel Miranda in mind, in particular his streetlife musical In the Heights? “You picked up on that? Holy shit!” she chortles, with a shake of her glamorous gold braids. Then she dials back to serious. “When it comes to theatre in an urban environment, particularly musical theatre, it’s pretty much the same setup: this exciting place where everything is pointed at this one voice that’s speaking for the street. Then there’s poverty porn. This is not a criticism of Lin-Manuel, who is one of our genius scribes. What I’m critical of is that institutions don’t put up more plays by people of colour about the inner city, so we have a range of stories.” It just so happens that Blank has a few of them in her back pocket. “Seed [her one play that did have a full production, at New York’s National Black Theatre, in 2011] is a story that takes place in Harlem and people actually speak in rhyme, but there’s a little bit more depth than the usual representations.” It’s about a gifted child and the woman who tries to help him fulfil his potential. Then there’s her TV calling card, Casket Sharp, about a young graduate who returns to his decayed home town to settle his dead father’s funeral business, only to get caught up in a row about funeral rites between the mother of a young dead man and his gang family. She turned down the chance of turning it into a TV series because “I didn’t know whether I wanted to create a show where people were tuning in every week to black death, even though they were saying it’s our version of Six Feet Under.” She gives another shake of her head and concludes that, despite all her setbacks: “there are just some things that should be on the stage: I’ll never be done with theatre, I’m just hoping that maybe now theatre will take a chance on me.” She’s well aware of the irony that the worlds of television and film, which initially seemed so much more remote and glamorous, should have proved more welcoming. “But the beauty of this moment is that there’s no denying it. I am officially a film director. I made a film.”",film
"You might not have realised it at the time – you might not even realise it now – but on Friday afternoon, something truly momentous happened: David Lynch pulled a seven out of a jar. For the most part, the burst of online celebrity visibility that marked the start of the Covid crisis has dribbled down to almost nothing. Joe Wicks has stopped doing PE lessons. John Krasinski’s Some Good News show screeched to a halt four months ago. Mercifully, nobody else has attempted another group singalong of Imagine. But David Lynch is still plugging away, updating his YouTube account twice daily. The first videos are his weather reports, where he briefly tells us about the Los Angeles forecast. But the more gripping content comes in the form of his Today’s Number Is series, where he swirls 10 ping-pong balls around in a blacked-out jar, picks one out and shows us the number written on it. That’s all there is to it. As of Monday morning, Lynch has pulled a number from his jar on 43 consecutive days, each video comfortingly sticking to the same script. “Here we go for today’s number,” he says, standing in the same spot outside his workshop. He reveals the date. “Ten balls. Each ball has a number. Numbers one through 10.” He takes the lid off the jar, puts his hand in. “Swirl the numbers. Pick a number.” He pulls a ball from the jar, shows the number to the camera, says it aloud and the video ends. Exactly what it means is anybody’s guess. Lynch is known to be a fan of numerology, and his 2017 Twin Peaks revival was full of so many mysterious numbers that all manner of websites started to tie themselves in knots trying to decode their meaning. A bruised woman, never seen before or since, repeatedly cries “119” for reasons that are never explained. The screaming tree with a human brain tells Dale Cooper “253. Time and time again”. The character played by Carel Struycken orders Cooper to “remember 430”. These numbers might be relevant, or they might not. And so it is with the jar. The comment section beneath the videos has grown into a community of likeminded numerological sleuths, trying to assign a deeper meaning to the numbers that Lynch pulls out. Overwhelmingly, the most frequently drawn number has been eight, which many took to be an ominous portent of things to come. After all, you will remember that episode eight of Twin Peaks: The Return drifted into a nuclear explosion and saw the end of the world. For the first 40 days of the series, David Lynch pulled out every number but seven from the jar. Seven is Lynch’s favourite number. Theories began to emerge. Was it deliberate? Was it rigged? Did he keep ball seven in a freezer, so he could identify it by touch? Was he redoing any videos in which he pulled a seven? Regardless, every day a commenter called Wes W wrote the same thing: “Man if tomorrow’s not a 7 I’m gonna lose it.” Wes quickly gained a large following, as the rest of the audience took to pinning all their thwarted seven-based hopes on him. Then, on Friday, it happened. As always, Lynch ran through his script. He swirled the numbers. He picked a number. He looked at it, and broke into a broad grin. “Today’s number, by golly,” he giggled. “Today’s number, Wes, is seven.”  The jubilation in the comments was unparalleled. Not only had a seven finally been picked, but Lynch addressed had addressed a commenter by name. “WES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” one wrote. “Almost made me cry,” wrote another. “I feel like I’m a part of history by being here,” wrote a third, and it made sense. If you’d been following the numbers from the start, this weird little game produced and watched out of boredom in a moment of personal restriction, the number and the smile and the call-out genuinely seemed significant. And then Wes W disappeared, without so much as a reaction. As soon as seven was called, he stopped commenting. Now the comment section has transformed into a hunt for Wes, a gnomic figure with just three videos in his profile, one of which is a clip of David Lynch and five Woody Woodpeckers thanking a cinema chain for supporting Eraserhead. Who could he be? Will he return? Was he David Lynch in disguise? Are we all just projecting a much larger narrative on to something that may be meaningless? Probably, yes, but hasn’t that always been the case with David Lynch? David Lynch is still swirling his numbers. Yesterday’s number was five. What will today’s number be?",film
"The cast of Oliver Stone’s 1986 Vietnam classic Platoon heartily exchange old war stories in this making-of documentary by two of their own: Paul Sanchez, writer-director here, played Doc in Platoon and Charlie Sheen (“Chris”), who has been deployed to provide occasional narration. While Sheen had spent time in outh-east Asia before, accompanying dad Martin on the set of Apocalypse Now, he impresses on us just how inexperienced the rest these “no-name grunts” were. It was up to Stone’s fellow Vietnam vet, Captain Dale Dye to turn 33 drama school slackers into a trained rifle platoon with a two-week boot camp. Did he succeed? Let’s just say that Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller’s 2008 Hollywood satire, has a new ring of truth to it and 30 years on, only the level-headed Willem Dafoe can find the line between experiencing actual combat and shooting a movie without catering. They have, however, authentically captured the 1am atmosphere at a veteran’s bar. Every anecdote is overlong, any point worth making is made seven times over and occasional non-sequitur gems float above the relentless bed of juke-box rock. “It’s Cher, walking into my funeral parlour, and I’m going to do some low-budget piece of shit halfway around the world …” moans John C McGinley. “So I unzipped the old fly and pulled out the old friend and, yeah, I was gonna urinate on Oliver,” chuckles Johnny Depp. Stone himself never makes an appearance. That’s probably for the best, since the cast clearly despised him. His torturous methods involved forcing actors to do 30-plus takes for a single line of dialogue before revealing there was no film in the camera, and never had been. Then again, after sitting through 90 minutes of their self-indulgent reminiscence, you might conclude they fully deserved it.",film
"Two o’clock, Chicago time. The curtains are down against a bright afternoon sun and John Cusack, who is by reputation a late riser, takes a seat at the breakfast counter in his kitchen. For decades this storied, experienced and rather solitary-seeming actor has dressed all in black. Today is no exception. He wears a black T-shirt, black bandana and a black leather biker’s jacket. But for the incongruous cup he’s drinking coffee from (a medieval-style flagon, large as a flowerpot) Cusack could be one of those menacing motorcycle dudes who parks himself next to you at an American dive bar and starts explaining, unbidden, how he once killed a man but in error. He turned 54 in the summer. The voice is gravellier than when you knew it best, when Cusack was in his mid-30s heyday and playing those brilliant lovelorn everymen in Being John Malkovich (1999), High Fidelity (2000) and Serendipity (2001). The eyes, always so coolly narrowed when Cusack first made a name for himself as a teen star of the 80s, are more starey and tired these days. He rubs them a lot while he talks. Professionally speaking, Cusack has been on a wearying run of form of late, the past five years a hotchpotch of underwhelming thrillers. (He hopes that a new Amazon TV drama he’s starring in, Utopia, will help revive his stock.) And politically speaking, as with so many who lean left, Cusack has been left exhausted by four years of a Trump presidency. The actor was online most of the day before, getting angry at news bulletins and tweeting strangers and friends – broadcasters, Edward Snowden, a librarian in North Carolina, a chocoholic in the UK – about the president’s latest outrages. “He’s an evil fuck,” Cusack growls, “and he grinds our faces in it every day.” Back in 2012, when Cusack was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a few of the people closest to him gave speeches, his sister Joan Cusack described his character as part It’s a Wonderful Life (melancholy, sweet), part Doctor Strangelove (eccentric, political). Kate Beckinsale, Cusack’s co-star in romcom Serendipity, described him as a “bit mysterious”. Defining himself in his Twitter bio, Cusack prefers the phrase “apocalyptic shit-disturber”. Whoever is most right, Cusack is an interestingly complicated guy, both opinionated and deferential, salty and sweet. Sometimes strangers will send him messages, suggesting that he leave politics alone, stay in his lane. “You have officially ruined Serendipity for me!” they say. Or: “You used to be one of my favourites!” Sometimes, Cusack will reply: “Aww. You’ll be OK.” I ask him what he thinks about the idea that actors ought to stay in their lane, away from politics, and he takes a deep breath. (The “you” in the following speech can be taken to be directed at the person for whom Serendipity has been ruined.) “When you see children being ripped away from their mothers’ arms and put into kennels,” he says, “I’m sorry if you think someone speaking out against that is someone not staying in their lane. But let’s agree that, if you can’t figure out that that’s fascism, then we don’t have anything more to say to each other, and I don’t have any respect for you, and we should probably not talk. I mean!” When I ask if he holds out much hope for a return to political normality after the November election, Cusack puffs out his cheeks and wags his head, weighing it. “One hopes that sanity comes back. But, um, America is a bat-shit-crazy place. So you just don’t know.” And “you just don’t know” is the primary lesson a long career in Hollywood has taught him. A 30-plus-year veteran of the business, Cusack has known what it’s like to feel hot as an actor, and also what it’s like to feel the icy touch of irrelevance. When I ask about the difference between those two feelings, being hot and cold, Cusack pauses for a good long while and then says: “We-e-e-ell. I haven’t really been hot for a long time.”  Utopia, the show he hopes will warm him up, is colourful, breathless and vicious – a remake of Dennis Kelly’s Channel 4 hit, this time written by Gillian Flynn. It’s a multi-threaded drama that interweaves the stories of a gang of millennial comic-book readers, a pair of assassins and the sinister founder of a biotech company. Cusack, who can be peerlessly sinister when he wants to be (see his double turn in 2013, first as a serial killer in The Frozen Ground and then as Richard Nixon in Lee Daniels’ The Butler), plays the founder. Followers of his Twitter feed will know the powerful aversion to the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg this actor has. When I suggest to Cusack it must have been cathartic, playing a founder-saviour type, and getting to channel his deep suspicions about Musk and the rest, he corrects me: “Yeah. They’re not really suspicions so much as they’re, um, factual observations.” His unease about the Silicon Valley founder class stretches back to the 00s and his time aboard Bill Clinton’s plane as part of a celebrity delegation to Africa. Musk was on the flight, too, as were Larry Page and Sergey Brin from Google. “Too weird an adventure to pass up,” Cusack says, explaining his unlikely presence aboard. “It’s not like I’ve always been pure. No! I was the dog, and I was walked too. But then you start to see through it. You see these people saying, ‘Don’t be evil! We’re not evil!’ A nice catchy phrase. But then you see that their business becomes data-mining… You learn about what’s really happening with these companies. What their back doors are.” His strong political views evolved from that trip, Cusack says. In recent years he has travelled to Russia with the novelist Arundhati Roy to meet American exile Edward Snowden – “Ed” – and show him support. He has been a full-blooded supporter of Bernie Sanders for a while now, and though he will vote for Biden in November Cusack insists he will do so grudgingly. (“You’re voting for an extension of the neoliberal order. But the alternative is fascism. You have to vote against Trump.”) A year ago his politics got him in trouble when he put out a tin-eared tweet that he meant as criticism of Israeli foreign policy but which was antisemitic. Cusack apologised. Recently, he took to the streets of Chicago during the Black Lives Matter protests, and got rushed by a gang of baton-wielding cops while he was taking photographs. “They didn’t hit me, they just… tuned up my Vespa. Whack-whack-whack!” By queasy chance, part of the story of Utopia, which was written and filmed last year, involves a pandemic. It’s an accidentally timely subplot that Amazon has not been shy to push in trailers for the show. I ask Cusack, when he first read the script, whether it seemed at all plausible that something like this could happen, and he says yes: “Given the convergence of dystopian realities that we’ve had, whether it’s food and water shortages, endless war, global warming, it didn’t feel like it was too much of a stretch to imagine it happening. ‘Timely’ would be the wrong word, because that sounds like something that’s convenient and nice. But, for those people who have been Cassandras for a while, for those people who’ve been saying we must change, it feels like the rest of the world is catching up now.” Do you consider yourself a Cassandra? Cusack rubs his eyes again. He smiles. He frowns. He appears to think, fuck it: “Sometimes you do. If you are saying things that people might not want to hear, or things that are annoying to hear… Y’know, yeah. A little bit!” He’s gentler, honestly, than all this hoarse political speechifying makes him sound. He sister Joan once pointed out Cusack’s unconscious habit, at parties, of lowering his 6ft 2in frame to look someone shorter than himself in the eye: “To make them feel like the star.” Chatting as he sits in his kitchen, he isn’t so far away in manner from the affable, all-American boys he played so well in the 1980s. There was “Gib” Gibson in The Sure Thing (1985) and Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything (1989). As a viewer I first encountered Cusack when he played the wise and tragic college boy Denny Lachance in Rob Reiner’s bildungsroman, Stand By Me. Reiner, who also directed The Sure Thing, was a former teen star himself. Cusack remembers the director going out of his way to make him feel welcome in an industry that could be cold and cruel to its young actors. “You don’t need me to repeat all the clichés. Hollywood can be quite transactional and rough. I was lucky. I was 16, 17. Rob would invite you into his home, look after you – it wasn’t that… exploitative vibe at all. Movies were definitely the Wild West back then. But there were good people, too.” What does he remember of his first encounters with the rougher edges of the business? Cusack looks at the curtained window, holding in a smile, apparently wondering whether to tell the following story or not. “I remember, early in my career, when I was still in high school, you’d be on a movie set and at the end of the day people would go and get beer from the prop truck. And also you could get coke.” He doesn’t mean the kind with a capital C: “Like I said, the Wild West. Not that I was doing it all. But it was just sort of like, ‘Wow.’ Sort of like, ‘OK! Anything goes.’” After his breakout years in the 1980s he was in and out of work in the early 90s, till Woody Allen cast him in Bullets Over Broadway. Cusack found a cool groove towards the end of that decade, co-writing and starring in the cult comedy Grosse Pointe Blank and appearing alongside John Malkovich in the dementedly silly, but sort of brilliant, action movie Con Air. That film ended with an aeroplane full of condemned prisoners landing on a fully populated Las Vegas strip. (Incredibly, this is not the silliest scene Cusack has ever rendered for the action-movie canon. For that you need to check out the apocalypse movie 2012 and a sequence in which he drives a stretch limo through a collapsing Los Angeles skyscraper.) His career high came right at the turn of the century, when he reunited with Malkovich for the unforgettable Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze collaboration Being John Malkovich and a year later starred in, co-wrote and co-produced the movie adaptation of Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity. In 2001 he did Serendipity, which has proved durable, a well-thought-of Christmas romcom. The later 00s were not quite so fertile for him and might be best thought of as Cusack’s “with hilarious results” phase. On IMDB they summarise the plot of 2005’s Must Love Dogs as follows: “A 30-something preschool teacher looks to the personals for a change of pace and a relationship, with hilarious results.” In 2010 he starred in and produced the self-explanatory comedy Hot Tub Time Machine, a silly film that found a cult audience and doubled its money at the box office. But it was one of the last of his projects to date that Cusack was able to get real money for. “In the last few years, I haven’t been able to get projects financed,” he says. “That could be a function of getting older. Or it could be a function of being cold.” Instead, the past decade’s work has been characterised by some ace bit-parts and cameos (an eerie psychotherapist in David Cronenberg’s Maps to the Stars, the musician Brian Wilson in Love & Mercy, a soliloquising preacher in Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq) as well as some terribly average thrillers, in almost all of which Cusack appears on the poster brandishing a gun or standing next to someone brandishing a gun. “You may go make a film,” he sighs, lowering his torso over the breakfast counter, “you do all this work. And the movie sort of gets butchered in the editing room. And that happens, like…” (Cusack turns down his mouth, doing the sums) “like, nine times out of 10? So it’s not a very satisfying thing, if only one in 10 movies that you’re making work out the way they were planned.” Movie-making, he concludes, is “brutal, transactional, superficial and dumb.” Incredible, really, that he’s waited so long to get in on TV. In all his years as an actor Cusack had never ventured further into telly than a 1996 guest-spot on Frasier, even as telly became an exciting, thriving, prestigious format, a refuge for so many forgotten or overlooked actors of Cusack’s generation. He has heard it said he was once considered for the role of Walter White in Breaking Bad. Even, that he was offered the gig and turned it down. The rumour has proved so persistent that Cusack finally had to sidle up to showrunner Vince Gilligan and ask. “I said: ‘I never got offered Breaking Bad, did I?’ And Vince said no.” The new Amazon show, Cusack insists, was his first serious offer. “One of those phone calls, they want you.” And so he is waiting. For the show to come out (and maybe warm him up a little). For the presidential election in November, and the chance that Trump and his cronies will be ousted from power. All his adult life people have recognised Cusack, and tapped him on the shoulder, and said: I loved you in Say Anything (or High Fidelity, or Con Air). Sometimes a certain type of man, wary of looking soft, will insist it’s his wife who loves Cusack. Back in 2003, Cusack was at a boxing match in Las Vegas when he got one of these taps on the shoulder. “Hey, John,” said Donald Trump. “My wife loves you.” Cusack claims he shivered in revulsion even then.  When our interview is over he will be back online, barracking Trump, expressing his fury and his contempt. Before he goes I suggest to Cusack, gently as I can, that Twitter does not always look the healthiest place for him. “I would love to think about other things,” he agrees. “Poetry. Love. Anything else. But that’s just not the times we’re in. And, y’know, not all anger is just sort of somebody stuck in some rut in a basement. If you can’t be outraged on behalf of other people, or express anger at injustice, maybe that is its own rut. Sure, I might go too far sometimes. But I really just want to get across the message: that we’re sleepwalking into an incredibly dark possible future.” Cusack rubs his tired eyes. He drinks from his big tin tankard of coffee. Who knows, he says? “Maybe being outspoken hurts your career… I’m just aware it helps me sleep better at night, knowing that I wasn’t passive during this time.”  Utopia is streaming now exclusively on Amazon Prime Video",film
"How’s this for an official plot synopsis? “Hope and Crosby have to flee Melbourne in order to avoid two marriage proposals, and find themselves in Bali, where they find themselves vying for the attention of the princess and are targeted by thieves.” Well, those were the days, all right. Middle-aged white men literally fleeing the country because women wanted to marry them, only to find themselves lusting after an exotic princess. Road to Bali is the penultimate entry of the seven “Road to … ” films starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Not for nothing that the synopsis refers to them simply as Hope and Crosby rather than by their character names – which is something this film franchise surely encouraged, as the actors had different character names in each entry. Road to Bali is not the highest regarded of the series; that’s probably Road to Morocco, which even earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. But due to a copyright renewal snafu, Road to Bali entered public domain in 1980. So, it is technically the most “accessible” of the films in that multiple cheap DVDs and online prints exist, and you can appreciate it without having seen the other entries. There’s plenty of quarantine streaming fun to be had, traveling with this bickering pair of goofs as they make their way from Melbourne to Bali, and despite being a 1952 comedy, shot on studio backlots with what looks like stock photography establishing shots, there’s still a vicarious travel itch to be scratched given our current predicament. As the synopsis suggests, plot is nothing more than an excuse to create a string of humorous set pieces featuring visual gags, snappy one-liners and lively song-and-dance numbers. What the synopsis withholds is that the film also involves deep sea diving with giant squid, lovesick gorillas in mourning and head-shrinking cannibals. Happy trails! A remarkable quality of the Road to … series is they have so much fun acknowledging the artifice of film-making. The repeated breaking of the fourth wall addresses everything from the film’s silly structure to the actors’ real-life personas to Paramount, the studio releasing the film, in a way that suggests a curious place between highbrow self-reflexivity and lowbrow shoddiness. Sure, it all feels born out of vaudeville more than Brecht, but that’s not to say there isn’t something modernist about intercutting a clip of Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen, or having Hope’s character awake from unconsciousness and ask: “What happened? Is the picture over?” Alas, there are some icky matters – both on screen and off screen – to contend with in order to watch Road to Bali in modern day. Several of the supporting actors here would be excommunicated if they tried to wear these costumes on Halloween, and the gender politics are definitely a product of their time. There’s also the behind-the-scenes injustice for the film’s third lead, Dorothy Lamour. Despite her role in the success of the previous five films and her significant screen time in this film, Lamour worked for salary while Hope and Crosby enjoyed cuts of the profits. That wasn’t enough, though, when the gang reunited for the last time on Road to Hong Kong, Lamour was replaced by the younger Joan Collins. Which is all a shame because Lamour’s comic timing and athletic dance moves are a key reason these films work as well as they do. Credit is also due to Crosby’s frequent collaborators – the music and lyrics duo of Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke – who contribute everything from toe tappers to swooning ballads here. But like any buddy comedy, it ultimately comes down to the on-screen chemistry between the buddies. Hope and Crosby are a match made in Hollywood heaven. Watching Road to Bali – and other titles in the series – you can see how much they prefigure the high-concept buddy comedies of Coming to America or Wedding Crashers several decades later. Reports differ on how much was scripted and how much was ad-libbed, but the resulting repartee feels akin to both tightly scripted screwball comedy and the loose freewheeling improvisation of The Trip. As much as there’s an ongoing rat-a-tat-tat competition between the two characters, there’s a sweetness to their relationship, which one can imagine is as true of the performers as it is the characters. At a moment late in the film when things are looking grim, the two console each other: “At least we’re going out together.” The moment is surprisingly wistful, and not entirely played for humor. Of course, this is just for a beat. Then, it’s swiftly back to madcap pratfalls and wordplay, but not before they’re given one more reflection: “We’ve had a lot of laughs.”",film
"French-Algerian film-maker Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche sends us a dispatch from a civil war with Terminal Sud, an intriguing, somewhat abstract drama about a country descending into chaos. The facts on the ground here seem to tally with the Algerian civil war of the 90s, the so called “black decade” that claimed more than 100,000 lives. But the film was mostly shot in southern France, and Ameur-Zaïmeche doesn’t hide contemporary details such as mobiles and new-model SUVs. He has said in interviews that the point is to make it universal: this could happen any time, anywhere. The approach isn’t entirely convincing, and the unfocused sense of time and place is a bit distracting and frustrating at times. But there is real power to many of the scenes. The film is told in fragments as an oppressive government strengthens its grip. It opens with a minibus stopped at a military checkpoint, the passengers held up and robbed. By soldiers or a rebel group disguised in army uniforms? Who knows. The city is a wild west. Men in balaclavas drive around in unmarked vans gunning down journalists and dragging suspects off the streets. The camera’s attention is often drawn unexpectedly away from the main event. When a man is tortured in a military prison, Ameur-Zaïmeche spends as much time watching the torturer limber up – psyching himself up like an athlete – as he does on the interrogation. Holding all these moments together is a deeply charismatic, towering performance by French comedian Ramzy Bedia. There are other doctors in the rundown hospital where he works, but he is the Doctor, a great slab of man built like a farmer, gentle and tender with his patients. He tells everyone that he is neutral but then death threats arrive. The film gathers in force the more time he is in front of the camera.",film
"“You’re mine until you get married,” says Bill Murray’s instantly recognisable voice in the opening of this bittersweet tale of fathers and daughters, husbands and wives. “Then you’re still mine.” It’s a refrain that echoes throughout writer-director Sofia Coppola’s very enjoyable (and deceptively deep) seventh feature, a film that knowingly lifts riffs from screwball capers and melancholy romcoms alike, writing love letters to the city of New York as it swirls from one upmarket fairytale locale to the next. Rashida Jones is Laura, a thirtysomething writer struggling to juggle creativity and childcare, who comes to doubt the fidelity of her husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans). A preponderance of business trips and an unexpectedly abridged nocturnal encounter make Laura wonder whether Dean’s thoughts are elsewhere. But it’s her perennial playboy father, Felix (Murray), who really sets alarm bells ringing, telling his daughter that all men are the same (ie they’re all like him) and gleefully insisting that they take joint action to uncover Dean’s potential duplicitousness. What follows is a whimsically comedic adventure in which Felix and Laura pursue Dean around the city (and even to Mexico), while swapping sassy Nora Ephron-style observations about the differences between men and women, with an added generation-gap edge, like Father of the Bride crossed with When Harry Met Sally. Having earned an Oscar nomination for his lead role in Coppola’s 2003 hit Lost in Translation, Murray is once again on deliciously deadpan form as the ageing lothario who has spent his life chasing women, yet longs to be loved by the daughter he idolises. For Felix, the suggestion that Laura’s marriage may indeed be on the rocks is a perverse form of wish-fulfilment, offering an excuse for him to step into the fray, imparting outdated lessons about life and love and while grandstanding as a sleuth-cum-spy, a role he’s clearly enjoying too much. Jones (who coincidentally played a dejected bride being offered fatherly advice in Coppola’s 2015 Netflix production A Very Murray Christmas) is brilliant as the writer blocked by the pressures of parenthood, whose anxieties about her husband reflect deeper worries about her own worth – her life, her talent, her achievements. That these worries should be rooted in (and fed by) a lifetime of Felix’s philandering is something Coppola’s script explores with a deceptive lightness of touch. Scenes of Dad charming traffic cops while Laura rolls her eyes are great fun (“It must be very nice to be you”), but more telling is her embarrassment when he comes on to the waitress or, worse, to one of her daughter’s ballet teachers. When Felix casually declares that he’s become deaf to the sound of women’s voices (“it’s the pitch”), Coppola cuts to the heart of the matter, forcing Laura to finally stand her ground and to remind him that “you have daughters and granddaughters, so you’d better start figuring out how to hear them”. Lovingly shot by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, who worked on Coppola’s dreamy-looking remake of The Beguiled, On the Rocks is very easy on the eye, with bangles, bracelets and watches used to illustrate an underlying theme of ownership as we flit from Raoul’s bistro in SoHo to Midtown’s 21 Club, taking in the table where Bogie proposed to Bacall. Jenny Slate makes the most of a recurrent (and very funny) psychobabbling cameo, while on the soundtrack, the dusty tones of Chet Baker spar with the French electropop of Phoenix, embodying the film’s blend of dewy nostalgia and clear-eyed modernity. On the Rocks is in cinemas now and from 23 October on Apple TV+",film
"Our latest Guardian Documentary is an unusual collaboration. Three independent Belarusian film-makers reacted to the country-wide protests by turning their cameras on themselves and their communities. Taken together, these three portraits offer a rare glimpse into life in a country in the throes of political upheaval. Belarus has only ever had one president, and Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the position since 1994, declared victory again in elections on 9 August with a contested 80% of the vote. The widespread protests that followed have been ruthlessly suppressed by security forces. Filmed in the first 10 days after the disputed election, we see both pain and hope in the story of a film-maker, a psychologist and a broadcast journalist forced to retire. Here we talk to the three film-makers about making the documentary: How do you see your role as a film-maker at a time like this? Maksim Shved: I would call the situation in my country a time of breakthrough transformations or even revolution. It’s an interesting, albeit cruel moment, which as a film-maker I felt compelled to capture. Ekaterina Markavets: When I was waiting for my fellow film-maker, director Maksim Shved, to come out of prison after being arrested filming the protests, I met a psychologist there who came to the prison to offer people psychological help. It was 2am and there were many other volunteers there on the street near the prison. It really impressed me how people rallied around a common grief. Later I found out that Belarusian psychologists had united and opened a hotline to help people to receive psychological help for free. So I decided to make a film about empathy because when we empathise with each other, it becomes easier for us to overcome these difficult moments. I was also very interested to know how psychologists themselves feel, how do they cope with all the dramatic stories they hear during the day. Andrei Kutsila: I wasn’t planning to shoot a film about the events during the elections in Belarus – I don’t like political topics in films – but the violence by the authorities against civilians forced me to pick up my camera. And more personally, my sister and her husband were driving along in Minsk on 11 August when the car was suddenly shot at and rammed. They were detained and spent several days in a prison with about 11,000 other peaceful people. What else could I do but pick up my camera? Maksim, we see in your film (part 1) that you were arrested and held in prison. What was that experience like? MS: In the five days I was in prison it was an informational vacuum and I could not have imagined what I’d see when I got out. Hundreds of happy people welcomed our car with national flags. It was unbelievable. I was shocked and presumed the protesters had won, that the dictatorship was broken. However, I came to realise that it’s not that easy and Lukashenko is not going to renounce his power. Now after seven weeks of confrontation, the emotional rollercoaster for most people has ended. We understand that changes will not be quick, but that we need to preserve our energy for local everyday activities and the big Sunday marches. There is still a lot of energising creativity and solidarity. Andrei, in your film (part 3) we meet Ksenia Baharava, a grandmother and broadcast journalist who worked for state TV for nearly 40 years. We meet her in hospital, where she is recovering from significant injuries sustained at a protest. And yet she seems hopeful for the future? AK: Most people’s mood is going up and down, like mine. But more and more people understand that it is impossible to live with this president. His contract with society is broken, and yet he is still holding on to power. Violence has become his only tool. We all try to believe in the best and our hopes are heightened when more countries do not recognise Lukashenko as a legitimate president. Ekaterina, in your film (part 2) we see the results of this climate of fear and trauma through these conversations with psychologist Alexei Zarybov. EK: The heroes of my film reflect the general mood of Belarusians: we all seem to be standing above a thundercloud. Everyone has paranoia and many people have an irresistible desire to leave the country because our rights are violated as if they do not exist at all. I feel that Belarusians have become fearless because we understand that if we remain silent they will simply grind us to dust. The only thing that we have and that helps us survive now is an empathy for each other. People almost immediately agreed to let me film their therapy sessions. And it was important for me to show different stories: to film the mother of the beaten man as well as the man who was beaten; and the mother of two children who despite not being physically affected by the protests was preparing herself for emigration, which puts her in a moral dilemma but she feels unable to continue to live in Belarus. What is your hope for the future?  EK: It seems to me that the Belarusian authorities are trying to do everything to intimidate people. I hope that everything will change, the power will change, and people will be able to heal their traumas, survive all this stress ... and once again visit a psychologist to talk about the usual trials and tribulations of life, like falling in love or getting angry with their boss. I hope that soon we can get back to normal life. What impact do you hope this film will have? MS: I’ve shared my story to ask questions that I’m also putting to myself right now and to show there are no simple answers. I’m pleased that people in the world can hear a more inspiring story about Belarus than just it’s “the last dictatorship in Europe”. More about the film-makers: Maksim Shved was born in 1979 in Minsk, Belarus. After graduating from Law Department of the Belarusian State University he decided to study directing. He graduated from St Petersburg high school of directors and dcreenwriters in 2013 and Wajda school (documentary programme) in 2016. Now he directs documentary series for television. Ekaterina Markavets was born in 1986 in Minsk, Belarus. She studied at Audio-Visual Journalism at the Belarusian State University. She began her career in documentary film with television journalism and has participated in many international workshops on documentary film directing. Andrei Kutsila was born in Baranovichi, Belarus in 1983. In 2007 he earned his degree in international journalism from the Belarusian State University and two years later he graduated from the Belarusian Academy of Fine Arts in Minsk. Since then he has collaborated with various producers and TV stations as a freelance filmmaker and participated in many international education programmes (including IDFAcademy and Berlinale Talents). In 2018 he won the IDFA award in the best medium-length documentary film category for Summa. You can read more of the Guardian’s coverage of Belaurs here. Watch more Guardian Documentaries here.

"The events explored in this electrifying courtroom drama – the trial of a high-profile group of defendants on charges relating to anti-Vietnam protests during the 1968 Democratic national convention – unfolded more than half a century ago. But there’s a stinging currency here that cuts through the wafting patchouli and tie dye and makes for a forcefully contemporary and relevant piece of film-making. This is partly because of a particularly satisfying marriage between the subject matter and the showy talents of the film’s writer and director, Aaron Sorkin. Unapologetically partisan in his politics, Sorkin the writer is in his element dealing with material with a message and an articulate ensemble cast with which to deliver it. And as a director, he sheds the needy pyrotechnics that rather detracted from his directorial debut, Molly’s Game, leaning instead on the crisp editing skills of Alan Baumgarten and superb work across the board from his cast. Of the latter, Mark Rylance is on cracking, abrasive form as defence attorney William Kunstler and, playing Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman, Sacha Baron Cohen aces a rare dramatic role. But mainly, the film feels timely because it is timely. It unfolds on the frontline of a culture war that rages still. For a country that places such value on freedom of speech, America had, and still has, a prickly relationship with dissent. The trial, as Hoffman is at pains to point out, is politically motivated. It’s a flex on the part of attorney general John Mitchell (John Doman), partly intended to kick out the foundations of the countercultural movement by jailing its figureheads. And partly it’s Mitchell’s sniping retort to a perceived slight by his predecessor, Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton).By lumping all the defendants together, the case reveals the schisms between them, tensions that Sorkin teases out with wit and relish. Clean-cut idealist Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) has little time for the stoner stunts of Hoffman and Yippie co-defendant Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong). Radical pacifist David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) is “literally a boy scout leader”. John Froines and Lee Weiner have no idea why they are being charged, but in the “Academy awards of protest, it’s an honour just to be nominated”. But it’s the treatment of the eighth man on trial, Black Panther Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), that gives the film its sobering gravity. Seale’s case is eventually declared a mistrial, but not before he is subjected to racism and humiliation at the behest of the judge. A harrowing scene in which Seale is shackled and gagged is both shocking and sickeningly familiar. This is a film that examines both the past and the present day; that plots a path on the common ground between them.",film
"Walt Disney announced it was laying off 28,000 employees from its theme park business on Tuesday, the latest company to announce huge jobs cuts in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The entertainment company blamed limited attendance at the theme parks it has reopened and the continuing closure of others for the “difficult decision”. “As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy,” Josh D’Amaro, head of parks at Disney, wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC. “For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We’ve cut expenses, suspended capital projects, furloughed our cast members while still paying benefits, and modified our operations to run as efficiently as possible, however, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity.” Disney’s theme parks in Florida, Paris, Shanghai, Japan and Hong Kong have been reopened with limited capacity but both its parks in California remain closed as Orange county, home to Disneyland, struggles to meet local health metrics for reopening. The majority of the positions Disney is cutting are part-time. “As heartbreaking as it is to take this action, this is the only feasible option we have in light of the prolonged impact of Covid-19 on our business,” wrote D’Amaro. Disney lost $4.72bn in the three months ended on 27 June, its first quarterly loss in nearly two decades. The reopening of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has also proved disappointing as Covid-19 cases surge in the state. The news follows announcements of other large layoffs from US corporations hit by the pandemic. United Airlines and American Airlines plan to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months as passengers avoid flying. Last week Ralph Lauren announced it was planning to cut 15% of its 24,900 global workforce. On Friday the US labor department will release its latest monthly jobs report. The US is expected to have gained about 850,000 jobs in September, the fifth straight monthly gain. But the rate of recovery appears to be slowing and only about half the jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered.",film
"The next James Bond thriller, No Time to Die, has been delayed yet again as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The 25th instalment of the spy franchise was originally scheduled to open in April 2020 but when cinemas shuttered, it was pushed back to November. With the box office still not back to normal, the film has been pushed to 2 April 2021. This weekend is currently occupied by Fast & Furious 9 which was also delayed from a 2020 release. “We understand the delay will be disappointing to our fans but we now look forward to sharing No Time To Die next year,” a statement from MGM, Universal and the Bond producers, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, read. No Time to Die is set to be Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007 and will see him up against the Oscar-winner Rami Malek as the villain with returning cast members Naomie Harris, Léa Seydoux and Christoph Waltz. The news follows other tentpole films also moving off their dates after disappointing returns for Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, which has reached over $280m internationally but only $41m in the US, where cinemas in the three main markets – New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco – remain shuttered. A week after Tenet’s release, Warner chose to push Wonder Woman 1984 from October to Christmas (it was originally intended for a summer bow), an early sign of things to come. Soon after, Disney followed up with a long list of changes: Black Widow was pushed from its new November date to next summer with fellow Marvel adventures The Eternals and Shang-Chi also following, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story was moved back an entire year to next Christmas and Kenneth Branagh’s Death on the Nile was edged back by two months. This week also saw Warner announce that Robert Zemeckis’s remake of The Witches, starring Anne Hathaway, would be premiering on HBO Max in the US, the latest of many digital bows for films originally intended for the big screen.",film
"The Ghostbusters and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids star Rick Moranis has been the victim of a street attack in New York City. Footage shows the 67-year-old actor assaulted by an unknown assailant on Thursday morning while walking near his apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The NYPD have referred to the attack as “random” and “unprovoked”. Moranis then went to hospital for an evaluation, suffering pain in his head, back and hip, according to the NYPD. He then reported the attack. “He is fine but grateful for everyone’s thoughts and well wishes” a representative for Moranis said in a statement. Police are now searching for the suspect who fled the scene. The actor’s Hollywood peers have shared their support on Twitter, including Marvel star Chris Evans who wrote: “My blood is boiling. Find this man. You don’t touch Rick Moranis.” Writer-director Judd Apatow also tweeted: “This the worst news of the last two days … This is why Rick Moranis avoided our country for decades. I guess he was right all along. We don’t deserve him.” Moranis, who was a mainstay of 80s and 90s comedies, had been largely absent from the big screen after focusing his time on being a single father after the death of his first wife. His last notable film role was in 1997’s Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. In 2006 he was nominated for the best comedy album Grammy for The Agoraphobic Cowboy. Recently, he had signed on for a Disney+ sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids alongside Josh Gad and appeared in an ad for a mobile phone company with fellow Canadian Ryan Reynolds.",film
"Not now, haunted house horrors! Never has the prospect of watching a movie about being confined to your home and beset by unseen terrors seemed less like escapism. We’ll soon see if the pandemic has sharpened our appetite for haunted house movies or put us right off them, as they seem to be the theme of this Halloween – and almost all of them centre on women. That’s not such a surprise, really. Unlike so many areas, ghost stories and houses of horror have been almost a haven for women, on the page and on screen. You could reason that the domestic realm was seen as a female space, and the natural receptacle for female writers’ explorations of things repressed and unspeakable. Some critics have ventured that female authors identified with ghosts – invisible figures struggling to exert an influence on reality. Fittingly, their works refuse to die. Exhibit A would be the ever-adaptable Daphne du Maurier, and Netflix’s lavish new version of her 1938 classic Rebecca, the tale of a naive young newlywed haunted by her predecessor when she moves into her husband’s imposing ancestral home. Director Ben Wheatley has his work cut out following in Alfred Hitchcock’s footsteps, although his and Jane Goldman’s adaptation is working from the original text (Hitch made some softening alterations), and the prospect of Kristin Scott Thomas as the icy housekeeper Mrs Danvers is just irresistible. Then we get to Shirley Jackson, who gave us one of the most terrifying entries in the genre: The Haunting of Hill House (again, the story concerns alienated women shackled to their home), which became one of the most terrifying movies, Robert Wise’s The Haunting (Netflix’s 2018 spin-off series is also pretty good). Josephine Decker’s disorienting new movie Shirley (led by Elisabeth Moss on top form) finds some sort of parallel in Jackson’s own strange domestic setup, as the disturbed, depressive novelist and her creepy husband play twisted psychosexual games with the couple who lodge with them. In recent movies we have already been seeing a new strain of hauntings, connected to more contemporary anxieties. New Australian horror Relic, for example, gathers three generations of women in a creaky old house where nothing is stable, especially the floorplan. But the spectre haunting them could be seen as dementia, which is claiming grandma and, by extension, coming for her descendants. It is of a piece with recent classics such as The Babadook and Hereditary, where the sources of the terror are not so much in the past as the present, or even the future. Who knows if or how Covid will find its way into this eerie realm, but it is already making life resemble a haunted house horror a lot more. ",film
"Coverage of Cineworld’s decision to temporarily close all of its UK cinemas has, understandably, focused on the impact on employees and potential longer-term consequences for the medium. But the immediate future for Bollywood in the UK now looks particularly bleak, given that Cineworld venues host more than half of all Bollywood screenings in the UK, presenting between 40 and 50 different films a year. The prospect of reduced takings in the UK is being felt in Mumbai, where the industry relies on the territory for a sizeable chunk of its overseas revenue. “Cineworld has played an important part in bringing Indian films to the UK,” says Vikram Malhotra, CEO of production company Abundantia Entertainment, whose films include Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Shakuntala Devi. “Most Indian films have released via Cineworld. It’s an unprecedented situation and revenues from overseas markets will surely be impacted as Cineworld goes non-operational. “With the Indian cinema industry just starting to return to theatrical releases, and considering the importance of the UK market for overseas business, the loss of Cineworld will be felt widely across the industry.” Twenty years ago, Bollywood distribution in the UK was very much on the fly. If you wanted to catch the latest film, you had to find a grainy copy in one of the video shops tucked between the halal butchers and vegetable markets in the country’s bigger cities. That all changed in the late 90s with the rise of the multiplex, which enabled cinemas to broaden their horizons beyond mainstream Hollywood fare and explore fresh ways of luring in new audiences. Cineworld was still in its infancy, with only 14 venues, when it was approached by two Bollywood production companies about showing their films. It was very much an experiment for the brand, but with many of its cinemas located in mutlicultural areas, it had a ready-made market on the doorstep. And with up to 20 screens available, a venue could easily afford to spare a screen on a quiet midweek evening. The move came during a heyday for big-budget Bollywood blockbusters made for the big screen, when stars such as Shah Rukh Khan were in their ascendency and their films created the same buzz among Bollywood fans as a new Marvel adventure. “Back then, no Bollywood films were being released in the UK, so we took a chance and started playing the films at two locations,” says Stuart Crane, head of film programming at Cineworld. “We put the shows into screens of 150 seats to test the waters, but it soon became clear this was an audience that had been underrepresented for far too long. We would have weekends where our top three films in these cinemas were all Bollywood films, and would be making considerably more than most of the Hollywood product. “I think at the moment most Bollywood companies are struggling to get films made and released in general. Even when we re-opened in July we couldn’t get hold of any of the back catalogue films as the majority of the companies had employees on furlough, or were just simply closed down.” The UK diaspora became an unexpected goldmine for Cineworld and in the early 2000s, Bollywood films accounted for 20% of Cineworld’s screens. Its venues in Feltham and Ilford were the top two cinemas in Europe for Bollywood titles and Cineworld began to hold star-studded premieres. Soon, Bollywood films were creeping up the box office top 10, snapping on the heels of Hollywood blockbusters. At its peak, In 2010, My Name is Khan played in more than a third of Cineworld’s screens in its opening weekend, taking £2.6m at the UK box office “It’s the sort of numbers you would expect from a Marvel movie,” says Crane. “Even now, especially during Eid and Diwali, you can have a big Bollywood film go up against almost any Hollywood film and we’d be putting the Bollywood film in the bigger screens.” With several highly anticipated recent releases bypassing the cinema and going straight to streaming services, including Gulabo Sitabo starring Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan, many in the industry fear that Bollywood will struggle to regain the overseas foothold of its pre-Covid days. Asim Abbasi’s film Cake looked to the chain for more than half its UK exhibition. “I don’t think other cinemas provide a strong enough alternative so it will definitely be impacting Bollywood films outright and when you factor in the pandemic, it becomes a very difficult proposition to release a film with the fees and marketing costs in the UK.”",film
"“To save a soul, that’s quite something.” So says Maud, the newly God-fearing subject of Rose Glass’s electrifying debut feature, which establishes the writer-director as a thrilling new talent in British cinema. Charting a razor-sharp course between the borders of horror, satire, psychodrama and lonely character study (Taxi Driver has been cited as an influence), Saint Maud is a taut, sinewy treat, blessed with an impressively fluid visual sensibility and boosted by two quite brilliant central performances. Morfydd Clark, who demonstrated such perfect comic timing in Armando Iannucci’s The Personal History of David Copperfield, is astonishing as the titular private carer nursing Jennifer Ehle’s Amanda, a once-celebrated dancer now facing the spectre of death. Maud’s duties are primarily physical: cooking, cleaning, administering medication and basic physiotherapy. But having recently started talking to God (shades of Emily Watson’s Bess McNeill from Breaking the Waves), Maud is convinced that she has been sent to Amanda with a purpose – to save her from herself. There’s a touch of Shirley Jackson about the Edwardian gothic hilltop house in which Amanda broods away her days, incarcerated yet still holding court. When she calls Maud her “saviour”, it’s hard to tell whether wonder or contempt lurk behind Ehle’s enigmatically wry smile. Yet Maud, who is haunted by flashbacks, is not as innocent as she first seems. Behind the prim exterior lies a fiery passion that is desperately searching for a purpose, a purpose she thinks she has found in nun-like mortifications of the flesh and in seizures that recall the ecstatic raptures of Saint Teresa of Ávila. In the US, where A24 has theatrical distribution rights, Saint Maud has been trailed as “from the studio that brought you The Witch, Hereditary and Midsommar”. Yet this British production is actually closer in tone to such German offerings as Hans-Christian Schmid’s 2006 masterpiece Requiem (inspired by the tragic real-life case of Anneliese Michel), or Dietrich Brüggemann’s Stations of the Cross (2014) in which spiritual sacrifice mingles with self-harm. Like those films, Saint Maud has at its centre a troubled young woman who comes to believe that God (or maybe the devil?) is working through her, a possibility that crucially is not disavowed. Instead, Glass concentrates on how that belief comes to manifest itself, on the isolation of a character out of step with the rest of the world and for whom the anarchically religious illustrations of William Blake strike a rebellious chord. None of which is to suggest that Saint Maud isn’t scary – it is! I’ve seen it three times and on each viewing I have found myself physically startled by beautifully orchestrated key moments, although crucially it has been an entirely different moment (a fleetingly contorted face here, an unexpectedly guttural voice there) that has caused that reaction each time. So subtly does Glass negotiate the shifts between intimate kitchen-sink pathos and shrieking supernatural surrealism, often within the space of a single scene, that Saint Maud seems to takes on a shape-shifting quality as it slips between the inner and outer realms of Maud’s experience. Plaudits to cinematographer Ben Fordesman (who cites Persona and Repulsion as visual references) and production designer Paulina Rzeszowska for conjuring the strangely timeless shadowy netherworld in which Maud and Amanda conduct their danse macabre, and to composer Adam Janota Bzowski, whose eerily prowling score weaves in and out of Paul Davies’s affecting sound designs. Great, too, to see physical effects (including a sly prosthetic nod to John Carpenter’s The Thing) blended with unobtrusive computer graphics to bring us into the spiralling whirlpool of Maud’s world, a world that will haunt you long after the credits have rolled.",film
"The English actress Samantha Morton, star of the hit television series Harlots and The Walking Dead, has publicly apologised for threatening the life of a young girl with a knife when she was 14. Morton, 43, said she wanted to “set the record straight a little bit” on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. The Oscar-nominated star was “incredibly sorry” about the incident, which led to her being charged with attempted murder and spending three days in solitary confinement in an adult cell block. She was convicted of threats to kill after she had confronted an older girl who had been bullying at the care home where they both lived. “I was mortified,” she said. “And I’m sorry to her. We were all abused. She was a child herself. Nobody looked after us properly. We were rioting in that home because they were locking the fridges at night. We were not safe.” One night on returning to the care home from a rave at which she had taken drugs, Morton saw a nine-year-old boy who she believed had been “pimped” by the bully. “I snapped and said I was going to kill her,” Morton said. “I didn’t harm her, I didn’t touch her, but I said those words. And I regret it and I am sorry.” Moved between care homes and foster families in Nottinghamshire, she also recalled her own attempt to put a stop to abuse. On a visit to her mother, who had suffered mental illness, she revealed she had been abused by a carer. The police were involved, but Morton, who was moved away to another care home, believes the two members of staff accused were merely demoted. She said she now feels “absolute forgiveness” and thinks many of those working in the care system in the 1980s were admirable, with only some abusing their positions of power. Expelled from school three times, Morton discovered her acting skills when a sympathetic teacher encourage her to audition for a drama workshop run by Central TV. It led to a role as a runaway in the television series Peak Practice. Morton has been acclaimed since then for a body of work that includes a key role in the film Minority Report and her own award-winning directorial debut, The Unloved, based on her time in care. She earned Oscar nominations for Woody Allen’s 1999 Sweet and Lowdown and for road drama In America in 2003, but reveals this high-profile recognition meant little when she was young, although it opened doors for her in the industry. She has come to consider awards ceremonies to be commercially debased, she admits. “These things are so branded now that it takes it away from the individuals. Nowadays you can’t get an Oscar without running a campaign. Back then it was more on merit, I suppose.” ",film
"The infamous 1978 exploitation-revenge flick I Spit on Your Grave – one-time “video nasty” and chosen by critic Roger Ebert as his all-time worst film – now gets a lengthy retrospective and reappraisal here courtesy of its director Meir Zarchi’s son, Terry. Perhaps the current febrile atmosphere – split between rampant online misogyny and strident #MeToo calls – is the right moment. Zarchi Sr is nonplussed in being asked to justify the 30 minutes of gang rape; he describes his film, with its second-half procession of wince-making retribution slayings, as simply “biblical – an eye for an eye”. Whether Terry Zarchi is persistent, or sophisticated enough, in questioning that belief is another thing. The director and cast were upset when, after struggling to sell the film, distributor Jerry Gross changed its title from Day of the Woman and sexed up the new poster (with Demi Moore, rather than actor Camille Keaton, supposedly providing the image). Which makes you wonder what kind of film they thought they were making. This is not high art, even if the sheer crudeness of staging and performance is what gives the film its brutish glow, and inflamed its critics. Zarchi Jr, though, has an unfortunate tendency to treat it like Tarkovsky. Detailing every nook and cranny of the production, the documentary is longer than the original film. Terry Zarchi may be right in drawing attention to the fact that such female-revenge narratives were unusual at the time, running counter to the reality that rape was often not taken seriously by the authorities – including the incident that Zarchi Sr says inspired him to to make the film, when, in the early 70s, he rescued a girl who staggered out of a New York park after being sexually assaulted. Now they are a familiar trope, from Kill Bill to Coralie Fargeat’s Revenge. Whether or not these films constitute feminism is a debate still raging. Zarchi Jr doesn’t fully prise open the discussion, leaving it to a panel of viewers – fans and detractors – to cast their ballots. (His attempt at impartiality is undermined by the family love-in tone he increasingly adopts, including towards Keaton for whom his father left his mother.) The rape survivor who is vociferously pro-Spit probably gets the deciding vote. ",film
"‘Have you ever had someone tell your story, take your voice … and replace your face until no one else can see or hear you?” These are the powerful words that Nigerian actor/director Genevieve Nnaji speaks to introduce the Netflix initiative Made By Africa, Watched By the World. Mixing new, original content with older African classics that have not previously been streamed elsewhere, this initiative, much like Strong Black Lead (2018), aims to showcase content that centres black stories but – unlike Strong Black Lead – it will be by and about Africans. It creates a path for stories that specifically address different slices of the African experience to see the light of day and reach a wider audience. Considering that there’s a growing feeling among Africans that inaccurate representation on screen is a given, that’s a good thing for everyone. So what does Made By Africa, Watched By the World give us? Netflix has purchased previously produced content and also produced its own, both TV shows and films. Kagiso Lediga and Pearl Thusi have followed up their 2018 romantic drama Catching Feelings with a TV show, Queen Sono, about an undercover spy, that premiered earlier this year. Nick Mutuma’s coming of age drama, Sincerely Daisy, is having its highly anticipated premiere on Friday, while other Kenyan films – Tosh Gitonga’s romcom Disconnect and Tom Whitworth’s Poacher – have also found a home on Netflix. Whatever you may think of the streaming platform, for African film-makers such as myself, Netflix is a lifeline. Here in Nairobi, one of the many problems film-makers face is the lack of active film distributors. After a film is made there is no way to market it or get it into cinemas, unless you go massively out of pocket. It is pretty much the same throughout the sub-Saharan continent – with the exception of Nigeria, which had a distribution boom in the early 2000s via videotapes and video compact discs, and South Africa, which has a far more modernised system with major distributors such as Ster-Kinekor and United International Pictures. Both have major limitations: these distributors essentially act as local representatives of major Hollywood studios and don’t market locally made films outside the country, and while Nigerian films did cross their borders, piracy meant they were greatly hampered. The wider reality is that Africanness in cinema has become an identity to play with. Hollywood tends to treat Africa as a homogenous location with unspecified cultures and accents. While we Africans can admire Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s Black Is King or Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther, the wall-to-wall fan adulation in the west doesn’t tell the full story. African audiences know these films get accents wrong and don’t accurately portray their traditions and cultures. For the most part, these stories are targeted at the black American experience, and to amplify their nuances and concerns. The black American experience may overlap with what African audiences consider relatable, but for the most part the social and especially political concerns do not entirely mesh. Netflix has other problems, too. It is a vast sea of content where films without big-name casts and directors may end up being lost in the mix. Lulu Wang said it best: “[The streamers] are building their brand, and when you are an established film-maker, you are a brand that they want to partner with to help build their own brand. But with newer film-makers, newer voices, you don’t have a brand.” Netflix is attempting to break its own logjam, but if it doesn’t back these African film-makers with the marketing they need, they will still struggle to find a wider audience.",film
"Unlike many actors, Peter Sarsgaard got some work during lockdown: an 11-minute short, shot by his wife, Maggie Gyllenhaal, on their rural estate in Vermont. Penelope, now on Netflix, is the strange, moving story of a widowed farmer, facing a sad future, broken only by a delirious evening humping a tree. “I’m never going to look at that tree in the same way again, and I don’t think that tree will ever look at me in the same way again,” says Sarsgaard. He’s on lockdown again with his family, this time in Greece, where they are shooting Gyllenhaal’s directing debut proper, an adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter. “That was the first thing Maggie told me about Penelope. She said: ‘I want you making love to a tree.’ And I was like” – a resigned sigh – “Oh, whatever. I’ll do it!” A dendrophiliac farmer is one of Sarsgaard’s less unusual roles. It is 25 years since he made his movie debut, as Sean Penn’s murder victim in Dead Man Walking. (Penn, “an inclusive, gentle guy”, took him out for dinner to apologise.) Since then, his signature role has been something sinister, or at least unsettling, making use of his purring voice and ever-narrowing eyes. He was an amiable sociopath in Boys Don’t Cry, the mad patricidal scientist in Green Lantern. When he first on Zoom he suddenly looms, darkly lit with a ginormous fuzzy beard, sitting against the rails of a cheap-looking bedhead; a creepy Rip Van Winkle stuck in a low-budget Airbnb. But any whiff of evil is soon dispelled by a big, affable smile. Are people often scared off by his CV?  “People like it! People like the bad guy. Because these are all thoughts and feelings that people have inside of them. Look at what gets the ratings just in terms of the news: people are interested in murder, they’re interested in disaster. This is some part of human nature, and it might be a distasteful one, but it doesn’t really help to ignore it.” That said, he does insist: “I do have a limit. I have turned things down that I thought were awful without any … you know.” Sarsgaard’s character in his latest movie, Veena Sud’s twisty, scary The Lie, is somewhere along the way on the Awful Spectrum. Without giving anything away, he plays Jay, an errant father who has difficult relationships with his ex-wife (Mireille Enos) and his teenage daughter Kayla (Joey King); when Kayla does something awful, the trio’s routine dysfunctionality becomes something properly horrific. Reflecting on Jay, Sarsgaard is mostly appalled at how irresponsible and ill-informed he is as a dad. “I’m a different kind of parent,” he says, “of the suffocating variety.” He knows his children (Ramona, 14, and eight-year-old Gloria) much better than that, he tuts. Parenting is, he says, “really what I’ve always wanted to do – more than acting or any of the other things I do in my life. I enjoy it. I teach my kids music every day” – oboe for Ramona, violin for Gloria. They’re a close family: the last time he shaved a beard off, Ramona kept the trimmings in a pouch for two years before “she realised it was disgusting”. He’s cut back on micromanaging, he says. “I mean, I just read Anna Karenina, and I have two children around me! So I’d say that’s a good sign.” Parts of Sarsgaard, 49, could suggest a certain luvvie self-sufficiency: the arty short films, the beard, the reading Tolstoy in Vermont soundtracked by his daughter’s oboe. He and Gyllenhaal, who married in 2009, also own a brownstone in Brooklyn, showcased in Architectural Digest last year. And yet he also seems bright, generous and self-aware. The son of an air force engineer from Illinois, he moved home more than 10 times before college. He did a play just once at school, aged 10, believing instead that he would play soccer until a succession of concussions literally knocked that on the head. “I wasn’t part of the culture of acting,” he shrugs. “I wasn’t a group person – I’m an only child. So I wasn’t at first interested in the community of theatre.” Did that swiftly change? “Over time,” he settles. “I’ll say this: if there’s some value in me being in the group, I will.” Otherwise? “If the script says that I play a loner guy that comes to town, then I will happily be that guy.” Which may or may not bring us to Sarsgaard’s bat house: a garden sanctuary for as many as 200 bats, much needed in New England, where they are now threatened. “We need bats,” cries Sarsgaard. “We need bats!” Another tragedy of the pandemic is the tainting of their reputation, he thinks. “There are things you shouldn’t do to animals,” he chides, “like maybe eat them raw, or sell them, hang out with them in close proximity. But without bats, the world is gonna really suck.”",film
"The cinema of Korean director Hong Sang-soo is seductively low-key and lo-fi, and his latest is a movie-novella in three encounters. It’s so downbeat, so matter-of-fact, that the registers and nuances are almost beneath the radar of what generally constitutes filmic effect. This really is just people talking, and though they sometimes raise their voices, get angry, embarrassed, or upset, a keynote of polite calm soon reasserts itself. Hong’s camera sedately records each exchange from an undramatic distance, sometimes zooming in for something closer midway through the conversation, but not for any pointed reason. Watching this film means recalibrating your expectations so you can gauge the subtleties and absorb the sotto voce implications about relationships and sexual politics. Pretty much all the way through, nothing very sensational seems to be happening. And yet the movie’s sensational meaning is hiding in plain sight: in the title.Gam-hee is a young woman in Seoul who is a florist by trade, though no great importance is attached to that. She is played by Kim Min-hee, the director’s partner and longtime collaborator, who has acted in seven of his last eight films – but is probably best-known for starring in Park Chan-wook’s 2016 film The Handmaiden, based on Sarah Waters’s novel Fingersmith. Gam-hee has been married for five years, during which time, we learn, she has never been apart from her husband for even a single day. She is at some pains to tell people that she has been fine with this. She says things like: “We manage to have good moments every day”; and “I feel a little love every day and that’s enough.” But now her husband has gone off on a business trip so she is going around visiting some old friends, which evidently hadn’t been possible before. Gam-hee encounters three women in three sections. Young-soon (Seo Young-hwa) is a gentle, sweet-natured and slightly dowdy woman who is now divorced and lives in the countryside outside Seoul raising chickens: the woman next door, to whom the title may or may not allude, has run away, leaving a distraught daughter roaming disturbingly around like a ghost. Next is Su-young (Song Seon-mi), a pilates instructor in the city: she has a crush on a neighbour, but is also being stalked by a young poet, with whom she had a rash one-night-stand. Thirdly, there is Woo-jin (Kim Sae-byuk), who is imagined to be the manager of Seoul’s (real-life) Emu cinema and arts centre. She is a slightly spiky character.The first two encounters are planned but this third meeting, in the cinema’s cafe, is very much accidental: Gam-hee tells Woo-jin that she is here to see a film, but this is clearly a fib. In each case, the female conversation is interrupted, or disrupted, by a man. Young-soon’s neighbour pompously asks her to stop feeding stray cats because his wife has a fear of cats and so can’t leave their apartment. But could this woman’s agoraphobia be connected with her overbearing husband, not the cats? Su-young’s former lover rings on the doorbell and harangues her while she’s trying to tell Gam-hee all about her agreeable flirtation with an older, distinguished man. And after talking to Woo-jin at the arts centre cafe, Gam-hee has a very tense but revealing conversation with a famous novelist and TV personality who is there to give a sold-out reading: Gam-hee was dating this man before she got married.When Gam-hee finally meets her old lover, she can’t help giving him a shrill piece of advice: when he’s on TV, which is a lot, he talks too much. Gam-hee is irritated by his volubility, a symptom of her dismay at his public visibility; he keeps on popping up, gabbling away, while she is trying to concentrate on her new life with her husband. And yet there is every sign that this former relationship with a not-yet-celebrity was no better than the new one.Hong just places these three situations in front of us: muddled, messy, happy-sad. “None of them seems like a crisis, and neither does Gam-hee’s own life. But she might want to run, all the same.",film
"Rennie Davis had come to protest peacefully. The police had come to riot. Wielding batons, they stormed forward yelling, “Kill Davis!” he recalls. He was cracked on the head, knocked to the ground and felt lucky to escape with his life. It could be a scene from this year’s summer of civil unrest in America. In fact it was a demonstration outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago that descended into a violent clash with police and the national guard. The story of Davis and other organisers of the protest is told in The Trial Of The Chicago 7, a film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin that premieres on Netflix on 16 October. Its star-studded cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, Eddie Redmayne and Mark Rylance. In an interview with the Guardian, Davis, 80, says he was not consulted during production of the film and expresses serious reservations about how he and fellow activists are portrayed. But he also welcomes the timeliness of its release. “Coming out at this time is just really perfection,” he says by phone from his home near Boulder, Colorado. “There are some things that I wouldn’t agree with how Sorkin has characterised certain figures in the trial, myself included. But the impact of the movie is there and I certainly endorse and support it.” The tumult of 2020 – a global pandemic, economic crisis, an uprising over racial injustice – has frequently been compared to 1968, when the Vietnam war was raging, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated and major cities were engulfed by violence. From a farm community in Michigan, Davis’s political awakening came in the early 60s. He helped created Students for a Democratic Society, effectively the voice for students in the north. Davis was an activist and community organiser and joined the antiwar movement in around 1965. By the summer of 1968, Americans were dying at a rate of more than 1,000 per month in the worst year of the Vietnam war. Davis became the national coordinator of a coalition of 150 organisations dedicated to nonviolence that went to Chicago. “Our initial plan was to bring 500,000 people to Chicago and it was simply because the mayor refused to grant permits that the numbers reduced, but the result was a police riot. That’s how a presidential commission defined what happened. But it was watched on television by more people than watched the moment the first man landed on the moon. It was incredible.” Eventually the city did grant a permit for a demonstration in Chicago’s Grant Park that was so benign it included parents with babies. Davis remembers that a young person lowered a flag to half-staff, later explaining it as a symbol of international distress. “The police saw the flag coming down and basically came in and beat people as they arrested this person. We had a very highly organised team of close to 4,000 marshals so I was able to put up a human chain where arms were linked. “We faced out towards the police to just bring the whole situation under complete control in a matter of minutes. Then I announced to the police that we have a permit and you can see we are able to secure this properly, so if you could withdraw, that would be in everybody’s best interest, or words to that effect. “That just set off the police and they came crashing in. As they approached me, I literally could hear police yelling, ‘Kill Davis!’ I was hit on the head and knocked to the ground. I was on the ground crawling with my two arms trying to get away and just being clubbed and clubbed and clubbed. I think what saved me that day, honestly, was a little chain fence in the park. I was able to get under the chain fence and it gave me three seconds to get away, stand up and get on the other side. I did pass out for a while.” Davis went to hospital and was given 13 stitches and managed to avoid arrest. “The police realised I was seen as the organiser of this event so they came into the hospital and did a room-by-room search trying to find me to arrest me. One of the most amazing things of the impact we were having on the city is that there were nurses who literally risked their entire career. “This was a county hospital, they were employees of the county, and they put me on a trolley and covered me with a sheet and literally moved me from room to room to evade the police search until I could get to an exit and get out. I did, and didn’t get arrested. It really is amazing. Even today I think: wow, that was some courage there.” But the incoming Richard Nixon administration successfully pushed for the purported ringleaders of the protest – including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and Davis – to be charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. They were originally the “Chicago Eight”, but the case against the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale – who was silenced in court by being bound and gagged – was eventually dropped. A chaotic and raucous trial began in 1969 and forms the backbone of the Netflix movie. Davis continues: “The trial went forward with eight people and, on the opening day, the New York Times said on the front page: ‘This is the most significant political trial in American history’ – and it certainly lived up to its billing. “Certainly none of us want to go to prison for many years, so it’s not to say we weren’t mindful of the likely outcome, but quite honestly this was a group of people, myself included, who really saw the opportunity to basically speak to the country about the Vietnam war. We had different styles and we came from different organisations but, while the movie characterises us as squabbling and fighting a fair amount, it really wasn’t the case.” When the trial ended each day at 4.30pm, the accused, out on bail, would travel far to deliver speeches to crowds of thousands of people. “This was every night with every defendant and people were stamping their feet and screaming. It was really that support of, especially, students that made such a difference. “We also had press conferences at the lunch break that were larger than the press conference at the White House: the entire world press was present in a massive room that could barely hold everybody. All three networks carried our story pretty much as the lead story every single day for six months.” The trial lasted five and a half months. At one point all the defendants read the names of people who lost their lives in Vietnam. Five, including Davis, were found guilty of inciting a riot and all seven, plus their lawyer, were sentenced to prison terms for contempt of court. The convictions were reversed on appeal. Davis became friendly with John Lennon and proposed that the onetime Beatle undertake a 42-city tour to revive the waning antiwar movement and raise funds for local causes. The first was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1971, but was so successful that Nixon tried to to have Lennon deported and the tour was abandoned. Davis still recalls the day when Lennon took him to a recording studio in Manhattan: “Basically the entire audience is just me and Yoko and we sit there and I still don’t know what’s going to happen. John starts and he’s basically recording the final overdub of Imagine. It was really spectacular.” He moved to Colorado and set up a business, consulting to chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. But his counterculture streak also saw him living alone at the bottom of the Grand Canyon for four years. “Today I teach earth whispering, how to basically deepen yourself and become more self aware and things like that. It was largely triggered by that Grand Canyon experience.” Davis is played by Alex Sharp in the movie. Sorkin, known for the White House TV drama The West Wing and the Facebook origin story The Social Network, started writing the screenplay in 2007, but filming did not begin until late 2019. It is his second go in the director’s chair, following Molly’s Game in 2017. Davis has mixed feelings about the finished product. “I was the coordinator of the coalition that went to Chicago and I brought back American prisoners of war from Vietnam at a time when places where I was living were being bombed by US military. In the movie, I’m made out to be a complete nerd who’s afraid of his own shadow.” He adds: “Sorkin was seven years old when the trial was occurring and clearly had no understanding of the defendants or, maybe more importantly, the tens of millions of people that were just passionately supporting us.” Half a century later, Donald Trump is again swimming against the tide of public opinion, according to every poll, by playing down police brutality and using the Nixon “law and order” playbook to seek re-election. Hoffman, Rubin and Hayden are no longer alive but for Davis, the echoes are inescapable. “Of course, there are very decent police officers in every state but the systemic racism in the police department just can’t be denied. “It’s very similar to the anti-war movement. There was a period where the protests represented a segment of society but gradually the anti-war movement came to represent the majority of society and that’s exactly what I see happening now. It is Black Lives Matter but it’s also the women’s movement and the youth movement and the environmental movement and the Extinction Rebellion movement and how they see themselves as basically being, in a way, one voice. “They don’t have the kind of coalition that we had in the 60s but I suspect that’s going to be coming. As we move towards this kind of authoritarian tendency in the government – and the government just has really lost his way – the greatest hope right now is that movement, just as it was in the 60s.”",film
"Months after the initial Covid-19 restrictions closed all cinemas, Australian moviegoers are beginning to return for socially distanced screenings across most of the country. But with most major international releases delayed, the large chains that rely on blockbusters face an uncertain future. And for independent operators, more accustomed to showing reruns of classics and local titles, the outlook is not much clearer. As indoor attendance restrictions ease in states other than Victoria, some in the industry are confident Australians who have tired of lockdowns and streamed TV series will return to cinemas for the traditionally busy end-of-year period. But operators who are still paying rent and staff, now with a smaller contribution from jobkeeper, worry that revenue may not return quickly enough to save them all. In 2019, Australia’s 524 cinemas – with 2,310 screens and 439,772 seats – recorded about 85m admissions, generating $1.23bn in box office revenue, according to Screen Australia data. IBISWorld’s William Chapman says: “Australians have been pretty reliable cinema-goers, but as the cinemas can seat more people, will they want to see the films on offer?” In a report on Australia’s cinema industry in April, the senior analyst made the bleak prediction that forced closures would drive down revenue, while Australians in lockdown flocked to the streaming platforms.  Chapman has since been analysing box office data covering the periods when cinemas have been able to reopen with reduced capacities – shaped by different indoor gathering restrictions in various states. He predicts box office revenue in 2020 will be about 25% of the 2019 figure, and expects to see aggressive tactics to draw Australians back in over the coming months. “I think cinema operators will definitely look at discounting tickets, and promotion offers, to try and entice people back,” he says. Before the pandemic, about two-thirds of a cinema’s revenue came from the box office, while food and drink accounted for about 20%, with the remainder coming from advertising. While Australia has so far been spared the wholesale closure of multiplexes seen in the UK, Chapman believes the viability of large chains will ultimately depend on how long big international releases continue to be delayed and whether Australians “will have the money to spare on a ticket given economic issues and the comparative cheapness of streaming services”. Village and Event can raise debt as publicly listed companies, he says, while Hoyts’ Chinese owner, the Wanda Group, “might have deeper pockets to fund losses”. Kirk Edwards, chief executive of Village Cinemas, says the cost of rent is a particular issue for larger chains. Because his chain – which includes 58 cinemas in Australia, including some jointly run with Event – exceeds the $50m revenue threshold, it has not been covered by rent relief codes. He says the larger operators, often in shopping centres, which demand higher rents, have struggled as a result. “Cinemas in Australia pay $280m in rent a year and the industry employs 13,500 staff,” Edwards says. “We do more admissions than all professional sports in Australia combined. “My number one, key concern for all cinemas, is that we need greater support from landlords.” Michael Hawkins, executive director of the National Association of Cinema Operators, says the industry is grateful for jobkeeper, but “without government support for rent for major chains, it will be very difficult for some operators to survive” if a second or third wave shuts cinemas again. Hawkins says delayed global releases have also put the survival of both large and small operators at stake. “Let’s not sugarcoat it, we have concerns,” he says. However he believes if operators can stay afloat for the coming months while relying on independent and Australian films, and re-screening of classics, then the backlog of delayed titles set for release will make 2021 “a very exciting year”. While acknowledging “one or two” films have broken with accepted protocol and gone straight to streaming – including Disney’s Mulan – Edwards says cinemas are part of a “global alliance” and have to accept that the release of films such as No Time To Die, the new James Bond title, has been pushed back to 2021. Village’s program is about 40% “blockbuster titles”, Edwards says. But he believes the delayed Christopher Nolan film Tenet will generate $20m box office revenue in Australia, and is a sign Australians will turn out for delayed films when they are finally released. Eddie Tamir, whose company Moving Story includes three Melbourne cinemas – Classic Cinemas in Elsternwick, Lido in Hawthorn and Cameo in Belgrave – as well as Sydney’s Randwick Ritz, is confident independent cinemas can survive by screening cult classics and niche titles in the absence of “tentpole” global films. “There’s a lot of doomsayers around, I call them ‘schadenfreudians’ of the cinema industry. Cinema has met many challengers, and has been told it’s been dying for 100 years. “We’ll keep dying for the next 100 years too,” Tamir says. While he is keen for restrictions to ease so that his Melbourne cinemas can reopen, Tamir takes confidence from the demand for sessions at the Ritz, which have included Tenet, as well as films from Fellini and Hitchcock and foreign language titles. He has established a Video On Demand streaming site, and is selling choc tops and merchandise from one cinema’s box office, but says these don’t come close to covering losses. Scott Seddon, the president of Independent Cinemas Australia, believes only inner-city independent cinemas can rely on the taste for smaller movies. Seddon runs a five-screen cinema in Raymond Terrace, north of Newcastle in New South Wales, and a drive-in screen in the nearby Hunter Valley. He says regional cinemas rely on the major international releases. “Having No Time to Die moved back to April next year was a big issue for us. We didn’t get much joy out of our reruns. Our audience wants new releases.” Seddon says the outlook for independent regional cinemas is “all pretty precarious for the moment”. He says the government now needs to provide greater support beyond jobkeeper and small grants to sustain vital community institutions. “In a regional area cinema is much more of a focal point, it means so much more to the community. Lots of our customers have disabilities, have companion cards, and are older Australians. “Their weekly outing is to come and see a film. So if we start seeing regional cinemas disappear that’ll be a huge loss,” he says. Edwards, of Village Cinemas, also believes the value of cinema will be an important part of the Covid-19 recovery. “The population is at breaking point with stress and aggravation. Cinemas are good for wellbeing, where they can escape that day-to-day hardship . “It is a place where people go and get away, we’re a world of escapism.”",film
"J Lee Thompson’s gripping capital punishment drama Yield to the Night from 1956 gets a re-release: a Brit noir classic and a unique career achievement for Diana Dors as Mary Hilton, a woman awaiting execution for murder. The events leading up to Mary’s crime are intercut with her jail ordeal, attended by female wardens or “matrons” in the brightly lit cell, whose lights can never be dimmed because of suicide-watch surveillance. It unfolds like an eerie, lucid dream of squalor and shame. I first became aware of this film in 1995 when the Smiths’ Singles album came out, using as cover design the image of Dors gripping (or, ambiguously, caressing) the frame of her bedstead, like the bars of a cell. The final track of that album, incidentally, is There Is a Light That Never Goes Out. Mary is permitted a black cloth over her eyes to help her sleep, which she grimly compares to the blindfold given to someone in front of a firing squad. She doesn’t mention it, but both Mary and the cinema audience would sense the other comparison: the sentencing judge’s black cap. Mary becomes delirious as she becomes obsessed with all the tiny details in her cell: the scratches on the wall, the sheen of the enamelled tin mug, the painted brickwork, the pattern on the back of the matrons’ playing cards. Thompson’s camera records these details with unforgettable psychopathic precision. Above all, Mary is obsessed with a door in her cell that has no handle on her side. She (and we) are never explicitly told – but Mary realises that she will see that door open only once, and very soon. What lies behind it, horrifyingly, is the gallows platform, as near to hand as an ensuite bathroom. The movie was based on a novel by Joan Henry (who was married to Thompson), and both the book and Henry’s screenplay were written before the Ruth Ellis hanging, but the movie was released one year afterwards and its production and reception were surely coloured by the queasy aura of fascination radiated by the Ellis case. Interestingly, Mary Hilton is a less potentially sympathetic figure than Ellis; she doesn’t commit a crime of passion on the spur of the moment, but something planned for months – an act of revenge which, in the traditional manner, is a dish eaten cold. The opening credit sequence confronts you with the stark, wordless melodrama of the slaying, the victim tracked from Trafalgar Square to Belgravia, a nightmare of Dutch angles and vividly banal visual details looming up to the camera. Intermittently from then on, we see what led up to it. Mary is a young woman separated from her husband, living in west London and working in an upscale French-style perfume store. She falls for handsome, moody young musician Jim Lancaster (played by the actor and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Michael Craig) and they date for a while until Jim falls for a haughty socialite who toys with his affections and humiliates both him and Mary, triggering a terrible act of violence. In prison, Mary is visited by her ex-husband Fred (Harry Locke), her querulous mother (Dandy Nichols) and anguished brother Alan (John Charlesworth). The narrative of the crime is well done, but the whole film, together with Mary – and perhaps Diana Dors herself – are exalted and transfigured in those harrowing prison scenes taking place unbearably in the present tense. Where once she was blond, brassy and sexy (though open and vulnerable) now Mary is dead-eyed, almost a sleepwalker, waxy of skin, calm, quiet-voiced, enigmatically placid, unrepentant about her crime – though the fact of the capital verdict has rendered this last issue irrelevant. But it is as if Mary is awed by her insight into the reality of death. She has been inducted into the occult mystery and knows something that no one else has grasped: not the prison governor, not the chaplain, not the home secretary. As the time drags on, waiting for a possible reprieve, Mary becomes friendly with her matrons. They are not allowed to smoke, but the prisoner (oddly) is, and when the chief warden comes in, Mary will occasionally snatch the illicit cigarette out of a matron’s mouth and pretend it’s hers so they don’t get into trouble – like the decent sort she is. On her exercise walks, Mary will brood on lines from AE Housman’s A Shropshire Lad (which Jim used to read) on mortality and the brevity of life: “About the woodlands I will go / To see the cherry hung with snow.” But the British title – it was called Blonde Sinner in the US – is taken from Homer’s Iliad, with the herald telling Hector and Ajax to stop fighting because night is falling: “It is well to yield to the night.” Mary is not yielding to a natural night, however, but the artificial one of execution. Finally, two matrons are allowed to kneel and pray either side of Mary, like the thieves crucified with Christ. And as for the awful final moments themselves, it is interesting to compare this with other dramas on the same subject. We are not introduced to the hangman in the black comic way of Robert Hamer’s Kind Hearts And Coronets (1949). Shelagh Delaney’s screenplay for Dance With a Stranger (1985), about the Ruth Ellis case, does not actually show Ellis’s imprisoned life and death at all. Adrian Shergold’s Pierrepoint (2005) with Timothy Spall as the famous hangman, did not shrink from showing you the horrible scene when the door to the adjoining cell was opened, revealing the noose. None of this is what happens in Yield to the Night, but there is a terrible power in its descent of darkness.",film
"There’s a taste of turkey, or a can of own-brand mechanically reclaimed turkey-substitute, in this moderate TV-movie-style biopic of Helen Reddy, the Australian-born singer who came to the United States and had a string of hit singles in the 1970s, including the feminist anthem I Am Woman. She died recently, and deserved more elegiac attention than she got. Caroline Sullivan’s excellent obituary is here. Reddy found her voice among the commercial shlock of the day (this film has at one moment a shot of Reddy’s place on the Billboard 100 list, one place behind Chuck Berry’s My Ding-a-Ling). Tilda Cobham-Hervey gives a bland performance as Reddy; Evan Peters (Quicksilver from the X-Men movies) is hammy and over-the-top as the sweaty manager and husband, Jeff Wald, who snorts all Reddy’s earnings up his nose. Danielle Macdonald adds some zip with her performance as Helen’s friend, pioneering music journalist Lillian Roxon, whose personality seems more interesting than the main character’s here. The sentiments expressed in the movie are laudable enough, but the cardboard dialogue and cliched storytelling make it a wearisome watch, and Cobham-Harvey’s performance is so opaque and uninflected it feels like a lost item of pop art. When the film shows Reddy performing Angie Baby during her Vegas residency – actually, a rather disturbing song – she just croons earnestly through the track pretty much in its entirety, and there is something so inert, uninterpreted and undramatic in this sequence that the film goes into a trance of pointlessness. Each scene needed a jolt of music or energy that just wasn’t there.",film
"Isabella Rossellini is a busy woman. It is hard to know how the model, actor, writer, animal behaviourist and farmer finds so much time to talk about sex. But she does. In recent years, she has made numerous tiny films about the sex lives of animals under the umbrella titles Green Porno and Seduce Me. Now she hopes to take them to a larger audience – or, to be more accurate, she hopes to bring a larger audience to her farm. With theatre stymied by the pandemic, she is livestreaming a show from Mama Farm in Long Island, New York, where she lives with her sheep, goats, chickens, ducks and dogs. The show, called Sex & Consequences, is part circus, part animal cognition lecture and part penetration. In Green Porno and Seduce Me, Rossellini dresses up as different creatures to tell us how they mate. She dances, preens, teases and thrusts with a strap-on penis by way of illustration. The films are funny, educative and a little bit bonkers – not unlike Rossellini. As well as learning about the joy of sex, we also learn about its infinite capacity to invent, exploit, control and kill. Take the female praying mantis, for example. “The female starts eating his head when she is mating with him!” Rossellini says with relish. “Imagine that he has evolved his body so the nerves that control the movement to penetrate her are no longer in his head, but farther down in his spinal cord, so she can still keep eating him and he can mate with her.” Then there are the hens who eject sperm if they don’t rate the rooster; the fun-loving dolphins who explore any orifice going; the polyandrous Prunella modularis (AKA dunnock), which breeds with multiple males because it makes economic sense. We have barely started. Rossellini introduces us to snakes with two penises that use their spare member to produce a gelatinous plug, barring entry to the female for the next male; Pacific salmon that spawn just before they die; hermaphrodite earthworms and limpets that are happily self-sufficient; strategically promiscuous chimps that have sex with as many males as possible to protect their babies from infanticide; and drones that bleed to death after their penis ruptures while they are mating with a queen bee. Rossellini is on the farm when we video-call. She is dressed in black – trademark pixie haircut, dash of red lipstick, big yellow glasses, elegant as ever. The only thing that surprises me is the warmth of her smile. The younger Rossellini rarely seemed to smile. In 1982, she signed an exclusive deal with Lancôme and became the world’s highest-paid model. As the face of Lancôme, Rossellini represented an ideal – dreamy, desirable, distant. Meanwhile, in films, her characters were often too tortured (the abused nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens in David Lynch’s Blue Velvet), too cool (the sardonic bad girl Perdita Durango in Wild at Heart) or too macabre (the sultry sorceress Lisle Von Rhuman in Death Becomes Her) to smile naturally. Rossellini, 68, grew up in France and Italy, the daughter of two movie legends – the Swedish Hollywood star Ingrid Bergman and the revered Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini. Her parents were as touched by scandal as they were by glamour – Bergman was still married to her first husband when she gave birth to Rossellini’s older brother. She was denounced by the US Senate as a “vile free-love cultist” and didn’t work again in the US for many years. Her parents divorced when Rossellini was five and she and her two siblings moved into a hotel in Rome for two years, where her parents would visit them. It was hardly a conventional childhood. At the age of 14, her father bought her a book called King Solomon’s Ring, by Konrad Lorenz, one of the founders of animal behaviour studies. “A little lamp went on in my brain and I said: this is what I want to do.” But she didn’t have the confidence. “The idea of studying zoology or biology intimidated me. But I was a beauty, thank God! So I went into the family business.” Was she always aware she was beautiful? “Not so much. I was a little chubby when I was young and I was born with a deformity of my spine.” She had surgery for her scoliosis when she was 12 and spent most of the next two years in plaster. Beauty didn’t seem relevant back then. “Because I was sick, I was just happy I could walk.” Rossellini grew up adoring films, but she opted for modelling. “Because my mother was Ingrid Bergman and my father was Roberto Rossellini, I was intimidated about becoming an actress and a director.” In her late 20s, she decided to act. Did her parents’ reputation help or hinder her? “Both,” she says. “It opened doors, but the judgment was much more severe.” She remembers her first reviews – of The Meadow in 1979. “In the press, they said: ‘She looks like her mother, but she certainly hasn’t inherited her talent.’ It crushes you. If they say it today, you just say: well, maybe that’s true. It doesn’t hurt you so much.” She beams when she talks about Bergman. “You know she won three Oscars?” (Only one actor, Katharine Hepburn, has more.) “I have not even been nominated for one. But it doesn’t affect me any more. This is the great thing about getting old: things that preoccupied you when you were young cease to preoccupy you. I would have loved to have had one Oscar. Well, too bad. I have six sheep, two dogs, two children.” She bursts out laughing and says she is more than satisfied. One of Rossellini’s middle names is Elettra, the Italian for Electra – and she has often said she had something of a father complex. Her first husband, meanwhile, appeared to have a father-in-law complex. She married Martin Scorsese in 1979; they divorced four years later. After they separated, Scorsese told her it had been important to him “to think that he was in a relationship with Roberto Rossellini’s daughter”. Family history repeated itself when she and Scorsese divorced; by then, she was pregnant with another man’s child – that of the former model Jonathan Wiedemann. That marriage also lasted four years. She then had a six-year relationship with David Lynch. In 1993, then single, she adopted a son, Roberto. Three years later, at the height of her modelling success, she was dumped by Lancôme for being too old. She was 43. “I was told advertising is about dreams and women dream to be young, so I couldn’t represent that dream.” Was she shocked? No, she says, she had seen it happen with other models – and her mother in the movies. “The thing that was painful was that I had become their spokesperson and that was not valued. There is a film by the French actress Delphine Seyrig called Be Pretty and Shut Up, and that’s what I felt.” Twenty years later, Lancôme, now run by a female CEO, apologised and invited her back to model for them, which she is still doing today. The culture has changed, she says. “Women executives have a different sensitivity. Male executives only understood makeup or fashion as an instrument of seduction, because that was addressed to them. They didn’t understand that we like to put on makeup or dress up just because it’s a game; it’s pleasurable.” Look, she says. She fetches one of her face masks. The inside is splashed with red. “See. They all have lipstick inside!” She giggles at the idea of wearing lipstick no one can see. “I don’t want to wear beautiful clothes and lipstick because I want to get married.” She almost spits out the word. “I do it because it makes me feel good. I’m single and I’m doing it for me.” Today, she believes she symbolises something different for Lancôme. “I’m not there now to represent beauty; I’m there to represent a different dream. It may be defined as joyfulness; life goes on and there are many chapters. I think that’s why they keep me.” In fact, Rossellini says, she is grateful that they gave her the boot a quarter of a century ago – and that Hollywood similarly wrote her off. It was at this point that she decided nothing would intimidate her and that she would do everything she had always wanted to. She wrote books and scripts, went to university in her mid-50s and completed a master’s in animal behaviour, made films for her own pleasure, bought the farm, started lecturing and made Green Porno, which aired on Robert Redford’s Sundance TV. In 2005, she wrote and starred in a surreal short film about her father, called My Dad Is 100 Years Old. Her father was represented by a huge, heaving belly and she played all the other parts – Chaplin, Hitchcock, her mother and plenty more. “My twin sister was offended by the way I portrayed Dad. She thought it was diminishing.” But Rossellini was happy to be discovering new things about herself. “A friend said to me: you are not the daughter of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini, you are the result of a threesome between the porno star Cicciolina, Jacques Cousteau and Luis Buñuel! It made me laugh so much. I didn’t know I had this streak of surrealism and comedy in me. It’s probably what made me work so well with David Lynch.” Your work is such a contrast to your father’s, I say – Roberto Rossellini’s neorealist trilogy (Rome, Open City; Germany, Year Zero; Paisà) is as bleak as it is brilliant. Yes, she says, but as a man he was so different. “My dad made such serious films, but he was so funny. So funny. It was unbelievable. Sometimes I had to leave the room to catch my breath. And so is Marty [Scorsese]. Marty makes all these films about people shooting and brains exploding, but you sit with him and he makes you laugh so much. Sometimes I have to say: Marty, you’re making me laugh too much, you’re suffocating me.” You seem so much more confident than when you were younger, I say. She smiles. “Ageing brings a lot of happiness. You get fatter and more wrinkles, and that’s not so good, but there is a freedom that comes with it. The freedom is: I better do what I want to do now, because I’ll be dead soon. So this is my last chance. Also, there’s a serenity that comes – I had the career I had, good or bad, I did the best I could, and now I continue pursuing what is interesting to me.” She mentions the importance of being curious – always learning new things. “I’ve seen actress friends so depressed about losing their beauty. People didn’t want them any more. And I felt that, too. Studying saved me from being depressed about losing my beauty. It gave my life so much joy.” Do you really feel you have lost your beauty, I say – you look great. “Thank you! Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and think: ‘Not bad!’” In 2015, Rossellini featured in the film Joy, alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro. At the time, she said it was the first proper movie part she had been offered in six years. “Yes, and it is the last film,” she says. I remind her she appeared in Vita and Virginia, a literary costume drama a couple of years ago. “Ach, yes – a very, very small role.” But does she want the work? I get the impression that she finds movie life boring compared with all the other stuff she is doing. “It is boring!” she says with thunderous satisfaction. “I don’t want to be in that trailer in the parking lot outside a highway waiting for my five minutes for several days. I come home and there is such life – friends and the animals and problem-solving.” She says the farm is a haven from the toxicity of the US today. How does she feel about the prospect of Donald Trump winning a second term as president? “It’s very frightening. I always had a question to my parents. How could Italy become fascist, how could Germany have become Nazi? I don’t want to define Trump as fascist or Nazi, but he is authoritarian – a threat to democracy.” Has she been involved in the Black Lives Matter campaign? “No, but my son is black. He sent me a video that moved me very much. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve said to my son: if a policeman stops you, you answer like this, you don’t put your hands in your pockets, make sure to look them in the eye. If you are threatened, call your uncle, because his uncle, my sister’s husband, is a lawyer. He sent me this video with all these parents teaching their children the same thing and they were all black. When he sent that video, I suddenly thought: oh, that’s my story.” Rossellini says she has not entirely given up on movies and TV shows – not least because they get her out into the wider world. “I feel I have to work with others, because I cannot just be a recluse doing my tiny avant garde shows. My agent sometimes says: oh, Isabella, stop it, it’s a waste of time, there’s no money in it.” Despite its title, she insists Sex & Consequences is about more than sex. She explains how the show also explores animal cognition, empathy and altruism. Rossellini looks at me. “See, when I say cognition, already you just fall asleep when you hear the word. Sex is really easy. It makes people laugh.” There is another surprise in the new show, she says enthusiastically. “I have a husband!” She stands up, walks to her bedroom, and pulls back the duvet. “Look! Look! How can you not love him? He’s in bed. Let me turn the light on.” “Blimey,” I say, “that looks more like a blow-up doll than a husband.” “It’s a dummy!” she giggles. “But I treat him as a husband. In the show, I talk to him. At one point, I say to him: ‘Oh, stop it dummy, instead of stop it stupid.” Is that a metaphor? “Yes, exactly!” This may be bullshit psychology, I say, but you seem more content single than when you were married or in long-term relationships. “No, it’s not bullshit.” She takes me back 20-plus years, to a crunch point in her life. “I was with David Lynch and that came to an end [she seems to forget a subsequent two-year engagement to Gary Oldman] and then Lancôme came to an end and I needed to reconstruct my career. I had my two small children and I just didn’t have room for another boyfriend or husband. I don’t think I could do the amount of things I do if I have a husband. Husbands are time-consuming.” If you had to restrict yourself to one career, what would it be? “The farm,” she says. Rossellini tells me it is called Mama Farm because it is female-dominated. “We have so many hens, female sheep; 90 per cent of bees are female. I started the farm and I’m a mama, and my daughter has a two-year-old son, and a lot of mothers come to the farm.” Is it a feminist collective? “Yes, it’s nurturing, and maybe there is something feminine in nurturing.” At times, she says, it feels like paradise. “People work serenely, the animals walk about, there are crops and flowers. I always say: if I see a man and woman walking about naked, I’ll know I’m in Eden.” Rossellini’s daughter, Elettra, who lives next door and works on the farm, has popped round. It is time to go. I tell Rossellini it is wonderful to see her getting so much pleasure from the world. “I certainly do,” she says. “I don’t know if it’s genes, if it’s me or if it’s life. But it works.” Sex & Consequences will run on select dates from 16-25 October. Tickets for the live stream can be bought at dice.fm.",film
"Multiplexes may be closing their doors or reducing their hours but it is not all doom and gloom in the world of cinema. Box offices at many independent cinemas are reporting solid audience numbers, with some selling out screenings and others encouraging blockbuster fans to give arthouse films a try. “There’s no getting away from the fact that overall it’s a difficult time,” said Jason Wood, creative director for film and culture at HOME in Manchester. “We feel huge sympathy for people losing their jobs. But it’s an exciting time for independent cinema. It’s really important to recognise there is an industry beyond the mainstream blockbuster film culture.” While multiplex screenings for Tenet have sometimes been sparsely attended, often films shown by HOME are selling out. “We had a lot of love while we were closed during lockdown: people were sending donations and taking up memberships,” Wood said. One tactic has been to show films on the big screen, such as the Kitty Green movie The Assistant, that were streamed during lockdown. Some viewers saw the film online and wanted to see it on the big screen; others heard about it because it had done well on streaming. It has been a sellout at HOME. “But for me the really big success is the BFI restoration of La Haine,” said Wood. “We’ve played it now for four weeks and it’s sold out every single performance.” Bong Joon-ho’s Memories of Murder has also been hugely popular. “Many of the successes have been foreign language, a number are directed by women, some directed by people of colour,” Wood said. Another venue welcoming back audiences in good numbers is Watershed in Bristol. “We hit our September target and our October advance sales are really brilliant,” its cinema curator, Mark Cosgrove, said. Its big hits have included the British coming-of-age drama Rocks. “There is an overall crisis, but it’s in the commercial blockbuster model. Some of the reporting is suggesting that cinema is dead because the Bond film has been moved back. There’s a lot more film out there.” Meanwhile, capacity at the Queen’s film theatre in Belfast, like elsewhere, has been reduced because of coronavirus. Joan Parsons, head of the theatre, said: “We are full for most screenings at the moment, and have to turn people away. It is clear that there is an audience that want to attend cinemas, all of which have made significant investment in health and safety measures.” Not all independent cinemas are thriving, of course. WTW, a beloved family-run business that has cinemas in Newquay, Truro, St Austell and Wadebridge in Cornwall, issued an emotional plea this week for people to take a chance on the sort of arthouse film they might not normally see, or pop in for a takeaway coffee or box of popcorn. It’s director, Mark Williams, said: “There have been plenty of sleepless nights and many tears shed. It is not just cinemas that are affected. From sound and projection engineers to our local drinks and concessions suppliers, there are so many affected by the current huge challenges. We’re determined this won’t be the end.” While the cinemas of Aberystwyth, mid-Wales, defied a government ban at the start of the second world war and stayed open, Covid could force the Commodore, run by Mike Davies’ family since the late 1950s, temporarily to shut. A few good nights of James Bond can usually keep the cinema going for months, so the loss of 007, the new Wonder Woman and Black Widow films is a bitter blow. “We had Bill and Ted this week. We had almost single figure audiences which is a shame – it’s not that bad a film. The studios and distributors are being shortsighted, to put it mildly. When they finally release their blockbusters there might not be so many cinemas to play them in,” Davies said. Davies, his wife, Cindy, and son Neil are currently keeping the cinema going. “We’re doing cleaning, maintenance, everything,” said Davies. “We’re hanging on. We won’t give up.”",film
"According to talent agent Archie (Peter Kim), “women of colour directors are hot right now”. Writer, director and star Radha Blank knows this (she won the top directing prize at Sundance). In her warm, funny and enjoyably rude debut, she creates a fictionalised version of herself, slyly jabbing at the way her value is perceived. Has-been playwright Radha is pushing 40 and teaching an after-school theatre programme – “You the black Shakespeare, ma!” insists an eager student. Her midlife crisis prompts an awkward rebrand as rapper RadhaMUSprime (Miss Prime, as opposed to past it) and an unexpected romance with Bronx-based beat maker D (Oswin Benjamin), sparked by fresh creative inspiration and after-hours visits to his studio. During the day, she is ground down by rewrites of her play about gentrification, Harlem Ave, given a stage by J Whitman (Reed Birney), a liberal theatre producer obsessed with “black poverty porn”. It’s a sharply observed comment on the ways women of colour are encouraged to contort their creativity in order to be consumed by white audiences.",film
"When I read Dan Palmer’s brave and honest coming out column in the Sydney Morning Herald last week, suddenly I was jolted back to a dark place seven years ago when I almost took my own life. The former Wallabies prop described a moment when he was driving recklessly, the feeling of “death felt preferable to anybody discovering [he] was gay.” For me, I was working as a television reporter in Townsville in 2013 and driving to an interview. Suddenly I felt this heavy urge to have an accident. With all my strength I pulled over and called my best friend who told me to go to the doctor. I did immediately. He prescribed me antidepressants which helped fight off the black dog that had been chasing me since high school. Finally, it had caught up. Unlike Palmer, I was already out. In fact, I was outed when a friend who I had one of my first sexual experiences with secretly recorded it and showed the video around school. That only confirmed what the kids already knew and the bullying went from bad to horrendous. I remember wagging almost every sports class, even though I played rugby as a kid and enjoyed it – because in those changing rooms and in that masculine environment, that’s where I copped it the most. So you can imagine my surprise when years later, a rugby club would go on to change my life. Not just any rugby club, the world’s first gay rugby club, the Kings Cross Steelers in London. Four years ago I moved to the UK seeking an adventure and trying to shake that black dog off once and for all. My flatmate was a member of the Steelers and suggested I try it out. When I ran around the oval at the first training session, unfit and overweight (thanks to the Heathrow injection) I was a lap behind everybody. I didn’t want to embarrass myself by giving up and as I finished, lagging far behind, everybody in the club stood there clapping me on. It was a feeling I’ll never forget. Then in my first game, it all came back to me. I scored the most tries. People were patting me on the back and wanting to get to know me at the pub afterwards. Finally, I had found a place where I belonged. And, as a bonus, I went on to meet and marry one of my teammates, John – the funniest and kindest person I know (not to mention a great rugby player). By this point, I was working as the Europe correspondent for 10 News. I had my own camera and decided to make a documentary about the Steelers because I noticed the sport was having this transformative effect on nearly everyone in the club. I’d heard people talk about the power of sport before, but never believed it until now. Here, queer people were reclaiming their place on the pitch – an arena they grew up being told they didn’t belong in. In fact, from this single club, there are now 80 gay and inclusive rugby clubs around the world including five in Australia. In the Steelers’ first season, they sent out 120 invitations to play against teams in Essex. Only a handful accepted. Many thought it was an April fool’s joke because the letter was sent around that time. There was the occasional homophobic sledge, but over time the Steelers won the respect of these straight burly British men because not only did they beat them on occasion, they showed them that we’re all pretty much the same. Flash forward to me taking my camera to Amsterdam to film the club at the Bingham Cup, the world cup of “rainbow” rugby. I filmed my team hoping to get enough material for a feature. I sat on the footage and a year passed. It was only when Israel Folau began posting “hell awaits homosexuals” on social media that I realised I had to tell the story of the club – and my own story. So like Dan Palmer, I too have Folau to thank in small part. My film has played in scores of festivals across eight countries. When it premiered at the New Zealand International film festival (after the All Blacks tweeted the trailer) a teenager messaged me saying he was struggling and getting bullied at school, but my film gave him hope that things get better. To me it made everything I had gone through worth it. The bullying. The self doubt and the self-loathing. I guess the lesson I learned is you have to keep searching for happiness, because you just might find it where you least expect. In my case, it was the rugby pitch.  Eammon Ashton-Atkinson is the US correspondent for 10 News First. His independent documentary Steelers: the World’s First Gay Rugby Club is in cinemas across Australia now",film
"A detonation of pure acting firepower is what’s on offer in this movie version of August Wilson’s 1982 stage play. Declarative and theatrical it might be, but it’s also ferociously intelligent and violently focused, an opera of passion and pain. We see African-American musicians hanging around a white-owned Chicago studio one stiflingly hot day in the 1920s, waiting for the legendary blues singer Gertrude “Ma” Rainey to show up with her entourage so they can cut an album. The lead track is expected to be her live hit, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, and the drama imagines a certain pushy trumpeter in the band named Levee angling for his own version to be recorded. A simmering argument about how this song is to be arranged and performed forms the basis of a confrontation about race, sex and power. Viola Davis plays Ma Rainey with tremendous hauteur: Cate Blanchett’s Elizabeth I never arrived at Hampton Court with more magnificent display or more queenly prerogative than Davis’s Rainey making her entrance, with her own lovers and court favourites, sweating at the temperature, her painful feet and the incompetence of the studio chiefs. And Chadwick Boseman gives a moving performance as the fiercely talented but insecure Levee, crucified by a childhood experience of racist violence and dreaming of fronting his own band. This is Boseman’s final appearance on screen, and what a glorious performance to go out on. It is a head-butting confrontation of the galácticos: Davis and Boseman are each the immovable object and irresistible force. Amusingly, both are concerned with their feet. Poor Levee has just blown every cent on a fancy pair of shiny shoes and he is always showing them off, hopping and dancing around like a little kid. Ma Rainey’s feet, on the other hand, are in agony. We see her picking her way down the stairs at her hotel in discomfort, yet her rolling, heavy-set gait is part of what imposes her authority on the room. She gets to wear a pair of comfortable indoor slippers in the studio and doesn’t move anywhere she doesn’t want to. Levee has, quite without Ma’s permission, prepared an ingenious new version of Black Bottom that downplays her slow, bluesy vocals and gives a more demanding, uptempo orchestration for the boys in the band: Toledo (Glynn Turman), Cutler (Colman Domingo), Slow Drag (Michael Potts) and of course Levee himself with his flashy trumpet. This is with the sneaky connivance of the white manager Irvin (Jeremy Shamos) and studio boss Sturdyvant (Jonny Coyne) who sense this is how to make it a lucrative crossover hit. Ma furiously rejects the new version, sensing – accurately – that this means getting upstaged and that Levee wants to use her prestige as the launching pad for his own stardom. The only male she wants to showcase is her own teenage nephew Sylvester (Dusan Brown) that she capriciously wants to let him introduce the number, despite the fact that he has a stammer. To add to the tension, she has brought along her gorgeous girlfriend Dussie Mae (Taylour Paige), who is dangerously enamoured of Levee. So who has the power in this contest of wills? In some ways it is Ma Rainey herself – she is the talent, she must be placated, and everything depends on her – yet the band are bleakly unimpressed about her ability to connect with non-black audiences. Levee has power of his own with new ideas about music, but it is the duplicitous management who control it, and the tragedy and the violence are ignited by the band’s derision at Levee’s sycophantic attitude to these white chiefs. It triggers Levee’s own memories of racist violence and humiliation – and while others in the band get set-piece speeches, too, there is something a bit contrived in these theatrical arias. But they are delivered with such intensity, and the film has a genuine coup in its final scene, showing how Levee’s talent is to be exploited and the way black culture itself is destined to be appropriated. Boseman’s face is so open, so transparent, so needy – it is an instrument for every painful emotion. It is such a generous performance: the portrayal of a man sacrificed on the altar of his own past.",film
"Movie romances traditionally have what’s called a “meet cute”, that clinching moment when a couple-to-be first bump into one another. It would be hard, though, to think of a meet less cute than the one in The Night Porter, Liliana Cavani’s erotic drama from 1974. When Max (Dirk Bogarde) encounters Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), they are in a concentration camp: he is an SS commandant and she is his teenage prisoner, crop-haired, ghostly and gaunt. A twisted relationship develops. She gives him sex and he brings her gifts, such as the head of a fellow prisoner in a box. It’s the little things that mean so much. Twelve years after the end of the war, they are reunited when she checks into the Vienna hotel where he is manning the front desk. Soon it’s like the good old days all over again: they play sadomasochistic sex games, and Max tries to prevent Lucia being killed by his Nazi chums. The film, which has been in and out of circulation over the decades, is released this month on Blu-ray in a 4K restoration, giving new audiences a chance to marvel at the high-wire performances, rinky-dink dubbing and sustained mood of maudlin kitsch. They can also decide whether this is a chamber piece of singular intensity or a ghoulish dalliance with fascist porn. Or possibly both. Holocaust survivor Primo Levi called the film “beautiful and false” and said “it has nothing to do with the camps”; while the academic Jörg Heiser wrote in 2010 that Cavani turns “concentration-camp reality” into “a playground for Nazi chic”. Opinion at the time was divided. The film was treated largely with respect in Europe but savaged by US critics, with Pauline Kael in the New Yorker calling it “humanly and aesthetically offensive”. The US distributor, Joseph E Levine, exploited the furore by taking out a newspaper spread featuring hostile notices. “Selling it on the strength of its bad reviews,” said Vincent Canby, surprised to find that his own hatchet job in the New York Times was being used to flog tickets. Cavani was not pleased either. “It was misleading,” the 87-year-old director tells me from Rome. “It damaged the reputation of the film. It was seen as a sexual work and that’s not at all what I wanted to do.” Unsavoury offers began landing on her desk. “Some producers proposed to me that I make a porn movie,” she says, clutching her forehead. “I said, ‘You’re completely crazy. No way.’ They wanted Nazi porn!” It’s true that the film has always had a strong whiff of the taboo. I first saw it at the age of 15 at the delightfully insalubrious Scala cinema in London, where it could be found in outre double bills with the likes of Salon Kitty, one of the “Nazi porn” projects that Cavani turned down. A friend had told me that The Night Porter showed people having sex on broken glass, which seemed to me reason enough to pay the £2.50 ticket price. As it turned out, he was exaggerating. Though Max and Lucia do crawl on jagged shards, and fight over the sticky fragments of a broken jam jar, there is no glass-based intercourse, strictly speaking. Jane Giles, the Scala’s former programmer, remembers The Night Porter as a reliable money-spinner for the repertory cinema. “It appeared 23 times between 1981 and 1992,” she says. “That makes it a real Scala regular. It was part of a trend that started in the 1970s of sexually extreme Euro arthouse films, which put it in the Scala sweet spot. These were films that were slow to come to home entertainment, and so weren’t widely available.” It was also part of a wave of Italian pictures confronting fascism in a sexualised context: Visconti’s The Damned (Bogarde and Rampling again), Bertolucci’s The Conformist, Pasolini’s Salò or The 120 Days of Sodom. “Germany was doing it, too,” Giles points out. “But what’s different is that Italy was more like the wild west when it came to censorship and classification. What you got was this confluence of Italian film-makers dealing with their country’s fascist tendencies, combined with much freer, more explicit imagery.” The Night Porter still faced legal obstacles at home – a delegation of Italian film-makers, including Bertolucci, successfully challenged efforts to ban it. While the movie retains a disreputable air, however, its origins are anything but. Kael in the New Yorker was way clear of the mark, for instance, when she surmised that the film probably “came out of idle speculation: ‘Gee, I bet there were people sexually enslaved by the Nazis.’” In fact, Cavani, whose grandparents were part of the anti-fascist movement, had spent years making documentaries about the war. One of those was Women of the Resistance, a 1965 study of partisan fighters, during which she interviewed two women whose stories inspired The Night Porter: a teacher who took holidays each year in Dachau, where she had been imprisoned, and another woman whose family urged her to forget her experiences at Auschwitz. “I asked what it was that she could not forgive the Germans for,” Cavani recalls. “She said, ‘They made me discover a part of myself capable of doing things I never thought I would do.’ I asked, ‘What was it?’ She didn’t answer.” Cavani wrote the treatment for The Night Porter in the early 70s. The budget was tight – the production ran out of money halfway, and shooting was suspended while additional funds were raised. Surprisingly for such a dour film, the mood on set was merry. “There was a really nice atmosphere,” the director says. “It was light, all the actors got along. Charlotte had just had a baby, and she took him on set with a nanny.” Cavani has described the relationship between Max and Lucia as “beautiful”. In what way? “There was an attraction which marked Lucia for life,” she says. “When she and Max meet again, the flame has not faded. She was very young and disoriented by him. She was bowled over. She believed he desired her for who she was. And, despite everything, there was sincerity in his feelings. In its own way, theirs is a romantic relationship.” I confess to her that I can’t share this view of the film. Lucia was a child when they met. She was abused, exploited, terrified. How can what she feels for Max be love? Cavani smiles patiently. “We mustn’t generalise. Cupid shoots his arrows in random directions, and these two must have been struck. If Cupid’s arrow hits you, there is nothing you can do. Let’s be honest, nobody can really define love.”A crackling video call conducted through an interpreter may not be the best way to debate the nuances of abuse and control, so I ask Giles later what she makes of Cavani’s comments. “I’m with you on your reading of the relationship,” she says, “but I do understand what Liliana is saying. She’s found a language with which to describe her work. She’s a provocateur, and there’s an energy which allows her to take on that sort of material. If Liliana saw it as a story of abuse rather than a romance, it would look completely different. It wouldn’t have Charlotte Rampling slithering around – she would be lying on the floor, weeping and covered in sores.” I think Giles is right. Cavani needed to invest in the purity of Max and Lucia’s relationship in order to make something so sincere, foolhardy and enduring. After all, she has directed many films, including Francesco, starring Mickey Rourke as St Francis of Assisi, and Ripley’s Game, with John Malkovich at his disdainful, withering best. And yet it is The Night Porter that we are still discussing. While Cavani was overseeing this new restoration, she was asked whether she wanted to correct a cosmetic flaw in the original print. In the scene in which Max and Lucia struggle violently in a hotel room, a curly hair dangles from the top of the frame like a cedilla or a butcher’s hook. She refused to shoot another take at the time because Rampling, who had hurled herself into the scene, was exhausted. Offered the chance to fix it now, she declined once again. She tells me she sees it as a test for the viewer. If you fixate on that hair, she says, “then the film is not worth anything. We should throw it away.” But it symbolises something else, I believe: a precious imperfection. Perhaps the flaws and misjudgments in The Night Porter have done as much to keep it alive as its flashes of brilliance. They help to explain why we’re watching the film so long after its initial release, and arguing over it still.",film
"Lacking much else, this VOD-bound actioner offers two unexpected comebacks for the price of one. The star is Mark Dacascos, erstwhile straight-to-video stalwart aiming to convert his nifty John Wick 3 cameo into a second leading-man career. Behind the camera is Wych Kaosayananda, formerly just Kaos, the wildly overhyped Thai tyro exported at the height of Hollywood’s millennial Asian-cinema fetish to oversee megaflop Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever in 2002. His latest is a baby step up from that – cheap, self-produced tat being preferable to aggressively expensive corporate tat – but still feels underpowered. Ironically, it’s the kind of B pic a studio would have bulked up, cut tighter and transformed into a halfway worthy rental prospect. The pitch would be Collateral updated for the age of Uber; it plays, alas, like Collateral with the handbrake on. Dacascos’s Kai is the mysterious stranger with a score to settle who jets into Bangkok at 4pm, hails the cab of fresh-faced Fha (Vanida Golten) and spends the next 12 hours shooting people clean through the forehead. Unusually for an action movie, there’s next to no real action for an hour: the plot sets Kai in front of his targets, and – pop – off we drive to the next location. We’re left with all the lowish-octane thrills that follow from watching a man ticking items off his to-do list, and Kaosayananda makes such a deathly plod of it that vast stretches appear to be proceeding in real time. Always one of the more likable DTV stars, Dacascos brings a supermarket own-brand appropriation of Keanu’s Zen chivalry to Kai’s task; we just about buy why Fha doesn’t kick him out after he starts bleeding all over her back seat. His future employment isn’t in doubt. However, bigger question marks hang over Kaos. He gives the Bangkok sights a basic nocturnal sheen – even reviving the kind of strip-joint safari we all thought went out with the demise of Nuts magazine – but also floods scenes with the deadest of dead air in a vain push for atmosphere, and seems to think two negligibly different angles of the same dull shot will make for a dynamic, DePalma-like split screen.

"Joaquin Phoenix, who won an Oscar this year for his role in the film Joker, has reportedly welcomed his first child with fiancee Rooney Mara. They named the baby boy after Phoenix’s late brother, River, who died in 1993. The director Victor Kossakovsky revealed the news at the 2020 Zurich film festival after a screening of the black-and-white documentary Gunda. Joaquin was an executive producer on the film. Asking about Phoenix’s involvement in the film, Kossakovsky said: “He just got a baby by the way … A beautiful son called River.” River Phoenix, the star of films such as Stand By Me and My Own Private Idaho, died of an accidental drug overdose aged 23. Speaking recently to Anderson Cooper on the TV programme 60 Minutes, Joaquin Phoenix reflected on his bond with his brother and how media attention after his death affected their family.“River was a really substantial actor and movie star, and we didn’t really know it,” he said. “So during that time in which you’re most vulnerable, there are helicopters flying over. There are people that are trying to sneak on to your land. Certainly, for me, it felt like it impeded on the mourning process.” Phoenix and Mara co-starred in the films Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot and Mary Magdalene. They are prominent campaigners for animal rights, with Phoenix devoting much of his awards acceptance speeches to advocating for a vegan lifestyle. Two days after his Oscar win, Phoenix rescued a cow and a calf from an abbatoir. In July, a hostage siege in Ukraine ended after the president ceded to kidnappers’ demands to urge people to watch Earthlings, a 2005 eco-themed film narrated by Phoenix.",film
