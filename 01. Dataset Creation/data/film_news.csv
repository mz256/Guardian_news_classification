"Margaret Nolan, the actor best known for appearing in the title sequence for Goldfinger and for a string of appearances in TV shows in the 1960s and 70s, has died aged 76. Film-maker Edgar Wright, who directed Nolan in her final film role, in the forthcoming Last Night in Soho, reported the news on social media. Nolan, who was born in 1943 in Somerset, first appeared on film under the name Vicky Kennedy in “glamour” shorts by the then notorious Harrison Marks, appearing in his naturist film It’s a Bare, Bare World. She soon graduated to more mainstream films, with a noticeable role in the Beatles film A Hard Day’s Night (as the girl accompanying Wilfrid Brambell in a casino), and the James Bond film Goldfinger, as the masseuse Dink. Nolan also appeared in Goldfinger’s celebrated title sequence, wearing a gold bikini and with images projected on her skin – though in the film itself it was Shirley Eaton who played Jill Masterson, the girl smothered to death by gold paint. Nolan quickly outgrew her glamour-model beginnings and forged a reputation as a performer of great likability, with small roles in films as varied as Witchfinder General, The Great St Trinian’s Train Robbery, and the Marcel Carné drama Three Rooms in Manhattan. She also began a long association with the Carry On movie series, beginning in 1965 with a role as a secretary in Carry on Cowboy. She would go on to appear in five more, finishing up in 1974 with Carry on Dick. At the same time, Nolan developed a prolific career in TV, with guest roles in a wide variety of programmes, including Spike Milligan’s Q, Budgie, Steptoe and Son, The Persuaders! and Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? After the mid-70s Nolan stepped back from screen acting, but did appear as the dancehall girl Effie in the celebrated TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited in 1981. Nolan went on to develop an interest in visual arts, and her piece My Divided Self – a cut-up collage of her own publicity stills – was included in the feminist exhibition Equals in 2013 in Manchester’s Blankspace gallery. In an interview in 2007, Nolan described her artworks as “the idea that I was there as this passive woman, being looked at, but behind it all, behind my eyes, of course I knew what was going on”. Nolan also became involved in politically inflected theatre in the early 70s, influenced, she said, by her then husband Tom Kempinski’s experience of the 1968 “évènements” in Paris."
"In the 90s, everyone had heard the urban myth about black-market organ trading: the story of the poor chump who went to a party and woke up in a bath of ice minus a kidney. Now, with this blackly funny, cheerfully violent bad-taste comedy-horror, director Brea Grant riffs on the legend. Her film is set in 1999 in the ER unit of an Arkansas hospital where one of the nurses, Mandy (Angela Bettis), runs a side hustle in organ trafficking. Whenever a patient who is unlikely to make it is wheeled in, she earmarks them for harvest – and has even been known to nudge victims along with an injection of bleach. Mandy arrives for the night shift dead exhausted. Patients assume that she is overworked, but the truth is that Mandy is addicted to opiates, slipping vials of morphine into her scrubs pocket. She bankrolls her habit with the organ business, working in cahoots with nursing colleague Karen (Nikea Gamby-Turner). Bettis is terrific, beautifully underplaying Mandy’s bone-dry sense of humour: she is openly contemptuous of patients and their families, rolls her eyes at colleagues and refreshingly has zero anxiety to please. And while she may bump off the odd patient, she is also highly competent. She is not, however, a criminal mastermind. Things go seriously wrong when Mandy recruits her cousin, textbook airhead blonde Regina (Chloe Farnworth), who botches a kidney pick-up. After misplacing the organ, Regina puts on a nurse’s uniform and decides to find another patient to kill. It’s a throwaway film that perhaps I shouldn’t have enjoyed as much as I did, but Mandy is such a deliciously sour character."
"When T’Nia Miller first told her mother that she was dating a woman, she explained to her mum that she wasn’t there to see her have sex with men, so this was no different. “It’s just about me having really good friendships and beauty in my life,” she recalls saying. “That was it. We never had more of a conversation than that. If she had any issues, they were hers to deal with, not mine. She knew that. She’s a very educated, very well-read woman. For her, coming to terms with it was easy.” The east-London born actor is telling me this story over the phone as she walks her dog (she forgot about the interview and her seven-month-old pomeranian, Dilhi, needed his daily steps) because she’s taking part in the #YoungerMe campaign, an initiative by the LGBTQ+ young persons organisation Just Like Us, which asks how LGBTQ+ inclusive education would have helped older queer people when they were in school. “With my ‘coming out story’, I was very much supported by my family,” she continues, “but there are many children that aren’t. I know as a black actor what it meant to see people like me on the screen, and I think that’s exactly the same when it comes to sexuality and how we identify. That’s why Just Like Us is so important. It helps forge those intergenerational connections.” Miller says that she had “no exposure, no knowledge, nada” of LGBTQ+ issues growing up. “I’d never seen a queer person on TV and I didn’t know any queer people at all until I got to college. I used to travel from the East End to go to college in Notting Hill and that’s where I met my first queer family, as it were; people who were a little bit different than the social circle I was used to mixing with. My God, it was refreshing.” In fact, she kept her sexuality hidden until her early 20s. “I have Jamaican heritage. I love reggae music and I used to listen to a lot of bashment as a kid,” she says. “That scene, at the time, didn’t support me being queer. Although such views weren’t present in my family, in the wider society there was a shame shrouded on it, so I sort of denied it and pushed it back.” Ultimately, she ended up marrying a man and having children, “but by the time he started being an arsehole I realised: I have two kids, I’m a little older and I don’t give a shit about social pressure, so I’m going to start dating women. It was really that simple.” Miller has never been one for conventionality. While she followed a fairly traditional route of studying theatre at college and gaining a place at Guildford School of Acting, she arrived at university in her early 20s divorced, with two kids and a mortgage. She also refused to succumb to the tactics employed by the institution to break down its students so they can build them up into actors. “You go to drama school and you think these people are gods,” Miller says. “You feel very fortunate to be there and you believe these people. You’re young and impressionable. Yes, I had two kids, but I was under the age of 23. I was a baby who had babies. The difference is that I wasn’t going to cry and break down because, damn, I had already lived. That shit wasn’t going to get to me and that was a point of contention.” She recalls one horrific experience with a member of staff on her first day, who told her that she was lucky to be there as there were no good black actors in the industry. “Of course, we got into a back-and-forth. It wasn’t an argument, per se, but that’s that the moment I went, fuck, I’m back here …” she says. “You’re in an institution that doesn’t recognise you and minimises your experiences.” Does she feel like it was personal bias from the teachers or the institution itself that was racist? “I don’t think there’s a difference. The institution is not hiring the right people. Institutions are made up of people and policymakers. There was obviously personal bias among the teachers, but there were some beautiful teachers as well. It is about the texts and what is studied, and the parts that you’re cast in, if there is even a part for you because you have a darker hue. It’s down to the teachers who make the lesson plans to think about these things.” Thankfully, she says this isn’t something that she has encountered in her professional life. After finishing drama school, she graduated to small roles on shows such as The Bill and Holby City, finding meatier parts in Channel 4’s Dubplate Drama, an interactive series about a teenage grime MC, and, later, the groundbreaking queer film Stud Life, which was directed and written by Campbell X. In the latter, Miller played JJ, a masculine-presenting black lesbian working as a wedding photographer. “Campbell X made us do this method-acting thing,” she says of the role. “For three weeks we had rehearsals, and so I bound [my chest], packed and walked in that body. Sometimes I was mistaken for a young black boy and I got to understand my son more.” However, Miller was careful to avoid getting pigeonholed into the “queer actor” box, just as she was about taking on any roles that perpetuated a derogatory narrative about black people. “You always have choice,” she says. “I think that’s really important, otherwise I would have done so many things and my career would look very different. But when I first signed with my agent, I said: ‘I’m not prepared to play the stereotypical council estate prostitute single-parent mother.’ I am a single parent, but I wasn’t prepared to play those roles.” Miller has played police officers in her career, though “It’s weird as I don’t like the police,” she says. Does she feel differently about those roles now after the Black Lives Matter protests this year? “I look at them the same way. It was a role and I liked the role. Do I believe in the establishment as it is? No, I do not. Do I like the police? Not particularly. But if the script and character are good, and there’s an integrity in the story then yes, I’d play those roles again.” In previous interviews she has said that she has played characters that felt “whitewashed” – “just look at my CV; you can see them there,” she says – but even then, “it’s about what you, as the actor, bring to the part”. When she’s working with someone such as Russell T Davies, with whom Miller has collaborated twice, most recently on the dystopian drama Years & Years, she doesn’t have those issues. “He listens and he’s patient and he’s funny,” Miller says of Davies. “He takes the time and is invested in people. Also, we talk about people using their white privilege for good – he’s an amazing example of that. It’s about having conversations with the producers and the writers. Working with Russell, I was able to do that.” Her most recent role, as Hannah Grose in Netflix’s horror series The Haunting of Bly Manor, also provided the opportunity to tell a queer story that wasn’t centred around coming-out narratives, of which Miller is bored. “We had that lesbian love story and it was just a given,” she says. “I think we’re seeing that more in programming and that pleases me. That’s where it needs to be headed. What I will say is that we need more of it and more differently able-bodied people and different races.” Miller is aware of casting directors and agents having “difficult conversations” about inclusion, although she remains cautious about how change is brought about. “If the response is to just stick a load of black people on the screen, then that’s not really doing the job, in my opinion. It has to be behind the camera and in front of camera. It’s not just black people, too. Don’t think that you’ve filled your diversity quota by just sticking a black person in one of those roles. There are so many people to consider and until that happens, we’re not there yet.” The pandemic hasn’t helped, of course, and Miller says that it’s been hard to gauge whether any of the progress being discussed has actually been implemented. “I think that’s a longer journey,” she says. “Not too long, but I think it’s going to take a while to really find out.” 2020 hasn’t been a washout, though. Career wise, Miller has just returned from Spain where she has been shooting Spanish-Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar’s series La Fortuna, which also stars Stanley Tucci and Clarke Peters, star of The Wire. And Miller believes that without the pandemic, the spotlight on this summer’s Black Lives Matter protests wouldn’t have been so bright. “There has been a global social justice movement, which has never happened,” she says. “That’s the beauty of this year. Also, I got to spend three months in the sun. That was brilliant.”"
"In 2013, French documentary-maker Thomas Balmès made a film called Happiness, about an eight-year-old monk called Peyangki in the remote Himalayan village of Laya in Bhutan – and how this boy was responding to the astounding novelties of TV and the internet. Now seven years later, Balmès has returned to Laya and to Peyangki, who has grown to young adulthood in this brave new digital world. What Balmès has chanced upon now are not simply more instances of how the web has opened or closed that innocent mind: he gives us a sad and sombre love story from the globalised 21st century. Basically, Peyangki is now regularly neglecting his religious studies and is addicted to his smartphone and to the web, though arguably no more so than any other young person in the developed world. And in particular he is into the Chinese video service WeChat, through which he is regularly talking to a woman called Ugyen, apparently a bar hostess in Bhutan’s capital, Thimphu, who sings songs for him. Eventually, the two meet in the big city: Ugyen clearly didn’t quite grasp that he was so young and a trainee monk (rather than a possibly well-off farmer, which she assumed from his stories about collecting and selling mushrooms). And he didn’t realise that she had a small child and is, in any case, thinking of quitting the country for two years to do domestic work in Kuwait. It is a subdued film, and watching it is like continuously walking up a slight gradient. Balmès has subtly guided the stories of his two principals, though the setup is occasionally a little uncomfortable, as when the monk’s master tells Peyangki’s friend to search for him in the city. A thoughtful portrait of separate lives and destinies."
"It’s been a tough year, hasn’t it folks – with horrific bushfires, a global pandemic and the continued existence of Pete Evans. To say the spread of coronavirus has affected the worldwide movie industry is of course something of an understatement. The pandemic is acting as a great accelerant, fastening pre-existing trends towards a streaming-centric industry. The Australian film industry is more practised at being resilient than Hollywood, with homegrown productions battling for audiences at the best of times. This year they more than held their own, delivering plenty of fine works in a wide range of genres. Here are the 10 best Australian features from 2020, all receiving a local theatrical or streaming release (outside of film festivals) during the calendar year. There’s lots of talking in writer/director Serhat Caradee’s Sydney-set family drama, with almost the entire first act consisting of a single dialogue scene in the back of a car. Jamal (Tyler De Nawi) is the black sheep of his family, to say the least, secretly returning home to Sydney’s western suburbs to visit his dying mother after joining Islamic State in Syria. The radicalised Jamal engages in long and tense debates with his kith and kin, during skilfully constructed dialogue exchanges that toss around big discussions about motivations people have for joining groups like Isis. The pangs of pain and betrayal are never far from the surface, with a baffled and heartbroken family unable to separate the personal and the political. Big, bright, juicy colours dominate the mise en scene of director John Sheedy’s H is for Happiness . A vibrant aesthetic for a coming-of-age film about a very perky pipsqueak – the cherub-faced 12-year-old Candice (played charmingly by Daisy Axon). Candice becomes besties with the new boy at school, a potential love interest named Douglas (Wesley Patten), whose full name according to her is “Douglas Benson from Another Dimension”. The question of whether Douglas is indeed from another dimension is one of the subjects pondered in this sweet, nuanced and lovingly textured film, peppered with various Wes Andersonisms and coated in that beautiful, radiant, rainbow look. I’m tempted to say you don’t see films like Hot Mess much anymore: a nano budget character-oriented drama that turns scruffy aesthetics and pared-back production values into virtues. But in truth we didn’t see these films much before either. Sarah Gaul is utterly authentic as 20-something aspiring playwright Loz, who has a tenure at a small Sydney theatre (I used to live around the corner!) and struggles to balance her workload and love life. Writer/director Lucy Coleman brings a plucky spirit that reminded me of other spritzy dramedies from cash-strapped Australian film-makers – such as Love and Other Catastrophes, All My Friends are Leaving Brisbane and That’s Not Me. Hot Mess had a small number of event-based screenings in cinemas last year but didn’t receive a proper release until landing on Netflix in October. In Christiaan Van Vuuren’s feature film directorial debut, the camera is in on the joke; it probes the space for laughs. A Sunburnt Christmas is Bad Santa crossed with the 1987 Australian family movie Bushfire Moon, following an on-the-run-criminal (Daniel Henshall) who arrives at a tinder-dry farm in the middle of nowhere, recruiting a couple of children (Lena Nankivell and Eadan McGuinness) who believes he is Santa Claus to help him find stolen money hidden somewhere on the property. It’s cute, warm-spirited, very entertaining and not short on attitude and sass. Van Vuuren presents a unified approach to comedy, from script to performance and cinematography, bundling everything together to land the jokes. When the sentimental stuff eventually arrives, it’s well-earned and satisfying. The director Catherine Dwyer’s fist-pumping documentary about the women’s liberation movement in Australia during the 60s and 70s is one of those films that makes you want to take to the streets. The focus is on second wave feminists who saw a window for change and fought tooth and nail for it. Dwyer blends talking heads, photographs, posters, archival footage, music and more with momentum, capturing the movement’s energy. Many interesting discussions are raised, such as whether the activists ought to work within the system or try to rip it down: that age-old, important debate about reform versus revolution. Director Jeremy Sims’ remake of the excellent 2015 Icelandic drama of the same name stars Sam Neill and Michael Caton as brothers and neighbouring sheep farmers who haven’t spoken to each other in years. It is a very thoughtful drama about masculinity, isolation, long-held familial grievances and, erm, that annoying yobbo redneck who happens to be your brother. Caton is the belligerent drunk and Neill the more sedate and sensible of the pair. Both react in different ways to the compulsory culling of their prized cattle following the spread of a terrible disease. What at first feels like a simple film grows increasingly nuanced, buoyed by a gentle but profound tone and temperament. David Wenham’s career is ageing like fine wine or malted whisky, the actor exuding gravitas as a pasty-faced gold thief who teams up with an Afghan cameleer (Ahmad Malek). But fine wine and whisky sound a tad too gentle on the palette, given his gritty and gravelly portrayal in writer/director Roderick MacKay’s commandingly styled western. Is it possible to age like fine ... rocket fuel? The Furnace is another reminder that the Australian or “meat pie” western is alive, well and packing heat, adding to the genre’s very impressive recent titles – including Warwick Thornton’s Sweet Country and Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale. Its focus on ethnic minority communities (including Chinese immigrants and Islamic, Sikh and Hindu cameleers) suggests there are many more stories to tell and histories to revisit. You know Leigh Whannell’s second feature as a director – a US/Australia co-production, like his terrific previous film Upgrade – is working on bizarrely good levels when you can sense the titular character on the frame, despite no human actor being there, and anticipate with utter dread his next move. Every Invisible Man movie has involved dodgy men and their use of the sleaziest of all superpowers, from Claude Rains’ flaky scientist in the 1933 original to Chevy Chase’s yuppie stock analyst in 1992’s Memoirs of an Invisible Man. This time things are decidedly different, with Whannell washing away the B movie tropes to configure a thrilling drama about domestic violence and the terror of living with an abusive partner. A wonderful performance by Elisabeth Moss further elevates already powerful material as the terrorised protagonist Cecilia. Time makes monsters of us all is, broadly speaking, what I think director Natalie Erika James is getting at in her mysterious and big-thinking rumination on womanhood, family and dementia, which dabbles in the visual language and atmospheric framework of a horror movie. A deteriorating elderly lady, Edna (Robyn Nevin) is losing her grip on her memories and her mind – possibly also on her relationship with her daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote). Presented with a musty and sticky veneer, creating the impression that moss may be growing in the spaces between pixels, James finds various ways to reiterate in visual terms the key theme of the passing of time – from visions of an overgrown tennis court to mouldy produce in a fruit bowl. All the performances are great and the film is weirdly and intensely effective, yanking the heartstrings while delivering the collywobbles. When I interviewed George MacKay, who plays Ned Kelly in Justin Kurzel’s brilliantly bold and punkish film, the actor spoke about the famous bush outlaw using words that have stayed in my mind ever since – describing him as “a man who became, in the end, a fridge magnet”. Re-teaming with Snowtown scribe Shaun Grant and adapting Peter Carey’s best-selling novel, Kurzel’s thrillingly cerebral exercise positions the iconoclastic historical figure inside pop culture’s infinite cycle: less a hero or a villain than, indeed, a future fridge magnet, doomed to be reduced by his own destiny. The dialogue is strewn with lines reminding us the film is about the loss of life to legend and man to myth; also of history as an endless process of reinvention, ever-informed by the mores of the present. The drama gains velocity as it tumbles forward to the shootout at Glenrowan – a stunning sequence that paints in electric prose the film’s feverish meta qualities."
"As a child in 1960s east Harlem, documentary film-maker Sam Pollard was “profoundly touched” by two events. The assassination of John F Kennedy, in 1963, when Pollard was in junior high school. Then, five years later, the murder of Martin Luther King.  Yet as he grew up, Pollard found his memory of those events softening round the edges. “You think back and try to remember how you reacted to everything going on, particularly the March on Washington, and it all swirls around in your head,” he says. “Some things get lost. You think: ‘Wow, was that really happening?’ It’s history, but not so long ago that I can’t remember it.” That is as good an explanation as any for why someone would pursue a career in archival nonfiction cinema. For Pollard – a veteran documentarian who was nominated for an Oscar for 1997’s 4 Little Girls, about the 1963 murder of black children at a Baptist church by the Ku Klux Klan – it is also the rationale behind his new feature, MLK/FBI. The film aims to clarify and remind, looking not only at the complicated legacy of a civil rights leader who is all but enshrined as a saint, but also at the culture of federal law enforcement hostile to him and his cause. As opposing entities cloaked in nostalgia and ideology that must be peeled back to get at the truth, it is impossible to understand one without the other, Pollard believes. “I thought it could be another way to look at Dr King, and another way to break down the mythology of the FBI,” he says. “This was an opportunity to interrogate the images they’d made for themselves, and for each other.” David Garrow’s eye-popping book The FBI and Martin Luther King, Jr: From ‘Solo’ to Memphis provided what the director calls “the framework that became the genesis of the film”. Together, Pollard and Garrow expanded the research, filing countless freedom of information requests to access once-classified FBI documents. “It’s actually not that difficult to get material from the FBI,” Pollard says with a half-laugh. “It’s just that once you do, there are always a lot of redactions in it. What will be key are the actual audiotapes that will come out in 2027. But we were still able to piece together a lot from other transcripts about how they tried to discredit Dr King.” The tapes Pollard mentions, set for release later this decade by a 1977 court order, contain the recordings that J Edgar Hoover’s FBI surreptitiously collected through years of covert surveillance on King and his associates. The constant invasions of privacy were just one plank in a wider campaign of harassment recounted in granular detail throughout the film via pristinely preserved footage and audio. While the Bureau cultivated a fanbase through adulatory portrayals in an officially sanctioned TV series and films such as Walk a Crooked Mile and The FBI Story, it did everything in its power to undermine and defame King. His progressivism so threatened its status quo that agents sent King’s wife, Coretta, a tape of her husband allegedly conducting an extramarital affair, along with a note exhorting him to kill himself for the good of his movement. Pollard takes a nuanced stance, laying bare the injustice without excusing King’s indiscretions. “I think the thing that’s fascinating about this material is its understanding that Dr King was a human being,” he says. “He’s put forward as an iconic presence, but I felt strongly that we wanted to represent him in a more complex way. He was a man, and like many of us, multitasking. He was leading the struggle, while dealing with his personal life and its baggage. He was wrestling with the choice to speak out against Vietnam, and the backlash he received from that. He was dealing with the knowledge that he and his associates were being constantly watched by the FBI, which also took its toll on him.” The film shows King in repose, around the house and at the dinner table and surrounded by family; humanising looks at a larger-than-life figure. But Pollard also engages with his subject intellectually, connecting his beliefs about protest to a US that, to this day, is fraught with racial tensions, as sentiments critical of police grow more widespread. Although King urged non-violence, a talking point centrists love to trot out as a counter to more radical demonstrations, he also said that a riot is the language of the unheard. “Dr King makes a TV appearance,” Pollard says, “and the woman asks him: ‘Don’t you think your protests are causing the violence in these cities?’ The reality is when peaceful social protests happen, we’re saying that we want change and we’re willing to request that in a passive way. But there are people in America angrier than that who can’t take it. With enough systemic racism, people say enough is enough, then looting or burning is just what happens. Peaceful protests don’t lead to it. It’s a reaction. The death of George Floyd leads to it. The death of Breonna Taylor leads to it … What do you expect, when someone’s got their foot on your neck for hundreds of years?” The film posits that in his wariness of authority and his commitment to equality, King would have been more attuned to the world of 2020 than most in his day. But Pollard harbours no illusions about the man’s character, and how it might be received in an era increasingly harsh about personal failings. One of MLK/FBI’s major themes is the ease with which a man’s personal life can be turned against him, a practice that has been all but mainstreamed in the years since King’s death. Between the heightened moral standards in activism and the reactionaries still raging against everything he fought for, he would be under the same ethical microscope. “Unless he could have adapted to the time,” says Pollard, “he’d have been ripped to shreds, man,. Eaten alive.”"
"It is a lonely business, being a Tom Cruise fan in 2020. The heel lifts, the way his arms pump when he runs (nobody runs like Tom Cruise), his Dorian Gray looks: I love Cruise for all of it, and yet I’m aware this is a deeply unfashionable opinion, and one I’m often called on to defend at dinner parties. And so it befalls me, as Cruise’s solitary champion, to step to his aid now, like Ethan Hunt in a tuxedo taking on a posse of earpiece-wearing hitmen, as behind him an orchestra plays Nessun Dorma. Earlier this week, The Sun released leaked audio of Cruise berating the crew of Mission: Impossible 7, which is filming at the Warner Bros Studio in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, for breaking Covid safety protocols. “If I see you do it again,” yelled Cruise at two crew members he’d spotted standing within two metres of each other, “you’re fucking gone. And if anyone in this crew does it, that’s it – and you too, and you too. And you, don’t you ever fucking do it again.” Cruise, who is producing and starring in the blockbuster, went on: “I’m on the phone with every fucking studio at night! Insurance companies! Producers! And they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies. We are creating thousands of jobs you motherfuckers! I don’t ever want to see it again. Ever! And if you don’t do it, you’re fired. No apologies. You can tell it to the people who are losing their fucking homes, because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education. That’s what I sleep with every night – the future of this fucking industry!” Clearly Cruise lost his temper, and it was wrong for him to shout at the crew. But – and this is a pretty colossal but – Cruise is under a phenomenal amount of pressure right now, the sort of pressure that would get to anyone, even Hollywood megastars who audition their future girlfriends on private jets. Listening to the rant, what I heard was not a tyrannical producer who likes to bully his subordinates out of a sense of personal vindictiveness, but a man under a near-inhuman amount of stress. Although he used profane language, Cruise wasn’t derogatory: he didn’t call the crew morons, or scream personal insults. This wasn’t a racist or sexist rant: it was a stern telling-off from someone who goes to bed at night worrying about the hundreds of people whose jobs rely upon him. When Cruise spoke about spending every evening on the phone to insurance companies, trying to keep the Mission: Impossible 7 set running, I felt sorry for him. The actor George Clooney, himself a director and producer, defended Cruise after the story broke. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show, Clooney said: “He [Cruise] didn’t overreact, because it [breaking safety protocols] is a problem … [He’s] in a position of power and it’s tricky, right?” Clooney added: “If production goes down, a lot of people lose their jobs. People have to understand that and be responsible.” Running a film set in the middle of a global pandemic makes rappelling down the Burj Khalifa (Cruise’s most famous stunt) look a breeze – I know which one I’d rather do, and I’m terrified of heights. Hardly any movies are filming right now, because it’s simply too expensive: the chances that one of the hundreds of people on set will contract Covid at some point, causing production to shut down, are too high. Every day a set is closed costs producers tens of thousands of pounds. As Cruise rightly observed during his rant: “People who are losing their fucking homes, because our industry is shut down.” Industry bible Variety estimates that 465,000 people were out of work in Hollywood this year, owing to Covid; in the UK, the figure was estimated at around 50,000. In addition to these woes, Hollywood is reckoning with the existential challenge posed by streaming platforms, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. In a sign of which way the wind is blowing, WarnerMedia recently released its entire 2021 film slate to streaming services, to the consternation of The Suicide Squad director James Gunn, and Tenet director Christopher Nolan. It’s only through Cruise’s superhuman will power, deep pockets, and personal clout that the Mission: Impossible 7 set is even running at all. Cruise reportedly shelled out £500,000 of his own money for two cruise ships to house workers safely during filming. “Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups,” a source explained at the time to the Sun. In addition to keeping the Mission: Impossible 7 set going – providing employment to hundreds of people – Cruise has also been generous in support of other directors. In August 2020, he filmed himself attending Tenet at the Waterloo Imax in London, to reassure people that cinemagoing was safe. (Looking very fetching in a tight black jumper and colour-coordinated respirator mask as he did – only Cruise could make PPE look so manly.) Before, Cruise has urged audiences to turn off the “motion smoothing” on their TV sets. (While he was in his Top Gun costume – I swooned.) Motion smoothing is a technique used to improve the quality of high-definition sport, which is now increasingly offered as standard in high-definition TV sets. It makes films look rubbish: naff, and like soap operas. Cruise is an old-school movie star, in the best possible way, and he wants to preserve the magic of cinema as an experience, even if audiences are watching his films at home, in their pants, on their brand-new tellies. Because if Tom Cruise is going to hang off a cargo plane while it takes off for your entertainment, the least you can do is fix the settings on your TV. Cruise is, by all accounts, not a systematic bully. He does not usually tyrannise his crew. Few negative stories emerge about his conduct on set. Brett Ratner, he is not. Cruise can be challenging to work with – he is famously a perfectionist, as tough on himself as he is on others – but he is not cruel. Speaking to Vulture last July, his former co-star in Mission: Impossible 2, Thandie Newton, recounted an experience in which Cruise asked her to reshoot a scene dozens of times, because he wasn’t happy with her performance. “It was a real shame,” Newton says, “and bless him … because he was trying his damnedest.” Newton said that Cruise “tries super-hard to be a nice person. But the pressure – he takes on a lot.” If you’re looking for a person who’s singlehandedly trying to save a movie business that’s on its knees, gun pointed at its head, Cruise is your man. But every man has his limits, and it seems that Cruise has finally found his. And who could blame him? Making a film during Covid – that’s mission impossible. Even Ethan Hunt has a breaking point."
"Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó deserves our thanks for going somewhere very few film-makers want to go: out on a limb. Many a time, his neck has been risked and his arm has been chanced; he makes movies to challenge us. White God (2014) was a Hitchcockian nightmare about a mass uprising among all the dogs in a city, and Jupiter’s Mood (2017) was a fantasy superhero-parable about a Syrian refugee who gets the ability to fly after being shot by an immigration cop.Most of his movies have been set in Hungary, but this new drama, scripted by Kata Wéber (who also wrote White God and Jupiter’s Moon), is his first English-language film, set in an indeterminate American city (but filmed in Quebec). It’s a vehement, forthright and sometimes unwatchably painful and upsetting emotional drama about the death of a baby; his two stars, Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf, are at all times giving it upwards of 10,000%, especially Kirby. This is clearly a personally engaged film for its creators; I wanted to admire it and in a sense I do. But there is something self-conscious and hammily plotted about it, once we have got past the real-time ordeal of its terrifying opening scene. There are times when a North American transplant of this European director is unconvincing, and the central situation itself is like a pop-art image rather than the impassioned real thing. We are uncomfortably close to Lars von Trier territory, or maybe Atom Egoyan at his most prescriptive. Sean (LaBeouf) is a builder working on a bridge whose construction we see very symbolically being completed throughout the drama. He is a rough-around-the-edges, blue-collar kind of guy, but his pregnant partner, Martha (Kirby), comes from a posher background. Her ageing mother, Elizabeth (Ellen Burstyn), is a tough woman of Hungarian Jewish background who as a baby escaped the Holocaust, and is now in the first stages of dementia. She disapproves of the oafish Sean and is not so subtly dismayed by the fact of the pregnancy that appears to make his unfortunate union with her daughter permanent. She has also irritated Sean by insisting on buying the couple a pricey family-type people carrier, through the good offices of her car-dealer son-in-law Chris (played by director and actor Benny Safdie).The moment of birth arrives, and with it a well-meaning midwife called Eva (Molly Parker), a last-minute replacement for one they wanted, but who earnestly takes on board Martha’s desire to have her baby at home. Tragedy strikes like a bolt of lightning, and Kirby shows how Martha goes into a state of shock and unprocessed rage and horror. The film persuasively and sympathetically shows how Sean thinks her decisions after the tragedy amount to an act of self-harm that she will regret, and also depicted how this terrible event has raked up all Elizabeth’s agonised thoughts about what it takes to survive.But the film also gets bogged down in a lot of frankly inauthentic, silly and jarring plot points involving the existence of Martha’s cousin, a fierce lawyer called Suzanne whom Elizabeth wants to fight for a prosecution and also for compensation: she is played by Sarah Snook (Shiv, from TV’s Succession). This character is sketchily imagined, and the legal case and its courtroom technicalities aren’t convincing.The movie is at its very best at the (agonising) beginning and also, maybe, at the very end with its enigmatic, almost dream-like scene centred around an apple tree. The physicality of that opening, harrowing sequence is strongly managed: it has drama and compassion. (Interestingly, Susie Orbach is credited as a “technical expert”.) But as for everything in the middle – the people on the screen and their relationships look like high-flown imaginings, far from real life. The film is like an intensively bred hothouse flower that can’t exist in the open air."
"Musa Hadid is the popular Palestinian mayor of Ramallah in the West Bank, and this thoughtful, sympathetic documentary tracks his stressful day-to-day working life – shown suddenly getting a lot more stressful in 2017 when President Trump announced his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. Hadid feels strongly that this move emboldened Israel’s military to be more menacing in Ramallah, with soldiers marching into stores and demanding to see security camera footage on the grounds that there could be images of terrorists – and even doing the same at city hall. The film lets you appreciate Hadid’s delicate and complex situation. He is often receiving high-profile international visitors and relishes the opportunity to show off the city he loves – the opening and closing sequences of this film, incidentally, almost feel like the introduction to Woody Allen’s Manhattan. One such VIP is Prince William, though some of Hadid’s colleagues are less than happy: “All the problems of our country come from Britain!” says one, referring to the 1923 Mandate. Hadid is evidently irritated by some foreigners (such as a German delegation) who lecture him about the compromises necessary on both sides, implying an equivalence, and annoyed also that such events always come as a “balancing” of a visit to Israel. The boost for Ramallah, though gratifying in some ways, might also mean that the world might gradually come to think that it is the natural capital of Palestine, and Jerusalem the capital of Israel – though this is very far from what Palestinians want. And all the time the normal municipal problems have to be sorted out. Hadid is shown as touchingly enamoured of the impressive Vegas-style fountain display outside City Hall."
"This telephonically themed horror film, set in nameless American suburbia circa 1987, is not to be confused with the Korean horror film of the same name that also came out this year (and relies crucially on a landline call). This confection is a fairly shonky assemblage of tired tropes, full of dropped connections and annoying static. Its biggest virtue is that it contains another gamey, and game-for-anything, performance from horror-film matriarch Lin Shaye. Shaye has played spooky ladies in scads of scary films, such as the Insidious franchise and lesser known fare such as the enticingly titled Helen Keller vs Nightwolves. Here she is Edith Cranston, a former schoolteacher who has been a raving mess since being blamed for the death of one of her pupils (although never convicted of the murder). Nevertheless, a gaggle of teenagers, including Tonya (Erin Sanders), older sister of the murdered child, has persisted in taunting, teasing, playing pranks and bullying Edith for years. When Tonya and new kid in town Chris (Chester Rushing), along with brothers Brett (Sloane Morgan Siegel) and Zack (Mike Manning), finally push Cranston too far, she kills herself. But her husband Edward (Tobin Bell) summons the high-school seniors back to the house with a strange proposition: if they make a phone call on a decrepit old princess phone, ostensibly to a handset installed in Edith’s grave, and stay on the line for just one minute, they’ll each earn a substantial inheritance. Being teens in an American horror film, the kids are too stupid and greedy to twig this is a terrible idea. Traumatic flashbacks, mangled corpses with gymnastic abilities and blood-splattered undead apparitions soon ensue. One might posit a subtextual interpretation that the youth of today, reared on mobiles, are so unaccustomed to landlines that they see these once ubiquitous household fixtures simply as conveyances for transmitting evil."
"If ever you had the idea there was something bohemian or glamorous or Bukowskian about drinking in a Las Vegas bar … then this movie will wise you right up. It’s a docu-realist fiction about a seedy place called The Roaring 20s, in Las Vegas, which is about to close for good. (The films was actually shot at a place called The Roaring 20s in New Orleans, which is still open for business, but maybe there’s something about the desolation and melancholy in a bar that makes every closing time feel like the last closing time ever.) The film-makers got the barflies present, with one professional actor in the mix, to improvise over a long day’s journey into night and the following day, while doing real drinking and apparently dropping real acid. This isn’t actually as spectacular as they have might have expected; it leads only to a belligerent near-fight. The result is sometimes heart-rending and sometimes hilarious. One desolate guy announces: “I pride myself on only having become an alcoholic after I became a failure.” He also explains something of his backstory: “I overslept one morning and the bottom fell out of manufacturing.” Meanwhile, the boozing and the boasting and meaningless slurred arguments continue, to the soundtrack of Michael Jackson, Patsy Cline and Kenny Rogers’ The Gambler (twice). A beyond-drunk woman called Pam seated at the bar terrifyingly hoists up her top and announces proudly: “Look! Sixty-year-old titties!” The man next to her gallantly remarks that they are “higher than some men’s nutsack” – to which she responds: “I once divorced a man because his nutsack hung down lower than his dick.” If only TS Eliot could have got his pub-going “sweet ladies” in The Waste Land to say anything half as resonant as that. This is a fascinating slice of Americana which reminded me of 70s movie-making, like John Huston’s Fat City. I half-expected young Stacy Keach and Jeff Bridges to roll in for a few whiskies."
"One Night in Miami is a fluent, high-minded, if sometimes slightly inert movie, with an invigorating interest in ideas and debate – and it begins with a brutally effective sucker-punch of racism from the Jim Crow/antebellum world. Regina King directs with flair, working from the script that Kemp Powers (co-director of Pixar’s Soul) has adapted from his own stage play. This is a Stoppardian high-concept display, imagining the conversation of four legendary African Americans who really did come together in Miami in 1964 after the boxing victory of Cassius Clay (as he then was) over Sonny Liston. The world is about to change, and they are ringside.Eli Goree plays Clay, euphoric and slightly terrified by his own emerging greatness; Kingsley Ben-Adir is Malcolm X, keen to nail down Clay’s private promises to convert to Islam; Aldis Hodge is Jim Brown, the NFL megastar thinking of going into the movies; and Leslie Odom Jr is soul singer Sam Cooke, under fire for going along with the white music establishment. The movie puts them all in the same motel room – Malcolm X’s – and this is to be, to quote the Hamilton musical, the room where it happens; or at any rate, where what’s going to happen gets talked about. (Without comment, King lets us absorb the faint echo of the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in 1968.) Meanwhile, wives and children get distractedly phoned up, but women themselves are absent from the action and debate. Chiefly at stake is the world of Malcolm X, about to break away and start his own organisation, and so tensely aware that claiming Clay as a prestige convert would be of enormous help. Clay is suddenly unsure if abandoning all that delicious secular pleasure is what he wants to do. Brown feels sports have got him just as far as they’re going to, and that maybe he can cash in his celebrity capital and transfer it to the movies. Cooke angrily defends his own career, proclaiming the real black power of his lucrative music publishing empire.One exchange between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke rang a little false for me. Cooke has just told them how the Rolling Stones have covered a tune written by his contracted protege Bobby Womack: It’s All Over Now, doing far better with it than any black star. Then Malcolm X tauntingly asks him how it is that Bob Dylan can make the kind of chart-topping protest music that black people should be doing. Well, the obvious answer is – because Dylan is white. Hasn’t Cooke already explained this? Hasn’t he given him the example of Bobby Womack and the Rolling Stones recording the same song? But Cooke and the movie itself are weirdly reluctant to spell it out, perhaps because Dylan is another icon-ally on the right side of history. At any rate, it’s an engaging and spirited piece of work."
"For his children’s films, Robert Rodriguez long ago established his own style in strip-cartoon type graphics, garish colour schemes and affordable digital effects – notably with the genuinely likable and now almost 20-year-old gem, Spy Kids, which starred Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. But since then, his line in family movies has felt visually wearing, hectoring and pretty flat, without much in the way of a funny script. This new one pops thinly like day-old bubblegum, with the same lack of anything satisfying or nutritious. It is a sequel to his entirely disposable 2005 kids’ film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, which felt like he had knocked it out in a month in his edit suite. This follow-up isn’t quite as insufferable, but it has the same tendency to confuse hyperactivity with energy, and that reference to David Bowie in the title is not earned, unless we’re talking about turning into a type of chocolate assortment. Taylor Dooley returns as Lavagirl, but Taylor Lautner, the original Sharkboy, was apparently not available for this movie, so his character is now behind a mask. These characters are only cameos anyway. Now it is all about the new tween generation, the wacky, moody kids of the superheroes, particularly Missy Moreno (YaYa Gosselin), who is the daughter of Marcus Moreno (The Mandolarian’s Pedro Pascal – also appearing as a supervillain in Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman 1984). She and a bunch of other Gen Z contemporaries find themselves cooped up in a creche-style school classroom in the grownup superheroes’ HQ, presided over by the stern Ms Granada (Priyanka Chopra) until they realise they have to save the world against an alien invasion. This is pretty ho-hum stuff, but it could keep very young kids quiet over a lockdown Christmas."
"This typically ambitious Pixar animation comes on like a fever-dream cross between Disney’s Fantasia and Powell and Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death, with a bizarre hint of Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones thrown in for good measure. A tale of a music teacher who loses his life but discovers his soul, it’s a visually sumptuous riot of ideas, pitched somewhere between a playful musical, a divine comedy and a metaphysical drama. Just as the Minions movie opened to the delightful helium sounds of its heroes happily “ba-ba-BA”-ing the famous Universal theme, so Soul begins with the distinctive Disney anthem being jazzily murdered by a discordant school band. If music teacher Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) could wish upon a star, he’d wish to be somewhere else, preferably tinkling the ivories at a swinging club. Joe’s dream comes true when he gets a late-in-the-day call asking him to sit in with hip jazz saxophonist Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett). The audition goes well – so well, in fact, that Joe leaves with his head in the clouds and promptly falls to his death down an open manhole. So far, so slapstick. Yet finding himself on a moving stairway to the Great Beyond, and determined not to miss the chance of a lifetime, Joe runs the other way and winds up in the Great Before, a dreamy neverland where protean souls are assigned “unique and individual personalities” before being sent to Earth. Here, he meets 22 (Tina Fey), who has refused to take her place in the real world despite the best efforts of a string of teachers, including Gandhi, Lincoln and Mother Teresa (“I made her cry”). And thus it falls to the disembodied Joe to help 22 find her spark, with unexpected body-swapping results. Co-written and directed by Pete Docter, Soul shares many of the traits of his previous outings, Up and Inside Out. Like the latter, it addresses existential issues (the construction of personality; nature v nurture) through the accessible language of animation – like a theologically fired revisiting of the strip cartoon The Numskulls. And like Up, in which an old man rediscovers the meaning of life after turning his house into a helium balloon-powered airship, it ties its redemptive message to a bizarrely convoluted plot that occasionally trips over its own narrative shoelaces. It’s easy to become blase about the visual brilliance, both technical and artistic, of Pixar’s output, but Soul really is a treat for the eyes. From the almost photo-realist clarity of the earthbound scenes (the jazz club interiors give Damien Chazelle’s work on The Eddy a run for its money) to the otherworldly eeriness of the out-of-body segments, it’s a pleasure to watch. Witness the tangible physical beauty of Joe’s fingers flitting across the keyboards as music transports him to another dimension, juxtaposed with the wonderful strangeness of creatures from another world that resemble trippy line drawings of Fred Flintstone as reimagined by Picasso. With an original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and jazz compositions and arrangements by Jon Batiste (the ambassadorial house-band leader for Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show), Soul has musical pizzazz to spare. Foxx, who won an Oscar playing Ray Charles, lends emotional depth to Pixar’s first African American leading role, with co-director/writer Kemp Powers (along with consultants such as anthropologist Dr Johnnetta Cole) ensuring that the film’s cultural reference points strike just the right note.

"Tom Cruise has been recorded screaming obscenities at crew members on his current film Mission: Impossible 7 after apparent breaches of on-set social distancing guidelines. The Sun published an audio recording of Cruise shouting and swearing at film crew on the project, of which is he one of the producers, threatening instant dismissal of anyone found to be contravening distancing rules. On the recording Cruise can be heard shouting: “I don’t ever want to see it again, ever! And if you don’t do it, you’re fired, if I see you do it again, you’re fucking gone. And if anyone in this crew does it – that’s it, and you too and you too … don’t you ever fucking do it again.” “That’s it! No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education.” Cruise appeared to be reacting after crew members were spotted standing too close to each other by a computer screen at Leavesden studios in the UK. Like all major Hollywood productions, Mission: Impossible 7 has been hampered by potentially catastrophic delays and shutdowns due to the pandemic. Production in Italy was halted in February after authorities banned public gatherings in response to the first wave of coronavirus, but in July permission was given for shooting to restart in the UK after Cruise personally appealed to culture secretary Oliver Dowden. In October, filming in Italy was suspended again after reports of a positive Covid test on set. Underlying Cruise’s outburst is his sense that the production is functioning as a model for how Hollywood can continue to work under pandemic conditions, with the actor stating: “I’m on the phone with every fucking studio at night, insurance companies, producers, and they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies. We are creating thousands of jobs you motherfuckers … Movies are going because of us. If we shut down it’s going to cost people fucking jobs, their home, their family. That’s what’s happening.” The film’s production company has been approached for comment."
"There comes a time in the life of a writer, director and, perhaps, a company when the days shorten, the shadows lengthen and contemplating the inevitable must begin. The guy in the cloak with the retro lawn equipment can’t be ignored any longer: Death. In Pixar’s latest film, Soul, mortality springs itself with supreme bad timing on protagonist Joe Gardner, a New York jazzman about to play the gig of his life when he falls down a manhole. After 2017’s Coco and this year’s Onward, this is Pixar’s third film about death in as many years. Is this fixation the Californian animation giant’s midlife crisis in multimillion-dollar CGI form? Soul, directed by Pete Docter, is a classy offering with smart colouring-book metaphysics in the vein of his 2015 film Inside Out, as Joe attempts to escape the “Great Beyond” and return to his body, via the “Great Before”. This is the realm where nascent souls must find their spark – their animating passion in life – and are then dispatched to Earth. Visually drawing on Powell and Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death, broaching the dark subject for children with life-affirming insouciance, and – featuring the company’s first black lead character – a big diversity coup, it’s a typically slick, four-quadrant-pleasing, stock price-boosting entertainment package. This is what Pixar do. But the company has been showing its age lately. A run of almost uniformly dazzling films culminated in 2010’s Toy Story 3. But under Disney’s management, a weariness set in: too many sequels, and originals that didn’t have the conceptual snap of that brilliant first spree. Perhaps the injection of morbidity is how Docter – also Pixar’s chief creative officer since 2018 – has planned to startle the studio out of its corporate lull, reconnect it with weighty themes and get its mojo back. Maybe it isn’t that premeditated. Perhaps it is a natural consequence of where Pixar’s top personnel are in life: Docter is 52, entering the decade where, as parents die and ageing really kicks in, death starts to become more than theoretical party-poop. Lee Unkrich – director of Coco, set in the Mexican “Land of the Dead” – is 53, though last year, in a very mid-life decision, quit Pixar to spend more time with his family. Onward’s director Dan Scanlon is only 44 but definitely, to use a golfing metaphor, moving on to the back nine. His film – set in a kind of Dungeons & Dragons-flavoured suburbia filled with centaur cops and a manticore restaurant manager – is the one that deals most directly with death in the form of loss. Its teenage elf brothers try to complete a “visitation spell” that will bring back their dad – a story inspired by Scanlon’s own life, as his father was killed in a car accident when he was one. Death, though, has always lurked in Pixar’s filmography in the sense of the creeping passage of time. Docter’s second film, Up, was roundly praised for its initial 10-minute sequence: a wordless prelude charting the years of lead character Carl’s marriage to Ellie, their inability to have children and her eventual passing. It was a stunningly sombre opening to a kid’s adventure romp. The driving motor of the Toy Story films is Woody’s fear, and struggle to accept, that he may become redundant as his owners Andy and Bonnie grow older. In toy terms, this is death – haunted by the prospect of dispatch to the refuse heap or, in the fourth film, the junk shop; decrepit, sad afterlives that are the opposite of being alive in the hands of a child. This fear of obsolescence – of being cast into shadowlands unlit by the imagination – is as much a part of Pixar’s identity as the cute anglepoise lamp. It’s also there in Wall-E’s vision of planetary landfill, a pile-up of defunct human objects and history. Or another oubliette: the Memory Dump in Inside Out, where Riley’s childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong must be jettisoned in order to allow her to grow up. Pixar understands this theme so well because the birth of the company itself signified a moment of pop-culture obsolescence, of the old pre-90s analogue world, in order to give way to the new digital age of infinite play. “Memento Woody” could be its motto. Toy Story is suffused with nostalgia, for the era of wholesome postwar entertainment that the likes of Woody and Bo-Peep represent. But however lovingly it evokes that feel of that world, down to the stitching on a cowboy’s friesian waistcoat and the cheap plastic snap of Buzz Lightyear’s wings, it did as much to kill it off as anyone. Consumers expect far more these days, and Hollywood’s digital CGI wizards can conjure up anything to match our expectations. Their boundless ability to encompass all eras of past pop-culture and simulate any reality, from a Lilliputian toy’s paradise to a bone-clattering Dia de los Muertos fantasia, only reflects our culture’s hunger for non-stop entertainment and distraction. Pixar is part of the same San Francisco Silicon Valley elite that, elsewhere with companies like the Google-backed Calico, is busy trying to “cure” death. Maybe depicting that great intangible is the one remaining frontier for its entertainment arm to conquer, irresistible to those with a nagging sense of ontological horror: that if you have the godlike ability to create anything, does that mean that, underneath, is really … nothing? No wonder Pixar metaphysics only come in primary colours. Dealing with death in its recent films, it has preferred to hew close to JM Barrie’s “awfully big adventure” line, with Coco and Soul making death just another big playground for kids to explore. Soul was inspired by Docter’s realisation, in the seconds after his son was born, that his innate personality was already formed. But, fundamentally rooted in Joe Gardner’s quest to return to Earth, play his gig and prove to himself that his life hasn’t been a pointless waste of time, the film is very much the adult’s perspective on death. It’s another mark on the side of the ledger that says Pixar secretly aren’t in the business of making films for children. Docter is also a practising Presbyterian who gives interviews to church media, but neither Soul, Coco or Onward have an obvious faith agenda; he has said the company is not about converting people. But there is nonetheless a kind of theology to this run of work, a subtle individualism visible in Soul’s search for a personal spark in the Great Before, which looks very much like a soft-play Silicon Valley campus. Or, co-existing with the Latino family values veneer, Coco’s insistence that its young mariachi Miguel must not ignore his musical calling. Similarly, searching for his father allows the young elf Ian to ditch the self-esteem issues and grow into a true spell-caster. That is Pixar’s corporate-evangelist meaning of life: to live your true potential. Whether that message is strong enough to act as a form of solace in a year in which death has been more close by than most remains to be seen. And Covid-19 could just be the 21st-century’s amuse-bouche for even greater environmental catastrophe that would mean le fin for possibly hundreds of millions more people. Wall-E sounded an early warning about that, but Pixar’s articles of faith – play and the imagination – are strong in the face of such darkness. Even in the valley of death, there was an inspirational videocassette and a comedy cockroach."
"Tom Cruise follows me on Twitter. Until now, I have been relatively proud of this fact, even though he follows tens of thousands of people, and only tweets three times a year, and his account is probably run by his staff, and he wouldn’t actually be able to tell you what Twitter was if you held a gun to his head. Regardless, I was proud. But now I feel like a failure, because Tom Cruise has never sent me a cake. And it turns out that all Tom Cruise does is send cakes to people. According to Yahoo, every year he orders more than 100 white chocolate coconut bundt cakes from Doan’s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California, and sends them to his famous friends. Rosie O’Donnell gets one. Kirsten Dunst gets one. Jimmy Fallon gets one. James Corden gets one. Graham Norton gets one, and his staff eat it without telling him. Henry Cavill called it “the most decadent, the most amazing cake”. Barbara Walters once ate hers live on television, in a power move as yet unmatched by any mortal human. And of course it is a good cake. Tom Cruise doesn’t operate by half measures. He thrives on intensity. He once explained how to make spaghetti carbonara to Oprah Winfrey with such ferocious conviction that I immediately started making it his way, no questions asked, in case he found out and ran to my house and kicked me in the throat. As I said, of course it’s a good cake. The Yahoo story is full of nice details. Cruise chose Doan’s as his bakery of choice because Diane Keaton bought one of its cakes to prove that it was tastier than Katie Holmes’ favourite cake. Cruise’s team takes each cake to a secondary location to be gift-wrapped before they send it out to recipients. Dunst calls it the “Cruise cake”. Despite all this, the most important thing here is the knowledge that Cruise has now officially become more legend than man. In truth, he was already well on the way. This summer, a conversation he had with culture secretary Oliver Dowden led to a Covid travel exemption so that Mission: Impossible 7 could resume production. Not long afterwards, when the rest of the world was sheltering in place, he was filming in Norway, driving a motorbike off the side of a mountain before gliding back to Earth on a parachute. Cruise has always been aggressively keen on reaching the upper levels of his capability, but this year it seems as if he’s forcing things to happen through nothing but sheer power of will. The cake thing leaves no doubt. Sending hundreds of cakes to people during a festive season so miserable that many of us have barely been able to get it together enough to write anyone a card is nothing short of miraculous. It’s as if Tom Cruise has decided that Christmas will happen and now, purely because of that, it’s happening. Yes, it’s true that he isn’t saving the world. But isn’t he sending a message to us all? If we can all go the extra mile and remember other people, and use our near-infinite wealth to direct a team of underlings to purchase, wrap and send a cake to the woman from Interview With a Vampire, then the world would undoubtedly be a better place. Was this entire piece a ploy to get Tom Cruise to send me a cake? Yes it was. Am I ashamed of that? Yes."
"As for everyone and everything else, this has been a traumatising year for cinema. Many new movies have had to be viewed at home, on streaming services, and cinephiles have had to accept this arrangement, rather like gourmets who see their favourite restaurants survive by repurposing themselves as delivery and takeaway centres. And streaming has, arguably, given a new audience to independent and arthouse cinema that might not otherwise have much of a showing in theatres. Lockdown has intensified the debate about the validity of the small-screen experience of cinema – and it’s especially intense for me, when I consider one of my favourite films of the year. Steve McQueen’s Lovers Rock is one of the glorious works in McQueen’s superb five-movie Small Axe sequence about the Black British experience. It is gloriously cinematic and was slated to feature at this year’s (cancelled) Cannes film festival. But it was commissioned by the BBC, and so the vast majority of the people enjoying this wonderful film will be doing so on the small screen. That’s why it is being described, understandably, as one the television highlights of the year. Well, it can be both, and so I am listing it in the Braddies, my personal choices that exist separately from Guardian film’s best-of-the-year countdown. As ever, there are 10 nominees in 10 categories: film, director, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, documentary, cinematography, screenplay, directorial debut. There is also the single-entry nomination in the special category: quirkiest future cult classic most likely to be overlooked by the boomer mainstream media establishment. The nominees are listed in no particular order and readers are invited to vote below the line for their preferred winner and talk about omissions.

"In a year when many of us obsessed over anti-escapist films about disasters engulfing the world while also being presented with a junkier than usual lineup of wannabe blockbusters (both the obvious result of the dreaded C-word), there’s something fitting about us closing the year out with Greenland, a chaotic comet thriller presenting the apocalypse up on a chipped platter, the cut-rate combo that 2020 deserves. Originally set to star Chris Evans with District 9’s Neill Blomkamp at the helm, instead we have Ric Roman Waugh reuniting with his Angel Has Fallen star Gerard Butler, a lower-wattage prospect compounded by the film’s prime theatrical release in June swapping out for an on-demand launch before Christmas. Butler, who last faced natural disasters in 2017’s dreadful Geostorm, plays John, a structural engineer trying to patch things up with his estranged wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and son Nathan. But in pleasingly quick and frantic fashion, their lives are upturned by an incoming comet, one that was originally predicted to bypass Earth but is now set to cause mass destruction. John gets a call to tell him he’s been pre-selected along with his family for shelter which sets them on a path to safety although it’s one that’s far from smooth … Working with a budget far lower than that for a film of its ilk (just $35m compared to Geostorm’s $120m or even the far less action-centric Contagion’s $60m), Greenland is sold on grand spectacle yet contains not that much of it. I’d argue that it’s just about enough for viewers not to feel short-changed (it’s no Reign of Fire in that regard) but it’s a film where the biggest moments are told in fleeting montage, something that works both for and against it. The tight focus on a family’s struggle to stay alive rather than the experts figuring out what to do behind the scenes is refreshing (Butler’s everyman can only do so much to help) and there’s a horribly well-orchestrated anxiety to some of the earlier, surprisingly believable scenes. The specifics of selection and how this process would then operate during a disaster (starting with the newly adopted presidential alert which leads to a QR code) feels just about convincing enough and there’s a clamminess to watching the characters desperately try to figure it all out. The script, from Buried writer Chris Sparling, is also infused with a rather pessimistic view of humanity, characters showcasing terrible behaviour that’s easily identifiable after the year we have all had. But the family’s lack of identifiable characteristics (dad = man, mum = woman, son = diabetic) means we get tired of them all too fast. The indulgent two-hour runtime also means that their journey starts to plod as well as lose even the slightest amount of credibility by the time we reach the film’s absurd finale. The clue to where it’s all headed is, er, in the title and despite the film’s enjoyably extreme ramping up of global mayhem, it all crescendoes in a classic “have your cake and eat it” disaster movie ending. It’s an adequate, involving enough afternoon watch (faint praise: better than Geostorm) and for those with a certain destructive itch that still needs scratching, this should do the job."
"Director Spike Lee and musician David Byrne have created a crowd-pleaser with this spry concert film of Byrne’s 2018 tour turned Broadway performance. Nearly half the setlist comprises hits made famous by Talking Heads – and who wouldn’t find their spirits buoyed by footage of Byrne and co careening through the crowd during a sweaty and exuberant performance of Road to Nowhere, GoPro cameras trailing them? Byrne and his band, who wear their instruments strapped to their bodies, dance barefoot in starched, steel-grey suits across a stage designed to look like a chainmail cube. This is a Spike Lee Joint and so Lee shoots Byrne from above so the viewer can better appreciate the clarity of the staging, from the wings to give a sense of the choreography and among the performers to capture their energy. There aren’t any isolated moments as cinematic as Byrne’s tender lamp dance in Jonathan Demme’s 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, but the director’s playfulness is felt. The show is interspersed with Byrne’s earnest reflections on low voter turnout and Black Lives Matter. It’s ambiguous whether Lee’s presence is supposed to legitimise or complicate any white guilt Byrne might feel. “We all need to change. I also need to change,” he says, introducing his cover of Janelle Monáe’s 2015 protest song Hell You Talmbout. Still, it’s a moving and reverent scene, with Lee inserting images of black Americans who have died at the hands of the police."
"In his visor-and-face-mask combo, Daveed Diggs resembles a cross between a welder and a highwayman. He peers into his webcam as he walks, offers a “Yo!”, and finds a quiet corner of a Los Angeles studio to sit down, then whips off his headgear to reveal spidery braids and a black beard. An East Bay T-shirt serves as a reminder that the 38-year-old hails from Oakland, the Bay Area city that provided the backdrop, and the dazed deadpan sensibility, for Blindspotting. That extraordinary film, released in 2018, which Diggs co-wrote and starred in, twisted straight-arrow subjects (racist police violence, unconscious bias, gentrification) into comic vignettes without any loss of gravitas. He is speaking today from the set of the TV spin-off series. “It’s the same idea as the film,” he says. “It’s a comedy in a world that won’t let it be one.” Praising Blindspotting in these pages two years ago, Mike McCahill described it as “2018: The Movie”, but there seems regrettably little chance that the series will look dated by the time it reaches our screens. “The topic of the different policing of poor and brown people is not new to the current resurgence of Black Lives Matter,” Diggs says. “That’s the world we live in. It’s as consistent as it has always been.” Audiences have had no shortage of Diggs this year. At the start of the pandemic, Disney+ streamed a 2016 recording of the Broadway musical Hamilton, originally intended to be released in cinemas next year, which features the actor’s swaggering, Tony-winning dual performance as Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette. Diggs is also the star of Snowpiercer, the Netflix series based on Bong Joon-ho’s post-apocalyptic train-bound thriller (a second season is in the can, with a third shooting next year). He recently played a comically carnal Frederick Douglass in the irreverent abolitionist drama The Good Lord Bird, and next year he will be Sebastian the Crab in the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. “I enjoy so much,” he says when I mention this eclecticism. “There’s really not a lot that I hate doing. My taste in everything is always the thing I haven’t tried before.” This month, he pops up in Soul, Pixar’s animated fantasy about a music teacher scrambling to get back to Earth from the afterlife. Diggs’s vocal imprint is minor – he has one scene as a barbershop know-it-all – but his main contribution was as part of a group of “cultural consultants”, also including the musicians Quincy Jones and Questlove. “It’s Pixar’s first film with a black protagonist,” he says, “so they wanted feedback on cultural relevancy from a ton of black folks. They’d show us character designs and ask: ‘Does this feel like a person you know?’ or ‘Are you offended by this in any way?’ One person said, ‘In the background voices, I didn’t hear anyone who wasn’t speaking English, and that’s not my experience of New York.’ I thought that was such a brilliant note! It hadn’t occurred to me. It’s buried in the mix – but somebody picked up on it.” He also sat in on feedback sessions, where material was mercilessly torn apart. “I don’t think I could write for Pixar,” he laughs. “They’ll hack away at a thing if it’s not working. It’s brutal. Nobody is concerned with anyone’s feelings, they just want to make a great film. I was a newcomer, so to me it sounded like they were killing babies all over the place.” The actor and writer Rashida Jones – Quincy’s daughter, who co-wrote Toy Story 4 – has called Pixar a place where “women and people of colour do not have an equal creative voice”. Diggs believes the studio is trying to remedy that. “It’s part of an industry-wide self-examination. Everybody means well, but there’s so much unconscious bias happening. If you don’t have representation in the upper ranks – if there’s no producer of colour at the top, and no upper-level writers of colour – then it doesn’t matter what’s happening in your writers’ room. When younger writers of colour present interesting ideas, those always get cut because there’s no one at the end of the line who understands the cultural relevance and specificity of those details. No one’s actually saying: ‘We don’t care if black folks or queer people manage to see themselves in this.’ But that’s the result. You don’t know what you don’t know.” It is a lesson he has taken with him into the Blindspotting series. “Our writers’ room was almost entirely women because we are writing for a female protagonist, and we were aware we would miss certain things because of our own blind spots. We also work with as many female directors as we can to check us on those things all the time.” Diggs is an eloquent speaker – check out his 20-minute commencement address at Brown, his alma mater, for definitive proof – with a gift for juggling light and dark subjects. This month, for instance, his avant garde rap trio, Clipping, released a bouncy tween-pop single, Puppy for Hanukkah, and a sinister, horror-soaked new album, Visions of Bodies Being Burned. Typical tracks include Pain Everyday, where the descendants of white racists are haunted by the ghosts of lynching victims, and Body on a Pile, which surveys the carnage following the slaughter of several cops. Among their previous songs is The Deep, which imagines the babies of drowned pregnant slaves building an underwater world. Why is horror – from Get Out and The People Under the Stairs to this year’s Lovecraft Country and His House – so adept at conveying black experience and black history? “The great thing about horror as a genre is that the times generally identify what the monster is,” he says. “When you look at Jordan Peele’s work, or any of the stuff enjoying popularity right now, it allows black creators to shine a spotlight on the things that have always been monstrous, and then to make physical monsters out of them. They become visually frightening so everybody gets to be scared of them.” Absent from the new album is the single Chapter 319, released on Juneteenth this year as a response to the murder of George Floyd. Diggs, a famously dexterous rapper, puts it as bluntly as possible on the track: “Donald Trump is a white supremacist, full stop/ If you vote for him again, you’re a white supremacist, full stop.” The song was written in a day, he tells me, “to be played at protests”; it also breaks one of the band’s self-imposed rules by having Diggs rapping in the first person. “Most rap is rigorously first person, but we always wanted to be able to talk about things without having people assume we were living them.” Much of Clipping’s music, like Pixar’s films, has a timelessness that will allow it to be understood easily in decades to come, whereas Chapter 319 may need footnotes for listeners in 2040. “That’d be great if it did,” Diggs says, smiling sadly. “It’d be really nice if we didn’t all immediately understand what that song was about.” I was planning to end by asking about his hopes for America in the coming years. But I think he just answered that.  Soul is streaming on Disney+ from 25 December. "
"Over the years, animation studio Pixar have patented and perfected a particular type of film: bittersweet life lessons of intense depth and emotion, wrapped up in super-slick, cutie-pie visuals. In among the more obviously kid-oriented Toy Stories and Cars, this strand of Pixar’s output has originated a string of sensational classics: Wall-E, Up, Inside Out. Well, Soul sees Pixar hitting another one out the park – and it’s perhaps unsurprising that it has Up and Inside Out director Pete Docter’s name at the top, as director and co-writer. (Another of the writers, One Night in Miami’s Kemp Powers, gets a co-director credit.) In broad terms, Soul appears to be a hybrid of Inside Out, with its literal rendering of internal psychological constructs, and Coco, the more traditional-looking afterlife yarn. What Pixar have come up with is a hypermodern spirit-world fable that also looks back to classical anchoring values with a touch of hippy-era mysticism: music, art, self-expression, rites of passage. In one way, the title is a little deceptive: jazz, not soul, is the musical motif of choice here. (Perhaps, like the original Toy Story and its wooden cowboy, there’s a retrograde yearning for the validation of generations older than the actual target audience?) Jamie Foxx is middle-aged music teacher Joe who falls down a manhole shortly after securing his life’s ambition of an actual live gig with a lounge-bar jazz combo, and is transported to a minutely detailed afterlife that bears more than a passing resemblance to A Matter of Life and Death – the Powell and Pressburger film where David Niven, like Foxx, passes over but is desperate to get back to the real world. Soul’s spirit world has immaculately designed conceptual architecture: a Great Beyond (plus conveyor belt) for dead people’s souls; a Great Before, with seminars and mentors for its nursery of unformed consciousnesses; and interesting subworlds, such as “the zone” for ecstatic fulfillment (“in the zone”) and a desert of “lost” souls. On hand are soul “counters” and “counsellors” that look like Picasso line drawings. Amusingly, though, all this is an elaborate preamble to Soul’s rich earthbound comedy: what is essentially a three-way body swap in which Joe’s soul ends up inside a cat, and the spirit of an as-yet-unborn being (played by Tina Fey) called simply 22 inhabits Joe’s body. In the end, though, all Pixar films are about growing up, and Soul examines this on multiple levels: from Joe’s reluctance to cut the apron strings to 22’s reluctance to be born. As cinema-going is decimated by Covid, Soul has been bumped early – and some might say cynically – on to Disney’s streaming service, instead of the big screen. It’s a shame: the film’s glowing designs deserve to be seen on the most large-scale format possible. But Soul is certainly a film that can rise to any occasion, even a cruddy laptop browser. It’s just a joy from beginning to end."
"Jeremy Bulloch, who has died aged 75, was a busy character actor who staked a claim for cinematic immortality by playing the inscrutable Boba Fett in the Star Wars films. A masked, enigmatic bounty hunter with a jet pack and distinctive costume design, Boba Fett debuted in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), capturing and carbon-freezing Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in order to convey him to the slug-like paymaster Jabba the Hutt. Despite relatively limited screen time and dialogue (his few lines were post-dubbed by the American actor Jason Wingreen), both Bulloch and Boba Fett became much loved contributors to the franchise and he reprised the role in Return of the Jedi (1983). In the eventual Star Wars prequels Boba Fett was played by the child actor Daniel Logan, and so Bulloch was instead hired to play the spaceship pilot Captain Colton in the third of them, Revenge of the Sith (2005). Unlike his onscreen villain, Bulloch was genial, good humoured and modest, playing down his contribution to the success of Boba Fett. He insisted he only got the part because he was a good fit for the costume, having been brought in by his half-brother, the producer Robert Watts, but his precise body language and smouldering presence were, in fact, integral to the character’s appeal. Bulloch was born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. His mother, Aziz (known as Diana, nee Meade), already had three sons from a previous marriage when she married the aeronautical engineer (and later mushroom grower) McGregor Bulloch in 1944. Jeremy was the middle of three children from this second union. The family moved around and so his education was peripatetic: St Leonard’s school in Blandford Forum, Dorset, a private tutor in Wincanton, Somerset, then Dorset House in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Having failed his 11-plus exams Jeremy – and most of his siblings – enrolled at the Corona theatre school in London and was soon working, making his professional debut in a breakfast cereal commercial. He started appearing in films, as an extra in A Night to Remember (1958) and Carry on Teacher (1959), before playing more substantial roles on television, in the series Counter-Attack! (1960), The Chequered Flag (1960) and Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (1960-61). He made his theatrical debut in 1962 at the Pembroke theatre, Croydon, and hit the West End in 1964 in I Love You, Mrs Patterson (St Martin’s theatre, directed by Frith Banbury). His big screen break came in 1962 when he was cast in the film Summer Holiday as Edwin, one of four mechanics, led by Cliff Richard, who persuade London transport to lend them an old bus which they renovate and take on a road trip, provoking both mayhem and music. With a cheerful, open face and a light, melodic voice, he was perfect for juvenile leads and had a short run in Compact (1965), an early BBC initiative to create a rival soap opera to Coronation Street, and was then one of the originating stars of the next attempt, The Newcomers (1965). His three-year stint included the much publicised wedding of his character, Philip Cooper, for the show’s 200th episode (designed to steal the thunder of the rival soap’s imminent nuptials of Elsie Tanner). A solid career as a character actor in both drama and comedy followed, with appearances in most popular shows of the time – Doctor Who (1965 and 1973), Dr Finlay’s Casebook (1970), Crown Court (1972), Man About the House (1974), The Professionals (1978) and Richard II (BBC Shakespeare, 1978). He then became a regular in the thoughtful sitcom Agony (1979-81), playing one of the groundbreakingly non-stereotypical gay couple living next door to the advice columnist Jane Lucas (Maureen Lipman). His later TV work included Chocky (1984), Chocky’s Children (1985), Robin of Sherwood (1984-86, as the decent and stoical village headman Edward of Wickham), Faith (1994), Sloggers (1994-95), Spooks (2002), Doctors (2006-08) and Law & Order: UK (2009). Bulloch appeared in three James Bond films: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Octopussy (1983), in the last two playing the gadget man Q’s assistant Smithers. He wrote an autobiography, Flying Solo (2005), contributed to Elstree 1976 (2015), a documentary about Star Wars actors, and was a popular guest at conventions around the world, endearing himself to fans due to his self-deprecation and unstarry conduct. He withdrew from public appearances in 2018 due to the effects of Parkinson’s disease. He met Maureen Walker, a model, on holiday in 1967 and they married three years later. She survives him, as do their sons, Jamie and Robbie, another son, Christian, from his brief 1965 marriage to Sandra Ford, which ended in divorce, and 10 grandchildren."
"With the taste of Christmas lunch and festive beverages still lingering on our palettes, it’s time to embrace the possibilities of the new year and wash away memories of that rotten old 2020. In that spirit, here are 10 Australian films to look forward to that are slated for release in 2021. Many more productions are in the works, of course, so this list is not exhaustive; think of it as a taste of what’s to come. Dir. Anthony Hayes Actor Anthony Hayes struck gold in the casting of his second feature film as director – which is called, in fact, Gold – with Hollywood heartthrob Zac Efron starring in this thriller about two men who discover the world’s biggest gold nugget. Efron may be in the “I should be taken artistically serious” stage of his career, with a recent portrayal of Ted Bundy in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, and appearances in The Disaster Artist and The Beach Bum. Let’s not talk about that upcoming Three Men and a Baby remake. Dir. Daina Reid Elisabeth Moss delivered a gooseflesh-raising performance as a victim of domestic violence in The Invisible Man and will star in another Australian thriller, Run Rabbit Run, re-teaming with The Handmaid’s Tale director Daina Reid (whose oeuvre includes the excellent basketball-themed series Sunshine). Moss plays a fertility doctor whose life spirals into turmoil due to the increasingly strange behaviour of her young daughter. Dir. Stephen Maxwell Johnson Some excellent Australian or “meat pie” westerns have landed in recent years, among them Sweet Country, The Nightingale and this year’s The Furnace. So the bar has been set high for director Stephen Maxwell Johnson’s film about a pair of men tracking down a dangerous Aboriginal warrior in the outback circa the 1930s. The buzz around High Ground is very positive, with Variety calling the film “handsomely mounted and absorbing” and Guardian Australia’s Debbie Zhou describing it as “a rip-roaring western against the starkly remote Northern Territory outback”, following its Berlin film festival premiere.. In cinemas 28 January Dir. Baz Luhrmann Baz Luhrmann’s currently untitled Elvis Presley biopic (a US/Australia co-production) has been given a tentative release of November 2021, but given the film comes from the extravagant Australian auteur, it may well be delayed as he awaits the world’s supply of glitter to be shipped to the set. It will be lavish, that much is certain, though little else is known about it beyond casting details – with Austin Butler, a Nickelodeon and Disney Channel alumni, playing The King. What will it be called: Love Me Tender? All Shook Up? Given Luhrmann’s play-to-the-back rows style, maybe just Elvis. Dir. Jane Campion Jane Campion’s erotic period drama The Piano was such a good film Australia kinda sorta pretty much claimed it as our own, bestowing it with a tonne of gongs (11 in total) at the 1993 AFI awards. Maybe we’ll do the same with Campion’s next film, The Power of the Dog, a New Zealand/Australia co-production. The great director adapts author Thomas Savage’s novel, which the Guardian reviewer Peter Beech called a “rich and challenging psychodrama” about two ranch-owning brothers. Dir. Larissa Behrendt After the Apology and Maralinga Tjarutja director Larissa Behrendt’s upcoming documentary explores, in the words of Screen Australia’s synopsis, “how a group of NRL greats came together to invent a new pre-game ceremony in response to the Maori Haka” – in an effort to confront racism and celebrate Aboriginal culture. It will premiere on NITV, which continues to build a repertoire of important and highly engaging non-fiction productions – highlights in recent times including the You Are Here series, Warwick Thornton’s eye-watering The Beach and the Fred Glynn portrait She Who Must Be Loved. Dir. Justin Kurzel News of an upcoming Port Arthur massacre movie was always going to generate controversy, reigniting debate about where the line is on narratives about real-life atrocities. In my opinion, we must listen to and respect the opinions of survivors while acknowledging that many great films have been made about terrible things. Voices condemning the film sight unseen add little if anything to the conversation. Nitram will be directed by Justin Kurzel, a tremendous Australian film-maker whose work includes Snowtown and True History of the Kelly Gang. That admittedly means little in this context, because even great directors can produce duds from time to time. The jury is out until the arrival of the film itself. Dir. Sally Ingleton I got tingles towards the end of the invigorating trailer for Sally Ingleton’s documentary about eco warriors – young, old and everywhere in between – fighting for the future on the frontline of environmental activism. Despite the spin and bluster from Scott Morrison’s government, it is clear to all and sundry that on the issue of climate action Australia is one of the bad guys, in the same category as Russia and Saudi Arabia. Instead of waiting for history to condemn us, these protesters are putting their arses on the line to say: no way; enough is enough. In cinemas 4 February Dir. Glendyn Ivin Naomi Watts leads this adaptation of a non-fiction book about a woman (Watts) who suffers a terrible fall that leaves her mostly paralysed, but whose spirits are lifted by an injured magpie her family names Penguin. The film will be helmed by Glendyn Ivin (who recently directed the excellent series The Cry and Safe Harbour), joining a pantheon of recent homegrown movies about the inspiring influence of animals – from dogs (Oddball, Koko: A Red Dog Story) to birds of prey (Healing) and a pelican (Storm Boy). In cinemas 21 January Dir. Thomas M Wright It’s no surprise that Joel Edgerton signed on to star in this South Australia-shot thriller, given it’s the sophomore feature of director Thomas M Wright, who previously made the enthralling Adam Cullen biopic Acute Misfortune. The Unknown Man is about an undercover cop’s attempts to convict a man for an unsolved murder. The Screen Australia website likens it to Animal Kingdom and Insomnia."
"Nothing warms the anti-yuletide misanthropes’ shrivelled hearts like a good old-fashioned Christmas-themed horror film wherein the evil inside human souls gets unleashed on happy-clappy hedonists. This Georgia-set spooky adventure story, although flawed, indulges that curmudgeonly instinct with a tale of a privileged white North American couple, Mia (Ivanna Sakhno) and Max (Alex Hafner), who arrive at a mountain resort where they plan to spend Christmas snowboarding and making lame jokes about the Overlook hotel from The Shining. This will prove prophetic. Director Stanislav Kapralov, making his directorial debut with a script he co-wrote with Omri Rose, affords just a little bit of sympathy towards recently orphaned Mia, who desperately wants to start a family. Max, on the other hand, comes across as much less likable, mostly because he insists on using the word “epic” as a superlative despite being above the age of 13. And partly because he insists, no matter how much the locals try to warn him off, that he wants to snowboard on the Black Ridge, which may be haunted by the spirit of a child killed by entitled snowboarders years earlier. In all honesty, the path towards the film’s final feeble twist is as discernible as a neon pink jacket on the ski slopes. But Let It Snow is well put together, from the spectacular location work to the strong use of sound to the sort of arresting imagery that recalls the haute body horror of Midsommar. Sakhno doesn’t quite match Florence Pugh’s performance in that film – but she does impress with a willingness to get cold and traumatised, and she screams with despair like a real pro."
"One of the most surprising new avenues to have formed for celebrities over the course of the pandemic has been Cameo. For the uninitiated, Cameo is a service where celebrities can create personalised messages for their fans. For £75, Hodor from Game of Thrones will wish you a happy birthday or – if you have £750 lying around – Richard Dreyfuss will put on a Jaws shirt and struggle to pronounce your name. But maybe this isn’t enough for you. Maybe you want to find direct engagement, with a much bigger star than Cameo offers, and for free. If that’s the case, I can heartily endorse not liking a Russell Crowe movie. Because, even if it takes him a while, Crowe will do his best to respond to your criticism. And if you’re really lucky, he’ll sound like an out-of-touch bus stop crackpot in the process. Here’s what happened. On 9 January, Ian McNabb, frontman of The Icicle Works, wrote the following about the 2003 film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World: “Lots of folk complaining about lack of sleep during the Pandemic. May I recommend Master And Commander starring the usually captivating, attention-grabbing Russell Crowe. I’ve never made it past the ten minute mark. You’re welcome. And thanks Russell.” The tweet began to pick up steam and, just nine days later, found its way to Crowe himself. Now, Russell Crowe is a very famous man who has almost three million followers. However, despite this he was unable to let the criticism sit. Instead, he narkily replied: “That’s the problem with kids these days. No focus. Peter Weirs film is brilliant. An exacting, detail oriented, epic tale of fidelity to Empire & service, regardless of the cost. Incredible cinematography by Russell Boyd & a majestic soundtrack. Definitely an adults movie.” As it happens, both parties are wrong here. Master and Commander was a perfectly adequate film, although I’d be surprised if anyone thought about it in any meaningful way from the moment the credits ended, but the important thing is that Crowe reacted. Again, not much new there. He reacted to Bafta editing a poem out of an acceptance speech by pinning a television executive to a wall and calling him a “motherfucker”. He reacted to poor hotel telephone coverage by throwing the telephone at a clerk’s face. This time it is different, because he did it on Twitter via the means of a “kids these days” rant. And this is brilliant. This is confirmation that Crowe is willing to share his generalised biases with the world, and all you have to do is have an opinion on one of his films. Perhaps you could write that Cinderella Man felt like such a deliberate piece of Oscar bait that it failed to be emotionally captivating, or that A Good Year felt shallow and redundant compared with its previous television adaptation, or that the promotional campaign for Unhinged was more entertaining than the film itself. Either way, there’s now a good chance that Crowe will respond by saying, “In my day children were taught to be seen but not heard”, or “We never used to wash our hands after going to the toilet when I was growing up, and it never did me any harm,” or “Is it just me or are Wagon Wheels getting smaller?” This could have huge repercussions. After all, Crowe is so influential that dozens of stars might start joining in. It’s the Twitter equivalent of the Law of Attraction. Tell the universe that you didn’t entirely love a film made 18 years ago, and the universe will tell the star to inform you that you are incorrect. Perhaps rolling your eyes at Bruce Almighty will bring Jim Carrey to your door. Perhaps frowning at Hulk will make Eric Bana say hello to you. Perhaps, if you’re really mean about Maid in Manhattan, Ralph Fiennes will create a Twitter account specifically to call you a prick. And anyway, Crowe is right. Kids these days are to blame for everything. Kids have got no attention spans. Kids only like superhero movies. Kids can’t sit through a ponderously slow film about boats because they’d rather be watching an unboxing video on YouTube. Kids won’t watch a film that doesn’t have any sequels, even if it has been deliberately titled to make it look like the first part of a new and exciting maritime franchise. Kids eat candy. Kids make too much noise. Kids are responsible for everything bad in the world. Ian McNabb is 60 years old."
"Film and TV crew are no longer exempt from coronavirus restrictions related to job travel, it has emerged. The UK government’s list of jobs that qualify for travel exemptions has been updated to remove “television production” and “high end television production and film”, which means that executives and crew arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 10 days. The move is a reversal of the widely publicised policy that saw film-makers and crew allowed into the UK in July without quarantine as part of a government drive to get film production in the UK back up and running. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden had made the announcement after apparently consulting with Tom Cruise, whose Mission Impossible films were among the Hollywood productions to restart shooting in the UK in September. Other productions likely to be affected include The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, which had been halted for two weeks in September after Pattinson tested positive for coronavirus. The only media-related job on the government’s list still exempt from travel restrictions appears to be workers on the BBC’s broadcasting transmission network and services."
"Since the dawn of the 20th century and the mainstreaming of existential thought, every generation has fretted that they’re at the end of history, bearing witness to the hysterical collapse of social and political order. From the age of postwar nuclear anxiety to the sweet summers of the counterculture to the turn of the millennium, some faction always fears that they will be forced to let go of the world they understand to make way for a frightening, confusing new one. I would contend that the current generation of humans alive on Earth – having dealt over the past year with a global pandemic, incompetently attempted fascist takeovers, the fracturing and splintering of the world economy, and in some regions, the sky bursting into flame – has a more legitimate claim to that feeling than any that’s come before. If the year’s final days and their promise of a vaccine rollout introduce an aftertaste of hope, the prevailing note of 2020 has been a sour apocalyptic tang. The despair, tedium, frustration and surreal delirium that defined the past 12 months have all been amply articulated in writing over the past year; today, we look to the future. Even with real life having taken on the destructive maximalism of a Roland Emmerich movie, we may still turn to films set in the year 2021 for perspectives on what previous generations imagined may await us. And from those visions, whether dystopian or utopian, perhaps we can begin to brace ourselves for a year that can’t possibly be worse than this one. Read on for a survey of cinematic soothsaying about the possible dangers waiting in the days to come: Simon Amstell’s BBC mockumentary lays out an entire chronology stretching from the second world war to 2067, an ambitious account that details how the UK of tomorrow will come to forsake meat and adopt an all-vegan lifestyle. The year 2021 figures prominently into this timeline, as the point at which a super swine flu descends on Britain to claim a sweeping body count. Livestock numbers plummet, pork prices skyrocket, and the populace enters an “era of confusion” about what they’re allowed to eat. At a time when the Daily Mail expects everyone to forgo pizza and chow down on toast instead, as a gesture of nationalist solidarity, food scarcity stands out as an especially troubling symptom of geopolitical unrest and viral unpreparedness. Things turn out alright in Amstell’s projections, as Britons embrace veganism and learn to live harmoniously with the animals (who have been imbued with the power of speech, in the soothing tones of Joanna Lumley). For many, however, life without the prospect of a drippy, melty cheeseburger still represents a fate worse than death. In 1995, cult oddball Robert Longo predicted that the internet would grow too large and immersive for humanity’s own good, eventually becoming so central to our daily doings that it would start to eat away at our psychology. He also envisioned the consolidation of corporate influence into a handful of mega-conglomerates, with power centralized around Asian markets. The one thing this cyberpunk seer got wrong was that we’d all look great while the world went to hell, outfitting Keanu Reeves’ human flash drive and the pharmaceutical mercenaries chasing him with immaculate, slimming suits. Aesthetics aside – virtual styles would leave the clunky, primitive CGI of Longo’s e-dimension behind – his notion of an all-consuming online existence displacing our own real-life experiences was right on the money. As younger generations contend with the blurring of the lines between their authentic selves and their outward-facing alter egos on social media, Johnny’s neural implants scrambling his consciousness start to seem redundant. A few years on Twitter can melon-ball holes in your brain just as easily. The august Hammer Film Productions reigned supreme during the 50s with their vividly gory revivals of such classic ghouls as Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster, and the Mummy. But the following decade saw their relevance starting to wane, and left producers scrambling to figure out what the next big thing might be. The studio tried to pivot into sci-fi and met with little success, their 1969 lunar adventure cast aside by audiences and critics alike as laughable without quite being funny. Never mind the peanut gallery over at Mystery Science Theater 3000, though; there’s some substantial truth to director Roy Ward Baker’s treatment of space exploration as a gold rush sending capitalist competitors scrambling to plant their flag. Rumors of a gigantic asteroid made of pure sapphire pit an arrogant millionaire against a daring astronaut in a race to claim it, a conflict not such a far cry from the ongoing scrum between Virgin Galactic, Northrop Grumman, and the half-dozen other business interests keen on commercializing the galaxy. Baker had the foresight to realize that incineration by extraterrestrials wouldn’t be the primary hazard when venturing into other worlds – just the rich megalomaniacs back home on Earth. Japanese animation great Makoto Shinkai didn’t look too far ahead for this fantastical environmentalism parable, which jumped forward only two years from its release in 2019. He suggests that the future is now, and that the issues raised by his script’s subtext already matter to the present moment – namely, the well-founded concern over global warming, rising water levels, and inevitable planetary drowning. Tokyo teen Hodaka can’t believe his eyes when he meets the ethereal Hina, a “sunshine girl” capable of controlling the weather at the cost of her own body’s integrity. She’s a finite natural resource, used up over the course of the film until she has no choice but to drift into the sky just to keep the rains at bay. Shinkai’s unexpected conclusion, in which Hina returns to Earth and allows the sea to swallow up much of Japan, makes the bracing proposal that maybe we’re better off that way. We’ve lived too recklessly for too long, and if our species is going to get what it deserves, all we can do is accept our self-made destiny and try to find some inner peace. A land ravaged, ragtag bands of survivors, insectoid invaders, you know the drill. What sets this Philippine production apart from its genre’s many similar entries is its artistic medium of garbage, the production design guided by the in-universe plot point that manufacturing has ceased due to lack of materials and the human race has turned scavenger. Using whatever trash they can get their hands on, the rebellion must mount a jerry-rigged offensive against the “locusts” and the mutated homo sapiens in cahoots with them, while preserving the classified location of the recyclable sanctuary known as Paraiso. Their fight for freedom starts with everyone knee-deep in a problem many are still in denial about today, as expanding plastic landmasses float ominously out in the middle of the Pacific. Reality is confronting us with hard physical limits all over the place – cloud servers for data storage, the non-viability of fossil fuels – and we’ll soon have to learn how to make do with what we’ve got. Otherwise, it’s only a matter of time until we’re all subsisting on gelatin made from ground-up cockroaches, though that one comes from Snowpiercer. All of these films picture grim outcomes, but Lorene Scafaria’s feature debut is the only one that finds an optimistic way to see all the devastation. Her off-kilter comedy begins with the news that we’ve all got three weeks before a massive flaming rock obliterates our fragile blue-green marble and extinguishes all life on it. For the suicidal, middle-aged Dodge Petersen (Steve Carell), the certainty of annihilation actually jolts him out of his benumbed stupor and teaches him to appreciate the time he’s got left, which he mostly spends with the enchanting Penny Lockhart (Keira Knightley) on an end-of-days road trip. They find solace in one another, an object lesson in how to maintain sanity during an emergency that has everyone else running around like Chicken Little. Whether our oblivion comes through man-made or organic means, we’ll only have one another for light in those dark days. Some may choose to fight back, but some may concede to the whichever great cataclysm befalls us, and they might just have the right idea. Would you rather live for 50 years in austere, dangerous conditions, or spend a brief but glorious time free of regret and consequences?"
"The film director Jasmila Žbanić does not regard herself as a catastrophist. “I’m an optimistic person,” she says, smiling hard. But, like any Bosnian her age, there’s no avoiding the fact that she was formed by the war that broke out in her country in 1992: “I was 17 when it started, and we didn’t understand at first that this was war. We were convinced that Yugoslavia, and especially Bosnia, would never go to war, because it was so mixed. I have Serbian family, I have Croatian family. We were naive. We couldn’t imagine it. We said this will pass. A month or two. There are some stupid people with guns, but they’ll be gone soon. When that didn’t happen, it was a shock, and what it taught us is that everything can turn upside down from one day to another. Life is fragile. The whole system is fragile. This is a feeling that I carry through life. I don’t take anything for granted, especially not institutions.” Žbanić’s gut-wrenching new film, Quo Vadis, Aida?, deals with one of the war’s most heinous atrocities: the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, during which Bosnian Serb forces under the command of Ratko Mladić executed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys – a genocide the United Nations forces deployed to protect the inhabitants of the supposedly “safe area” of Srebrenica did almost nothing to prevent. By the time of Srebrenica, Žbanić had been living under siege in Sarajevo for almost three years; she might have been preoccupied only with her own problems. But what she heard in the weeks and months that followed stayed with her. “Here was another shock,” she says. “This was a UN-protected area. We felt that if the aggression could not be stopped by the UN, then there were no human rights we could believe in – and from that moment, I was obsessed. I wanted to know everything about it. It was a trauma for all Bosnians. When we learned how many people had died, and how they had died, and how they were buried. When we learned that the graves had been moved [in an effort to cover up the massacre].” Ten years ago, she began to think someone should make a film about it: “But I was really hoping it wouldn’t be me. It’s such a hot political subject, even now. There is still huge denial from Serbian politicians that it even happened. Enter this territory, and everyone is against you, because it’s still so present. People continue to live with it. They have their own pain, and their own ideas of what such a film should look like.” What persuaded her in the end? Perhaps it was that she knew now that she could do it. Her 2006 film Grbavica, about the postwar life of a Bosnian woman who was raped by a Serbian soldier, had won a Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival. But she was pulled along, too, by her deep conviction that film has the power to change minds. “This past of ours,” she says, vehemently (she’s talking to me via Zoom from her cottage in the south of Bosnia). “The tendency is to deny, or to hide, or to make false facts. But in order to move on, we have to see it.” Quo Vadis, Aida? follows a UN translator – a character loosely inspired by Hasan Nuhanović, who published a book about his own experiences – inside the base at Srebrenica, minute by minute, hour by hour, as she fights to save her sons and husband from Mladić’s men. The Dutch soldiers for whom she’s working tell her that no exceptions can be made; that her family, too, must go with the Serbians on their buses; that they have received guarantees all those taken will be safe. But she knows their words are empty, even as it falls to her to relay similar promises through a loudhailer to the thousands of hungry and terrified civilians – many of them her friends and neighbours – who have sought protection at the base. For many different reasons, the film is a remarkable achievement; Žbanić deals so deftly with such freighted material (she also wrote the screenplay). Chief among them, however, is the astonishing performance of Jasna Đuričić, who plays the translator, Aida Selmanagic – one for which she deserves to win all the prizes. “Making the film was a responsibility for all of us,” says Žbanić. “But for Jasna, and for Boris [Isaković, who plays Mladić], there were huge issues. The [hostile] response from some to my film Grbavica meant that they knew what they could expect when it came out – and they’re both Serbians. It was brave and progressive of them to take on these roles. For Jasna, it was hard, hard work: she met some of the mothers [of the dead], and her responsibility was to them. For Boris, there was the issue that, in Serbia, Mladić is still considered a hero, even after his conviction as a war criminal. How to play him? How to capture his essence, this man who has the power over people’s lives, who is like a god?” What has been the response to the film in Bosnia? This is complicated. Bosnia, even now, is divided into the two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Republika Srpska. Žbanić and her producers made the decision to premiere Quo Vadis, Aida? at the memorial centre in Srebrenica, which is technically in the latter, to an audience of young people from all sides (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian); there was also a screening for survivors. “Those who were born long after these events were moved,” she says. “Many of those on the Serbian side live under the influence of a media that encourages them not to feel for Muslims, and the film emancipated that part of their brains. It allowed them to cry. As for the survivors, they told me that it was how they remembered it.” But in the rest of Republika Srpska, the Serbian-dominated part of the country, the film has yet to be shown. “The cinema owners are too frightened. They fear the government will give them the kind of punishments that cannot be proved: financial inspections, for instance. To get round this, we suggested underground screenings that we would not even announce. But they said no, someone will find out. A group of boys will be paid to throw stones at the cinema.” It gives her particular pleasure that young audiences find the film gripping: a thriller, of sorts. “My thesis film at film school was about mass graves,” she says, with a black laugh. “This is where I grew up! Even sex was used as a weapon here. But I remember my professor saying: look, this isn’t a document for submission to an international tribunal. It’s a movie.” All directors believe in film as a medium, but when Žbanić talks about the way culture in general, and film in particular, can bring people together, she speaks with more authority than most. “In the siege, we quickly resumed normal activities that were not normal at all in the circumstances, and there was a feeling that by going to the theatre or a film festival, dressed up nicely, you were showing that you were not a victim, that this barbarism would not win. It is really true that we needed culture almost as much as we needed food. To see a film with others, even in crazy conditions, a VHS tape screened against a wall, huddled together: it was very human, and it kept me sane through it all. It gave me the sense I have even now that a film is more than a film. It is life. That’s where my love for it comes from.” Quo Vadis, Aida? is not, she says, against the UN, though she believes its failings in Srebrenica were extremely grave: “On the contrary, it’s about how to make it stronger, and more able to protect human rights.” She believes that people talk too glibly about war. “I’m afraid that if Srebrenica was happening at this moment, the outcome would be the same. Europe is more disunited now, and rightwing forces more in evidence. If this were the constellation of political powers, no one would lift a finger to help the Bosnians – and this is what is scary. We say never again, but there’s nothing behind our words. Bosnia is still considered ‘other’ in Europe. I was at a gathering where the European Film Academy president said that there had been no war in Europe for 70 years, and all I could think was: ‘Were the 100,000 people who died in Bosnia not Europeans?’ But we don’t count.” In Bosnia, she believes, no one won. “The fascists are still around us. The victims and the perpetrators live alongside one other, because only the big guys were sentenced. That is very hard, and I hope my film allows people to talk about it – about the fact that peace doesn’t just come like lightning to burn all the bad things down.” Quo Vadis, Aida? is on Curzon Home Cinema from 22 January"
"Did the closing episode of The Mandalorian’s second season just give us the final appearance of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker in Star Wars? If so, the return of the original Jedi knight to carry away Baby Yoda to a future under his care, looks like a fitting farewell to the boy from Tatooine who destroyed the evil Empire. Especially as his last hurrah as a force ghost in the appalling The Rise of Skywalker let the side down. Yet what if this isn’t the end, but rather the beginning? Disney-owned Lucasfilm currently has a problem on its hands, one that Hamill and an army of CGI technicians are more than ready to handle: Star Wars fans can’t wait for the umpteen new TV shows that are due to spin off from The Mandalorian. Efforts based on Obi-Wan Kenobi’s middle years, Boba Fett’s later period and Ahsoka Tano’s post Clone Wars antics are perhaps the most heavily anticipated – but there is very little interest in more Skywalker clan-linked efforts of the kind that fuelled the space opera saga for nine movies after JJ Abrams inadvertently Death Starred the entire franchise last time out. This is largely a good thing. It was the relentless focus on the big beasts of the original movies that ultimately destroyed the sequel trilogy, specifically the decision to bring back Emperor Palpatine as a laughable zombie version of himself who proceeds to magic up a new Imperial fleet with a flick of his fingers. Strange we never heard of that particular Sith trick before. On the other hand, Hamill remains relatively unaffected by the abject failure of Rise of Skywalker. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, the Star Wars sequel in which Luke had the largest role, will almost certainly go down in posterity as the best film of the trilogy now that Abrams’ earlier The Force Awakens has been so badly tarnished by the director’s subsequent efforts. It explored fascinating and unexpected themes, such as the idea that Skywalker might find failure in his middle years having experienced nothing but relentless victory in his youth. But even if we don’t want to see those sad events played out in new movies, there are still decades of Luke’s life to explore, and it appears we now have the technology to experience them with the saga’s original actor in situ. IndieWire reports that Hamill was on set to play the digitally de-aged Luke in that final scene where Baby Yoda is passed to his new mentor, though it appears that Max Lloyd-Jones starred as the Jedi knight for the action sequence in which Luke thrillingly destroys a platoon of mechanised dark troopers. So why not bring Hamill back in a new movie? The Mandalorian has proven beyond doubt that there is ample room in the Star Wars galaxy for new adventures outside the traditional timeline – it operates entirely in the wake of the Rebels’ victory over the Empire in Return of the Jedi, a period before the rise of the First Order that was not previously considered to be fertile territory for the long-running saga. Recasting the role of Luke is one option, but that approach didn’t work out for the middling Solo: A Star Wars Story. Bringing Hamill back, especially given how spot-on the digital de-ageing looked for The Mandalorian, is surely the more palatable option. There might even be room to bring back a de-aged Harrison Ford as Han Solo for some brand new adventures with his old pal. Disney+ might be the obvious vehicle. But only the multiplex delivers the kind of budget that would allow Lucasfilm to put together the technical team needed for such an ambitious approach, and besides, Disney already has 10 TV shows in the works. Of course, some might say that the studio should leave well alone – that Hamill’s iconic performances in the original trilogy shouldn’t be stained by the possibility of future appearances not hitting the same heights. But we live in the Covid-era, in which the inability of mankind to do much else but sit in front of the telly most evenings means we demand more content than ever before, and the idea that popular characters and sagas won’t be recycled for the entertainment of the masses is naive. That spaceship has most definitely left the dock – hell, they are even bringing back Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. The best we can hope for is that new adventures live up to the excellent standard of The Mandalorian, and few would argue that Luke’s return ended up being the highlight of the entire show so far."
"Released in 2016, Jane Harper’s debut novel, The Dry, evoked a sense of sundried desperation and El Niño-inspired unease that felt as familiar to many Australian readers as the book’s genre trappings (its tagline, “a desperate act in a small town with secrets”, could apply to anything from Twin Peaks to Top of the Lake). The book hadn’t even hit shelves when producer Bruna Papandrea and screenwriter-director Robert Connolly started planning the film. Papandrea is perhaps best known today for adapting Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies for HBO, which swapped Sydney’s northern beaches for affluent, coastal California – but there was no separating The Dry from its western Victorian backdrop. “It just lends itself to mystery and suspense so well because you do have that undercurrent of danger in a lot of locations,” Harper says. Whether set in state forests, coastal communities or great, thirsty expanses of agricultural land, her four novels to date pick up on the duelling sensibilities of romanticism and dread that have recurred in Australian storytelling since colonisation. “It’s quite easy for things to go wrong quite quickly, which is a real gift for a writer.” The Dry, which opens in cinemas on Friday, follows off-duty Australian federal police detective Aaron Falk (Bana), who is reluctantly dragged back to his fictional hometown of Kiewarra after his childhood friend is found shot, dead along with their wife and son. The current case, and Falk’s presence in town, are complicated by his own implication in the death of another friend, Ellie (BeBe Bettencourt), decades earlier. Before making the film, Connolly hit the road with Bana so the pair could immerse themselves in the world of the book. “You drive one, two, three hours out of Melbourne, and by the time you cross four you’re into the Mallee region and the landscape changes immensely,” Connolly says. “I fell in love with it; it’s the most beautiful, extraordinary place. But it’s tough … you feel this muscular, tough lifestyle of the landscape set against its beauty.” In this tension, Harper’s characters inherit a settler narrative of pioneers carving hard-won homes and livelihoods from an often inhospitable, alien outback. It’s also part of a nation-building mythology that helped launder the realities of dispossession and environmental degradation on unceded country. (The Dry’s story of a complicated small-town homecoming rings very differently to that of Wiradjuri author’s Tara June Winch’s The Yield; in the film, a retired farmer, played by Bruce Spence, laments without irony how the automation of agriculture could all but clear the region of its people and communities – imagine that.) Like the novel, the film’s slow-burning plot crackles with other 21st century pressures and anxieties that seem ripped straight from a Four Corners report. While the apparent murder-suicide that initially draws Falk back home echoes all-too-common acts of male-perpetrated family violence, Harper’s books are also peppered with corporate crime, revenge porn, gambling addiction, crippling debt, preyed-upon backpackers and toxic masculinity that sweats into hi-vis and private school uniforms alike. Onscreen, Connolly frames Harper’s characters like ants set against the vastness of the landscape – and the scale of their problems. “Something Eric and I talked a lot about early on was not judging the characters that live in that world,” says Connolly, who also drew inspiration from Roman Polanski’s similarly water-driven whodunnit Chinatown. “There’s a version of these stories that’s like Deliverance – ‘urban character gets stuck in dark, horrific regional place’ – and that wasn’t our intention. We had to look deep into the heart of these damaged characters and the tough luck they’ve had, and find the humanity.” For Harper, that humanity was grounded in her 13 years as a print journalist. “It gave me a really good ability to listen to people’s stories and try to find a human element behind the headlines.” Inevitably, the greatest of the pressures facing these characters are drought and fire, both worsened by a changing climate that, counter to the denial of federal ministers in Akubra-and-moleskin cosplay, is evident on the land. Like its source novel, The Dry ties into a wave of recent local literature from Alice Bishop’s A Constant Hum to Jennifer Mills’ Dyschronia that reflect upon the impact of ecological disaster on small communities. “When I moved back to Australian in 2008 I got sent on a fire safety course as a reporter, so I could be safe in the event that I would have to go out and cover a bushfire,” Harper says. “I was stunned by what I saw and learned – I’d never seen that portrayal of fire. How quickly it goes from OK to deadly in the space of minutes, that’s always stayed with me.” Connolly says: “The big image of the film is Aaron standing in a river that’s now completely dry and remembering himself 25 years ago, swimming with his friends. It’s kind of devastating imagery. “Climate change and its impact on the land were present with us all the time,” he adds. “We were filming out in a part of Australia that is doing it really tough. Beulah, the town [on the poster], has drinking water issues. It’s ever present. Farmers are growing different grains than they used to because there’s not enough water, they’re adapting.” Much has changed since filming was completed in 2019. After the carnage of last summer’s bushfires, Australia is now entering a typically wetter (if still record-breaking) La Niña period. Worldwide protests have seen the very nature of the cop-centric crime drama reappraised. And now The Dry hits cinemas during a different kind of dry spell, as one of few new releases on what is typically one of Hollywood’s biggest days of the year. “We really tried to make this kind of, we call it, ‘hyper-Australian’ cinema,” Connolly says. “A big Australian film: big landscapes, big stories, music, stars – one that brings Australian audiences to the cinema to watch.” A year of lockdowns might also grant the film an edge neither Harper or Connolly could have scripted: only in 2020 could 117 minutes of a maskless Eric Bana freely travelling around the Victorian countryside also qualify as escapist fantasy.  The Dry is in cinemas from 1 January "
"Even in a year that has made us numb to strangeness, it’s been a funny old December: a festive season largely without festivities, while many will be spending Christmas apart from their usual crowd. With that in mind, the usual seasonal viewing options – those extravagant Christmas films that pile on the tinselly cheer – may feel out of step with the collective mood. A time, then, for Christmas films that permit a little wintry chill, some room for loneliness or pensive melancholy. Or exquisite misery, if you feel like plunging into the anti-Christmas genre at its most extreme with Mon Oncle Antoine – a Canadian classic that I hadn’t seen until recently. Made in 1971, Claude Jutra’s film is an unsentimental coming-of-age tale, following a Quebecer teen through about the least jolly Christmas Eve imaginable, as he assists his undertaker uncle in the collection and eventual rescue of a dead body. If that sounds solemn, it is, but there’s hard-won humanity amid the austerity, and Jutra has an eye for crisp, severe beauty. It’s also free to view on YouTube, thanks to the National Film Board of Canada’s marvellous archival channel. Dialling up the warmth several notches, Bill Forsyth’s wistful, gently absurd Comfort and Joy (1984; on Amazon Prime) begins with a breakup, as Scottish DJ Allan “Dicky” Bird (a droll Bill Paterson) is left single days before Christmas – but not wholly alone, as he finds himself improbably tangled in a turf war between rival ice-cream vendors. On its release, the film was seen as something of a letdown after Forsyth’s previous films, but time has been kind: it glimmers with home and kinship against bleak odds. You could pair it with either of two films about the unexpected consequences of one’s lover departing at Christmas: in both Lynne Ramsay’s mordant, oddly rapturous Morvern Callar (2002) and Zach Clark’s eerily deadpan White Reindeer (2013; both on iTunes), the young heroine’s partner abruptly dies, making for a holiday season of sudden independence and surprising escapades. You could say something similar for Tom Cruise’s nasty yet cathartic yuletide odyssey in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (1999; on Microsoft Store) – a weirdly evocative film that captures the silly season in all its sometimes alienating excess. Staying in New York’s sinister underbelly, Allen Baron’s 1961 thriller Blast of Silence is short, shadow-striped and razor-cut. A neo-noir tracking a hitman going about his business between Christmas and New Year, it’s niftily nestled in the Internet Archive. Nearly as minimalist, though a lot more colourful, Sean Baker’s iPhone-shot gem Tangerine (2015; on Google Play) has already attained seasonal counter-classic status with its jangly, touching study of two transgender sex workers spending the holiday together on the streets of Los Angeles. All of which isn’t to say the alternative Christmas film can’t partake of a little swooning romanticism. I’ll be rewatching Wong Kar-wai’s 2046 (2004; on Amazon) this coming week, bathing in the saturated, satiny colours of a time-shifting puzzle in which Christmas – and the lost loves and unsuccessful trysts that congregate around it – is the one constant. But I’ll be following it up with Todd Haynes’s dreamy, crystalline Carol (on Prime), a red-ribboned Christmas romance in which heartbreak does lead to the brink of ecstatic reconciliation: two people, alone against the world, heading into a new year and future together. What more do you really need to get through the holiday? The Prom (Netflix, 12A) The latest product of Ryan Murphy’s relentless Netflix content deal is also the first feature film he’s directed since 2010’s Eat Pray Love, and proves he has a better head for episodic TV. Adapted from a modest Broadway musical, this glitter-assaulted trifle centres on a vain quartet of New York stage luvvies, descending on a bigoted Indiana town to help a marginalised lesbian teen attend prom. Initially announcing its intent to satirise empty celebrity activism, it proceeds to fall into exactly that trap itself, with wet self-help songs, preening star performances from James Corden and Meryl Streep, and a forced air of sub-Glee gaiety – undercut by the film’s palpable confidence that it’s Really Helping People. The Macaluso Sisters (Curzon Home Cinema) Playwright-turned-film-maker Emma Dante’s charming, lace-delicate second film premiered in competition at this year’s Venice film festival, where it was overshadowed by beefier competition. So it’s a surprise and a delight to see a UK release for this deft, moving tale of sisterhood across multiple decades, which most impressively traces and braids the life stories of five women in under 90 minutes, its melodrama never feeling forced or compressed. Small Axe (BBC, 15) They’re all available free on the iPlayer, of course, but if you’re a physical media completist – or are Christmas gift-shopping for one – the five films making up Steve McQueen’s extraordinary television project have been gathered into a single DVD box set. Foregrounding London’s Caribbean community on a scale never previously seen on screen, it’s a rich, raging, celebratory quilt – in particular, Lovers Rock gives us the feverish party hit that this December has been missing."
"Ellen Burstyn is struggling to make herself heard above the sirens that are screeching across the city. “I live on a road that’s very popular with police cars and ambulances,” she says down the line from New York. She had been trying to tell me about the Oscars when she was interrupted by the racket. If she is nominated in March – and, with the odds of her winning best supporting actress currently at 5/1, she almost certainly will be – this would make her the Academy’s oldest acting nominee, having turned 88 this month. “At the moment, it’s Chris Plummer,” she says excitedly. “But I would beat him by 42 days! What a great crown that would be to wear.” If her performance in the Netflix drama Pieces of a Woman wins her a nomination, it will be her seventh. Over the last 50 years, Burstyn has been recognised for her portrayals of a jaded wife in The Last Picture Show; of a mother whose child is demonically possessed in The Exorcist; and of a widowed waitress who hits the road with her young son in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. In Same Time, Next Year, she played a married woman who meets annually with her lover; in Resurrection she was a car crash survivor who acquires healing powers; and in Requiem for a Dream she starred as the mother of a junkie who becomes an addict herself. Her sole win was for Alice, where the range of her performance still astonishes, running from distress and desolation to joy and outright comic pizzazz. Busy on Oscar night with the Broadway run of Same Time, Next Year, she sent Alice’s director Martin Scorsese to collect the award in her stead. In truth, she was relieved not to go. “I’m never really comfortable there. Everyone in borrowed gowns, smiling down the red carpet and being interviewed about, oh, I don’t know. But it’s not this kind of conversation, I can tell you. ‘Whose dress are you wearing? Whose diamonds?’” Attending is fine, she thinks, if the odds are against you. “I’ve gone other years when I felt more confident that I wouldn’t win. Whereas with Alice, I was not surprised that I won.” She lets slip a naughty laugh, perhaps realising that this might come across as less than humble. Her rivals at the 1975 ceremony included Gena Rowlands for A Woman Under the Influence and Faye Dunaway for Chinatown. The competition will be stiff again if Burstyn is nominated next year, as she is likely to be up against Amanda Seyfried for Mank, and Olivia Colman for dementia drama The Father. It was Burstyn who picked Scorsese to direct Alice, back in 1973 when her stock was far higher than his. Warner Bros, dazzled by how good she was in the dailies from The Exorcist, offered her any script she wanted. Seizing on Alice, which had once been proposed as a vehicle for Diana Ross, Burstyn then selected Scorsese, fresh from Mean Streets, to lend the project his freewheeling, improvisatory energy. Now, in what might be interpreted as a pleasing act of reciprocation, the director has lent his name to Pieces of a Woman as executive producer – “To make sure the film gets seen”, as Burstyn puts it. She plays Elizabeth, a steely matriarch with a clenched and joyless smile, who pressures her grieving daughter Martha to testify against a midwife after the death of her baby. Hair lacquered into a kind of crash helmet, Elizabeth charges head-first at life, refusing to allow fate the upper hand. The film’s indisputable highlight is a ferocious, eye-popping exchange between mother and daughter. As Martha, played by Vanessa Kirby, wavers over appearing in court, Elizabeth tries to tip the scales with a story about her own past – about her birth, in fact, during the Holocaust, when a doctor advised her mother to simply throw her away. “That speech kept growing,” she says. “Before I did my take, Vanessa said, ‘Convince me.’ Because her character had been resistant to the idea of court. I did the speech the way it was and then, just as I finished, I had the realisation that I had not convinced her as needed. So I carried on talking, and I did that part about, ‘Speak your truth, tell them how it is for you.’ How I said it, I don’t remember. It just came out of me. I was in the scene, you know? The fiction was the reality at that point. When I got to the end, I felt I had, in fact, made her want to go to court.” In her 2006 memoir, Lessons in Becoming Myself, Burstyn explains that her preparation for any role involves “taking an elevator down to my inner archive, where I quietly flip through the files until some memory rises up and offers itself”. What did she find down there that was relevant to Elizabeth? “You know, I never talk about that,” she says. “If I do, it loses its power. Personal memories are like tools I can call on for help. If I give it away to you, it won’t work for me any more, so I won’t answer that.” The elevator doors close firmly on the subject. She will confirm, though, that she has never resorted to the sort of harsh tactics that Elizabeth employs, swatting obstacles away with her chequebook. At one point, she tries to bribe her daughter’s partner, played by Shia LaBeouf, to leave town for ever. “I doubt I would ever do that,” she laughs. “It would have to be extreme circumstances.” Speaking prior to the recent allegations about LaBeouf’s abusive behaviour, Burstyn is full of praise for her co-star. “Shia is so fierce about being real. He isn’t standard issue.” I remind her that he once appeared on the red carpet at the Berlin film festivalwearing a paper bag with the words “I Am Not a Celebrity” daubed on it. “Oh, I read about that,” she says. “I never quite understood it.” Has fame ever been a burden for her? “I’ve never been one of those celebrities who got chased down the street by shouting throngs. People are always very nice to me. It hasn’t been at all unpleasant.” The same can’t be said of her life. Burstyn’s childhood in Detroit was marked by abuse of every kind, not least from her violent mother. “I’m surprised by how much I miss her these days, having had such a difficult relationship with her,” she says. “I have the impulse to call her very often. I say it out loud sometimes, ‘Mom, I wish I could call you.’” What would she say? “I think it’s just to go back over the past. I wish I could’ve been more helpful then and understood her point of view, rather than resisting. It would be nice to be able to talk to her about that now. And I do talk. I talk to the mother that lives inside of me.” How did the way she was raised affect her own parenting? “Well, I remember when I was a child having a mental notebook where I would say, ‘I’ll never do that when I’m a mother.’ I would make notes about what a good mother should and shouldn’t be. I think my son would tell you I was a very good mother. I’m sure if my mother and I could sit down and talk about it today, she would say she was sorry. Years later, when I was already an adult, I talked to her about being hit so much. I told her this was not a good thing. She said, ‘I’d never do it again, I’ll tell you that. Not now I know how much trouble it caused.’” She pauses. “I’m glad she understood that before she left.” Learning to “abide trouble and suffering”, she says, has stood her in good stead as an actor. “Otherwise you’re afraid to haul up those uncomfortable things in your work.” She trained at the Actors Studio in New York in the late 1960s after realising that she didn’t want the glitzy, fluffy star roles that lay ahead for her on the path she had been following for 10 years. She craved the tough stuff. She didn’t have to be Debbie Reynolds: she could be Marlon Brando. Burstyn is still intimately involved with the Actors Studio. In fact, she has to field a call from one of her co-directors in the middle of our conversation, to discuss an upcoming board meeting. “Hold on, I’m getting a call from Alec Baldwin,” she says. “Don’t go anywhere.” Her stint there, under Lee Strasberg, led directly to the string of films, including The Last Picture Show and The Exorcist, that transformed her career – and the whole of US cinema. If she is rarely invoked alongside Warren Beatty, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino as one of the faces of the American new wave, it can only be because she is, rather inconveniently, a woman. Casual moviegoers can recite those very masculine monologues from Taxi Driver, Five Easy Pieces or Network. Less familiar but every bit as scalding is the scene in The King of Marvin Gardens, from 1972, in which Burstyn offers her makeup, clothes and a few freshly-snipped locks of hair to a bonfire on the beach at Atlantic City. “They’re made out of mink hairs, did you know that?” she says as she sprinkles her false eyelashes on to the flames. “For 20 years, I’ve been wearing animal hairs on my face.” The sight of a woman dealing fearlessly on screen with age, decaying beauty and disappointment was a chastening one, more uncomfortable for many than the male equivalent. Burstyn’s experiences also prove that a woman has far less cultural credit in the bank when things go awry. All the industry clout she had built up during the 1970s evaporated after a pair of box-office flops: Same Time, Next Year and Resurrection. Two strikes and she was out, more or less, consigned for around 15 years to television, in the days when this was not a prestigious place to be. “That was it, girl, you know!” she said in an interview in 2000. “It’s a sin to have your films not make money.” Audacious directors who grew up on her work came eventually to the rescue, calling on her unusual capacity for being both benign and barbed, in films as diverse as The Yards, Requiem for a Dream, Interstellar and Wiener-Dog. She has had few opportunities, though, to be as loose and funny on film as she was in Alice. There has been plenty of slush in her career (The Spitfire Grill, Playing by Heart, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood) but a distinct dearth of laughs, unless you count the preposterous remake of The Wicker Man, where she presided gleefully over the torture-by-bees and eventual immolation of Nicolas Cage. The vital thing is that she survived Hollywood, a place she once described as a “hamburger machine”. How did she avoid being turned into mince? “It was never really my intention to be a movie star,” she says. “I always wanted to be as good as I could possibly be. That kind of goal leads you in a different direction to wanting to be a star, which can be a frightful experience. The fact that I’m still working at 88 tells me I did what I wanted to do.” The sirens have stopped wailing now. Calm settles over the city."
"Heroes Don’t Die is the second recent film – after Quentin Dupieux’s absurdist Deerskin, also due in the UK in 2021 – in which French high-flyer Adèle Haenel gets behind a camera to soothe a wounded male ego. Here she plays film-maker Alice, who decides to humour her friend Joachim (Jonathan Couzinié) who, after being collared in a Paris street by an angry Slav, comes to believe he is the reincarnation of Zoran, a Bosnian soldier who died on 21 August 1983 – the day he was born. The pair pack the digicam and head Balkans-ward to track down the truth. Debut director Aude Léa Rapin, co-writing with Couzinié, reaches for Nouvelle Vague-like sprightliness with this meta-filmic setup. But it has the unfortunate effect of spotlighting Heroes Don’t Die’s self-regard and hesitancy over what form to take. If it’s satirising first-person documentaries, it doesn’t keep that subject in sharp focus. The character-study element, as Alice begins to doubt Joachim’s sincerity about his belief in reincarnation, feels expedient. It engages only sketchily with Bosnian history: it situates its story in Bratunac, the next town over from Srebenica. This tempting proximity to seriousness, when a war widow draws parallels between her and Joachim’s situations, leads Rapin towards borderline misjudged musings (“It’s good to tell yourself stories.”) Haenel, the film’s moral centre, is capable of both the Clintonian hauteur she showed in Portrait of a Lady on Fire and a gabbling, caffeinated over-seriousness used to fine effect in 2018 French comedy hit En liberté!, but this film leaves her dashing between the two poles. True to form, though, for the film’s slightly maddening inconsistency, in the final 10 minutes – as Joachim encounters a peasant woman who may or may not be the dead soldier’s wife – a gripping, almost wordless scene delivers pathos, thematic depth and a poetic kick from a glorious Bosnian hillside all at once. Otherwise, it is a largely frustrating exercise; sometimes history is best left in the backdrop. "
"“India is two countries in one,” our hero Balram observes in The White Tiger: there is an India of light, preserve of the rich and powerful; and an India of darkness, where millions toil in poverty. The White Tiger is a vivid study of caste and servility, as Balram (Adarsh Gourav) ingratiates his way into the service of a wealthy family, until he realises he is consigned to reside in the darkness. “And don’t believe for a second there’s a million-rupee gameshow you can win to get out of it,” he says, in a dig at that other fantasy of Indian class mobility, Slumdog Millionaire. There is rarely a magical mechanism by which people are lifted out of poverty, but the movies are often happy to peddle that notion. We would be kidding ourselves if we thought The White Tiger’s class/caste analysis only applied to India. Elsewhere, it is either better disguised or presented as a fact of life, especially when it comes to stories about servants. The Hollywood equivalent to Slumdog would be a Cinderella fantasy such as Maid in Manhattan, in which Jennifer Lopez’s lowly hotel cleaner is whisked into the light by senator Ralph Fiennes. Nor is there much difference between Balram and, say, PG Wodehouse’s Jeeves, or the dozens of other downstairs domestics in British period fare such as Gosford Park or even the recent Bridgerton. They might detest their overlords but they know their place – usually serving tea in the background. It doesn’t have to be this way. The White Tiger readily brings to mind The Servant, Joseph Losey and Harold Pinter’s subversive 1963 study of a sly manservant (Dirk Bogarde) who steadily takes over the Chelsea home of his upper-crust employer (James Fox). Similar tales abound in European cinema: Losey’s follow-up The Go-Between for one, or Diary of a Chambermaid – following a young woman’s ordeal at the hands of the haute bourgeoisie. Jean Renoir filmed it in 1946; Luis Buñuel turned in a more unsettling version in 1964; there was also a 2015 remake. France’s infamous Papin sisters – maids who murdered their mistress in 1933 – inspired a host of works including Jean Genet’s play The Maids (Glenda Jackson and Susannah York starred in the 1975 film), Sister My Sister, and Claude Chabrol’s terrific La Cérémonie, starring Sandrine Bonnaire and Isabelle Huppert. Then there is that masterclass in British servility The Remains of the Day, in which Anthony Hopkins’s terminally repressed butler rues a lifetime of loyalty to a Nazi-sympathising toff (Fox again). Many of these stories are conveniently set in the past, which makes The White Tiger a dangerous modern rarity, although last year’s Parasite struck a very similar chord. Let’s not pretend the gap between the haves and have-nots has narrowed. Maybe the movies have some catching up to do."
"On 23 August 2007, Lindsay Lohan issued a statement to TMZ in the Hollywood dialect of professional contrition that hints at behind-the-scenes PR damage control. In its 11 brief sentences, she makes a plainspoken admission that she’s “addicted to alcohol and drugs”, that her destructive behavior is no one’s responsibility but her own, and that she’s ready to take the steps required to get her back on the path to wellness. While not quite a turning point for her career, which has remained stagnant over the past decade-plus of self-referential screen roles and regrettable pop singles and swiftly shuttered Grecian nightclubs, that press release did provide a fitting coda to the odd and sordid tale of I Know Who Killed Me. Released one month earlier, the mid-budget slasher vehicle for Lohan was derailed again and again by her personal life, even as its text was inextricably bound up in the same. Though DOA at the box office upon its critically savaged theatrical run, this widely, wrongly maligned film has been embraced by a growing mini-cult attuned to its aesthetic of surreal artifice and grim interplay with real life. We appreciate the irony of a woozy-headed meditation on the luster and tragedy inherent to the classic celebrity-in-peril archetype – which its star could not appear on Leno to promote due to a DWI arrest earlier that week. The troubled production process involved working around its leading lady’s mandate to spend 30 nights at the Wonderland rehabilitation facility, bouts of the often-euphemistic Tinseltown ailment “dehydration”, a not-at-all-euphemistic appendectomy, an infected surgical incision, and a paparazzi presence so relentless that a few shutterbugs ended up in the background of some shots in the finished film. But the baggage she dropped off at set only served to deepen and enrich the subtext of a stealth noir gem, one that gestures to a long-bygone era of movie stardom through the framework of a cheaper and dirtier sort of serial killer thriller. As a girl nextdoor seemingly transformed overnight into a vamp with a cigarette-rasped voice and formidable pole-dancing prowess, she brings the thought experiment of “what if Barbara Stanwyck had been fed through Disney’s wringer as a child?” to life in exhilarating fashion. Lohan is first introduced as Aubrey Fleming, the wholesome kind of all-American high schooler who still takes piano lessons and stops her boyfriend at second base. Aubrey promptly falls victim to a psycho with a predilection for using dry ice to peel off layers of skin like lasagna sheets, except that Lohan returns soon after on the side of the same road Cloris Leachman ran on to in Kiss Me Deadly. When she wakes up in the hospital short an arm and a leg, she insists that she’s femme fatale Dakota Moss, the hard-living daughter of a crack addict. The link connecting these two women goes beyond being the figurative yin to the other’s yang, and beyond the kooky Corsican-sister explanation for why Aubrey and Dakota have matching wounds. They constitute a hysterical parody of the cautionary tale projected on to all young women, teenaged starlets in particular, that their virginal innocence can be tarnished into slatternly moral dissipation with one wrong move. Director Chris Sivertson works in a lurid playfulness, offsetting the gratuitous gloved-hand gore some have likened to giallo with a tone of wry melodrama more redolent of the soap opera from Twin Peaks, another of his professed influences. He lets the Aubrey/Dakota duality bleed into the fabric of the film by using the combatting colors blue and red the way others might use black and white, rendering shadows as luminescent splotches and fading out between scenes not to literal darkness or light, but to hues suggesting an elemental good and bad. Lohan’s enacting a fame-ritual dating back to the entertainment industry of the 20s and 30s, gamely being the madonna and whore the tabloid-readers of the world demand she be, if only to show how absurd and outmoded the dichotomy is. Much of Lohan’s post-dry-out work has attempted to play on her public persona, to less than encouraging levels of success. (The less said of her addled, scantily clad, gun-toting nun from Machete, the better.) But for a minute there, it looked like she might have a future as a more skillfully scare-quoted version of herself, still possessed of the canniness and precocity she showed as a rising talent in The Parent Trap and Mean Girls. A close-minded America dismissed I Know Who Killed Me as working nadir of a woman hitting her own rock bottom. Little did they realize they were getting a glimpse of the Lindsay that could’ve been."
"Anger burns a hole through the screen in this stark monochrome picture from veteran director Andrei Konchalovsky: a gruelling re-enactment of the hushed-up Novocherkassk massacre in western Russia in 1962, when Red Army soldiers and KGB snipers opened fire on unarmed striking workers, killing an estimated 80 people. It was a day of spiritual nausea for the Soviet Union, which had only just entered Khrushchev’s new de-Stalinised era of supposed enlightenment – a postwar civilian bloodbath that was the Soviets’ Sharpeville, or Kent State, or Bloody Sunday, or indeed the Corpus Christi massacre in Mexico City that featured in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. Yuliya Vysotskaya – a longtime Konchalovsky player – plays Lyuda, a Communist party official and single mother who lives in a tiny flat in Novocherkassk with her 18-year-old daughter Svetka (Yuliya Burova) and grizzled old dad (Sergei Erlish). There are terrible food shortages, yet Lyuda is a loyal and uncomplaining party member who not so secretly pines for the good old days of Josef Stalin, when the Soviet Union was bathed in glorious wartime destiny and when things seemed to be better all round. Now she is having a furtive affair with a cynical and bleary married committee official who doesn’t even seem to like her very much. To the party’s uncomprehending disgust, a strike is triggered by exhausted workers’ rage at the sudden issue of lowered wages and food price rises and the party’s fatuous claim that this lethal combination will ease pressure on state finances and, therefore, create more plenty in the long term. There is horrifying chaos and slaughter: Svetka goes missing, and Lyuda embarks on a desperate quest to find her, dead or alive. What’s worse is that she has a party-loyalist reputation for endorsing precisely this kind of cruel crackdown and must suppress her secret anguish about her missing daughter and give an address to the party faithful beginning with the greeting: “Dorogie tovarishi!” (“Dear comrades!”) Konchalovsky clearly shows the incompetence, paranoia, bureaucracy and secrecy that created this mass murder. I found myself thinking about Craig Mazin’s recent TV drama Chernobyl. The same instincts are on display: to shut down the city, to cover everything up, smother everything and fail to understand. There is here an intense regional dislike of Novocherkassk and the whole area as the home of the untameable Cossacks and peasants. Lyuda’s father has grim memories of retributive local killings, and he reflects grimly on Mikhail Sholokhov’s And Quiet Flows the Don and its bitter vision. So much of the film’s pain is in that single word: comrade. (Lyuda keeps finding herself singing a rousing patriotic song from the movie that’s just been on TV: Grigory Alekandrov’s Spring, with its earnest chorus of, “Oh comrades, protect your motherland at all costs!”) The word denotes equality and brotherhood and anti-hierarchical idealism that does away with caste and class. In fact, the word functions as a sentimental kind of denial about the vertical structure of power everywhere, with everyone afraid of people above them – but also people below, who could snitch, or suddenly be promoted over them. There is a chilling moment after the massacre when a bewildered young woman is curtly told to sign an official document confirming that she will never reveal to anyone what has happened, but is then taken away, apparently to be executed, when the KGB official decides her behaviour at their brief interview has been unsatisfactory. This woman’s fate is, however, even stranger and scarier than we think. So the drama continues with officialdom blandly declaring that there will be a party with dancing that evening at 7pm, apparently to expunge any ill feeling, and also, given that the blood cannot be washed away from the asphalt and has somehow baked redly into it, a new layer of asphalt must be placed over it. On top of all this, Konchalovsky places an unexpected ending with its layer of bleak irony; it is a passionate drama of fear and rage."
"Stanley Kubrick’s enigmatic film 2001: A Space Odyssey has posed a puzzle from the first. The unsettling story of a manned space journey to Jupiter, it continues to intrigue audiences 50 years after its release. But now, thanks to a small British record label, a “lost” original song, commissioned especially for the film but never used, is winning admiration from fans for the way it catches the flavour of a cinematic one-off. “I gave the song what I believe is its first airplay on my Scala Radio show a few weeks back,” said Mark Kermode, the Observer’s film critic. “Audience reaction was utterly polarised, but I have the suspicion it will become a cult favourite. It is very ear-wormy.” Speaking to the Observer from California, the song’s composer, Mike Kaplan, a film-industry veteran and Kubrick’s former long-time publicist, said he is astonished to find a piece of music he put his heart into all those years ago is belatedly gaining airtime following its release as a single a few weeks ago by Bristol-based Wave Theory Records. “I know it doesn’t sound like anything else, and I am not sure how I managed to work it out,” said Kaplan, 77. “I could never do it again. But it is great to hear it being played.” The publicist was challenged to write the song, 2001: A Garden of Personal Mirrors, during a meeting with Kubrick and MGM records after they had all listened to the demo tape of another song that had been intended to help promote the film. Declining to use the downbeat tune, Kubrick turned to Kaplan, who he knew wrote music and who he felt understood his film: “I hear you write music. Why don’t you write something?” he said, according to Kaplan. After moonlighting on his day job to compose the song, Kaplan had it professionally mixed and sung by folk performer Naomi Gardner. “The intent was to capture the different responses 2001 was generating from audiences and the media, the many levels of interpretation and appreciation, from its hypnotic visuals to its metaphysical illuminations. We also wanted to instil curiosity among audiences who had not yet seen what was becoming a cultural phenomenon,” Kaplan has explained. He wanted to emulate the success of the quirky hit MacArthur Park, featuring Richard Harris, but when he played it to Kubrick the tinny reproduction on a portable machine did it no favours. Although the great director liked the title, he said he could not imagine it becoming a hit. The two friends never discussed the song again, although they continued to work together closely on A Clockwork Orange. Another composer, Alex North, also wrote a score for 2001, but Kubrick ultimately went for a classical work, Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra. Kaplan first met Kubrick in 1968 in a projection booth, where the director was told that the team promoting 2001 were having a hard time working out how to sell it to audiences. “We were confronted with a metaphysical drama encompassing evolution, reincarnation, the beauty of space, the terror of science and the mystery of mankind that required critics and audiences to surrender to its unique rhythms,” Kaplan explained. “With a visual narrative that jumped millennia, the 161-minute epic [original running time] contained only 22 minutes of dialogue.” After a two-hour discussion about the film, they shook hands and a long friendship began. The composer Dan Jones, founder of Wave Theory Records, said: “Attempting to write any music for Kubrick would be a daunting task, as Alex North – and now we discover Mike Kaplan – were both to discover. I was immediately struck by Mike’s song. It exudes the spirit of the time of its creation in New York. Both North’s atmospheric score and this celebratory single stand on their own musical terms, revealed years after their creation; and both of them give clues to the complex creative interactions that Kubrick’s films distilled.”"
"Cinematic rethinks of classic fairytales, especially Red Riding Hood, are a micro-genre about as exasperating and banal as the “year X called and it wants its Y back” joke. In Hunted’s case insert, 1985 for X and “postmodern feminist trope” for Y. Nevertheless, this uncomfortable but adroitly executed horror version in which a young woman is chased through the woods by toxic male monsters is pretty good stuff: unnerving in the right ways and flecked with colourful, unexpected specks of wit. In what presumably must be rural Ireland given most of the supporting characters’ accents, Eve (Lucie Debay, feral and fierce) is a bit of an outsider, a French woman stuck in the middle of nowhere supervising the construction of a housing estate. A chance visit to a local bar brings her into the orbit of a charming, vulpine-featured nameless stranger who sounds American but is actually played by the French actor Arieh Worthalter. After he saves her from the aggressive attentions of another guy (Ciaran O’Brien), Eve lets down her guard only to find herself kidnapped by a psychotic, sadistic misogynist. Even worse, he’s a psychotic sadistic misogynist with a movie camera, and we all know how evil they are. From there on out, the rest of film is the narrative slap and tickle of escape-recapture as Eve, dressed in red duffel coat, tries to get away. She is in an ancient, soggy forest where there are a few other characters wandering around, ready to fill the roles of grandma and woodsman. But director Vincent Paronnaud, working from a script he co-wrote with Léa Pernollet and David H Pickering, adds a few kinks that divert the story from the tracks laid down by the fairytale origins. Thankfully, we only see glimpses of the footage of tortured women on the hideously believable nemesis’s camera, so ultimately the movie – just about – feels more like a critique of the character’s woman-hating mindset rather than a vehicle for it."
"British illustrator and visual-effects director Gavin Rothery makes his feature debut with this artificial intelligence thriller: a tale of love, death and robotics that has some nicely creepy moments. Set in 2038, it centres on lonely computer scientist George Almore (Divergent’s Theo James), who is holed up in a remote research facility in Japan secretly working on an android version of his wife Jules (Stacy Martin); she has died in a car crash. His prototype, J3 (also played by Martin), is his closest yet to the real thing: a highly advanced humanoid with spookily pale skin who looks like she might be the ghost of his dead wife. Poor old J1 and J2, his earlier, clunkier prototypes: they look on bitterly as the newer, sleeker model gets all George’s attention. The movie opens with sweeping helicopter shots over a snowy forest. Inside the concrete bunker-like facility, Rothery works wonders with a modest budget (he was behind the look of Duncan Jones’s Moon), creating an ungimmicky nearish future that looks a lot like today. When George’s corporate bosses threaten to pull the plug on his research, he hurries to put the finishing touches to J3 – a task involving the contents of a fridge-like archive unit containing his dead wife’s consciousness. George is surrounded by the robot versions of Jules. J1 is boxy, non-verbal and baby-like. J2 is a little more advanced: she can speak, and behaves like a teenager, huffing jealously when George removes her legs to give to J3. In the end, George is playing God – creating a woman not from a rib but electrical components and computer programming. The script’s take on this is romantic: here is a man who’ll do whatever it takes to be reunited with his wife. I couldn’t help finding it a bit more sinister; when J2 misbehaves, George orders her back to her docking station. He is in control. (Anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch.) And the final ta-da revelation felt a bit contrived. Still, Archive is refreshingly non-cerebral – and that’s a compliment. It’s a sci-fi movie that wants to entertain, not deliver a lecture on AI."
"The FBI’s secret campaign of bugging, harassment and defamation against Martin Luther King Jr in the 60s is the subject of this startling but sometimes frustratingly reticent and guarded documentary. This poisonous dirty-tricks campaign continued until King’s assassination in Memphis in 1968, a murder that the bureau was somehow unable to prevent, despite its fanatical round-the-clock surveillance of King as well as its loudly proclaimed dedication to crimefighting. It is now a matter of record that King was a flawed human being and had extramarital sex, but this is an enduringly mysterious part of his public image. (Even Ava DuVernay’s very fine biopic account of King in her 2014 movie Selma, starring David Oyelowo, tactfully romanticises these indiscretions.) The bureau’s audio tapes of alleged meetings in hotel rooms were finally, in 1977, handed over to the National Archives by order of a federal judge but sealed – they cannot be released until 2027 at the earliest. What exactly will they prove? Anything at all? All we have right now are the typescripts of the agents’ highly subjective summary reports. This film from Sam Pollard, based largely on the work of Pulitzer-winning historian David J Garrow, shows how bizarrely toxic and dysfunctional the FBI’s campaign was, an ongoing secret war that involved running informants within the civil rights movement – a painful and even tragic aspect of this history that probably deserves a documentary of its own. Bureau director J Edgar Hoover was incensed by King’s leftist associations, and by his international celebrity, especially after he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1964. After chancing on evidence of his adultery, Hoover hoped to use this to undermine him, and with extraordinary spite circulated the tapes to King’s wife Coretta and even to church leaders and the press, apparently hoping (in vain) that someone would go public. There was even a suggestion that King was present at a rape – and this film, very gingerly indeed, comes close to hinting that there might one day be a #MeToo case to answer. But wait. Where is the proof here? Where is the naming of names? Surely the bureau, with all the dark powers at its command, could have induced one of King’s alleged mistresses to come forward and go public? Apparently not. It is a question that this film does not fully address, although it certainly gives us a queasily detailed picture of Hoover’s pure paranoid nastiness."
"When it comes to TV, Star Wars is sitting very pretty after the enormous success of Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian, a space opera tour de force that has completely re-routed Disney’s vision for its long running saga. All of a sudden, we are due to see multiple enticing spin-offs centred on characters including Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano and Cara Dune, which will eventually culminate in a grand crossover event involving the soft-hearted bounty hunter. Star Wars’ number one rule – that members of the Skywalker clan must be at the heart of all major events – has been Death Starred in less time than you can say: “Great shot kid, that’s one in a million!” But how about the big screen, where Star Wars began, and where – until very recently – it was always imagined the saga’s most vital moments would play out? Here, we find ourselves in a very different place, with the once promising sequel trilogy having ultimately disappointed due to a lack of fresh thinking and an approach to macro-storytelling more chaotic than a box of angry Krykna. This week we got the titbit of news that Marvel supremo Kevin Feige’s long-mooted Star Wars movie is still moving ahead, with Rick & Morty producer Michael Waldron now on board to write the screenplay. Waldron is also writing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and is head writer on the upcoming Disney+ series Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston’s prince of mischief. In short, he’s being trusted with a whole heap of Disney-owned properties. Then there’s Rogue Squadron, the starfighter spin-off that Wonder Woman’s Patty Jenkins was recently tapped to direct, about which little is known other than it looks like another off-centre project. Finally, of the movies still thought to be on Lucasfilm’s current slate, there’s another untitled film from Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi, about which very little is yet known. We do have – back on TV – upcoming shows based on the early lives of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Lando Calrissian. So it is not as if the Skywalker clan and their pals have been completely scrubbed from galactic history. But it would be a shock to see any of these films continuing where the messy and disappointing Rise of Skywalker left off. There was a sense, watching that movie, that Disney-era directors of Star Wars had become trapped by the overwhelming legacy of 40-plus years of space opera shenanigans, to the point that it made more sense to wipe the slate clean and start again with fresh story arcs, free of the terrible pressure inspired by legions of fans watching one’s every move. That’s precisely what Rian Johnson’s proposed new Star Wars trilogy was once intended to do, prior to The Mandalorian changing everything. The Last Jedi film-maker was announced in November 2017 as the director of a new triptych set in an as-yet-undiscovered corner of a galaxy far, far away. But very little has been heard about these movies since October 2019, when Johnson cryptically told Entertainment Tonight he would still be “thrilled if it happens”. That’s a pity, for divisive as The Last Jedi turned out to be, it was still the only film in the sequel trilogy to really try to shake up the saga. The worry is that Johnson’s ideas might no longer sit in the sweet spot where Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy currently sees the saga going, which seems to be centred on either the Mandalorian-verse or fan-friendly nods to supporting characters from the original trilogy. The basic plan seems to be a shift into what we can only refer to as a kind of Hollywood populism: taking anything that has worked in previous Star Wars ventures and expanding on it. This is why Donald Glover is returning as cocky smuggler Calrissian (as pretty much the only character in Solo: A Star Wars Story that fans really took to), and Rogue One’s Diego Luna is back as Cassian Andor for his own Disney+ spin-off. And yet, if the future of Star Wars is to match its glorious past, we need something more than this cosy, reactive creativity. We know nothing about the grand plan for the big screen – will all these new movies exist within the same timeline, so that their major players can be brought together Marvel-style for another grand space opera smackdown? Or will Star Wars remain content to play out in the margins for the time being? For those of us who witnessed the mess Lucasfilm made of the over-ambitious sequel trilogy, such short-term thinking might seem a safer bet than the alternative. And yet at some point the Disney-owned studio will need to find a way to mirror the success of the original trilogy by telling a multiple-episode tale that transports us once again to the whirling, mesmeric cosmic playground of our dreams, to a galaxy that seemed creatively limitless. It doesn’t seem like too much to ask – just don’t bring back Emperor Palpatine yet again or we’ll have to feed you to the krayt dragon."
"“Give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man.” Aristotle might well be pleased that his maxim was the inspiration behind one of the most celebrated TV documentary series of all time – now the legacy of director Michael Apted, who has died at the age of 79. Tony Walker, who appeared in all nine of the award-winning Up series – which charted the lives of 14 British children from 1963 with Seven Up, through to their 60s, with last year’s 63 Up – led tributes to Apted yesterday. The former taxi driver from east London said Apted, who died on Friday, was “like a family member to me. I loved the man dearly and I’m quite devastated at his passing.” Thomas Schlamme, president of the Directors Guild of America, described apted as a “fearless visionary as a director”. He “saw the trajectory of things when others didn’t, and we were all the beneficiaries of his wisdom and lifelong dedication.” He added: “Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn [his] passing.” The producers of the James Bond film franchise paid tribute to his ability to move “effortlessly and successfully between all genres”. In 1999, Apted directed The World Is Not Enough, starring Pierce Brosnan. “He was beloved by all those who worked with him,” tweeted Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. Apted was born in 1941 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, later moving to London with his family. As a teenager he developed a love of cinema, describing watching Ingmar Bergman’s Wild Strawberries as a “road to Damascus moment”. After studying at Cambridge, he joined Granada where he was asked to find children to take part in a one-off documentary. Among the 14 chosen were three boys from a prestigious private school, a boy from a small farm in the Yorkshire Dales, a London boy – Walker – and an east London girl. The show was an early forerunner of reality TV, but focussed on social history and inequality rather than fleeting celebrity and vacuous challenges. It was a success but no further shows were planned. A casual inquiry about the children’s progress led to 14 Up in 1970, this time with Apted as director. He directed all subsequent series. He also worked on Coronation Street in the 1960s, and directed the country music classic Coal Miner’s Daughter, starring Sissy Spacek as singer Loretta Lynn in 1980. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, with Spacek winning best actress. Apted’s movie credits included Gorillas in the Mist, Continental Divide and Critical Condition. His final film was the 2017 thriller Unlocked, starring Orlando Bloom, Michael Douglas and John Malkovich. But the Up series, which won three Baftas, was his most enduring work. It starkly illustrated the differences in life opportunities for children depending on their backgrounds, and charted the personal challenges and traumas faced by participants. Kevin Lygo, managing director of ITV, which broadcast Up, said the series “demonstrated the possibilities of television at its finest in its ambition and its capacity to hold up a mirror to society and engage with and entertain people while enriching our perspective on the human condition. “Michael’s contribution to film and programme-making continues to be felt and he will be sadly missed.” George Jesse Turner, a cameraman who filmed all but the first two series, told the Observer last year: “It was about class in the beginning, but it was not done scientifically, in the way it would be now. It was quite random, simply going to schools in London and Liverpool and the Lake District.” Apted, he said, was “good to work with. When we go out to film, he is never one to say he would like a particular shot. He leaves it to me.” Walker, now 65, whose childhood ambition was to become a jockey, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that, when he was chosen for the series, “I was a sort of street-urchin kid. I was just excited that the cameras were on me at the time, and I never knew what the implications were. “Most of all, Michael gave you that warm feeling. it was like a Catholicism, every time I heard his voice. it was like going to a psychiatrist… [I had] complete trust in him. I’m really sad, I’ve known Michael for all my life really, but for seven years.”"
"Graham Greene famously declared Patricia Highsmith “the poet of apprehension” in the foreword to her 1970 short story collection Eleven. There’s no better way to describe the American writer, whose psychological thrillers meld gliding literary cool with a jangling morass of nerves – a combination, in turn, that film-makers have been trying to translate since the middle of the last century. This coming Tuesday marks the centenary of Highsmith’s birth, and her allure to screenwriters remains undimmed in 2021. A glossy new Ben Affleck-starring film of her novel Deep Water, the first film from Adrian Lyne in 19 years, is scheduled for August, while a TV version of Ripley, starring Andrew Scott as her most adaptable character, is in the pipeline. They’ll join a large and variable roster of Highsmith screen adaptations, ranging from cast-iron classics to mouldering B-movies. It’s no easy subgenre to enter, the bar having been set impossibly high right off the bat – by Alfred Hitchcock, no less, whose perfectly sinuous film of Highsmith’s debut novel, Strangers on a Train (on Amazon Prime), released just a year after the book’s 1950 publication, surely played some part in cementing her own elegantly nasty reputation. A murder-swapping mystery shot in woodcut-sharp monochrome, it still finds room in its skin-tight plotting for hovering waves of queer energy. Hollywood wouldn’t attempt Highsmith again for some time, but in the 1960s, European cinema entered a long-term love affair with her work – beginning with René Clément’s pristinely chic Plein Soleil (Amazon), an adaptation of The Talented Mr Ripley that kicked off an ongoing, international tangle of further Ripley tales and interpretations. Clément’s oblique, sun-bleached introduction to identity-thieving serial killer Tom Ripley (played, never more beautifully, by Alain Delon) has little in common stylistically with Wim Wenders’ Germanic, foggily atmospheric The American Friend (BFI Player), which bathes Ripley’s subterfuge in a coffee-stained 1970s palette, nor with Anthony Minghella’s marvellous The Talented Mr Ripley (1999; Chili), the starry, glamorous classicism of which only briefly disguises its perverse, inky heart. Less celebrated but fascinating, Liliana Cavani’s 2002 film Ripley’s Game (iTunes) revisited the turf of Wenders’ film with less wintry ambience and more slithery, Malkovich-headed madness. That these films are so disparate only feels right: Ripley’s screen legacy is as shape-shifting as he is. Other, non-Ripley European spins on Highsmith are thin on the ground in the streaming realm – or were, until I stumbled upon Church of Film, a Vimeo streaming service set up by a Portland-based repertory cinema project of the same name, dedicated to the rare and the little-screened. There, you can find a Highsmith mini-festival including Claude Chabrol’s slinky nightmare of male obsession The Cry of the Owl (1987); a chilly earlier dip into Deep Water (1981), ideally cast with Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Louis Trintignant; Claude Miller’s unfussy but satisfying This Sweet Sickness (1977), starring a young Gérard Depardieu; and, heading back to Germany, a brisk, stern, Oscar-nominated adaptation of her wrongful-imprisonment story The Glass Cell (1978) that Highsmith herself rather approved of. More recently, as highlighted last month in this very column, Todd Haynes’s swoon-worthy Carol (2015; Amazon Prime), adapted from Highsmith’s one outright lesbian-themed novel, holds the gold standard. It’s not quite rivalled by such honourable attempts as Hossein Amini’s sexy, gorgeously dressed period runaround The Two Faces of January (2014; Google Play), nor by the diverting but low-impact A Kind of Murder (2016; Microsoft), nobly led by Patrick Wilson. But in cinema, even medium Highsmith has it pleasures. Expect many more variations over the next hundred years. My French film festival (Curzon Home Cinema) The annual online festival dedicated to new voices in French cinema is under way until mid-February, and should find a larger audience than usual in lockdown times. This year’s lineup mingles shorts and features, youthful comedies with oddball ghost stories and more: the names are largely unfamiliar, so taking chances and diving in is the way to go here. Working Girls, a study of border-crossing sex workers that Belgium has entered into the Oscar race, merits a second glance. If you want guaranteed greatness, meanwhile, a classic slot has been reserved for Jean Cocteau’s dreamy Orpheus. Archive (Amazon/iTunes, 15) British director Gavin Rothery has a background in graphic design and visual effects, which is plain to see in the gorgeous, steely surfaces of his debut feature, well-led by Theo James as an isolated AI scientist trying to digitally resurrect his wife. There’s much promise here, but the shadow of Ex Machina looms too large over it. Away (iTunes, U) Now available digitally after its cinema release in August, Latvian animator Gints Zilbalodis’s beautiful, thoughtful long-journey-home adventure is a rare children’s film with a healthy dose of surrealism and melancholy: consistently endearing, never too cute. Relic (Signature, 15) Australian writer-director Natalie Erika James’s debut is one of a run of recent films to address the trauma of dementia, though its approach is bracingly original and moving. A sharp, tingling horror film that fashions fading memory as its own kind of haunted house, it walks a tricky line with tact and style to spare."
"Name: Samantha. Age: 64. Not your 64. Hollywood 64. Call it 48. Appearance: No. What do you mean “no”? She’s not appearing. In what? Also, who’s Samantha? O tempora! O mores! How quickly we forget and the cultural discourse moves on. That doesn’t help me. There was a time when it would no more need explaining who “Samantha” was than that the sky is blue or grass is green, such was the fame of Sex and the City and its quartet of fast-living, quick-loving and heavily brunching heroines. Oh, them! Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha! There you go. So, what has happened to her? Please can it be the wiping of her line “Lawrence of my labia” in the second SATC movie from the global digital record? Alas, it is not. Rather, it has been announced that SATC is to return in a series called And Just Like That… It will be 10 half-hour episodes following the gals as they adventure through life, love and more brunches in their 50s – but without Samantha. They think there’s a show without Samantha? There’s not even a decent brunch without Samantha. Where’s all the angst-free sex and non-neurotic light relief going to come from? Whose stupid idea was this? Take it up with Kim Cattrall. The actor declined to return to her role. Don’t tell me – she left a Post-it note on Carrie’s laptop screen saying: “I’m sorry – I can’t. Don’t hate me.” That would – pause to spit on the memory of Berger – have been excellent, but no. She simply refused (apparently repeated) attempts to bring her back to the fold. I assume the long-rumoured animosity between Cattrall and her co-star Sarah Jessica Parker is behind this decision. Or is it just the fear of being made to say something like “Lawrence of my labia” again? Most people are assuming the former, although I’m sure they would have just as much sympathy for the latter. We might, incidentally, do away with the “long-rumoured”, thanks to Cattrall’s 2018 Instagram post, aimed at Parker, about “how cruel you really were then and now”. Yowch. Quite. I suppose she doesn’t need the money, either. Or the work. Cattrall has been probably the busiest of the SATC stars since the show ended, carving out a second-act career primarily in the UK on television and on stage, appearing in some prestigious stuff. I still cannot help but wonder if it’s a doomed venture without her. It’s 2021. It matters not a jot either way. Do say: “I look forward to as complex, fresh, funny and fearless an examination of the sixth decade of womanhood as the original SatC provided for the fourth.” Don’t say: “Sponsored by Vagisil.”"
"Model-turned-actor Ruby Rose (Orange Is the New Black, John Wick: Chapter 2), is utterly mesmerising to look at – with her lush lips, perfectly shaped eyebrows and macho tattoos – but so far the jury is very much out on whether she can act more than merely adequately. This action vehicle doesn’t exactly strengthen the case for her defence, although she moves with impressive grace in the actiony bits when required in closeups that show her character, Ali, whupping bad guys’ asses. Rose is meant to be a former marine, haunted by a botched assignment that cost the lives of a family she was protecting. In the film’s present tense, she takes a job as a doorman – shouldn’t it be “lobby attendant” or even “doorperson”? – at a posh New York City building, only to wander accidentally into a heist that goes very wrong. A strangely immobile-featured Jean Reno offers an almost self-parodying turn as the snobbish yet brutal French mastermind of the criminal gang, who are looking for paintings looted by the Nazis years back. Ali must protect the husband (Rupert Evans), teenage son (Julian Feder) and irritatingly spunky daughter (Kíla Lord Cassidy) from harm – which involves a lot of skulking in the building’s secret passageways, making for a mostly one-set shoot that looks like it saved a lot on budget. Director Ryuhei Kitamura, whose career began with pulpy horror fare, directs with efficiency but a seeming total lack of awareness of how silly this all looks from a distance. There’s little humour or invention to leaven the deadened inertness of the script."
"One thing is certain: vanilla ice cream was eaten. The rest? If only we knew. The year is 1964 and activist Malcolm X, singer-songwriter Sam Cooke and American football player Jim Brown gather in Miami, Florida, to cheer boxer Muhammad Ali – then Cassius Clay – to his first world heavyweight championship. No celebration is planned because he was not expected to win, so the four repair to Malcolm’s hotel room in the segregated African American part of town. Their little-known meeting intrigued writer Kemp Powers when he read about it in Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties, a book about the intersection of civil rights and sport by Mike Marqusee. “It was like a tossed-out paragraph and it’s one of those things where you stop and go back and go, wait, what?” Powers recalls in a Zoom interview. “That sparked a great deal of interest because they were probably four of the most iconic black men to me in my life at that time, so I set about doing a lot of research because I wanted to know how they all met one another.” A journalist at the time, Powers had to endure pre-internet research involving long-distance travel to hunt out-of-print biographies and obscure VHS recordings. Efforts to contact Brown – still alive today – and Ali were unsuccessful. The events of that night remained tantalisingly elusive. What was a curse for a journalist, however, proved a blessing for a playwright. When he switched careers to creative writing, Powers saw the story’s potential in a new light. “It seemed like the very thing that stopped me and stymied me researching the book, which was I couldn’t really figure out too much of what went on in the room, felt like the perfect grist for a stage drama.” The upshot was One Night in Miami, a 2013 stage play that earned an Olivier award nomination when it was directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah at London’s Donmar Warehouse a few years later. Now comes a film version adapted by Powers and starring the British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir as Malcolm, Eli Goree as Clay, Aldis Hodge as Brown and Hamilton’s Leslie Odom Jr as Cooke. Most of the action takes place in the secluded hotel room, with the audience a fly on the wall as conversations zig and zag between the trivial and the tragic. Clay, just 22, cocky, beautiful and barely scratched by the big fight, is about to rattle much of white America by announcing his name change and allegiance to the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist movement that worships Allah. Powers says: “When Ali lit the torch at the Olympics [in 1996], he was at the time the most beloved athlete in the world. But in the 60s a lot of the same people despised him like a demagogue. It’s interesting to see the change in the perception, almost to the point where it seemed like it was prudent for people to forget his politics. “He was vocal about things that people would not be vocal about and that was aggressive for someone so young. He was willing to even sacrifice his own career on behalf of those beliefs.” Malcolm was among the most prominent members of the Nation of Islam and the film conveys in him a mix of charm, ferocity and fragility. Powers says: “Malcolm’s philosophy was incredibly powerful and moving to all of those men. When Sam Cooke was killed in a hotel in Los Angeles in December that year, his red Ferrari was parked outside and inside it they found a bottle of whisky next to a copy of Muhammad Speaks. “That little thing says so much about Malcolm’s philosophy and politics getting into the head of this pop crooner: he had a copy of the Nation of Islam paper in his car on the night he died. Those are the details that give me the grist for this story and the relationships.” But the true heavyweight bout of this film does not involve Clay. Malcolm accuses Cooke of indulging in respectability politics, arguing that he should be using his voice “for the cause” of black liberation instead of entertaining mostly white crowds. “You’re a monkey dancing for an organ grinder to them,” he says. Cooke contends that his success as black businessman, boosting the careers and incomes of other black artists, is a form of liberation in itself. Then Malcolm puts Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind on a record player and pointedly asks how it is that “a white boy from Minnesota speaks more to the struggles of our movement than anything you’ve written in your life”. (Cooke did respond to Dylan’s song with A Change is Gonna Come.) As in many strong plays, the author doesn’t choose sides, or rather takes both sides at the same time. Powers recalls: “The joy of seeing it on stage was watching the audience get behind one philosophy and then seeing them have to go [sharp intake of breath] and turn on a dime when the retort made as much if not more sense. Probably the strongest case of that was the fight between Malcolm and Sam where Sam tells a story about the Rolling Stones and his influence on them. “Often in the stage production, by the end of that, the audience would applaud, ‘Yeah, you told him’. And then Malcolm puts on Blowin’ in the Wind and that same audience would sing along and go, ‘Yeah, what he just said’. It was always hilarious to watch that happen in real time because it really never got old and just goes to show that you can look at things from a slightly different perspective and it seems so obvious.” It is a classic tension: activist versus artist. Does a high-profile performer or sportsperson have an obligation to march, protest and use their megaphone? Or is their work alone enough to known down barriers, show what is possible and embody the change they seek? For Powers the question is personal. “Honestly, the fight between Malcolm and Sam, that’s my internal monologue going on inside my own brain on a regular basis. That’s why if we’re successful, people shouldn’t come away feeling one person is particularly right or wrong because the answer is who is right or wrong is situational. “There are some days where the best way I could bring about change and move things forward is to work within the system. But then there’s other days where the system is so broken it needs to be torn down. There are days that call for us to be more like Malcolm X and days that call for us to be more like Sam Cooke. The reality of it is, for a movement to really bring about change, you need some Malcolm Xs and some Sam Cookes.” Within a year of that night in Miami, both Cooke and Malcolm had been gunned down. Powers’ own life turned on a tragedy. When he was 14, playing with his mother’s gun at home in New York, he accidentally shot and killed his best friend, also 14. The friend’s parents forgave him and did not press charges; he was sentenced to a year of counseling; his criminal record was expunged on his 16th birthday. He wrote about the experience in The Shooting: A Memoir in 2004 before embarking on the research that would form the basis of One Night in Miami, which starts streaming on Amazon on Friday. He is already riding high as co-director and co-writer of Soul, the first Disney Pixar movie to feature a black lead character. “I have two movies out right now that I wrote, and one of them is my Malcolm X and one is my Sam Cooke. This is an independent film, just my pure putting my voice out there. Soul is a Disney Pixar film. I’m working within a system and I would like to think that both are effective in different ways and positive and in different ways. My own life in the art that I put out is an example of how you can do different things.” Commentators have inevitably joined dots between last summer’s racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd and the release of One Night in Miami. Malcolm exhorts: “Our people are literally dying in the streets every day.” But Powers resists glib compartmentalisation. “Nothing that I’ve done has been in reaction to any of this. Ultimately, everything that I’m doing is trying to get to the humanity of these characters and, if anything, reveal some universal truths. I’ve always said that hyper specificity should enable us to see the universality in a lot of these themes and I’ve always hated the fact that the humanity of the black characters is often forgotten.” This play about four men, written by a man, is directed by a woman, Regina King, acclaimed as an actor in films such as If Beale Street Could Talk and TV dramas such as Watchmen. One Night in Miami is the first movie directed by an African American woman shown at the Venice film festival. Powers is delighted. “We all have our blind spots and the play is such a testosterone-driven story and potentially the film could have been,” he says. “Regina’s going to be inquisitive about certain things and make certain decisions where I like to believe a male director would probably make different ones. I think her decisions made the film better. “A great example would be the conversation between Malcolm and his young daughter in the film. That wasn’t in the script initially. Regina, through her network of women, reached out to Malcolm’s oldest daughter. She told her about how her father used to leave hidden notes in books and then call and send them on scavenger hunts. “Regina called me and said, ‘That’s so amazing. I didn’t know that about Malcolm, You should write that in.’ And I wrote it into the script. That was a discovery that I genuinely believe would never have been made with a male director.” Malcolm was assassinated in 1965. Had he lived, he would have turned 95 this year. What would he have made of today’s America, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, from Black Lives Matter to the sacking of the US Capitol by a largely white mob? “Malcolm would probably be like, ‘I told you so,’ just like James Baldwin would be like, ‘I told you so’. A lot of these guys, the reason they feel like prophets is because they literally were saying exactly what was going to happen if we didn’t face up to our own history and these problems. And now it’s all exploding.”"
"Veteran film-maker, screenwriter, theatre and TV director Andrei Konchalovsky’s career is nothing if not eclectic. He co-wrote Tarkovsky’s 1966 classic Andrei Rublev, while his directorial CV ranges from an acclaimed 1970 adaptation of Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya to Venice prize winners The Postman’s White Nights and Paradise, via the Kurosawa-originated white-knuckle thriller Runaway Train and the ill-fated Hollywood buddy cop action film Tango & Cash, from which he was removed mid-shoot. Konchalovsky’s latest (once again feted at Venice) is among his finest work, a harrowing drama set in 1962, in the provincial USSR town of Novocherkassk. Julia Vysotskaya plays Lyudmila (AKA Lyuda), a stalwart party official who served as a battlefield nurse during the second world war, and who retains a nostalgic devotion to Stalinist ideals in the age of Khrushchev. “What am I supposed to believe in if not communism?” Lyuda asks, as her political devotions are challenged in the fallout of a factory strike and protest, to which the army and/or KGB (precise attribution is a thorny issue to be wrestled with) respond with deadly force. As the authorities rush to cover up a state-sponsored atrocity, Lyuda searches for her missing teenage daughter, Svetka (Yulia Burova), for whose life she fears in the wake of terrible violence. The horrifying events in Novocherkassk upon which Dear Comrades! is based (briefly reported in Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago) were not officially acknowledged or investigated for 30 years. Significant, then, that Yuri Bagrayev, who led the investigator’s team in 1992, acted as a consultant on the script, co-written by Konchalovsky and Elena Kiseleva. Meanwhile, Konchalovksy cites films such as Mikhail Kalatozov’s The Cranes Are Flying and Grigori Chukhrai’s Ballad of a Soldier as stylistic reference points for his disturbingly handsome feature, which presents its bleakly crisp black-and-white images in a retro 4x3 frame. Seamlessly blending exterior shots of Novocherkassk with grand sets constructed in Moscow, Konchalovsky creates an utterly convincing air of mounting chaos, brilliantly captured on multiple cameras marshalled by cinematographer Andrey Naydenov. Yet this is no Paul Greengrass-style exercise in frenetic docu-fiction, spurred on by a blur of handheld footage. On the contrary, Naydenov and Konchalovsky opt for an eerie stillness that bizarrely amplifies the film’s impact. Amid the increasingly confused cacophony of unfolding events, the comparative calm of the visuals strikes a horribly threatening chord. Despite the true grit of its historical setting, it’s the personal story of Lyuda’s journey from stoical party hardliner to frantically aggrieved mother that draws the audience in. Vysotskaya is terrific in the central role, capturing both the dreams and disillusionment of a character who strives to repress, rather than express, her emotions, offering a staunch face to the world even when confronting an unimaginable reality. Whether she’s struggling to control her fear in a hospital or in the toilet fending off silent screams, Lyuda’s predicament is made all the more affecting by Vysotskaya’s ability to convey great turmoil with minimal action. Throughout, Konchalovsky juxtaposes wide-ranging events with seemingly insignificant details to dramatic effect. In an early scene, a hole in Svetka’s sock proves no more than a scolding distraction; later it will return in gut-wrenching form, having assumed catastrophic significance. There’s a similar tension at play in the film’s pointed use of song, with patriotic tunes evoked to devastating effect during moments of desperation in a manner that reminded me of Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War. Here, the chilliness of the story is shot through with an unexpected warmth that ensures immediate emotional engagement with distant events.  On Curzon Home Cinema"
"The year is 1971 and David Bowie (Johnny Flynn) is about to embark on his first US tour. Except he only has a tourist visa and so he’s not supposed to perform – convenient, given that the film-makers were unable to secure the rights to any of Bowie’s original music. Its omission is noticeably awkward, with Flynn doing inert versions of tracks Bowie covered, such as Jacques Brel’s My Death, as a clumsy workaround. The narrative centres around a supposedly formative road trip Bowie took with his American publicist Ron Oberman (Marc Maron), suggesting that encounters with Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground helped give birth to Bowie’s alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Troublingly, flashbacks that look at Bowie’s relationship with his half-brother Terry Burns (Derek Moran) imply that the singer’s family history of psychosis also played a significant part in the creation of his onstage persona. A title card indicates that the film is fictionalised and so perhaps shouldn’t be scrutinised for fidelity. Still, the whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie’s maverick spirit."
"With the levels of global hysteria that had built up around the 1999 release of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, it was always destined to disappoint. Initial reviews of the film were actually sort of positive. Critics picked up on the fact that a story about trade taxation was a bit flat, in the same way a date with a bank manager is a bit flat; that the dialogue was ripe; that Jar Jar Binks – the CGI comic relief intended to give the toy companies something to sell – was, unforgivably, not funny. But it had Jedi, spaceship battles, it looked staggering, and the consensus was that it had set up a fresh trilogy fairly ably. Job done, then. Or so it seemed. In the months following the movie’s release, opinion shifted. The wow-factor of the CGI rubbed away, revealing the creaky bones of the film beneath. Questions were asked of the relevance of the CGI aliens’ accents, from the Caribbean patois of Jar Jar and the south-east Asian timbre of the Trade Federation Neimoidians to the slave-owner Watto, who was accused of being equally offensive to both Arabs and Jews. (George Lucas strenuously denied any racial stereotyping, making these elements of the film, at best, bewildering oversights.) Special hatred was reserved for Jar Jar, played by Ahmed Best, and for young Anakin Skywalker (the then nine-year-old Jake Lloyd). In the early days of the internet, both actors were unprepared for the now sadly commonplace levels of abuse the toxic side of fandom can discharge. All of a sudden, The Phantom Menace was loathed. (“I had death threats,” Best said later. “I had people come to me and say, ‘You destroyed my childhood.’”) It would be impossible to stage a defence of the film without at least addressing its faults, which are certainly legion. Jar Jar is the main culprit, but on reflection, he’s little more than an occasional annoyance. He’s goofy. Kids like him. He’s hardly the film’s protagonist. So it’s no great challenge to ignore him. Likewise, the odd “yippee!” aside, Anakin isn’t half as irritating when seen at a cool remove of 22 years after the fact. He’s merely one of an entire ensemble of characters without a single definable personality trait between them. Throughout the film, scenes seem to linger for a few awkward seconds after they should, or cease abruptly without any purpose for their existence having been established. There’s also an uncanny weightlessness to much of the CGI. In fact, from editing to dialogue to plotting, some of the nuts-and-bolts film-making on show is, frankly, baffling. But there is – there is! – a great movie lurking beneath all this. The sheer amount of world-building is remarkable: in one film we are introduced to the whole power structure of the galaxy before The Empire: a Republic, a Senate, a Jedi Council, Coruscant, Naboo and the Gungan city, and we are reintroduced to lawless Outer Rim planets like Tatooine. We see how it all works, and witness actual, jobbing Jedi going about their Forcey business in the inexorable run-up to war. It all whips along at a fair old clip. And the action set pieces are peerless. The pod race is an astounding assault of speed and noise. The land and space sorties are as good as anything the original trilogy managed, if a little inert in their lack of overall stakes. And the lightsaber battles remain the best of any Star Wars film to date. Darth Maul is the coolest baddie Star Wars ever gave us, and the athleticism he brings to the previously stiff duels has yet to be bested. Attack of the Clones features some of the blandest CGI action ever filmed, and a love story so lumpenly delivered it makes you wonder whether George Lucas has actually ever met another human being, let alone courted one. And Revenge of the Sith, while bringing the trilogy to a generally satisfying close, is festooned with the hokiest dialogue this side of The Room. (One climactic scene genuinely features the lines “The Sith are evil!” “From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!”) The Phantom Menace, though, isn’t bad at all. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are excellent. It tells a satisfying, enclosed story. Its action is handled with zip and flair. And, from the death of Qui-Gon to Anakin’s mother giving him up, it even manages to tug on the old heartstrings occasionally. Gungans notwithstanding, it is a very solid Star Wars film. Is it a classic? Goodness, no. But if you haven’t seen it since you left that movie theatre in 1999 with your hands clenched in tight white fists of fury, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. Don’t be afraid. Remember: fear leads to anger …"
"Jane Harper’s best-selling novel The Dry is one of those books that feels written with a feature film adaptation in mind: a genre narrative (crime mystery-thriller) that’s pacey, plot-driven and full of dialogue, with a central location ripe for cinematic imagery. Extensive use of flashbacks is built into its structure, and they’re even presented in italics as if to say, “This is where the cuts and scene changes go”. Director Robert Connolly’s adaptation is a very gripping and polished film, commandingly performed and directed, with an airtight sense of tonal cohesiveness – despite lots of, well, air in the frame, derived from countless mid- and long-shots capturing barren exterior locations in a fictitious Australian outback town. Written by Connolly and Harry Cripps, the script – like Harper’s book – hinges on dual mysteries: one concerning the recent and the other a distant past; both involving deaths that were potentially but not necessarily murders. Binding the threads together is the protagonist Aaron Falk (Eric Bana), a Australian federal police agent who returns to his fictional hometown of Kiewarra following the apparent murder-suicide of his old friend Luke (Martin Dingle Wall), who it seems killed his wife and child before turning the gun on himself. Clipped introductory images show the aftermath of the incident, leading into location-establishing shots of the town presented in dusty yellowish tones that go on to define the film’s aesthetic. By contrast, brief fleeting visions of Melbourne are rendered steely blue, with Bana doing that thing that actors often do when positioned in skyscrapers: staring pensively through the glass at the concrete jungle around them, with a look on his face that screams “I’m in deep thought”. (Is it possible, I wonder, for characters in dramas and thrillers to not be in deep thought when looking out a floor-to-ceiling window? Is it possible they’re just thinking “I’m hungry, is it time for lunch yet?”) Falk hits the road, arriving at Kiewarra for his friend’s funeral, where the priest mentions a “devastating drought” – his eulogy placing The Dry in a context of Australian films that contemplate droughts (others include the 1920 silent film The Breaking of the Drought, John Heyer’s influential 1954 documentary The Back of Beyond, the Disneyified family movie Bushfire Moon and the recent A Sunburnt Christmas). The dryness in Connolly’s film communicates that things could catch fire at any point: literally, given Kiewarra is a danger area for bushfires, but in other ways too – for instance the mental temperature of the locals, many of whom react in hostile ways to Falk’s presence. The deceased man’s parents (Julia Blake and Bruce Spence) are convinced he didn’t do it and ask Falk to investigate. When he does accusations are thrown back at him relating to the unsolved death many years ago of Falk’s teenage friend Ellie (BeBe Bettencourt). Falk was implicated in her passing, with a general consensus among locals that he lied about his whereabouts on the day of her death. This is voiced throughout the film, shading the protagonist in interesting ways, making him a morally murky figure – far from a clearcut hero, and possibly, in relation to those past events, a legitimate suspect. Falk soaks up the stories, attitudes and personalities of the townspeople, among them Sergeant Greg Raco (Keir O’Donnell), Ellie’s belligerent father Mal (William Zappa) and cousin Grant (Matt Nable), an uncooperative farmer (James Frecheville), the school principal (John Polson) and Falk’s longtime friend and sort-of love interest Gretchen (Genevieve O’Reilly). Bana’s performance delivers a morosely convincing take on the “bad cop” trope, his character also fleshed out through visions of a younger version of himself, played by Joe Klocek, in those regular jumps back to the past. Connolly (whose oeuvre also includes Balibo, Paper Planes and the miniseries Barracuda) understands how heavily the novel relies on flashbacks – a very cinematic device – and calibrates the film accordingly. While flashbacks have literary and theatrical precedents, as Maureen Turim explained in her book Flashbacks in Film (which I plucked from my shelf after returning home from the screening), the term emerged only after the advent of cinema, which provided visceral and decisive new ways to, as Turim puts it, “return to a narrative past inserted in a narrative present”. In this narrative past BeBe Bettencourt is very engaging as Ellie: personable but mysterious, relatable but ghost-like, navigating the outback and the schoolyard with a Picnic at Hanging Rock vibe, as a doomed teen with vaguely apparition-like qualities. All the supporting performances are bang on, adding a psychological intensity implied but not dictated by Stefan Duscio’s cinematography; despite the arid settings the real heat comes from the humans. Harper’s book was skilfully constructed, but has a bit of an airport novel vibe, particularly towards the end – which, loaded with the inevitable red herrings and reveals, feels a little like a box-ticking exercise. The film remains rock solid throughout: taut, tough and tense, matching wide-open spaces with uncomfortably close drama. It’s not the environment that terrorises, as it does in classics like Wake in Fright, but the people who move across it – with their hidden agendas, clashing motives and obscured pasts."
"Never Rarely Sometimes Always, writer-director Eliza Hittman’s reticent, watchful film on two 17-year-old girls’ journey across state lines for an abortion, is about as opposite in tone to the incendiary, patronising anti-abortion movement in the US as one can get: understated, devastatingly spare, resonantly attuned to the unsaid, be it pain or the friendship tested by a healthcare system that leaves so many seeking reproductive care on their own. There are numerous ways to go about depicting the obstacle course that is abortion access in the US – HBO Max’s Unpregnant, released this year, routes the same premise into a mostly charming roadtrip buddy comedy – but this is one of the most quietly powerful films of the year in its utter lack of pretension. The Sundance breakout allows the girls’ navigation of the hurdles – legal, financial, logistical, emotional – to compound into a searing portrait of reproductive healthcare in the US that lingers like a yellowing bruise. So much goes unspoken – you don’t hear Autumn (an impressively inward Sidney Flanigan) tell her cousin and best friend Skylar (Talia Ryder) that she is pregnant. Their decision to secretly schlep to New York from their small Pennsylvania town, where state law prohibits abortion for minors without parental permission, is swift, mostly tacit. Nor is there a word on the volatile political environment and legislative assault on abortion access that presaged the film’s release: 12 states enacted a form of abortion ban in 2019, some barring the procedure from as early as six weeks, before many, including Autumn, know they’re pregnant; Alabama attempted to ban abortion outright. Hittman observes this thicket through the eyes of one lost in it: the dismaying search for answers through Google, the condescension and confusion sowed by the town’s “crisis pregnancy centre”, an increasingly common facility that purports to counsel women on reproductive healthcare but in practice advises against “abortion-mindedness”. In New York, the obstacles become more diffuse and surprising – the girls navigate Port Authority, lug suitcases through a subway turnstile, hit up a skeevy yet approachable stranger from the bus for money. Hittman’s vigilant, passive style turns the city into an amorphous, shadowy challenge; midtown is far from unknown to movie-goers, but, under her direction, it becomes unfamiliar and suspect, the girls’ safety a bristling open question. Never Sometimes Rarely Always, which takes its title from the answers on a patient intake form read aloud to Autumn by a Planned Parenthood receptionist in a scene that drew raves at Sundance, is almost too spare in its observance of the girls’ bond and journey. But it’s ambitiously unsettling – I realised in the final scene that I’d kept my jaw clenched the entire movie. Since its release, the reproductive healthcare environment in the US has grown only more hostile with the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, a longtime favourite of the anti-abortion movement, to the supreme court. The court’s strengthened conservative majority will be a generational fight; this film carves out an aching, vivid space in its long shadow, by paying sustained attention to a journey more American women will likely have to take, if they’re able."
"This low-budget British psychological horror first premiered at FrightFest all the way back in 2011 but, due to a rights dispute, is only now receiving a wider release. This long delay hasn’t done The Glass Man much harm, thanks to the continuing relevance of its recessionary backdrop and the growing fame of lead actor Andy Nyman, now well known for the 2017 film adaptation of his stage hit Ghost Stories. A clean-shaven Nyman stars as Martin Pyrite, a man whose apparently comfortable, upper-middle class life is falling apart behind the scenes. He’s been fired from his job for reasons that are unclear, amassed a huge amount of debt, and is keeping all this secret from his genteel wife Julie (Neve Campbell). After a traumatic confrontation with his furious boss (Don Warrington) and an avoidant HR manager (Lorraine Burroughs), Martin spends a day deferring the inevitable, chit-chatting politely with shop assistants, while indulging in little luxuries he can ill-afford. It’s a tense and unsustainable situation, which comes to a head when a mysterious debt collector named Pecco (James Cosmo, by turns menacing and avuncular) arrives at the Pyrites’ front door. This Pecco is offering an impossible choice: pay up immediately or become his accomplice for a wild night of unspecified criminal acts. Cristian Solimeno’s script is witty, well-plotted and goes to darker-than-expected places, but his direction isn’t always up to the necessary task of disguising budgetary constraints. The Glass Man looks cheaply and hurriedly made, which is a particular problem when it comes to depicting the supposedly well-heeled surroundings of characters like Martin and his old school chum-turned-movie star Toby Huxley (played by Solimeno in one pivotal scene). The performances are assured though, leading to an appropriately shattering conclusion."
"Being able to critique yourself is a good skill. Often when a film has been released I’ll ask: “Did I make mistakes?” When I made The Cotton Club in 1984, people were telling me there were too many black people in it and too much tap dancing. I would say: “But it’s a movie about black people tap dancing.” Years later, I realised I had taken out half of the backstory. It was good to go back and fix that. Life is a great screenwriter. My daughter, Sofia, got such awful, unjust criticism for her performance in The Godfather Part III. She was 18 and was being told she’d ruined her father’s film. It was a deep wound for the poor kid. They were gunning for me, but she took the bullets. Now she is a more famous movie director than me. She got the last laugh! I don’t always want to tinker with movies, only when I’ve had annoyances. I’m lucky enough to own some of the movies I’ve made, so why not? Me and The Godfather are done now. There is more that [screenwriter] Mario Puzo wrote that we never used. But I don’t own The Godfather, Paramount owns The Godfather, and they may well decide to make more films. I feel that I’ve made my trilogy. I have other fish to fry. Releasing a movie is like following a sports team. You always sigh. Relief always follows the release of a movie, even if it’s a feeling of despondency. Film is an illusion. The audience just sees a lot of shadows on the screen. The emotion is in the audience. The trick is giving them something that unleashes that and suddenly they endow the images with their emotion. My theory is, when people say a movie is beautiful, I don’t think it can be unless there is beauty in the audience. Little matters more to me than the environment. We have to save the Earth. But the climate issue isn’t strictly about the Earth. Earth is going to survive, it’s been through many ice ages. It’s about the human race. I think we’re worth saving.  We need to see each other as family. You and I are relatives. You go way back to your first grandmother and mine is the same woman. All humans living today are blood relatives, and therefore we must embrace each other and work with each other and lift each other up. Because we’re family. We’re the human family. I want to make a film about the future. You know the Alfred, Lord Tennyson quote? “For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see, saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be…” That’s the movie I want to make. It would be called Megalopolis. I’m 81 so I hope I have enough years to make it. I want to give the children of the world a vision of the future that is beautiful. That is positive. That is a heaven on Earth, because I really think we can have that. Mario Puzo’s The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone is in cinemas now and on Blu-ray from 8 December"
"Gerard Johnson, writer-director of the serial-killer flick Tony and the corrupt-cop thriller Hyena, both set in London, travels 300 miles north to continue his run of blackly comic dramas. Muscle takes place in Newcastle (not that you’d know it from the cockney accents), where Simon (Cavan Clerkin) has a soul-crushing sales job and a moribund relationship. Can his tough new personal trainer Terry (Craig Fairbrass) guide him towards a healthier, more hopeful outlook? Not likely. Every depressing detail, from Simon’s ill-fitting work shirts to the concrete car parks he walks past on his commute, underline what a colourless existence this is. At first, the choice to shoot in black and white seems unnecessary – until Terry embeds himself further, moving into Simon’s spare room and using the house to host extremely grim sex parties. At this point, the absence of realistic flesh tones is revealed as a blessed mercy; the realistic flesh-slapping sounds are horror enough. This is Johnson’s first film without his cousin and collaborator Peter Ferdinando in the starring role, but Muscle’s two leads prove every bit as tuned into his uniquely bleak vision of male interaction. Simon’s workplace makes the Glengarry Glen Ross office look like a soothing yoga retreat and his gym, a place where reps keep pace with racist banter, is just as nightmarish. (Ferdinando does make a cameo, gruffly warning Simon off at reception, like Cerberus guarding the gates of hell.) The excellent characterisation and exquisitely menacing atmosphere ultimately go nowhere, because the plot seems to drop its barbell mid-set and collapse before reaching any kind of conclusion. Still, Muscle’s darkest joke is rather a good one; that such an earnest effort at self-improvement can go so spectacularly awry."
"Cinema audiences were introduced to the terrifying Darth Vader when he appeared through the smoky residue of a laser battle at the beginning of Star Wars (1977). First came the silhouette of his swishing cape and flared helmet, then in closeup the chilling details of his mask – the blank, fly-like eyes, the grille redolent of a mouth with gritted teeth. Ralph McQuarrie drew the original sketches of the character and the costume designer John Mollo made them a frightening reality, but it was the British actor and former weightlifter David Prowse who was inside the suit and behind the mask. Prowse, who has died aged 85, was the one responsible for Vader’s imposing physicality and distinctive sweeping movements, curiously graceful for one so large (the actor stood 6ft 7in and weighed 19st at the time). It was one of the peculiarities of his particular species of fame that while he played arguably the most memorable character in one of the biggest movies of all time, he could still walk down most streets without fear of being recognised. Even his voice would not have given him away: though he spoke Vader’s lines during filming, and was assured by the writer-director George Lucas that he would be required later for the dubbing sessions, it was the American actor James Earl Jones who delivered the character’s dialogue in the finished film. It was decided that Prowse’s thick West Country burr, which earned him the nickname “Darth Farmer” from other cast members, would not have struck quite the right note of menace for an intergalactic villain. Nor did he get to supply Vader’s menacing heavy breathing (that was the sound designer Ben Burtt, using scuba-diving apparatus). And though he performed his share of the light-sabre duels in the first picture, they were mostly handed over to the stunt department for the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). When Vader was unmasked in the latter film, moments before his death, it was the actor Sebastian Shaw, rather than Prowse, whose face was shown, and who got to speak the character’s final words. To add insult to anonymity, this death scene was concealed from Prowse, who claimed not to have been shown script pages during shooting. Such slights were in keeping with his general frustrations about the role. “As Darth Vader, you always feel as if fame and fortune’s coming towards you, but, just as it’s going to hit, it passes you by,” he lamented. “Sometimes in the cinema, I want to yell out: ‘Hey, that’s me up there, that’s me you’re all watching.’” Prowse was born in Bristol and was raised by his mother after his father died when he was five. He was educated at Bristol grammar school and from the age of 12 spent three years wearing a leg-iron because of suspected tuberculosis of the knee, a diagnosis that later proved to be unfounded. At 16 he dedicated himself to bodybuilding and at the age of 25, having worked as a lifeguard and a bouncer, he entered the Mr Universe contest, during which a judge told him he would never win because of his “ugly feet”. He switched to competitive weightlifting and went on to be British heavyweight champion for three consecutive years from 1962. While selling equipment in a gym in the early 1960s, he was approached by an acting agent who invited him to play the part of Death in Don’t Let Summer Come at the Mermaid theatre in London. From there, he moved on to commercials, television series and eventually films. He made an uncredited appearance in the star-studded James Bond comedy Casino Royale (1967), as Frankenstein’s monster, later reprising the role in a more orthodox context in The Horror of Frankenstein (1970) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974). He opened his first gymnasium in south London in 1969; his clients included Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath. He also became a fitness consultant at Harrod’s while keeping his hand in with acting. His most notable pre-Star Wars credit was Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, in which he was the bodyguard to the writer played by Patrick Magee. He starred in comedies including Carry On Henry (also 1971) and Terry Gilliam’s Jabberwocky (1977), and appeared with his future Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher in her mother Debbie Reynolds’s show at the London Palladium in 1974. Shortly before Lucas’s movie started shooting in 1976, Prowse began his 14-year stint as the superhero-like Green Cross Man in a popular series of road safety commercials. His voice was dubbed by another actor for the first two advertisements, but reinstated thereafter. The Sunday Times reported in 1978 that the first two years of Prowse’s tenure helped bring about a 5% reduction in road safety accidents in the 4-11 age group. As part of his contract with the Department of Transport, he toured schools as the Green Cross Man. After playing Vader, Prowse’s acting roles were few and far between. He was turned down for the lead in Superman The Movie (1978), but gave the successful candidate, Christopher Reeve, physical training “I spent six weeks trying to make him look like me,” Prowse said. He performed the same function for Cary Elwes in preparation for The Princess Bride (1987). A hip injury in 1989, as well as arthritis and various health issues relating to his ankle and spine, put Prowse out of action. In 2000, he contracted a blood disease that caused temporary paralysis in his arms. Still he lobbied at every opportunity to be considered for any future Star Wars films, and continued to mourn what he regarded as his slapdash treatment on the earlier instalments. By 2005, he told Empire magazine that he was doing “nothing else” except being paid to fly all over the world attending Star Wars conventions, which made it all the more galling for him when in 2010 he alleged that he had been banned from any future events. “People ask what went wrong with George Lucas but to be honest, I still don’t really know,” he said. “The only thing I’ve been told is I’ve burned too many bridges between Lucasfilm and myself.” One theory is that the director suspected Prowse of leaking in advance of the release of The Empire Strikes Back the revelation that Vader was the father of the film’s hero, Luke Skywalker. Though never formerly politically outspoken, Prowse publicly declared his support in 2009 for Ukip, the UK Independence party. Asked in 2014 what he would do if he ruled the galaxy, he said he would “reintroduce capital punishment”. He briefly managed the Welsh musician Jayce Lewis and wrote an autobiography, Straight from the Force’s Mouth (2016), as well as recording an audiobook version that ran for 540 minutes. In 1963 he married Norma Scammell. She survives him, along with their three children, Steve, James and Rachel."
"First-time feature director Ibrahim Miiro hits the ground running with this urban drama set in London; for the first half-hour, at least, it’s a film bursting with energy and adrenaline. Hannah Laresa Smith plays homeless teenager Ally who has recently run away from foster care. In the early scenes showing her chaotic street life, the camera pushes right in, claustrophobically close. Ally sleeps in the cold under a bridge by a canal and washes in public toilets. She earns a few quid as a courier for drug dealer Carol (Sallyann Fellowes), a nasty bully who fakes a mum-like warmth. I watched with an icy sense of dread, my hands clammy. Ally has no idea how at risk she is. A confrontation finally spirals her situation out of control. After being violently attacked, Ally runs off in a panic, leaving behind Carol’s money and drugs. And it’s here the movie disappointingly shifts into a crime opera, with the arrival of drugs kingpin Ilyas (played by Lithuanian actor Gediminas Adomaitis), another black-suited, taciturn gangster in the Euro-baddie tradition. Carol darkly whispers that he’s got links to a human trafficking gang up north. Ilyas gives Carol 24 hours to find the cash – or Ally. Terrified, Ally keeps out of sight. Her mate Josie, a few years older and hardened by life on the streets, suggests prostitution. The only person genuinely looking out for Ally is a lonely elderly man, Frank, (Mike Kinsey), who befriended her, and now turns detective to find her. The story increasingly feels unconvincing and contrived, and the ending is a bit sentimental. But Miiro directs with real confidence; he’s a name to watch."
"There’s something deliciously subversive about the backstory to this offbeat horror film, which was made in Canada. Director Justin G Dyck and screenwriter Keith Cooper have collaborated on a long list of treacly, holiday-themed, made-for-TV movies with titles such as A Very Country Christmas, Christmas With a View and A Christmas Village. Anything for Jackson, however, is a riotously gory, impish inversion of all things yuletide, in that it stars sweet-featured elderly character actors Sheila McCarthy and Julian Richings as grieving grandparents Audrey and Henry Walsh, who kidnap pregnant Shannon Becker (Konstantina Mantelos) in order to perform a satanic ritual on her. It’s as if Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, the little old couple who lived next door in Rosemary’s Baby, got to be the stars of their own movie. Audrey and Henry’s goal is to channel the ghost of their dead grandson, Jackson, into Becker’s unborn child. But deals with the devil have a way of going wrong – or throwing up nasty consequences in the fine print, such as demons and ghosts with murderous instincts of their own. Plus, their main adviser on matters demonological is a bitter “incel” type (Josh Cruddas) who lives with his mother and is prone to bitching about the leadership at their satanic church, an outfit quietly run out of the local community centre where members bring home-baked goods for breaktime. Dyck and Cooper turn this almost comical premise into an interesting work that treads the line between genres with agility. There’s a satirical streak, sure, but the devil’s forked tongue stays mostly in the film’s cheek, and in many ways it’s also a conventional horror pic. That means the usual quota of jump-scares and visual effects-created scary monsters, such as a contortionist ghost with a plastic bag tied over his head or a mad woman who keeps flossing the teeth, one by one, right out of her mouth. At the same time, there’s a streak of affecting drama that emanates from the main pair, a well-to-do couple scarred by tragedy who ultimately want to do something good but by any means necessary. Altogether, it’s a richer devil’s brew than you would expect, crisply edited and moodily shot – even if the last act doesn’t quite hit the spot."
"Just when you thought you were out … he pulls you back in. Francis Ford Coppola has presided over different editorial remixes of Apocalypse Now, and now he’s done the same with his little-loved The Godfather Part III from 1990: with new edits and a new title. He and co-writer Mario Puzo have removed the “threequel” stigma by renaming it The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, but, at 158 minutes (compared with the 175 and 202 minutes of the other two films), it’s hardly short enough to be a coda and doesn’t function structurally as such. Rightly or wrongly, it is exactly what the original title declared it to be: part three, the third act in the life of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who in his 60s tries to go into respectable business by bailing out the Vatican’s financially embarrassed bank. He thereby becomes a businessman of enormous power, somewhere between Faustus and Mephistopheles, yet also a vulnerable target for shadowy conspirators. There are a number of little changes to the original, the most important being at the very end, which might baffle those wondering about that new title. This change could imply that his real death was the emotional or spiritual death that happened on the steps of the opera house in Palermo, or even much earlier than that. Michael is drawn back into mob violence ostensibly because he gets involved in a quarrel between Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), the boorish boss of the casino he sold off, and his nephew Vincent Corleone (Andy Garcia), son of the late Sonny, played in G1 by James Caan. Naturally, Michael sides with Vincent, with awful results. But it isn’t just this. Michael realises that the supposedly legitimate world of business and politics he has been yearning for all his life is just as brutal as the mob, and Michael comes to play a key role in cheekily fictionalised versions of two real events: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the 1982 murder of the Vatican-connected banker Roberto Calvi. This film was derided at the time as a shark-jumping mess: choppy, convoluted, anti-climactic and with an underwhelming performance from the director’s daughter, Sofia Coppola, as Michael’s daughter Mary. It undoubtedly feels stuffy compared with Scorsese’s GoodFellas, which came out the same year and was much more vibrant than Coppola’s rather stately and self-consciously Shakespearian tale. (Amusingly, Scorsese’s mother Catherine had a cameo in both films.) Well, some critical revisionism is in order. Admittedly many scenes in this film are obvious retreads of key scenes from part one: the initial party set piece in which Michael receives visitors in his sanctum, and the final sequence, in which cold-blooded hits are intercut with a public event. But they are intended as “mirroring” events, full of dramatic irony and ill omen. This film has ambition and reach: maybe the conspiracy-theory stuff from the real world feels forced, but it gives a kind of surreal vividness to Michael’s endgame. His audacious “confession” scene with the cardinal who will become Pope John Paul I is outrageous in a way, but also melodramatically inspired. And Sofia Coppola isn’t as bad as all that. She brings a mopey callow yearning, as well as unresolved sexual tension to her forbidden love affair with her cousin Vincent. (And of course has proved herself as a director many times over since then.) I’m not sure how much, if anything, Coppola’s re-edit does for the film, but it’s worth a watch."
"Paul Greengrass’s latest film is based on the western novel by Paulette Jiles, about a girl returning to her family in 1860s Texas after being kidnapped by the Kiowa tribe. Helena Zengel plays the girl, Johanna, and Tom Hanks plays the man who must look after her: Captain Kidd, an ex-army veteran who makes a living reading aloud from newspapers to illiterate townsfolk, and who is now in the middle of a very big news story.   Released in the UK on 1 January Pitch Perfect producer Kay Cannon now directs this new live-action reboot of Cinderella, with James Corden as co-writer. The Grammy-nominated singing star Camila Cabello takes the leading role of Cinders, yearning for her prince. Idina Menzel plays the evil stepmother, Britain’s Nicholas Galitzine is the handsome Prince Robert, and Broadway star Billy Porter is Fab G, the genderqueer Fairy Godparent. (There is no word yet on Buttons, but surely Christopher Biggins is available.)   5 February This much-liked Australian romcom gives us the story of Ellie, a high-school high-flyer who aces her academic work but can’t figure out a way to talk to Abbie, the girl with whom she’s hopelessly in love – or ask her to the prom. Then a miracle happens: her dead lesbian aunt Tara returns as fairy godmother to offer plain-speaking advice from beyond the grave, but she hasn’t dated since the 1980s, and Gen Z dating norms aren’t easy for her to grasp.   5 February David Chase has co-written a prequel movie to his classic HBO series The Sopranos, featuring Michael Gandolfini as the young Tony Soprano – Michael being the son of the late James Gandolfini who played the New Jersey crime boss when the show was in its pomp. Corey Stoll plays the young Uncle Junior and Billy Magnussen is the young Paulie Walnuts. But who will be playing the ruthless young matriarch Livia Soprano?   12 February Lee Daniels’ new biopic of the great jazz singer Billie Holiday, played here by Andra Day, probes the way she was harassed by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, especially after she released her searing song Strange Fruit, about racism and the lynching of black men. The drama takes as its jumping-off point the sensational assertion from the British journalist Johann Hari that Holiday had an affair with a black undercover officer called Jimmy Fletcher, who had been assigned to arrest her. (Previous studies had suggested there was nothing more than a brief friendship.) Fletcher is here played by Moonlight’s Trevante Rhodes.   12 March As an actor, Emerald Fennell was the sensual and worldly Camilla Parker Bowles in The Crown, breaking the heart of Josh O’Connor’s Prince Charles. Now as a writer-director, she has created one of the most talked about films of the year – an icily subversive rape-revenge parable. Carey Mulligan plays Cassie, who likes to fake blacking-out drunk behaviour on the weekends, just to see how far her nice-guy dates will go with someone who they think can’t resist and won’t remember in the morning. It’s a challenging and provocative movie, and Mulligan is being tipped for silverware greatness.   12 February Frances McDormand delivers the performance of her career in what may well be the film of the year, from director Chloé Zhao. Nomadland is a docu-fictional movie about the American phenomenon of “nomads” – the sixtysomethings whose financial security and chances of retirement were shattered by the 2008 crash and who now roam the country in campervans looking for seasonal work. McDormand plays a fictional “nomad” and Zhao stages wonderfully conceived encounters with the real thing, while on the road. Moving, insightful, superb.   19 February A true-life legal thriller that may be a rival to Aaron Sorkin’s confrontation classic A Few Good Men. Kevin Macdonald directs the drama, which is based on the bestselling memoir Guantánamo Diary by Mohamedou Ould Slahi , who was imprisoned in Guantántamo Bay for over 10 years without trial. Tahar Rahim plays Slahi himself and Jodie Foster and Shailene Woodley are his defence lawyers Nancy Hollander and Teri Duncan, and Benedict Cumberbatch plays the ferocious prosecutor Stu Couch who comes to have qualms about evidence acquired under torture.   25 February Oscar-winning documentary-maker Bryan Fogel takes on the grisly assassination of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi Arabian journalist was the reformist critic of the government who in 2018 entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain papers relating to his marriage, but was murdered and dismembered so that his corpse could be discreetly removed. The Saudis’ nervous allies, including the UK, are reluctant to make a fuss about this important Middle East ally and arms purchaser. The film is reputed to have sensational new audio-tape evidence about who ordered the murder.   5 March Anthony Hopkins gives a much-acclaimed performance in this film, based on the original French stage play by Florian Zeller, and now directed by Zeller with a new English screenplay by Christopher Hampton. Hopkins plays an old man who is descending into dementia – to the horror of his daughter and carer, played by Olivia Colman. The story is told from his bewildered and terrified viewpoint, as people and places morph into each other as if in a nightmare.   12 March The 007 brand has been a bit tarnished lately, with the new James Bond movie abruptly pulled from the cinema schedules in the autumn (for the second time) and many cinemas blaming this letdown on their temporary closure. At any rate, here it is: Daniel Craig is hanging up his tux and sky-blue swimming briefs and bowing out of the 007 role with his latest Bond thriller, which has been delayed twice due to the lockdown. Veteran Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have teamed up with Fleabag legend Phoebe Waller-Bridge for what is purportedly a funnier, savvier Bond for Craig’s last hurrah.   2 April Those people who still associate John Krasinski with the fresh-faced Jim Halpert from the American TV version of The Office perhaps need to catch-up with the brilliant sci-fi futurist nightmare A Quiet Place from 2018, for which Krasinki was co-writer, director and star. In the story of a world menaced by blind alien monsters with super-strength hearing, Krasinski played opposite his wife Emily Blunt. Now he is back with the sequel.   23 April One of Britain’s brightest movie talents, Edgar Wright, returns with a psychological London horror with a time-travel theme, avowedly in the classic style of Nic Roeg. Set both in the present and in the glamorous and yet seedy world of swinging 60s London, it’s co-written with smart new talent Krysty Wilson-Cairns (who also co-scripted 1917 with Sam Mendes). Anya Taylor-Joy stars, and there’s some connoisseur-60s casting with the appearances of Terence Stamp and Rita Tushingham. Iconic, but now sadly departed stars Diana Rigg and Margaret Nolan gave their final performances in this film.   23 April Cate Shortland, who made the great Australian film Somersault, now directs this big-ticket superhero movie, in which Black Widow from Avengers takes centre stage in the 24th MCU film, a debut for which Marvel fans have long been yearning. Scarlett Johansson returns as the former FSB agent Black Widow (that is Natasha Romanoff), after the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which she is isolated and must fight to survive. The film brings in Florence Pugh as an ally of Romanoff’s and also Rachel Weisz is Melina Vostokoff, her handler from the world of espionage.   7 May Lin-Manuel Miranda is the composer and lyricist who became a titan of American musical theatre with his Broadway smash Hamilton. Now he is back with 11 new songs, in this bold new animated tale on a Latinx theme, about a capuchin monkey who has a passion for music and a thirst for adventure, and makes an exciting and dangerous journey from Havana to Miami to fulfil his dream.   4 June Whoever it is you were gonna call, you’d better call ’em again. This new Ghostbusters is a conventional threequel, effectively a follow-up to Ghostbusters 2 (and so standing apart from the recent gender-switch reboot). Thirty years on from the original story, two children and their single mom discover their link to the original ghostbusting heroes. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver reprise their roles; sadly, Harold Ramis died in 2014.   11 June Still speedy, still needy, still eerily boyish, Captain Pete “Maverick” Mitchell returns in this present-day sequel to Top Gun. The legendary US navy pilot played by Tom Cruise could be piloting a desk by now, but he prefers to be a badass warrior of the skies. Jennifer Connelly is now Tom’s love interest, a mere nine years his junior. Miles Teller plays Rooster Bradshaw, the son of Goose Bradshaw from the first film, who was played by Anthony Edwards. Could it be that this film will finally include the homoeroticism famously imagined by Top Gun superfans Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino? Probably not.   9 July It’s over 20 years since M Night Shyamalan bowled us over with The Sixth Sense, and despite some very rocky moments in his career – and supremely dodgy films such as Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender – he has never quite vanished from the scene. And now he is back with a high-concept supernatural mystery thriller of the sort he loves, based on the graphic novel Sandcastle, by Pierre Oscar Lévy. A bunch of tourists happen on a staggeringly beautiful seaside cove, but somehow can’t find their way out, and make an awful discovery: they are ageing a few years every half an hour.   23 July Here is the movie version of the British TV comedy People Just Do Nothing, starring Allan Mustafa, Asim Chaudhry and Hugo Chegwin, all about the radical pirate radio station in Brentford, transmitting drum and bass and garage – the legendary Kurupt FM, run by MC Grindah and DJ Beats. Now, after a period of creative stagnancy, the main players of Kurupt FM are astounded to hear that some of their music has been on a popular Japanese TV gameshow – so our heroes travel to Japan to get the money and acclaim that is rightfully theirs.   13 August Veteran British director Adrian Lyne returns to the movies after a long absence with a psychologically tense erotic thriller – perhaps something to compare with his 80s masterpiece Fatal Attraction – starring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas. Deep Water is based on the 1957 novel by Patricia Highsmith. A man trapped in a loveless open marriage has reluctantly agreed that his wife can have lovers as long as she does not desert the family home. When one of these lovers is found murdered, the husband thinks it would be a good idea to put around the rumour that he killed this man, in order to deter his wife from straying any more.   13 August Peter Jackson’s Beatles documentary, about the making of their final album, Let It Be, has the blessing of the surviving members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and it has been conceived as a creative riposte, of sorts, to the Michael Lindsay-Hogg film that showed rancour and acrimony. This will re-edit the footage and show new material to show the good feeling that McCartney and Starr say they remember. More startlingly, Jackson will reportedly use the transformative digital techniques that he applied to his first world war film They Shall Not Grow Old.   27 August Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman … Jordan Peele (the author of Get Out) has co-written this ingenious new film in the Candyman horror franchise – originally based on the Clive Barker short story, from 1984; the director and co-writer is Nia DaCosta. The grim Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago, where the Candyman would appear to anyone who repeated his name five times in the mirror, is now all flashy, upscale apartments and condominiums. But the Candyman is not to be gentrified out of existence as easily as that.   27 August This is an epic new adaptation of the classic SF novel by Frank Herbert from 1965 – the first of two projected movies that will cover only the first half of the book. It takes some chutzpah to take on a movie adaptation last attempted by David Lynch, but this is what Denis Villeneuve has done – having already shown he has the sci-fi chops with Arrival and Blade Runner. Oscar Isaac, Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star.   1 October The intriguing screenwriting team of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Nicole Holofcener take on a potent true story from medieval France that has assumed the potency of Arthurian myth – and Ridley Scott directs. Damon plays the knight, Sir Jean De Carrouges, who has accused his friend Sir Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) of raping his wife Marguerite (Jodie Comer). The king, Charles VI, played by Affleck, decrees that there is only one way to settle this – a trial by combat between the two men, on the understanding that God will create the just outcome. If De Carrouges loses, Marguerite will be burned at the stake for her false accusation. Criminal justice was exciting in those days.   15 October Chloé Zhao makes her second appearance on this list, as the film-maker lauded for her amazing docu-realist masterpiece Nomadland. This couldn’t be more different. It’s a Marvel superhero film about a mighty race of aliens who have been living on Earth for millennia and come out of shadowy hiding to battle against mankind’s enemy, the Deviants. The project, unveiled at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, features Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and Gemma Chan.   5 November With the politics of identity and ethnicity such a hot-button issue, Steven Spielberg takes on this ageless classic, updated from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, with its immortal Leonard Bernstein score – but will it follow last year’s Broadway revival in dropping the song I Feel Pretty, a move some suspected was driven by contemporary squeamishness about body fascism? Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler are Tony and Maria, the star-crossed lovers, and Rita Moreno, the iconic star of the original film returns in a supporting role.   10 December Once again, Wes Anderson brings his Olympic-level drollery and quirk in a style now endlessly spoofed by YouTube admirers (but never quite nailed). As with The Grand Budapest Hotel (inspired by Stefan Zweig), Anderson gives us an upscale literary-tourist vision of Europe – this time inspired by New Yorker correspondents such as SN Behrman and Mavis Gallant – in which an American paper’s French bureau enterprisingly reports on the 1968 protests in the city of Ennui-sur-Blasé. Stars Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and many more.  Date TBC Lovely, heartfelt performances from Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth carry this intimate movie from actor-turned-director Harry Macqueen. They play Tusker and Sam, a couple in middle age who face their greatest challenge after Tusker is diagnosed with early-onset dementia. They go on a camper-van holiday to the north of England to visit Sam’s sister and come to terms with the fact that this may be their last holiday together.  Date TBC The open secret of Victorian sexuality is rediscovered by director Francis Lee in his tremendous drama of forbidden love in 1840s Lyme Regis. Kate Winslet plays the real-life 19th-century palaeontologist Mary Anning, whose pioneering ideas and extraordinary fossil finds were appropriated without acknowledgment by the male scientific establishment. Saoirse Ronan plays Charlotte Murchison, a young woman whose friendship with Anning soon becomes much more.  Date TBC The hit UK stage musical now gets a film version, with Max Harwood playing Jamie, and theatre director Jonathan Butterell making his feature film debut. Jamie is a lonely 16-year-old at school, a young gay man who is bullied by the homophobes in class and patronised by dull teachers who bristle with uncomprehending distaste at his dreams of being a drag queen, and tell him to get a boring, proper job. The movie shows Jamie battling to make it.  Date TBC  All release dates are UK and are subject to change."
"“County lines” is slang for a new UK crime phenomenon that is basically as old as the hills: the targeting of vulnerable teenagers from the big city, generally ones absent from school and without stable family support, and using them to traffic drugs out to the provinces via solo train journeys – an invisibly discreet method – and then traffic the resulting cash back. It’s about drug mules, those age-old human beasts of burden, and about using children as the disposable footsoldiers of crime, which Dickens would have recognised. Henry Blake’s debut movie about all this, developed from a short made in 2017, is focused, compassionate and well-acted: a shocking social-realist drama-thriller. The victim-hero is 14-year-old Tyler (played by Conrad Khan) who lives at home with his mum Toni (Ashley Madekwe) and kid sister. He’s been excluded from school for fighting (Toni was once in trouble while a pupil at the same school) and crucially emboldened to do this by an earlier bullying incident in a chicken shop, when a total stranger stepped in to help him. This was a guy in his early 20s: tough, confident, kindly, clearly the kind of role model that young Tyler hasn’t encountered since his dad ran out on the family. He is Simon, coolly played by Harris Dickinson, who starts giving Tyler lifts in his nice car, letting Tyler see his expensive watch, taking him out for meals and letting him talk about his worries. Soon, desperately overworked Toni loses her cleaning job and Simon tells Tyler he must step up to his responsibilities and be a man: which is to say, Tyler must run drugs down to Canvey Island in Essex on the train and help sell them in a world of Hogarthian violence and squalor. The first “meal” scene with Tyler and Simon is very interesting: it takes place in another down-at-heel burger place. (Later, Blake will show Tyler’s wonderment and intimidation in seeing Simon in a much classier restaurant with his partner and child – and Simon’s intense irritation at this low-ranking subordinate presuming to contact him there.) Simon is grooming Tyler, and allowing him to experience, perhaps for the first time in his life, the pleasure of being listened to and treated with kindness. But the film shows how the conversation is provisional, exploratory. Simon is sizing Tyler up: assessing his suitability for employment. How much responsibility might this kid be given, if any? Interestingly, that first intervention in the chicken shop was not necessarily part of a master plan. Simon doesn’t even remember Tyler when he offers his shy thanks the next day. Getting involved in potentially violent situations with school-age kids that he’s confident of beating in a fight is something that Simon does almost without thinking. But, like career criminals, he can see how to create and enforce the bonds of loyalty, and of course his friendly mask is soon to be removed. County Lines is a film that doesn’t run along the usual rails of a gangster thriller. You might, for example, expect to see cycle-of-abuse evidence, signs of Simon’s own erstwhile innocence or victimhood, and then indications of how Tyler is coming of age in this nauseous business: becoming more ruthless and more professional, or maybe even superseding his boss. Blake doesn’t do that, although he certainly shows how Tyler is becoming more indoctrinated into the world of brutality, a trainee abuser who assaults his mum. Instead, County Lines shows us something realer and more banal.  For all the violence and the machismo, it is the woman who finally has to clean up the mess. Tyler’s mum must look after him, take him to hospital and take the measures necessary to settle his outstanding problems with Simon, who has naturally revealed himself to be the bully-in-chief. County Lines has excellent performances from Khan, Madekwe and Dickinson, and also Anthony Adjekum as Tyler’s teacher Laurence, one of the few people who speaks to him with genuine sympathy."
"Here’s an undemanding lighthearted comedy from Switzerland loosely inspired by a real-life spying scandal in the late 1980s, when it emerged that Swiss police had amassed secret files on 900,000 people suspected of dodgy political views. (Handing out leftwing leaflets was enough to make you a target for surveillance.) It’s a movie made for a home audience, I suspect; if you’re unfamiliar with the history, some of the events here feel convoluted and hard to follow. Though anyone old enough to remember the era will recognise the high-street golfing jumpers and creased nylon slacks in a nothingy shade of “C&A greige”. The setting is Zurich in 1989, where Viktor Schuler (Philippe Graber), a good-natured if none-too-bright detective, is ordered to go undercover at a radical lefty theatre. He shaves off his cop moustache, buys a leather jacket and volunteers his services as an extra in Twelfth Night. The trouble is that he struggles to uncover any useful intelligence. The actors turn out to be a bunch of luvvies with fuzzily vague politics. The play’s firebrand activist director is suspected of working for the Russians, but increasingly he looks like your standard issue bourgeois misogynist bully: a man who enjoys the sound of his own voice and humiliates a female actor when she refuses to perform naked. It’s a film with plenty of shots of Schuler hiding behind doors and comically getting the wrong end of the stick. (He is disappointed to discover a Russian that the actors keep banging on about – Stanislavski – turns out not to be a Moscow intermediary.) Inevitably he begins to question the mission and even the ethics of mass surveillance. Has the theatre opened his eyes or brainwashed him? It’s a harmless enough movie for the most part, though Schuler’s relationship with the play’s leading lady – while he is undercover, deceiving her as to his identity – feels a bit iffy after the UK’s more recent “spy cops” scandal."
"Warner Brothers has announced that their 2021 slate of releases, including high-profile films such as Dune and The Matrix 4, will premiere on the streaming platform HBO Max. The new hybrid release model will see 17 films launch online for US subscribers at the same time as they are released in cinemas, where available. They will then be available to watch for a month for no extra charge. The films will still receive a standard theatrical release internationally. “We’re living in unprecedented times which call for creative solutions,” said Jason Kilar, CEO of WarnerMedia. “After considering all available options and the projected state of moviegoing throughout 2021, we came to the conclusion that this was the best way for WarnerMedia’s motion picture business to navigate the next 12 months.” Warner’s lineup features major big-budget titles such as Godzilla vs Kong, James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, a long-awaited fourth Matrix film, sequels to Space Jam and The Conjuring and Denis Villeneuve’s new interpretation of Dune, which carries with it a reported budget of $200m. Also included is a string of awards-aiming fare including King Richard which stars Will Smith as the father to Venus and Serena Williams and In the Heights, an adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical. It’s been described as “a temporary plan” but will be a much-needed boost for HBO Max which launched earlier this year and has been struggling to attract subscribers ever since. Fewer than 9 million people have signed up while about 28 million existing HBO users haven’t activated their accounts, which come free with current plans. The news follows a difficult year for the studio, heavily affected by cinema closures as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Warners had tried to revive the box office with the release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet but the sci-fi thriller saw underwhelming returns in the US with less than $60m in the bank. The studio then decided to release tentpole sequel Wonder Woman 1984 on HBO Max on Christmas Day as well as in cinemas where available. It’s estimated that the film will need to make 40% more than Tenet’s global total to break even. “At some point you have to choose to share any love and joy you have to give, over everything else,” Wonder Woman 1984 director Patty Jenkins said at the time. Rival studio Universal recently reached agreements with a number of US exhibitors to show their films while allowing a 17-day window before a digital release. While some cinemas across the US remain open, the two main markets – Los Angeles and New York – have yet to announce when they will follow suit with infection rates rising in both cities. Global box office is set to fall by an estimated 66% in 2020."
"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones’s Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There’s the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles – swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be. It’s impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney’s 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks. Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor’s career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland’s closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston. The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams’s Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.  Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there’s winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom – Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor’s preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor’s self-centered “helpfulness” feels earned. But Godmothered’s tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother’s overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes. The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there’s one – co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) – within reach), but its shoehorned revelation – that true loves comes in many forms – is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious – unrealistic in the parts where it’s trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor’s misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle. Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it’s a bumpy, underwhelming ride – not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks."
"There’s an awful lot going on in this new movie from Steven Soderbergh. The title is appropriate: it’s garrulous, elegant, bristling with classy performances from an A-list cast, and Deborah Eisenberg’s screenplay has a theatrical intimacy. But it’s loosely and waywardly plotted, perhaps as a result of having gone through many drafts, though maybe not enough. It is slightly unfocused and uncertain as to where its emotional centre really lies – though there is a charm and a big dramatic finale. The story is mostly set (and economically filmed, by Soderbergh himself) on a luxury liner, , the Queen Mary 2, crossing from New York to Southampton. Meryl Streep plays Alice Hughes, a renowned novelist whose reputation and sales rely chiefly on a sensational early book about the collapse of a woman’s marriage. Her agent (Gemma Chan) takes her out for lunch and has to charm her cantankerous client into going to London to accept a prestigious award; she is also nervous about the fact that Alice still hasn’t delivered her latest manuscript but excited at the rumours that it could be a sequel to the sensational early book. Alice agrees to the trip but very grandly declares that she cannot fly, so her cowed agent suggests the ocean liner alternative, with Alice giving a lecture to get a freebie. Alice agrees, but only if she also gets tickets for three other people: her adored nephew (Lucas Hedges) and her two best friends from college, Susan (Dianne Wiest), a high-flying lawyer, and Roberta (Candice Bergen), who sells lingerie in a department store. Things get tense when it becomes clear Roberta is convinced that Alice’s great first book was actually about her, and that the book destroyed her life. Moreover, Alice’s agent has also sneaked on board, to keep an eye on her author – and Alice’s nephew is beginning to fall in love with her. In some ways, Let Them All Talk is a very agreeable throwback to the cinema’s antique world of love-boat romance on luxury ocean liners – the world of An Affair to Remember, Now, Voyager, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and even James Cameron’s Titanic. There is, in fact, very little movie talk, though in one conversation Chan’s character talks about her love for a certain “comedy of errors”, which would appear to be the French movie Priceless with Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh. I myself am not so keen. Let Them All Talk has two emotional registers. For the older generation, it is the rather wan but droll language of worldly regret, managing the anxieties and disappointments of old age. And Alice and Susan, despite their material achievements, are not free of these. Nor is Roberta – she is angry and trying to maximise this opportunity by nabbing a rich single guy on the ship (a little like Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes) – but her rage, and the real danger that she represents, is muffled by the keynote of gossipy larkiness that is sustained throughout the film and only flares out at the very end. The younger generation is represented by Alice’s agent and her nephew – although there is a serious age gap between the thirtysomething and the twentysomething. There is the opportunity for real passion, real excitement and real heartbreak in this farcically contrived pairing, but it fizzles out and Soderbergh and Eisenberg cut their key conversation before it ends. Of course, everything has to be about Streep, and her character hovers between the grande-dame hauteur she shows to almost everyone and the gentle ditsiness she shows to her nephew. Is she a black-comic dragon or a bittersweet lonely woman? The ambiguity is perhaps not entirely intentional. It is a voyage of adventure, but not really of discovery."
"Hugh Keays-Byrne was one of those extraordinary screen presences who didn’t land nearly enough substantial roles, but absolutely astonished when entrusted with the spotlight. The great English-Australian actor, who died this week aged 73, was less a performer than a visceral, wall-rattling force who seemed to summon his own weather conditions. You watched the guy, slack-jawed and kind of terrorised, uncertain whether his performances should be studied in film school or analysed by the Bureau of Meteorology. One person understood this more than anybody: the director George Miller, who cast Keays-Byrne as the principal villain in not one but two Mad Max movies. First the 1979 original, with the actor chewing the scenery as a dastardly gang leader named Toecutter, and more recently the Oscar-winning Fury Road, returning him to the franchise as Immortan Joe – a beefy, bedraggled, pasty-white warlord attached to a respirator fitted with rows of horrible-looking horse teeth and squeezed inside semi-transparent armour. Keays-Byrne will be forever celebrated for his bad-arse and batshit crazy Mad Max performances, though he appeared in many other screen productions, albeit often in frustratingly small roles including the pre-Mad Max biker movie Stone, the berserk Australian western Mad Dog Morgan, the strange exploitation pic Snapshot, director Richard Lowenstein’s excellent feature debut Strikebound, and the spectacular turkey Les Patterson Saves the World. Born in Kashmir, India, in 1947, Keays-Byrne’s resume is dotted with midnight movies but he came from a distinguished background, performing for the Royal Shakespeare Company in England for six years before resettling in Australia in 1973. His Fury Road co-star Charlize Theron took to Twitter on Thursday morning to deliver a tribute: “It’s amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul. You will be deeply missed my friend.” In a post published on Facebook, the legendary Ozploitation director Brian Trenchard-Smith also paid tribute to Keays-Byrne’s acting skills as well his character and temperament: “Hugh had a generous heart, offering a helping hand to people in need, or a place to stay to a homeless teenager. He cared about social justice and preserving the environment long before these issues became fashionable. His life was governed by his sense of the oneness of humanity. We will miss his example and his friendship.” Elsewhere in that post, the director reflected on how he “spent many happy Sunday mornings” with Keays-Byrne and others at a shared house where the actor lived in Centennial Park in Sydney. It was at that house, back in the 70s, that Keays-Byrne – gathered with other recently-hired cast members of Mad Max – phoned the film’s producer to make an odd request. The actors had decided they wanted to live and breathe their characters, who belonged to Toecutter’s disgusting gang. Their approach, they reasoned, involved driving dangerously modified motorbikes from Sydney to Melbourne – in addition to wearing the same clothes and avoiding showering. This kickstarted a period of intensely bizarre method acting I wrote about in my book about the making of the Mad Max movies, Miller and Max, with the actors embracing the grubbiness of their characters on and off the screen, helping fuel the wild energy so crucial to making the film such a distinctive and invigorating oddball. The group completely freaked out the then-barely known and inexperienced Mel Gibson who, co-star and co-feral David Bracks later recalled “didn’t know what he’d stepped into … He thought he was gonna cop it. That we were going to give it to him as a real bike gang and beat him up.” On the set of Fury Road more than three decades later, a virtually unrecognisable Hugh Keays-Byrne continued his wacky method style, remaining in character long after his co-stars had taken a break. One time between takes, Abbey Lee Kershaw (who plays one of Immortan Joe’s Five Wives) made the mistake of staring at the seasoned veteran who, looking utterly grotesque in his costume and makeup and determined to stay in character, stared right back. It is safe to say Keays-Byrne won the staring competition. In a YouTube video recorded during the film’s promotional tour, Lee recounted how this moment had such an impact she “couldn’t breathe and my heart was pounding out of my chest”, so much that “they had to stop the shoot and I had to breathe into a bag”. Many people spoke of Keays-Byrne as a generous and gentle spirit; I lost count how many times I heard words to that effect while researching my book. But there’s nothing gentle or laid-back about his best, biggest, gnarliest performances. The actor had his own style as well as his own gravitational pull; you didn’t so much watch him as experience him. Keays-Byrne will – to borrow from the script of Mad Max – ride eternal, shiny and chrome."
"When people think of Sean of course they think of James Bond, but he wasn’t really acting when he was playing that part. In real life, when he walked into a room, he walked like James Bond and he talked like James Bond, which people could find disconcerting. That was because he didn’t change anything about himself, including his Scottish accent, which tells you a lot about the man. Sean was a very tough man in some ways, but very sensitive in others. I first met him in 1971 when he was setting up a charity to help young Scots [the Scottish International Education Trust], wanting me to get involved – he liked how I projected Scotland to the world as a racing driver. He loved his country but realised it had its limitations – even though Glasgow’s fine art is renowned, he knew there weren’t similar opportunities elsewhere in the arts. He understood why people moved away for new opportunities, given he had come from a very ordinary background himself and done that, but he wanted Scotland to thrive from within. He was very proud that people knew him as a Scot all around the world. I’m apolitical but he wasn’t; he wanted Scotland to be independent, and that never left him. After Micheline [Connery’s wife of 45 years] called me to tell me he had died in his sleep, I called the first minister. That’s how important he was to Scotland. I’ve been in some interesting situations with Sean throughout the years. At a charity shooting event at Gleneagles, he convinced the king of Jordan to let Steven Spielberg shoot an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade scene in Petra. He was there with Steven and Harrison Ford, who was a good shot, but Sean – James Bond himself – couldn’t shoot. Sean treated everyone the same and didn’t suffer fools gladly. He had fun with people like that. Not with fans, though – he was always kind to them, never refusing an autograph. And obviously, Sean was very good-looking, so whenever we went out for dinner together, there were always women chasing him, but he’d always be surprised. He never thought of himself as a star. I spent some time with him not long before he died in the Bahamas. He was very unwell then with dementia, which is a very cruel disease – I know this personally, as my wife has had it for several years. It was sad seeing him like that, but there we were, the two of us, lying side by side on his bed. He told me he wanted to watch Sidney Lumet’s The Hill [from 1965], his favourite film in which he’d acted. It’s not well known, but he’s brilliant in it, playing a soldier in a north African army prison. That role meant more to him than all the Bonds. The next day, he asked me again if I’d like to see it as if he’d never asked me before. And so we did. When he died, I wished there had been a run of his films on TV to recognise what he did both for Britain and his beloved Scotland. He was a very dear friend. I’ll miss him very much.

"The last thing anybody ever expected from a Kelly Reichardt film was a big, dripping, golden slab of food porn. Three decades into her career, the American writer-director has become identified with a kind of ascetic purity, both in terms of her own starkly elegant aesthetic and the quiet, marginalised lives she tends to centre on screen. First Cow, her warmly melancholic and generous-hearted seventh feature, doesn’t break from that tradition, yet it serves up surprising pockets of comfort throughout. Let me just say it plainly: First Cow is a film that hinges significantly on doughnuts. Or “oily cakes,” in the film’s 19th-century frontier parlance: big sunny glops of deep-fried dough, eaten hot, drizzled with honey and dusted with cinnamon. Reichardt’s film lingers on the creation of these humble snacks as if gazing upon jewels in a coalmine: you want to reach into the screen and take one, burning your fingers as you do so. The oily cakes are the creation of one Otis “Cookie” Figowitz, a shabby, itinerant cook who earns his nickname before he becomes known for sweet treats. With a thankless job catering to a boorish pack of travelling fur trappers, wending their way through the wilds of Oregon in the 1820s, he generally trades in essentials rather than indulgences, made from what he can forage in an unyielding landscape. Originally from Boston, he has his own “go west, young man” dream, albeit on a sensible scale: to open a bakery in San Francisco. So he confides to the sympathetic ear of King-Lu, a Chinese immigrant on the lam, who becomes his lone ally in an unlikely money-making scheme: selling baked goods to the luxury-starved denizens of the Oregon trail, with milk nicked from a wealthy English landowner’s magnificent dairy cow – the first and only one in the region. Thus does First Cow unfold like an aged, rustic fable or folk legend, passed along to the point that some details have blurred, while any crisp moral has become elusive. Cookie and King-Lu steal from the rich to grow richer themselves and let the community live a little more deliciously: a victimless crime, unless you count that poor, lake-eyed, overmilked cow. Attentive as ever to the mores and strategies of living on the breadline (or indeed the cakeline) and the prickly interaction between haves and have-nots, Reichardt and her regular co-writer Jonathan Raymond (on whose novel the film is based) have made an exquisite, earthy diorama of American capitalism in miniature. It bristles with political aggravation, but is heated by human tenderness and comradeship: played with gentle wit and grace by John Magaro and Orion Lee, the burgeoning relationship between Cookie and King-Lu is rich in queer possibilities too, as their mutual outsider status blossoms into its own intimate bond. Reichardt has never been one to over-burden her films with either words or commentary, and in a year of such fraught political significance for the US, one can frame just about any American film of remote consequence as one for the times. Yet First Cow, set 200 years ago, feels more piquantly so than most: a calm, clear-eyed observation of national traditions of ownership and isolation, the rules designed to keep society’s outcasts out. It begins with a present-day exhumation, as literal bones of the past are tripped upon and brought to light. The historical fiction that ensues makes us ponder how much or how little has changed in the intervening centuries, and how different the prospects for a Cookie or a King-Lu — alone or together — would be in Trump’s America. One thing we know: those doughnuts would still sell like hot, oily cakes. "
"Peter BiskindA stone-cold classic from the moment it arrived in 1998. Biskind, a former editor of Premiere magazine, produced a detailed, insightful and immensely readable account of the (until then) relatively neglected achievements of the 70s “movie brats” and their outpouring of masterworks. Both scholarly and popular, Biskind’s book turned a whole new generation on to the Hollywood new wave. Edited by Alison CastleKubrick famously tried and failed to get a biopic of Napoleon off the ground in the late 60s and early 70s; Jack Nicholson and Blow-Up’s David Hemmings were variously in the frame. This doorstop-sized Taschen book is a compendium of Kubrick’s exhaustive research for the project, from script notes to costume designs. It’s a real eye-opener. John PiersonSpiritually the sequel to Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, even if it was published a couple of years before by Pierson (who later discovered The Blair Witch Project). His subject is the 80s indie wave in which he was a sales agent – and in which Harvey Weinstein figures as a baleful puppetmaster. Karina LongworthWith her podcast You Must Remember This, Longworth alerted a new audience to the entertainment value of old-gold Hollywood and its parade of gossip, scandals and forgotten stars. It all gets distilled in this epic account of the producer/entrepreneur/sleaze and his hold over a generation of starlets. Kevin MacdonaldA standout film-biz profile: a biography of Michael Powell’s film-making partner – jointly responsible for The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus – by his grandson, the director Kevin Macdonald. He writes about him with tremendous affection as well as the insight of a fellow professional. Matthew SweetBy some distance the best book about the British film industry I’ve ever read. Starting from its silent days to the sexploitation era of the 1960s, Sweet firmly foregrounds the popular, less feted areas of the industry, rescuing such figures as Pen Tennyson and Anita Fay Tipping from obscurity. William Preston Robertson“Making of” books are 10 a penny, but this one is pretty special – anticipating the future cultishness of the Coens’ “bowling noir”, with lengthy interviews with behind-the-scenes people and discussion of the brothers’ key themes (“howling, fat men” etc) – all delivered in Robertson’s dry, ironic prose. Ethan Coen’s wife Tricia Cooke is on editing duties. Budd SchulbergNovels can offer an interesting angle on the film world. Martin Amis’s Money, for example, was inspired by working on the flop sci-fi yarn Saturn 5, while Christopher Isherwood’s Prater Violet is an account of prewar British cinema. The real prince of industry fiction, though, has to be this 1941 account of the insanely ambitious wannabe Sammy Glick. Frank RoseThis takes backroom industry shenanigans to a whole new level. A comprehensive history of the celebrated William Morris Agency, it chronicles Hollywood from its vaudeville origins to the power-suit era of the 80s and 90s, via the unusual perspective of the dealmakers and power brokers. Julie SalamonA seminal exposé of big-budget Hollywood film-making at its most excessive. Salamon, then the film critic for the Wall Street Journal, was given unfettered access behind the scenes of Brian De Palma’s movie version of Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities, ending up in the right place to chronicle a slow-motion car crash of the highest order."
"The directorial debut of Viggo Mortensen, which he also wrote and stars in, is an empathetic but gruelling account of a father-son relationship. Nearing the end of his life, Willis (Lance Henriksen), is losing his memory and much of what redeemed him as a person. What’s left is bilious intolerance and a foul temper, which Willis deploys with a regularity that can feel a little cyclical. This, of course, is the point – toxic encounters between increasingly senile Willis and his gay son, John (Mortensen), are doomed to repeat themselves, no less painful for the fact that they have played out many times before."
"A lifelong chronicler of punk and of music’s excessive, transgressive fringes, it’s a wonder that it took Julien Temple as long as it did to turn his attention to Shane MacGowan. The frontman of the Pogues, famous for his ground-glass delivery, the gutter poetry of his lyrics and his fondness for various intoxicants, is a gloriously disruptive subject for a documentary. He once ate a Beach Boys album. But so colourful is his history that this is just a throwaway aside, barely meriting half a minute in this breakneck mosh through his life. Temple has always used archive material playfully; here, it’s particularly riotous, like a chaotic patchwork quilt tacked together by one of Shane’s drunk aunties. As for MacGowan himself? Blurred around the edges, with a terrifying death rattle of a laugh, his beer-soured presence in the film is a glowering counterpoint to the tendency, from some interviewees, to sanctify him as some kind of fallen angel."
"I was the child actor in a travelling experimental theatre company, La MaMa. We were the American entry in these summer theatre festivals across Europe and beyond: Italy, Germany, France, Scotland, Finland, Greece, Lebanon, Iran, we did them all. We also did some red countries. I remember thinking: “What is a red country?” I didn’t understand. We went to see A Clockwork Orange in Copenhagen. It was nice to find a theatre where the films hadn’t been dubbed, and it was a hot ticket, so that was probably the criteria. I don’t think that the twentysomething cinema usher realised what Kubrick had in for us when she allowed nine-year-old me in to see it. I remember the scene where they are pouring milk laced with drugs from the mannequin’s breasts. I’m still scarred. I was taken to lots of movies that I probably shouldn’t have seen. I don’t remember the names; I just remember the violence and the sex. It got my perspectives all mixed up. My first impressions into adulthood were that sex and violence were cool and hip. My dad was a drama coach. He had a theatre workshop with John Cassavetes. He also drove a cab. It was a good temporary gig for a single parent to make money in New York in the 70s. He’d say: “You know, I’m portraying the role of a character of a cab driver …” It meant I had a ride because my dad had a car. No one had a car in Manhattan unless it was a yellow taxi. It was just a delight for him to have me ride shotgun. The people who got in the back didn’t seem to mind that there was a seven-year-old kid sitting in the front. We shared a lot of rituals. We’d go for tea and muffins in the morning. He’d drop me off at school and he’d pick me up from the theatre late at night: 11pm was late for a second grader. This went on until I was 13 and I scored my first film [A Little Romance with Laurence Olivier] and I stopped performing at the theatre because now I was going to be making movies, apparently. I was always a Top 40 radio girl. My idea of fun was to go – late at night and at my own peril – to Colony Records in Times Square to buy 10-packs of blank cassette tapes to record off the radio. My goal was to edit out the commercials. My dream was to be a DJ. Now you have 1,000 songs in your pocket and it’s all on you; you can’t blame the DJ any more. It was an exciting time in America in 1976. We were 200 years old and very proud. We’d got rid of Nixon and we had hubris and joy. As Americans we had a sense of humour about ourselves, so our music had a sense of humour that hasn’t been around since. I loved the Isley Brothers and the Spinners. I loved Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel and It Only Takes a Minute by Tavares. We’d do the hustle to Troglodyte and Bertha Butt Boogie by the Jimmy Castor Bunch. Everything had this goofy sense of humour, which was great fun for teenage girls to dance to. When I was 12, it was like the whole world was 12.  I remember seeing The Way We Were with my mother. I thought Robert Redford was the bee’s knees. I think it devastated her. Watching her cry made me cry, even though I was too young to understand all the emotions. The teenage girl in me fell in love with Mark Hamill in Star Wars. When Saturday Night Fever came out, I lost my mind. I remember wailing into a parking meter when I came out of the cinema. That’s how out of my mind I was. I was 13, hormones were a new thing for me, and I finally had a place to put them. I thought it was the coolest, truest indictment of the desperation to be cool. And the vulnerability of somebody who’s so desperate to be cool struck a chord and touched me very deeply. John Travolta so beautifully portrayed that role. It was a bullseye of casting perfection in such a decade-defining blockbuster film. I imagine it was hard to get over that, in terms of: “I’d like to play other parts, please.” I’m always happy when Travolta is afforded opportunities to play diverse roles, because he was so indelibly stamped on that film. I was the perfect age for a lot of the cliche blockbusters, when the industry was learning that they could manipulate the market. They’d never marketed a film before like they did with Jaws. They didn’t have wide opening films before which stayed in the theatres that long. Culture was so much more shared back then. We have such diversity right now. Everything is available to everyone at any moment, so it’s hard to find that shared feeling. I grew up with an amazing love for actors and acting. It struck me as the bravest poetry possible. I didn’t realise how much goes into making a movie. I mean, who sits there and reads the thousands of names that come up on the credits after a movie? You walk out of the theatre but the names are still going. It is such a huge team sport. Robert Redford might look cool, but it took 8,000 people to make that happen. But when you’re 12, you don’t want to see the man behind the curtain. You want to believe what they’re showing you. I saw Taxi Driver with my dad in New York, which was very disturbing. Jodie Foster’s performance is indelible. Flash-forward two years and I was auditioning for Pretty Baby, which was probably the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been in my life. I first heard Marvin Gaye’s Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) in my dad’s taxi. I also fell in love with David Bowie. I can’t quite remember the first domino of when he moved into my bloodstream. I can remember thinking that I was witnessing a phenomenon. He was like a spider, weaving a web of sounds and music and genres. As a child of the 70s, there was an explosion of talent, musical and otherwise. It was a great escape, comfort and bonding experience to enjoy these things with somebody. The music was perfectly wholesome; it got your blood up and made you want to dance. To this day, the same songs still make me want to dance around my kitchen. I committed the whole of Elton John’s Goodbye Yellow Brick Road to memory. One of the first songs my daughter learned by heart was Grey Seal. I sing it a cappella with my girlfriend when we get together. I’ve played three singers in the movies and there’s a reason I didn’t portray them in my own singing voice. It’s not pretty!"
"Charged with the twin missions of kickstarting cinemagoing post-lockdown (outside the US, at least) and out-Nolanning every previous Christopher Nolan movie, Tenet carries a lot on its shoulders. The fact that it made it into cinemas is an achievement, but does it deliver? The critical consensus has been a qualified, often confused, “yes”, although opinions have differed widely, even among Guardian and Observer critics. One thing all will agree: as well as a fresh jolt of spectacle to revive the flatlining movie business, Tenet provides plenty to talk about and plenty to think about. Too much? Let’s talk about that. Even measured against Nolan’s usual origami plots, Tenet stretches audience comprehension to its limits. The story hinges on the concept of “inversion”. It’s the idea that things can appear to travel backwards in time, though some viewers have struggled to fully grasp this notion, what with Tenet’s reams of exposition, not helped by occasionally muffled dialogue and distractingly spectacular action sequences. The further you get into the plot, the more difficult it becomes to keep track of what’s what and who’s when. It’s like trying to complete a cryptic crossword while reciting the 13 times table backwards while on a tightrope over the Grand Canyon. “Don’t try to understand it, feel it,” Clémence Poésy’s scientist advises our hero, known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington). So were we feeling it? And did we understand it? Tenet’s climactic battle scene is especially challenging. Even though the two detachments of the “temporal pincer movement” are conveniently colour-coded and numerous visual cues are flagged up (the distinctive tag on Robert Pattinson’s backpack, for example), viewers might find it difficult to work out how, when or even if the battle is won, or lost. When you’re rearranging the cause-and-effect building blocks of storytelling like this, you’re always in danger of losing the audience. Many have been happy to just sit back and let the spectacle bombard the senses. Is that enough? Did you get it? And if not, will you go back and watch it again? Perhaps viewing it backwards might help? It’s one thing for Tenet to feel as if it makes sense on the screen, but does it stand up to logical scrutiny? Tenet’s characters repeatedly stress that “inversion” is not time travel – a distinction that conveniently enables the movie to circumvent the pitfalls and paradoxes common to time-travel movies. At least Tenet broaches the problem head-on by bringing up the “grandfather paradox”. It goes like this: If you go back in time and kill your grandfather, does that mean you’ll stop existing? With no grandfather, you can’t be born. And if you don’t exist, there’s no one to kill grandpa in the first place. Similarly, if Washington’s Protagonist had successfully foiled Kenneth Branagh’s plan, wouldn’t Branagh know that in the future, and so try something else? Or conversely, aren’t Washington’s past actions (such as recruiting Pattinson’s Neil) based on knowledge he has gleaned from the future? Other questions abound: how were the “time stiles” built? If only the bullets were travelling backwards in time, why did the things they hit miraculously fix themselves? What happens if someone needs the toilet? Nolan consulted physicist Kip Thorne (who also helped out on Interstellar) to ground Tenet in credible physics, but did they plug all the holes? Strip out the sci-fi elements and Tenet’s set-up is very familiar: glamorous international locations; expensive vehicles; huge action set-pieces; a plot that depends on getting the MacGuffin off the baddies to save the world, not to mention a preoccupation with men’s tailoring. Tenet is a homage to the James Bond movies. Nolan recently claimed to know “as much about the Bond films as Alan Partridge does” (a Celebrity Mastermind showdown surely beckons). He specifically swore off watching any Bond movies while making Tenet, to avoid overlap. Not that it shows, particularly. Nolan’s name is often the first to come up when future Bond directors are discussed; is Tenet his audition? Certainly, he has a command of the action sequences: the explosive airport raid and the reverse-gear motorway heist/chase sequence are both ingenious and exhilarating, all the more effective for their reliance on practical stunts and effects, rather than green-screen computer-aided trickery. Hoyte van Hoytema’s pristine cinematography also gives the visuals a familiar luxurious sheen – especially, when the setting is, say, a villa overlooking the Amalfi coast, or a racing catamaran (Hoytema was also cinematographer for Spectre). Does Tenet up the game for the likes of Bond and Mission: Impossible? Or do we still prefer our thrills old-school and linear? Perhaps we’ll find out when No Time to Die finally hits cinemas in three months’ time. Despite Tenet’s complex plot engineering, it is the human elements that keep the whole thing in motion. Washington, in particular. He’s in some ways a brave choice for such an expensive venture: by no means an established name (his breakout role came in 2018’s BlacKkKlansman) and a rare actor of colour in Nolan’s gallery of overwhelmingly white central characters. His role requires understated charm and soul but also a great deal of physical skill – not least in a painstakingly choreographed fight scene with his “inverted” self. Washington’s co-star Elizabeth Debicki is also a relatively fresh face, best known for roles in Steve McQueen’s Widows, though her star is set to rise with her casting as Princess Diana in series five and six of The Crown. As with Washington, her performance has been largely acclaimed, but is her character somewhat schematic? It is Debicki who does much of what little emoting there is to be done in Tenet, although her defining characteristics seem to be love for her son and marital torment – though she shows some steely cunning under pressure in the latter stages. Pattinson we can almost skip over as a safe pair of hands and a suit-friendly pair of shoulders at this stage. But Branagh’s portrayal of Russian villain Andrei Sator is likely to be more divisive, especially for audiences who last saw him as the heavily Belgian-accented Hercule Poirot. Tenet bravely leads the mission to reopen cinemas but it will almost certainly pay a price for it. Even if it is a huge hit, it is unlikely to earn as much at the box office as it could have done in Covid-free times. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most expensive non-franchise movies ever made, with an estimated budget of more than $200m (£150m). Will we see its like again? And do we want to? For some critics, Tenet is a variation on a theme Nolan has now mined to exhaustion. From Memento to Interstellar to Inception, clever, twisty, time-manipulating stories have sealed Nolan’s reputation, but you wonder how much further he can take them. Has has he reached his own “inversion point”? Does he need to find some new storytelling tricks to which to apply his considerable skills, or are you eager for more? A Tenet sequel, even? "
"Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are falling in love in the first trailer for Ammonite, a controversial romantic drama that’s being tipped for Oscars. The film tells the story of paleontologist and fossil hunter Mary Anning, played by Winslet, whose discoveries were often overlooked during her life in the early 19th century. Director Francis Lee, who broke out with the acclaimed gay romance God’s Own Country, received criticism last year when it was announced that his film would focus on a romance that Anning shared with another woman, Charlotte Murchison, played by Ronan. “I do not believe there is any evidence to back up portraying her as a gay woman,” family member Barbara Anning said to the Telegraph, calling the decision “sensational”. Another relative, Lorraine Anning, disagreed saying that “as long as it’s well presented and tastefully done” then it doesn’t matter. Lee defended the decision on Twitter writing: “After seeing queer history be routinely ‘straightened’ throughout culture, and given a historical figure where there is no evidence whatsoever of a heterosexual relationship, is it not permissible to view that person within another context?” Earlier this year, Lee also stated that “it’s not a biopic” but is inspired by Anning’s life and also his research into same-sex female relationships of the period. “The idea of two women actually in a relationship together was just not a thought anybody ever had within society,” he said. Anning’s contributions have recently achieved more attention with London’s Natural History Museum naming a room after her. She was also a candidate to have her face included on a £50 note. Ammonite was set to premiere at this year’s Cannes film festival but will now receive its first screening next month as part of this year’s Toronto film festival. It’s set to be one of the first unveiled contenders for an unusual awards season. Ronan has amassed four Oscar nominations, including most recently for Little Women, while Winslet has won one and received another six nods. Ammonite will be released on 13 November in the US and in 2021 in the UK."
"The latest from Canadian arthouse wunderkind Xavier Dolan is the story of two men and one kiss. The men are Matthias (Gabriel D’Almeida Freitas), a rising star lawyer who is starting to question whether his fast-track career is taking him in the right direction, and Maxime (Dolan), a carer for his addict mother who is about to leave behind a life that has rather stalled in Montreal to make a new start in Australia. The kiss is scripted – the pair find themselves roped into a student film by the insufferable younger sister of a friend. But the emotions it unlocks are real and perplexing, skewing the balance of a friendship that has threaded together the lives of both since they were children. Matthias & Maxime is recognisably the work of Dolan, who at 31 has crammed a lot of Quebecois melodrama into a relatively short career. His trademark flourishes are very much in evidence: the high-octane onslaught of dialogue, the dominant mothers and invisible fathers, the speeded up montages – his sly way of taking the most hackneyed of all cinema devices and giving it a punky, irreverent energy – and slick changes of aspect ratio (more on which later). But there is also a tonal shift here. The strident, splintering bitterness of some of Dolan’s earlier films (Mommy; It’s Only the End of the World) is replaced by a softer, enveloping melancholy. It’s not exactly gentle in approach – Dolan’s film-making has always been the kind that snaps and bares its teeth – but it’s more forgiving, perhaps, of the flaws in his characters. One of Dolan’s great gifts as a film-maker is the way he captures the dynamics of discord. The camera latches on to every sniping side eye, every cheap dig that finds its target. There is love lurking in his families, but that doesn’t stop warring siblings and sparring mothers and sons tearing each other apart from the inside out. A combative quality within the wider group of friends around Matthias and Maxime highlights the easygoing, instinctive relationship between the two. There’s a lovely shot early on: Matt and Max are framed in a lit window as they companionably work their way through the washing up, their heads bent together in a small, glowing square in the centre of the frame. It feels almost jarring when another character wanders into the shot. Later on, Dolan employs one of his aspect ratio shifts – the frame stretches like a lovestruck pupil dilating – and places the friends at opposite sides of the widest of widescreen shots. Between them is an endless expanse of beige sofa and a lifetime of unspoken words. These playful frame changes mirror the shifting focus of the film: it’s an intimate portrait of two men who can’t quite bring themselves to admit that their relationship might be more than platonic, but it also has a broader generational scope. These are lives at a turning point: carry on and become their parents (in one of the film’s cruder elements, Dolan includes a grotesque, cackling band of moneyed older women as a cautionary Greek chorus), or plough a fresh furrow. Ultimately, the revelation here is not so much Dolan’s more contemplative approach to film-making, but the subtlety and sensitivity of his performance. Max is sharp and witty, but lacks something of the invincible alpha-bro confidence of his buddies – certainly there’s a vulnerability here that is not evident in D’Almeida Freitas’s more erratic turn as the deeply confused Matt. Dolan doesn’t overplay Max’s diffidence but he does, in a couple of tremendous scenes, lay bare his easily bruised soul to wrenching effect."
"The Duke of Edinburgh’s award was designed to address what Prince Philip’s former headmaster Kurt Hahn identified as the “six declines of modern youth”. In his feature debut, Ninian Doff (who has directed music videos for Run the Jewels and the Chemical Brothers) mines black comedy from the misconception that young people lack “fitness, initiative and enterprise, memory and imagination, skill and care, self-discipline and compassion”. It feels like Edgar Wright’s Hot Fuzz and Ben Wheatley’s Sightseers are reference points. Troublemakers Dean (Rian Gordon), Duncan (Lewis Gribben) and DJ Beatroot (Viraj Juneja) must complete their DoE as punishment for setting a school toilet on fire; nerdy Ian (Samuel Bottomley) hopes it will look good on his CV. Lurking in the Scottish Highlands is the Duke (Eddie Izzard), an aristocratic baby boomer who wears a Hannibal-style mask and carries a shotgun. His mission is to teach ungrateful millennials to respect their elders. Hyperactive editing, the jittery rap score and an obligatory acid trip scene grate, but Doff’s social commentary is sharp. Katie Dickie is also drily funny as a sergeant who abandons her search for the local bread thief in the hope of catching an influx of “hip-hop terrorists”.  On Amazon Prime Video"
"The actor Ben Cross, who has died of cancer aged 72, took the film world by storm in the Oscar-winning Chariots of Fire when he played Harold Abrahams, the British Jewish athlete driven as a runner not just to win gold at the 1924 Paris Olympics, but also to battle antisemitism. A fellow British team member, the devout Scottish Protestant missionary Eric Liddell, played by Ian Charleson, is similarly seen in a quest to combat discrimination. Abrahams wins the 100 metres, while Liddell triumphs in the 400 metres. The two stars shared one of the most memorable opening scenes in film history, among the sprinters on a training run along a Scottish beach, enhanced dramatically with moments in slow motion and Vangelis’s inspirational music. “The water was freezing,” recalled Cross, “and we had bare feet – completely ridiculous. If you spoke to a sports trainer about running barefoot in ice-cold water, they’d ask you if you were mad. But, look, it made for a good opening sequence.” The 1981 film, produced by David Puttnam and directed by Hugh Hudson, won four Academy awards at the following year’s Oscars ceremony. However, despite Colin Welland’s “warning” to Hollywood that “the British are coming” as he accepted his statuette for best original screenplay, the two stars never quite fulfilled the promise they had shown in such a high-profile film – even though they jointly received the Variety Club’s most promising artiste award. While Charleson chose to spend much of his time on stage before his premature death from Aids in 1990, Cross found most of his best roles on television, which utilised his bony features and earnest, sincere air, and said he had no hunger for theatre. “Of all the jobs I’ve been offered, television was the best quality,” he later said. “I haven’t liked most of the films I’ve been offered. Film has the greatest international audience, so you have to be very choosy about what you do.” He had his first starring role on the small screen in The Citadel (1983), the BBC’s 10-part adaptation of AJ Cronin’s semi-autobiographical novel about a doctor who swaps his crusading job in a poor Welsh mining village of the 1920s for a wealthy existence taking care of London society before realising he has sacrificed his ideals. Going from the parochial to the international, Cross headed the cast in The Far Pavilions (1984), a lavish mini-series set in 19th-century India during the days of the British Raj. As the dashing romantic hero Ashton Pelham-Martyn (“Ash”), he played a British officer in love with a princess and battling to understand his own identity, having been orphaned and previously believing himself to be of Indian birth. To prepare for the role, Cross went to the country four weeks before shooting began in order to absorb the atmosphere – just as he had spent three months “training like a madman” for Chariots of Fire. “The man discovers he is English, yet his heart and emotions are very much Indian and he’s accepted in neither world,’’ reflected Cross at the time. “These misfit roles seem to seek me out. I always seem to play people not totally at home in the situation we discover them.” Born in Paddington, London, to Catherine (nee O’Donovan), a cleaner, and Harry, a doorman, Cross was brought up a Catholic and attended Bishop Thomas Grant school in Streatham, south London. Playing the title role in a school production of Toad of Toad Hall brought him laughs – and an ambition to act that was a long time unrealised after leaving home at 15, living in a van and working as a window cleaner. He eventually found jobs backstage, as a carpenter for the Welsh National Opera and property master at the Alexandra theatre, Birmingham. Then, during two years at Wimbledon theatre, watching a different show every week, Cross decided to get himself under the stage lights, successfully auditioned for Rada and graduated in 1972, aged 24. Apart from a handful of TV roles over the rest of the decade, his only screen appearance was as Trooper Binns – described by Cross as a “glorified extra” – alongside an all-star cast in the 1977 war film A Bridge Too Far. However, he began to get attention on stage. During a stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company he took the role of Kevin Cartwright in the world premiere of the Peter Nichols national service farce Privates on Parade (Aldwych theatre, 1977). His singing voice was showcased when he played Wally in the original London production of the Cy Coleman-Michael Stewart musical I Love My Wife (Prince of Wales theatre, 1977-78) and, at the time of auditioning for Chariots of Fire, he was Billy Flynn, Roxie Hart’s lawyer, in Chicago (Cambridge theatre, 1979-80), observed by the Stage as “strong and sly as the courtroom superstar”. His other television roles included Padre Rufino, a Franciscan monk aiding Jewish wartime refugees, in The Assisi Underground (1985), the vampire Barnabas Collins in the 1991 mini-series Dark Shadows, Rudolf Hess in Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial (2006), Prince Charles in William & Kate (2011) and the ruthless Ukrainian mob boss Mr Rabbit in the first two series (2013-14) of the American drama Banshee. The Italian production Honey Sweet Love (1994) gave him a rare starring film role, as a British army officer falling in love in Sicily during the second world war. He was also seen on the big screen as Prince Malagant in First Knight (1995) and as Sarek, Spock’s father, in the 2009 film Star Trek. Cross’s first two marriages, to Penelope Butler (1977-92) and Michele Moerth (1996-2005), both ended in divorce. In 2018 he married Deyana Boneva in Bulgaria, where he had been living for more than 10 years. She survives him, along with the two children of his first marriage, Lauren and Theo."
"If there’s one defining image from Nicolas Roeg’s zippy yet cruel adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, it’s that of Anjelica Huston ebulliently pushing a stranger’s baby carriage down towards a cliff edge. While a gory death might then be averted, it’s an almost unfathomably sadistic moment, a shocking act of hate contained within a glossy PG-rated studio fantasy. Even 30 years on, as the line between films aimed at children and teenagers blurs ever more, Roeg’s 90 minutes of mostly unfettered nastiness remains a startling watch, a bitter little fairy tale to keep kids up at night with a fear of torturous death. What makes The Witches so horribly effective, both on page and screen, is that this fear is aimed at a group that children have traditionally been taught to see as safe. It’s not just that the antagonists are women, it’s that they’re women who are made to resemble harmless family friends or neighbours, aunts or teachers, figures we expect to coo over babies, not try to murder them. Hollywood has forever fed into reductive and tiresome stereotypes of women as either mothers or molls, usually identified by their feelings towards kids. We’ve seen in countless films that a woman who loses a child also loses her sanity too, and that women unable to conceive are instead driven to steal a baby from elsewhere. The women we’re shown who don’t want children are usually glamorous femme fatales whose disinterest in motherhood is explained away by a more general sociopathy or unwanted spinsters who have seen their lives amount to nothing as a result. In The Witches, a large cross-section of women didn’t just not want children but they wanted to kill everyone else’s, an unapologetic and bloodthirsty desire for a child-free world. Various feminist critics of Dahl’s book and Roeg’s movie expressed distaste with its portrayal of childless women as murderous hags, although in recent years, some have seen it as more forward thinking and less misogynist in its worldview. Author Caroline Kepnes views it as “a hilarious, feminist commentary on women, work and family” where men are ineffective and women possess more power, something that might prove horrifying to those frantically upholding the patriarchy. In an ingenious, info-packed intro, we’re given a beginner’s guide to witches courtesy of Mai Zetterling’s Helga, who tells her grandson Luke, Parenthood’s Jasen Fisher, how to spot one of them, an urgent lesson that could end up saving his life. They’re foul creatures with square toes and blotchy scalps but wear sensible shoes and wigs to fit in. Writing for the New Statesmen, Jemma Crew views this as a way of the story rebelling against “aesthetic rules imposed on women”, a way of showing how so many are forced into impossible beauty standards by society and how men fear and criticise those who don’t conform. Their aim is to infiltrate without detection so they can kill as many children as possible, but in order to evade capture they must avoid using “knives or guns” and instead find inventive ways to dispatch of bodies. In arguably the film’s most chilling sequence, we see a girl kidnapped by a local witch and then trapped in a painting where she’s forced to live out the rest of her life, alone, doomed, with her family, crippled, watching from outside. It’s one of many staggeringly hopeless notes we’re left to sit with, a trademark not only of the story’s original author Dahl, whose work often delved deep into gleefully nihilistic territory, but of Roeg, a director whose often perverse films were aimed squarely at an open-minded adult audience and who seemed a strange, dangerous choice for a slick Warner Brothers family movie. But somehow, hiring the guy who made a film so filthy that it was shelved and then dumped by scared studio executives before shooting arguably the sexiest sex scene ever to make a film for kids proved to be a masterstroke. Roeg’s deft and entertaining late summer critic-pleaser maintained the sourness of Dahl’s source material while also transplanting the book’s sprightly pace. Sure, children are killed, but that hurtling pace and that Stanley Myers score sure make all that killing rather fun, huh? (Myers was also an unlikely choice, best known for his work on The Deer Hunter). Bar one controversial diversion which I’ll come to, Roeg doesn’t dampen the malevolency of the novel or his unusual, uneasy style, making certain unpleasant scenes that much more unpleasant with clammy, claustrophobic close-ups and unsettling Dutch tilts, shooting it like an adult horror movie, albeit one with goofy comic elements. His careful tonal control is matched by a ferocious performance by Huston as the Grand High Witch, a scene-devouring turn from an actor swiftly seesawing between camp and callous, a scary, funny and sexy villain without a visible shred of humanity. While Jim Henson’s de-wigged witches are monstrously effective (it was the last film he personally worked on before his death), it’s those in disguise that prove more nightmarish, posing as polite and unremarkable representatives for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. So while Huston’s unmasking scene remains a showstopper, there’s something more long-lasting about the surreal image of well-dressed women scouring the Cornish bluffs for a child they want to turn into a mouse. They succeed at downsizing our hero Luke, but he then goes on to destroy this particular coven before setting his sights on witches worldwide. This is where that aforementioned diversion comes into play. A happier ending was written that saw Luke turned back into a boy by a defecting witch who uses her magic powers for good, a spoonful of sugar heaped over the original, darker finale, which saw Luke remain a rodent. Dahl was incensed, and so Roeg agreed to shoot both endings and see which one test audiences preferred. Predictably, the happier endnote won out, and in response, Dahl threatened to take his name off the film, something Henson later urged him against (he still referred to the finished product as “utterly appalling”). It does still clang to end with such jubilation after what’s come before but given how far the film goes in many ways, it’s an understandable sacrifice. In Roeg’s autobiography, he noted that early rushes from the film were far more frightening throughout but after road-testing it on his rather terrified young son, he recalibrated. As an eight-year-old who sat drenched in fear watching it for the first time, too scared and embarrassed to leave the room, what he kept in was enough to cause me night terrors for months after. Ultimately any concessions didn’t matter commercially as the film underperformed despite a string of glowing reviews. But fondness remains, so much so that a remake is due out next year from Robert Zemeckis with Anne Hathaway drafted in as the Grand High Witch and, in a comically Hollywood move, 50-year-old Octavia Spencer playing the grandmother (Zetterling was 65 in the original). There’s an interesting change in location – this time it’ll be Alabama in the 1960s – and Zemeckis has said it will be “a sociological spin” on the story, a head-scratching proposition that we’ll have to wait until 2021 to see play out. Watching the 1990 original as an adult, nightmares long behind me, it’s a relief to see just how justified my earlier troubled reaction was, the product of a vicious little film that even now strikes a far nastier note than the majority of family-friendly studio offerings. It’s very much part of a particular era of darker kids films alongside Return to Oz, The Dark Crystal and Something Wicked This Way Comes, all of which were similar box office disasters, a sign that kids wanted to be amused rather than scared. While my briefly traumatised eight-year-old self might not agree, there’s something important about experiencing at least a somewhat neutered, PG-friendly form of horror at a young age. “Being scared is a rite of passage,” children’s author Joanna Nadin once said, “but a pleasurable one. I don’t see the gain in mollycoddling.” Dahl and Roeg’s portrayal of purple-eyed child-killing sadists might be fantastical but it’s also brutally effective, a salient reminder for younger viewers to be more aware of their surroundings and to use trust sparingly. There’s no straight-laced PSA about not talking to strangers that could have achieved that fear quite so brilliantly as watching a boy get turned into a mouse or a girl get trapped in a painting. The Witches is a scary movie for kids who need scaring."
"In this extremely French but quite enjoyable comedy-drama, comic actor Grégory Montel, basically a smiley labrador in human form, plays Guillaume, a divorced, middle-aged Parisian chauffeur. He is striving to make enough money to upgrade to a better apartment so he can have his tween-aged daughter (Zelie Rixhon) stay overnight. Guillaume can’t afford to lose his job, as it is already hanging by a thread due to his having earned several points on his licence for speeding. That makes enduring the hauteur of his latest client, professional “nose” or fragrance designer Mademoiselle Anne Walberg (Emmanuelle Devos), all the more challenging given she expects him to not only drive and carry her luggage, but also help her change sheets at hotels because she can’t stand the odour of the “clean” smelling detergent they’ve used, and take notes for her while she analyses the smell of a cave that needs to be copied for a client. From this cutesy meeting – a predictably antagonistic first encounter – a friendship develops that, admirably for a change, doesn’t end up in quite the place you might expect by the end. In fact, that’s just one of several refreshing surprises. Others include the finely observed writing that limns the relationships between the main duo and between them and supporting characters, such as Guillaume and his smart, observant kid, or Anne and her avaricious agent (Pauline Moulène). But the most interesting thing about the film is its well-researched glimpse into the smell business, a multibillion-dollar industry that spans not just the designing of high-end perfumes for fashion houses, but also efforts to disguise the stink of factory emissions and scents to pump into supermarkets to make people buy more stuff. In passing, Anne mentions that she designed Dior’s J’adore, whose original formulation is actually the work of master perfumer Calice Becker. This film feels a bit like a tribute to talents such as Becker and Christine Nagel (formerly of Jo Malone, now at Hermès) who acted as an adviser for the movie. That attention to detail adds a welcome layer of complexity, making the whole thing a bit like a visit to the perfume department at Galeries Lafayette before a taxi ride on a rainy day in Paris. Perfumes is in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
"You might think a nation that effectively banned science fiction for much of its history (during the Cultural Revolution, and for other periods) might hesitate before encouraging its film-makers to get their futuristic thinking caps on. But China’s communist government has apparently been inspired by the huge box office success of homegrown space blockbuster The Wandering Earth to issue guidelines aimed at emboldening directors and screenwriters who might be planning a follow-up. Variety reports the official document “highlights how the sci-fi genre fits into the ruling Communist party’s broader ideological and technological goals”, which sounds suitably 1984. (Except that George Orwell’s seminal dystopian tome is frowned upon in China, to the extent that authorities at once point last year stopped social media users from being able to type out its title in reference to an abolition of presidential term limits; strangely enough, the book itself is not banned.) Variety also suggests new Chinese sci-fi films will be encouraged to “highlight Chinese values, inherit Chinese culture and aesthetics, cultivate contemporary Chinese innovation”, “disseminate scientific thought” and “raise the spirit of scientists”. Chinese sci-fi films, the trade paper says, will therefore be asked to portray China “in a positive light as a technologically advanced nation.” The disappointing thing here isn’t so much that Chinese authorities feel the need to intervene in this way – censors have been cracking down on “unacceptable” elements of Hollywood movies for decades. It’s that any local film-makers with futuristic concepts humming away in their subconscious will be so stymied in their creativity. For if there’s any film genre custom-designed to upset rigid politburo thinking, it’s science fiction. A quick glance at the history of Hollywood sci-fi – both recent and past – perfectly highlights the issue. Futuristic quadrilogy The Hunger Games was grudgingly allowed to screen in China (Hengqin island, near Macau, even opened a Hunger Games theme park last year). But it’s hard to imagine any Chinese-produced dystopian effort, especially one featuring an oppressive authoritarian government, getting the green light. Looking further back, we can imagine the ending of 1973’s Soylent Green being cleverly altered so that Charlton Heston realises the ubiquitous, suspiciously meaty foodstuff that keeps Earth’s growing population constantly sated is in fact a tasty vegan treat (rather than … you know), had the film been made in China. Might China attempt its own Star Wars? Such a move would surely be risky given that censors have in the past banned movies in the Pirates of the Caribbean series for featuring swirling spirits; George Lucas’s popular space opera has possibly featured more leading characters returning from the dead as ghosts than any other saga in Hollywood history. How about Back to the Future? Well, China banned Robert Zemeckis’s sci-fi adventure in 1985 due to its depiction of time travel. It’s thought censors have become less rigid in the intervening years, though movies in which modern-day Chinese citizens travel back to the glorious past were still looked down upon as recently as 2011. Avatar? Hmmm ... Bully-boy outsiders invade and take over the territory of an indigenous people, downplaying their culture and exploiting the local resources. If Colonel Miles Quaritch and his cronies had been portrayed by Chinese actors in a Chinese production it’s hard to imagine this concept getting past day one. Mad Max? George Miller’s Oscar-winning Fury Road failed to secure a release in China, though local film-makers did manage to put out a blatant rip-off titled Mad Shelia that borrowed most of the plot. How about kids’ sci-fi? Would Pixar’s Wall-E, in which humans are forced to travel into space because they have polluted the Earth so badly, have been given the go-ahead as a Chinese production? Given the way China has treated its own environmental activists, this one also looks like a no-no. What about Alien? Could a film in which a Chinese team becomes the first human beings ever to come into contact with extra-terrestrial life, only to find itself immediately ripped to shreds by the HR Giger’s “perfect organism” ever find its way into a local studio? Such a storyline doesn’t seem likely to “raise the spirit of scientists” or portray China as a “technologically advanced nation”, though it’s possible Ripley’s mecha-suited victory over the Alien queen in 1986’s sequel might have passed muster. It seems more likely that Chinese sci-fi efforts will mirror the success of The Wandering Earth, about a seemingly Chinese-led (though rendered in the movie as a future “world government”) mission to save mankind by moving the Earth to Alpha Centauri. Not much in the way of controversy there, especially as the planet has apparently fallen into ruin due to an ageing sun, rather than any kind of human-inspired environmental degradation. Because that’s not a hot button topic in any way. We should certainly expect to see very different movies emerging than Hollywood has traditionally released. And maybe that’s no bad thing – at least if you’re happy to see the complete elimination of almost everything that has made futuristic film-making interesting in western cinema over the past few decades."
"There are few artists who excelled in working across multiple music genres like Arthur Russell, yet there are many who share his status of relative obscurity. When Russell died in 1992 at 40, due to Aids-related illness, he left behind a body of work that spanned disco, avant-garde, folk, pop, new wave and classical. Yet much of it remained unreleased for years, housed in an overflowing archive of 1,000-plus tapes. In recent years, a treasure trove of posthumous archive-raiding releases have brought Russell’s pioneering and fecund work to light. He’s influenced everyone from LCD Soundsystem to Hot Chip and even Kanye West sampled him on 30 Hours from 2016’s Life of Pablo. Yet when Matt Wolf – director of recent documentary Spaceship Earth – made his 2008 film, Russell was even more of a mysterious cult figure than he is today. Wolf’s film is a tender and intimate look at Russell and his humble journey from the cornfields of Iowa, running away to a Buddhist retreat in San Francisco, before landing in New York’s bustling music scene, of which he became a hugely significant part. Archive footage of Russell performing is about on a par with that of the Velvet Underground, ie sparse. Recorded interviews with him are even rarer. Yet what Wolf’s documentary lacks in visual punch via plentiful archive it makes up for with music and thoughtful editing. A great deal of space is left for Russell’s music to float through the film, from his groove-locked dance floor firecrackers to his scratchy cello pieces coalesced with whisper-in-your-ear vocals. It’s as much a soundtrack to a life as it is a story. The fact so little footage of Russell exists adds to his mystique; even though the film tells the story of a beloved cult musician, bringing his personality to life, there’s still an unshakable sense that he remains something of an uncapturable presence. When Russell died his Village Voice obituary read: “Arthur’s songs were so personal that it seems as though he simply vanished into his music” and Wild Combination runs with this as its cinematic mantra. Russell was a dichotomous character and this is reflected in both the film and his music. He was deeply shy – some went as far to say strange – and some of his more intimate music aligns with this. Yet he was also responsible for making wildly dynamic music under aliases such as Dinosaur and Loose Joints that would rip up the dancefloor at places like the Paradise Garage, the notorious nightclub he loved to frequent and lose himself to the speakers. “He had to be the funkiest white boy I ever met,” says singer and collaborator Lola Love in the film – someone who was no stranger to funk herself as a member of James Brown’s revue. Russell is also presented as someone who was obsessive, perhaps often to his own detriment as piles of unfinished work would stack up due to his incessant need to tweak things. He’s painted as often being difficult and demanding, yet clearly this obdurate artistic vision was what produced such deeply singular music. It’s the breadth and versatility of Russell as an artist – along with the film’s deft tone – that makes Wild Combination such an endearing gem. To follow Russell’s unique path is to dive into the history of New York’s counter culture. He collaborated with everyone from Allen Ginsberg to Talking Heads, and Phillip Glass and Larry Levan. During his tenure as musical director of the downtown avant-garde music venue the Kitchen, he brought in pop and rock groups such as Jonathan Richman’s the Modern Lovers, amalgamating the previously divided worlds of pop and classical. In many senses, Russell was a connecting bridge between these two worlds in New York. He saw no distinction between the so-called highbrow and lowbrow, sharing an equal zealousness for bubblegum pop as he did Indian classical music. Many contributors have endless superlatives for him on camera – collaborator and Modern Lovers member Ernie Brookes views him as being one of the greatest songwriters of all time “up there with the Beatles” – but it’s the moments spent with his parents and surviving partner Tom Lee that really connect, adding a weighty emotional resonance. The film ends with Russell’s parents being asked what would have happened if he hadn’t contracted Aids. “He would have gone far,” his mother says, softly. “Either that or he’d have another 4,000 or 5,000 tapes,” adds his father with a smile."
"Something of a curate’s Fabergé egg, this peculiar Russian-made steampunk-lite fantasy feature has some interesting story ideas, entrancing visual effects and lovely sets (a lot of it was filmed in Tallinn’s gorgeous city centre in Estonia, as well as in St Petersburg). But many of the lead performances are painfully inert, exuding less verisimilitude than the story’s computer-generated fairies. Just to guide it deeper into the valley of the uncanny, nearly everyone in the film speaks English but with obviously dubbed voices, so while the phonemes roughly match the mouth movements, it’s a fair bet that different actors (often with American accents) recorded the dialogue in soundproof booths during post-production. That said, this last weirdness creates a kind of verfremdungseffekt, or sense of alienation, which dilutes any remaining realism and thus may be intentional. We can be pretty sure that director Aleksandr Boguslavskiy and his collaborators fully intended to create a magical world that looks all at once medieval, belle époque and 1930s-ish. There, the residents of a town called Fensington live inside a high wall designed to keep them safe from supposedly sinister strangers, a bit like a Maga-hat fantasy version of Yuma, Arizona, but smaller and with more snow. Nearly a hundred years after the wall was built, a father (Eddie Marsan) gives his young daughter a necklace that turns out to have strange powers before he is taken away by officers wearing creepy bronze masks who claim that he is “infected” with some enigmatic disease. The girl, Abigail, grows up to be willowy, wooden-as-a-countertop ex-model Tinatin Dalakishvili, who then falls in with a group of resistance fighters. With masked soldiers snatching civilians in Belarus and the continuing conflict in Ukraine, it’s temping to spy some kind of anti-fascism allegory in this story, but that may be taking things too far. Sometimes a zeppelin is just a zeppelin.       "
"‘For three days after the Bataclan, I thought I was dead,” says Ismaël el Iraki, whose debut feature, Zanka Contact, about two lost souls recovering from PTSD, is playing at the Venice film festival. It’s a Wild at Heart-type love story starring Ahmed Hammoud and Moroccan music star Khansa Batma with debts to Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone. A car crash throws together a has-been rocker who has just returned to Casablanca and a streetwise con-artist, who get lulled into the shenanigans of the city’s music underworld. Zanka Contact riffs on the director’s experiences trying to recover from all he witnessed at the Eagles of Death Metal concert at Paris’s Bataclan venue in November 2015, when gunmen massacred 90 people in a night of coordinated attacks by terrorists that left 143 dead and hundreds injured. El Iraki stared at the gunman as he pulled the trigger. The bullet scraped past him. He was preparing to die when the fearless actions of a security guard called Didi saved him. Oblivious to his personal wellbeing, Didi kept returning to the concert hall, leading the injured and distressed to safety. “I saw a hero with my own eyes,” recalls El Iraki, who escaped through the front door of the building.  “I still live surrounded by ghosts,” says the Moroccan-born film-maker who moved to Paris to attend La Fémis, the prestigious French film school where his classmates included Raw director Julia Ducournau. It was there, in 2009, that he made the popular, award-winning short film H’rash. But those happy experiences now seem a world away after what happened at the Bataclan. “One of the things I discovered through this is PTSD is an infectious disease given to you by those who exact violence on you.” The Bataclan concert was supposed to be the first of eight live performances El Iraki was going to attend that week. Motörhead at the Zenith and the other gigs were cancelled, except for one. “I went to Kadavar because I had a ticket, and it said ‘placement libre’ [unreserved seating] on it. I was very afraid, but it was a life-changing experience for me. They brought me back from the dead.” The 36-year-old is wearing a Kadavar “horned goddess” T-shirt inspired by the German power trio’s track Goddess of Dawn as we speak via video. He has big hair that yawns out in all directions and a full beard that makes him look like hip-hop musician Questlove. He gives a hearty laugh. “I’m more of a rock guy, but if I don’t wash my hair it goes into dreadlocks. And that’s not me. I love funk, hip-hop, rock and roll – but reggae, even when I’m stoned is tough.” El Iraki is sitting in a room in his apartment in Paris that houses his extensive vinyl collection, and he feigns embarrassment when he moves the webcam to show how many are soundtrack albums. As a youngster in Rabat, film music records would often arrive months or years before the film made it to cinemas. So, by the time Jurassic Park came out, he recalls being very familiar with its soundtrack. That he still has the air of someone who is the life of the party is testament to the work he undertook at behavioural treatment centres after the attacks. “They make you relive what happened to you, again and again. They provoke it. What you realise is that is not a bad memory, it breathes in the present, and the goal is to make that thing become a memory.” An open letter on El Iraki’s Facebook page went viral when he criticised Eagles of Death frontman Jesse Hughes. The pro-gun Trump-supporting Hughes had condemned Islam in an interview using the type of abhorrent language found in Jewish-conspiracy rhetoric. An atheist himself, El Iraki adds: “The problem is that we are all part of many groups, and he doesn’t see the bigger group. You’re a skater, a Mexican food lover, a Dostoyevsky reader and you’re also a Muslim. You’re not just brown or whatever.” When he started making Zanka Contact, El Iraki says it was about a man who was present during a terrorist attack. But he realised: “That was too close to news material.” He wanted to steer clear of a story focused on violence; he criticises the media reporting of terrorist incidents as overly preoccupied with the violent spectacular with too little focus on the resilience of the victims. El Iraki wrote a symbolic fairytale about recovering from trauma. “It’s still there. You are fucked for life but can learn to live with it. At the heart of the movie is this couple with intersecting traumas and how they can help each other.” What happened at the Bataclan became more peripheral and symbolic to his film. Kadavar is the band playing a rock concert. “Unfortunately, there are a lot of things from the Bataclan days, a lot of visions and nightmares exorcised in a movie.” The creation of the titular song is a cathartic moment for the characters, and a reflection of the director’s own journey. “The main thing for me,” says El Iraki, “was to never lose my love of music because of this violence.”"
"A specialist in fantasy and the supernatural, Mexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro was born in Guadalajara in 1964. He worked as a special effects makeup designer, before making his directing debut with 1993 vampire story Cronos. He went on to make two highly acclaimed supernatural films in Spain – ghost story The Devil’s Backbone and Pan’s Labyrinth, which sets a fantasy mythology against the background of the Franco dictatorship. His work in Hollywood includes two Hellboy films, Japanese-themed robots-v-monsters epic Pacific Rim and gothic drama Crimson Peak. The Shape of Water (2017), a love story about a woman and an amphibian being, won multiple awards including Oscars for best picture and best director, and the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival. He is preparing a stop-motion version of Pinocchio, with voice artists including Tilda Swinton and Ewan McGregor. He also recently launched Wizards, the third of the Tales of Arcadia trilogy of children’s CGI animation series, currently screening on Netflix. And he has just published a new fantasy novel, The Hollow Ones, written in collaboration with Chuck Hogan, his co-author on book trilogy The Strain, which also spawned a TV series. Set in modern-day Manhattan, the early 60s deep south and Elizabethan England, The Hollow Ones introduces immortal occult detective Hugo Blackwood – named in tribute to the fantasy writer Algernon Blackwood. Del Toro talked about the novel and other projects over the phone from Toronto, where he has just resumed work on his feature film Nightmare Alley, production having halted in March because of the coronavirus lockdown. Starring Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett and Willem Dafoe, it is based on the 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham, and tells the story of the relationship between a crooked carnival worker and a psychiatrist. The Hollow Ones is a very strange genre hybrid. It starts off feeling like a Jack Reacher crime thriller, but then you bring in your character Hugo Blackwood, a Van Helsing-style demon hunter.This is a mix that goes back quite a while, starting with the [19th-century] Irish writer Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, who was one of the best ghost story writers. He came up with a character called Dr Martin Hesselius, who was in certain ways an occult investigator. Then Algernon Blackwood created a genre with John Silence, a physician slash psychic detective, for the first time merging procedural and supernatural happenings. That continued during the pulp literature era – it’s a very strange subgenre in horror fiction. You’ve dedicated the book to old-school horror/fantasy writers – Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, Arthur Machen. What is it about the Edwardian/Victorian imagination that excites you?What I like about Blackwood is that in his stories, the supernatural is a given – unlike, say, The Hound of the Baskervilles, where you have a very eerie atmosphere and legend and lore, but then you discover the more natural, prosaic causes of the case. With Blackwood’s John Silence stories, you’re not going to discover that it was a band of smugglers disguised as ghosts – you’re going to face the actual supernatural. There’s a note at the start of your book claiming that grave robbing is a major phenomenon in New Jersey. Really?Yes, that was the origin of this whole thing. I saw a newspaper story that detailed how they found human remains in a cauldron in a garage, and the police were linking it to grave robbing. I started researching, and found that grave robbing for occult purposes was almost reaching epidemic proportions in New Jersey. I thought, this is interesting – we can bounce back between that and Mesopotamian entities and a detective that you can summon on Wall Street in modern times. Your story deals with certain difficult areas of American history – the deep south, slavery, the Klan. Given the heightened sensitivities around such themes at the moment, do you worry people might feel that these are not topics best suited to genre fiction?Well, we started writing it five or six years ago. I think [African American FBI man] Agent Solomon is a really strong character in the book. The book is talking about evil in many forms, not just the supernatural form, but the human perception of it. I think fiction can work to address the real world. You have to be mindful of these things; the combination has to be done carefully – the horror and the idea of an America that is still characterised a lot by these things in the past. You’re a very active Twitter user, mixing your cultural enthusiasms with political comments. For example, you’ve mentioned the recent death of Giovanni López, killed after being arrested for not wearing a face mask in the state of Jalisco.That is sadly not an isolated case, it has happened in other states in Mexico. The reality that it’s revealing is a very tragic fact that we live with every day in Mexico, which is the meshing of the police with the criminals – it’s almost a complete symbiosis. The way you react in Mexico to the police is with immense wariness and distrust. This is just one of the cases that evidenced the almost insane paradox of somebody during a pandemic being hurt or killed by people who are supposed to be enforcing health laws. What do you enjoy about social media?You have to use it carefully. In my life, I’ve fused those things that I love artistically with the things that I believe politically – that’s true of my movies, it’s true of my Twitter account, it’s true of my daily life. I think what I have to do with social media is to point people in the direction of plays or movies or images or image creators that can enrich them, and that may not be well known. I try not to participate in chipping in on scandal or divisive pillorying. I try to use it as a positive, enriching platform. You’ve recently tweeted about rereleased silent films, new Mexican movies… What have you been watching of late?I could tweet 20 times a day – I’m very careful not to, because there’s a part of your life that needs to remain only for you. But a couple of days ago, on Gene Kelly’s birthday, I watched four of his movies, and not the ones you’d imagine – The Pirate, For Me and My Gal… Much of my time is spent rewatching – say, a Douglas Sirk melodrama or thriller, like Sleep, My Love. With the pandemic, my habit has been to screen at least three movies a day. I was in lockdown for many weeks in Toronto first, completely quarantined and socially distancing, and then in California, for an equal amount of time. Without having to go to the office, you have 18 hours, and you can dedicate nine hours to work, and nine hours for three movies, and still have time to take care of your basic needs. It’s a blessing to have the time. I’m very lucky to be able to work from home, so I try not to waste it. What about your animation series, Tales of Arcadia? What led you into that area?I wanted to cater to a family viewing experience, the way I had it when I was a kid. I grew up with the anime of Osamu Tezuka – in Mexico in the 60s, we were invaded by Japanese anime. I remember watching Astro Boy – it’s a very melancholic story, you know, and Tezuka in general has that feeling. I thought, could we do the classic “hero’s journey”, but use it to talk about loss? You’re also adding your stop-motion Pinocchio to a long list of versions of the tale. And you’re well known to be fascinated with Frankenstein – so will your Pinocchio be a kind of Frankenstein story?To me, they’re not exactly the same, but they’re similar. They are both creatures that are created and thrown into a world that they have to figure out on their own. They both have a moral, spiritual journey. I thought Pinocchio could be a great opportunity to talk about disobedience. Obedience isn’t a virtue, it’s a burden. Disobedience is the seed of reason – it’s a desirable way to gain your own soul. I thought this could be an interesting background for Pinocchio, if we set it during the rise of Mussolini – an interesting time for a puppet that refuses to obey. What can we expect from Nightmare Alley?There was a moment in American letters in which this underbelly of modern America started to be addressed – a lot of that congealed around noir writing, the pulp detectives and novels. But there are other pieces of writing, like The Day of the Locust, They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? and Nightmare Alley, that address this intersection of the modern and the visceral in a very interesting way. The original novel, when it was written, was right at the crossroads of the modern notion of psychoanalysis, kind of jamming that with the occult powers of the tarot, and the idea of travelling carnivals and spiritualism used to defraud the gullible. It’s a really interesting mixture of things – I don’t like things straight, I like to combine things that in theory should not go together. Like a post-civil war struggle in Spain and fairytale; or a mix of a Douglas Sirk melodrama with an amphibian god and a sexual-awakening love story."
"This crass, macho movie is an LA police drama with an unreconstructed 1970s mentality. Its heroes are tough-guy white cops with chevron moustaches who’ll smoke on duty if they damn well please, and to hell with the regulations. The only significant female character is a drug addict who allows a pimp to sell her daughter to a drug gang. African American men mostly appear cuffed and face down on the bonnet of a patrol car. And its sympathy for white lawmen who play fast and loose with the rules – especially at a time when so many unarmed black men are dying at the hands of white officers – feels shamefully irresponsible. The drama takes place over one night in the squad car of fresh-faced beat cop Nick Holland (Luke Kleintank) and his grizzled partner Ray (Thomas Jane). Ray’s primary lesson to the rookie appears to be versing him in cliched cop talk (“There’s the world inside your cop car, and everything else”). The pair make a handful of run-of-the-mill arrests while Ray attends to a personal matter: investigating the disappearance of his dead partner’s eight-year-old daughter. Inevitably, justice and the protection of women and children will require him to skirt the rules. To hammer home the point that Ray is a good guy, writer-director Joel Souza gives us a dirty cop, Jack VanZandt (Josh Hopkins), a speed-freak knucklehead who rampages around the city beating the living hell out of anyone who looks at him funny. This is mediocre, mostly forgettable drama, but it leaves a nasty taste. You can imagine it screened at the Republican party convention as the warm-up to a law and order debate."
"Although this music documentary about Robbie Robertson and the Band is directed by Canadian film-maker Daniel Roher, the great Martin Scorsese takes an executive producer credit and is also interviewed briefly on screen. Sure enough, Once Were Brothers feels a lot like one of Scorsese’s distinctive rock docs, particularly The Last Waltz, his 1978 record of the Band’s last live gig – with crisper digital photography and nearly the same star power in the lineup of interviewees. While there’s no Joni Mitchell or Neil Young, you do get Bruce Springsteen rhapsodising about the Band’s influence and craftsmanship, while sometime Band cronies and collaborators of yore – including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Van Morrison – chip in with reminiscences about the good old days. As in Scorsese’s rock docs, there are reams of archive footage and rare snapshots to swoon over (Dylan’s striped trousers from 1967 never get old), all seamlessly edited together by Roher and Eamonn O’Connor. The terrifyingly industrious Robertson effectively narrates the story and takes centre stage, which is probably right considering how central he was to the outfit. Due credit is also given to the contributions from Garth Hudson as well as the three band members who have died: Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, and above all drummer Levon Helm. The last gets a loving tribute: recognition for his instrumentality to the original lineup, praise for his musicianship and awe for his wildly free spirit. The story about Helm taking a sabbatical in the early days to work on an oil rig off the Gulf Coast is enough to make one nostalgic for a time when musicians were workers before they were celebrities. It’s a little disappointing – if hardly surprising given the period covered – that there are hardly any women interviewed here, or even featured in the flashbacks, apart from Dominique Robertson, Robbie’s ex-wife who offers an interesting side-eye view of the group. But them’s the breaks."
"A Kid Like Jake is an earnestly intended, seriously acted film, painful in various intentional and unintentional ways. It is by the TV veteran Silas Howard, who was the first trans director of the show Transparent, and adapted by Daniel Pearle from his own award-winning stage play. But it’s a film that strenuously avoids its own potential for satire or humour, averting its gaze from the #firstworldproblems issue. Claire Danes and Jim Parsons play Alex and Greg, a well-to-do New York couple: she’s a former lawyer turned stay-at-home mom and he’s a therapist. They have a bright, imaginative four-year-old, Jake (Leo James Davis), and like many parents in their milieu, they have allowed themselves to get obsessed with getting Jake into an exclusive private pre-school. This aspiration may sound ridiculous and snobbish but the film asks you to take it – and Alex and Greg – seriously at some level. The couple’s teacher friend Judy (Octavia Spencer) has noted Jake’s love of Disney heroines and dressing up in fairy gowns, and suggests to Alex that on the application form she should really emphasise Jake’s “gender-expansive play” because top-ranking schools are very concerned with diversity. And Alex, however keen she is to get into these elite institutions, has to suppress her conflicted emotions. It would be interesting to see what Neil LaBute or David Mamet would do with such an idea, or if they might present a debate about whether four is too early to be thinking about diversity in these terms. But debate in that sense is resolutely absent here. Oddly, there are hardly any scenes in which the parents interact with Jake (he is offstage in the play) and no one actually says the words “gay” or “trans” (although there is one abusive insult); it’s as if the drama is concerned to mimic the walking-on-eggshells diplomacy of the teaching professionals who have to engage with Alex and Greg. Danes gives it her very considerable best, but there is something weirdly inhibited about this movie."
"This is a horror comedy whose two constituent genres, like so much else in this style, cancel each other out: too funny to be scary and yet not funny enough to be funny. Two Heads Creek shows up like a would-be Ozploitation shocker and it’s lively enough, it hangs together and the anti-racist intentions are there. The screenwriter and star is Jordan Waller (who played Randolph Churchill in Darkest Hour). He is Norman, a nervous guy adopted at birth by a Polish woman in Britain along with his uptight sister Annabelle (Kathryn Wilder). Now grown up, the siblings have to deal with anti-Polish abuse from the locals and when they hear their birth mother was Australian they jump at the chance to meet her in her gruesomely named home town in the outback: Two Heads Creek.  They soon discover horrible things are going on, not unconnected with bigotry of the sort they’d hoped to leave behind: the movie riffs cheerfully on the Australian government’s international reputation for providing immigrants with what a former British prime minister called a “hostile environment”. The chopping and the splattering and the fine blood spray over appalled faces begins and the movie is targeted at a customer base who believe that this kind of thing is just automatically hilarious. They are things I find unhilarious and the all-important context here makes no difference to the unhilarity. Walker and Wilder sell it gamely enough – but it’s the sort of movie you need to smoke your body weight in weed to enjoy."
"With The Mole Agent, Maite Alberdi set out to make a film noir documentary about a spy in a nursing home. She did not expect it to transform into an aching meditation on isolation and loneliness. The Chilean film-maker told the Guardian she was initially toying with genre and form. In early scenes, she makes you question whether you’re even watching a documentary because of the heightened noir aesthetic – venetian blinds and high contrast lighting. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, follows the octogenarian Sergio Chamy who is hired by a private eye, Rómulo Aitken, to snoop around a nursing home. Gradually, life chips away at the Pink Panther playfulness of the premise, and the film settles into a sombre look at ageing and desperately hanging on to human connection. That journey, which for Alberdi is the accumulation of 300 hours of footage, flies by breathlessly in a 90-minute film. It began with a search for her lead. She landed at Detective Aitken’s office. He’s a former federal police investigator turned middle-aged private eye who had already handled four cases in nursing homes. As a documentary film-maker, Alberdi felt a connection to Aitken’s trade. He waits until he can find proof, just as she waits until the right scene appears before her camera. “I always say my budgets are to pay the crew to wait until the things that we are waiting for happen,” Alberdi said. They waited at Aitken’s office until the right case came along: a client wanted her mother watched to make sure she was being treated well inside a long-term care facility. These cases, Alberdi explained, are common, driven by the guilt of offspring who leave their parents in such institutions. The nursing home private eye, Alberdi said, is akin to the nanny cam. Aitken’s regular mole suffered a hip injury. He had to hire a new one. That led to a hilarious casting … erm … hiring process. We see various seniors in the interview chair responding to the help wanted ad. They’re baffled anyone would want to hire someone over 80. But they jump at the opportunity to break their moldy routines and be mentally stimulated with a new gig. The irony that entering a nursing home would be stimulating was not lost on Alberdi. When it came to that casting process, the documentary director did not take an impartial stance. “I fell in love with Sergio,” she said, explaining that she convinced Aitken to hire the soft-spoken and gentle 83-year-old widower. Chamy couldn’t navigate the camera on an iPhone, which would be deemed an essential skill in nursing home spycraft. The way he fumbles with tech in not so subtle ways lends the film much of its humour. But Alberdi felt he had the right disposition to be the film’s anchor, while embedded for months as the new resident in the senior home. She already had a crew on scene before Chamy’s arrival. The staff were told that her crew was making a documentary about daily life in a nursing home. That turns out to be closer to what the film became, since Chamy soon grew tired of spying. Despite all the deception, the film ended up being far more honest than intended. “Our heart was not in the case,” Alberdi said, explaining how her crew followed Chamy’s lead. Though he found his “target”, made contact and regularly checked in on her wellbeing, his undercover dispatches to Aitken grew less frequent. The gentle spy grew resentful of his boss and the covert job. Instead, Chamy befriended other residents and turned his attention to them. And the documentary became about the long-term care home’s social dynamic. Early scenes show the predominantly female residents watching the cameras suspiciously, reminding each other that those boom mics are listening in on their conversations, as if they too had secret agendas. But eventually they ignore the crew’s presence and carry on, often fawning over Chamy, who was one of only a handful of men in that home. Alberdi explained that the gender breakdown in this particular nursing home is not common in Chile. Men are usually dumped in homes, while women are kept with the children or grandchildren they raised. However, this particular home goes back decades, with a clientele largely made up of women who never married, had children or found their independence with careers. Alberdi pegged the home as a portrait of a patriarchal generation. “Your life makes sense if you get married,” Alberdi said, describing the sentiment that led to many of these women arriving at the home in their 50s, deposited there as though they did not belong in society. In that way, The Mole Agent feels disquietingly similar to Alberdi’s 2016 documentary, The Grown-Ups. That film is a compassionate portrait of young adults with Down’s syndrome who desperately want independence and resent being infantilized. Both films, for Alberdi, are about people that society refuses to integrate. They’re kept isolated because they are deemed too dependent – or rather, too much work. In The Mole Agent, Alberdi homes in on the micro-society the women and the nurses build for themselves, and how Chamy navigates that. In scenes that alternate between humour and heartbreak, he brings them conversation and comfort. He helps them cope, and when needed, stand on their own two feet. He keeps the home’s resident kleptomaniac in check, returning stolen necklaces to their owners with a gentle nod of disapproval towards the amusing culprit. And, if only for a short while, he entertains the amorous eyes of women like Berta. “I would consider giving God my virginity through my future husband,” says the simultaneously pious and randy Berta, who’s been in the home for 25 years. Alberdi’s film is particularly attentive to how Catholicism, patriarchy and female sexuality can thrive at once in this environment. That one line from Berta nails it all. The sadness that throbs throughout the film swells near the end, when the women in the home pour their heart out to Chamy about missing their families and being left behind. With that emotional finale, Alberdi expected her film to inspire a conversation in Chile about the loneliness and depression experienced by seniors. But Covid-19 did that instead. The pandemic forced long-term care facilities across the globe into intensive lockdowns. The ageing population, who are the most vulnerable to the virus, are now no longer able to receive visitors. Their isolation intensified. But the world started paying attention. “I read the newspaper on Saturday and there were pages speaking of depression in old people,” said Alberdi. She sees a silver lining in the current situation. She rarely witnessed a visit or a call from family to residents during her months at the nursing home. But now, during the pandemic, Alberdi said she’s noticed that people are regularly checking in on their parents or grandparents in senior homes. Seniors, who she couldn’t trust to handle iPhone cameras, are now jumping on Zoom calls with their grandchildren."
"A maze of a movie, in which the walls are closing in and the exit is through a constantly shifting Escher staircase of a storyline: the latest from Charlie Kaufman blends metaphysical sleights of hand with a mounting chill of choking panic. This is Kaufman’s second screenplay to be based on a novel, but unlike Adaptation’s meta-dissection of the processing of adapting Susan Orlean’s The Orchid Thief, here he attempts to get into the skin, or at least the sensibility, of Iain Reid’s 2016 book. We already knew that Jessie Buckley is something special. But she’s fully miraculous in the central role of a young woman who has agreed to meet her boyfriend’s parents (a frazzled Toni Collette and David Thewlis) on their isolated farm, even as the snow begins to fall and the angst sets in and she is “thinking of ending things”.  She is introduced as Lucy, but slips into other names (and other clothes and other voices) as the film weaves onwards. Perhaps describing her as the central role is misleading – there’s a friable, mercurial quality to the character that seems to repeatedly crumble and re-form, like a sand sculpture. But the authenticity of Buckley’s performance, which seems all the more remarkable when you think back over it than it does when you are watching her, gives the character a solidity, while the other characters drift around her like ghosts. This is not cinema that leaves you feeling good about things. Nor does it tread a familiar path. But I’m Thinking of Ending Things is one of the most daringly unexpected films of the year, a sinewy, unsettling psychological horror, saturated with a squirming dream logic that tips over into the domain of nightmares. Buckle up for this one and make sure you’ve stocked up on your meds."
"Onur Tukel’s 2016 “black and blue comedy” Catfight is catharsis by proxy. It goes without saying that the world is absurd and there’s a lot to be mad about. It’s far from a new sentiment but still, it’s one most keenly felt this year in particular. Pandemics, protests, presidents – it barely scratches the surface of the things we’re getting riled up about in 2020, whether righteously or not. But where to turn to release all that building tension? You watch someone else do it in your stead, of course. Catfight is simple in concept and execution – two entitled, upper-class women meet multiple times over the duration of the film to do little more than beat the absolute living snot out of each other. There’s more to it than that, sure – most glaringly, a pointed if a little boggling indictment of US imperialism and the war on terror, but if we’re being honest, there is nothing so thrilling as watching Anne Heche beat up Sandra Oh so badly that she ends up in a coma. It’s hard to believe that Veronica (Oh), a haughty, wine-fuelled trophy wife to a not-so-secretly closeted businessman, used to be friends with Ashley (Heche), a struggling lesbian artist who berates her baby-voiced assistant and doting wife, alike. But college is a far cry from the cutthroat nature of New York high society and when Veronica sees Ashley working as a caterer at her husband’s party, the smugness she doesn’t even attempt to hide at seeing her old friend fall so low, is truly deserving of the finishing KO Ashley will deal her in under five minutes’ time. But with the final blow does not come absolution, there is no sense of vindication or justice. The film and the actors alike go a long way to conveying the nuances of both women – Ashley is not an underdog dishing out just deserts and Veronica isn’t some black-hearted villainess. Ashley’s ambition and demand for recognition is her worst quality but her desire to start a family with her wife, Lisa (Alicia Silverstone), slightly softens her sharp edges. Veronica on the other hand is sniping and conceited but her ignorance over the state of her marriage and regret over not engaging with her son more bring a needed element of sympathy to the character, due to Oh’s earnest portrayal. Granted, these two women are largely unpleasant but the film makes it pertinent to understand that neither are more or less deserving of support or what hardships await them. And many hardships there are. The next fight, years later, doesn’t take you by surprise like the first one does, but it’s just as brutal. To call it the female version of David Fincher’s Fight Club at first seems flippant but soon feels quite apt. While the men in Fight Club are bored with their lives and seek release in basement brawls, the women of Catfight do not have such a luxury – overwhelmed by what life has dished out, they have hit a limit, with no other choice but to lash out and not without consequence too (as there often are for women). The fight does not bring glory or peace of mind, just heartache and more pain than maybe it’s worth – and what is more womanly than that? Catfight is sexy in title alone – there are no barely clad women pawing and scratching each other. It’s mesmerising but not remotely romantic. These aren’t two well-oiled gladiators stepping to the plate to defend home and honour, they are two big cats, brutish and volatile, swiping at each other’s necks. Their instincts are base and they are out for blood, which they get in abundance. The fights are a cacophony of comic book-esque jabs and hits, interspersed with Beethoven’s Symphony No 5. Both the cracking impacts of the punches and the sheer gall to get involved in a street fight while wearing white jeans will leave you wincing. It’s horrific but feels inevitable, natural, even. There’s little room in Catfight to hash out the morals of wrong and right. Both parties do untold damage to each other, both deal with loss, helplessness and rage – “You remind me of someone” says the orderly assisting Ashley in her physiotherapy at the same hospital Veronica was ejected from two years prior. She snipes at him much in the same way Veronica did – quite frankly, both these women are as bad as each other. But the thought of comeuppance is at the back of this film’s mind, there is far more consideration of the violent act itself, the matter of rage and the ways in which we release it, being the focal point. Which in itself is a thrill to witness. It is unimportant why you’re angry, just that you are. At a time when collective rage has hit a new peak but propriety dictates that regardless of how you’re feeling, no, you really shouldn’t start a fight club to deal with pent-up frustrations (for one, it wouldn’t be social distancing compliant), Catfight gives you permission to feel the upset and simultaneously provides an acceptable outlet. There’s a lot to be mad about in this world we live in, sure, but at least this film isn’t one of them."
"In This is Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist of the world’s loudest rock band, surprises the film’s director, Marty DiBergi, with a delicate piano composition that seems far removed from the heavy-metal sludge of songs like Hell Hole, Sex Farm, and Big Bottom. Nigel refers to it as a “Mach” piece – a fusion of Mozart and Bach – and intends it as part of a musical trilogy in D minor, which he calls “the saddest of all keys”. DiBergi thinks the piece is beautiful and asked him what it’s called. Nigel stops chewing his gum momentarily and deadpans: “Oh, this piece is called Lick My Love Pump.” Perhaps the similarities are merely coincidental, but the most important scene in Five Easy Pieces plays out in essentially the same way. Only here it’s Jack Nicholson behind the keys as Bobby Dupea, doing a soulful rendition of Chopin’s Prelude in E Minor, which at a minimum sounds like the second saddest of all keys. Though part of an upper-class family of classical musicians, Bobby hasn’t sat on a piano bench since returning to home to Puget Sound, Washington, but he’s willing to make an exception for his brother’s fiancee, Catherine (Susan Anspach), because he wants to get laid. (That’s another thing he and a rock musician like Nigel have in common.) The performance moves Catherine to tears, just as Bobby intended, but her reaction stirs the contempt and self-loathing that’s always simmering below the surface. He tells her it’s the easiest piece he could think of, and that he played it better when he was eight years old. If she believes it reflects some heretofore masked inner feeling, she is mistaken. “I faked a little Chopin,” he says. “You faked a big response.” That doesn’t mean Catherine is wrong to notice some flicker of soul in that moment – later scenes reveal that he really does feel something for her – but Bobby has spent his adult life trying to extinguish it. He won’t allow her to see the real him, whoever that might be. Fifty years later, Five Easy Pieces still puts us in Catherine’s shoes, puzzling over this charismatic mess of a human being. After spending the better part of the 60s stealing scenes in independent films like Little Shop of Horrors and Easy Rider, Jack Nicholson announced himself as a leading man with Bobby Dupea – and, in turn, introduced a decade where flawed characters like him were possible. In the hands of a lesser actor – or even a very good actor – Bobby could come off as a sour, abusive drip, unworthy of our interest, much less our sympathy. But Nicholson plays the audience like Bobby doing Prelude in E Minor, utterly confident that he’ll seduce us into caring about a man who’s incapable of returning the love he attracts so effortlessly. The timing of Five Easy Pieces is uncanny, coming just after a decade spent by Nicholson in independent cinema – before he was truly ready to infiltrate Hollywood in the 70s. Though the film was distributed by Columbia Pictures, the production company behind it – then called Raybert Productions and later known as BBS Productions (for producers Bob Rafelson, Bert Schneider and Stephen Blaunder) – was a flag-bearer for New Hollywood, which would import the exciting, iconoclastic work coming out of Europe at the time. Rafelson, who directed, and the screenwriter Adrien Joyce (AKA Carole Eastman), who had written The Shooting for Nicholson and the director Monte Hellman three years earlier, made a film of almost radical modesty, a character study with the richness and interiority of a great novel. And as with all great novels, it’s the smallest details that matter. The earliest scenes in Five Easy Pieces set the parameters of Bobby’s blue-collar life around the oilfields of Kern county, California: the grueling physicality of working on a rig; his contentious domestic life with Rayette (Karen Black), a waitress he’s comfortable mistreating; a bowling outing during which he insults Rayette while flirting shamelessly with the women in an adjacent lane. It isn’t until later, when he meets his sister Tita (Lois Smith) at a recording studio in Los Angeles, that we learn that he’s running from his past as a classical pianist of impressive musical stock. When Bobby learns that his distant father has suffered a debilitating stroke, he makes the drive to Puget Sound for a visit. But he’s so intent on separating his past from his present that he deposits Rayette in a motel and heads to the island alone. The big standalone scene seems like an anomaly, with Bobby castigating a waitress for not allowing him to order a simple side of toast with his omelet. His workaround for the restaurant’s “no substitutions” policy is to ask for a chicken salad sandwich sans everything – “I want you to hold it between your knees,” he says of the chicken – and he winds up sweeping the waters across the table in frustration. It’s a funny moment in a film with few of them, but it’s also Bobby in a nutshell: it’s no coincidence that he’s directing his anger toward a woman who shares his girlfriend’s occupation. It’s not out of character for him to combust so dramatically. And, in the end, he doesn’t even get the toast he wanted. But who knows what he wants? Bobby operates by impulse, which allows him to chase short-term desires like bedding women and getting toast with his omelet, but leaves him existentially adrift. Unlike the restlessness in a film like Easy Rider, which looks dangerous and cool and a lot like freedom, Five Easy Pieces is about the terrible uncertainty of being unmoored from any kind of satisfying life. The masterful closing sequence, like an elegant short story in itself, leaves the impression that Bobby will never find one, either. It’s possible to see Five Easy Pieces as representing the fallout after a turbulent decade – akin to the “what now?” final shot of The Graduate – but that would deny the specificity of a film that actively resists making statements. If it was representative of anything, it was the potential of what American film could be."
"Inaccurately titled horror film The Unfamiliar purees together an assortment of tired tropes with just enough originality and admirable craftsmanship to make 89 minutes of jump scares and twists visible from outer space reasonably bearable. Its first move is to make us wonder whether main protagonist Izzy (Jemima West), a British army doctor just home from Afghanistan, is really picking up on weird supernatural shenanigans in her rural home or suffering from acute post-traumatic stress disorder. Something definitely doesn’t seem right with her husband Ethan (Christopher Dane) who has suddenly shifted away from studying Polynesian totems (there’s a particularly scary looking one in the baby’s bedroom) in favour of writing children’s fiction. Meanwhile, her pre-adolescent son (Harry McMillan-Hunt) seems to be hiding secrets, and her adolescent daughter (Rebecca Hanssen) is acting just like, er, a stroppy teenager. In a somewhat witty reversal of expectations, CCTV camera footage of what Izzy thought were freaky events with demonic presences reveals nothing is there at all. Or is there? Somehow, it all comes to a climax when the family goes on holiday to Hawaii, which is at least a mildly novel setting for horror hijinks. If director Henk Pretorius demonstrates little more than mere competence in building atmosphere, at least he and his casting directors can spot talent in child actors. Both McMillan-Hunt and Hanssen are genuinely terrific as the troubled kids, projecting ambiguous signals about whether they’re possessed or just hormonal. It’s not entirely clear, but I believe they are supposed to be Izzy’s stepchildren, which makes this an interesting gloss on the usual family dynamics of fairytales, where the stepmother is meant to be the bad guy, not the kids. Elsewhere, Robbie Drake’s creature effects designs are effectively spooky and the use of white contact lenses never ceases to be creepy, however familiar it is as a sign of malignancy."
"The premise is the Fantasy Football of drama: imagine a select bunch of historical figures, together in one room, putting the world to rights. Tom Stoppard’s play Travesties (Lenin, Tzara, James Joyce) set the trend, and more recently, Kemp Powers’s 2013 play One Night in Miami imagined a summit between four African-American legends: Malcolm X, Cassius Clay (soon to become Muhammad Ali), football hero turned movie star Jim Brown and soul legend Sam Cooke. In fact, these four really did meet in Miami in February 1964. Powers has now adapted his play for the debut feature by actor and director Regina King (TV’s Watchmen, Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk). King opens out Powers’s drama somewhat, notably in an extended intro, but the action is largely restricted to a single hotel room. The occasion for the meeting is the Clay-Sonny Liston fight in Miami – after which Malcolm X summons the other three to celebrate Clay’s championship win. The guests expect a party, only to find that their sober-minded host intends an evening of “reflection” – with ice cream the only refreshment. The ensuing conversation reveals the tensions underlying a pivotal moment for black America: Clay (Eli Goree) is about to join the Nation of Islam, only to learn that his mentor Malcolm is leaving the movement. Brown (Aldis Hodge) is planning to hang up his helmet and act full-time, while Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr), already a massive soul star, is musing over the meaning and value of his artistry. The most heated moment comes when Malcolm X berates Cooke for not writing a song as politically eloquent as Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind. Soul fans will guess that before long, we’ll hear Cooke performing a number of his own that proved just as inspiring an anthem of its time. King, cinematographer Tami Reiker and designer Barry Robison mount a vivid, meticulous evocation of the period, with locales including poolsides, sports stadiums and the venues where Cooke sings. But the film is above all an enclosed talking piece for four terrific actors. Perhaps inevitably, Goree’s Clay lights up the screen whenever he talks – revealing the acuteness and sensitivity beneath the showmanship – with Hodge’s Brown as a saturnine, sceptical foil. But the meat of the meet lies in the interplay between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke – not least, perhaps, because we know their deaths were just around the corner. British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir is magnetic as the careworn, austere political leader, evoking the tenderness and well-concealed joie de vivre underneath the severity, while Odom’s Cooke shows self-examination as well as radiant insouciance. This is undeniably a very theatrical film, but it never hides that – indeed, it makes the most of a certain claustrophobia. It’s an immensely watchable evocation of a moment when black America was on the verge of an upheaval that continues to resonate, in 2020 as strongly as ever. It absolutely puts you – to coin a phrase of the time – in the room where it happened."
"Mathieu Kassovitz’s classic of banlieue rage has been rereleased after 25 years with a new urgency and relevance in the Black Lives Matter era. What comes across now isn’t the “hate” of the title, more the aimless, directionless comedy of three guys hanging around, bantering and squabbling about things such as which cartoon character is the most badass. It is touches like this which make you realise how very 90s it all is, similar to Tarantino and Trainspotting (with a nod to Taxi Driver’s “You talkin’ to me?” scene) but it also has a little something of the French New Wave, the world of Jacques Rivette’s Paris Belongs to Us, all of which influenced the later Americans. It’s a film about which I’ve had fluctuating views. Perhaps as a result of having watched it so much, I greeted the 10th-anniversary rerelease with some grumpy contrarianism. Now I think it simply looks superb. The age of Jacques Chirac’s presidency dawns uneasily (an official portrait is glimpsed in one scene) and in a tough inner-city estate outside Paris, the neighbourhood is waking up to the grim aftermath of a violent protest against police brutality, which has put a man in hospital in critical condition. His friend Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is simmering with rage, threatening to kill a cop with the police-issue gun he’s stolen, a gleaming snub-nose Smith & Wesson revolver; meanwhile, he is hanging around with his friends Hubert (Hubert Koundé) and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) with nothing much to do but wait for the next explosion of rage. There’s a gallery of well-known and (then) up-and-coming French actors in smaller roles: Vincent Lindon is a drunk bloke who turns up just as the trio is trying to steal a car; Philippe Nahon (who worked on Melville’s classic policiers and later became the totemic “Butcher” in Gaspar Noé’s movies) is the grizzled police chief who tries to break up a rooftop barbecue, Karin Viard is a Parisian art-lover – a rare female presence – and Kassovitz himself has a cameo as a neo-Nazi skinhead. The effervescent energy of this film keeps foaming away under everything; especially under its most amazing sequence: as one guy blasts out music from his decks at the high window of a tower block, Pierre Aïm’s camera ethereally floats out over the rooftops looking down, a moment that departs from the tense mood of the scenes either side of it and has surely influenced the drone camerawork of Ladj Ly’s new banlieue film Les Misérables. (But Kassovitz didn’t have drones in 1995. How did he get that shot?) Of all the figures in La Haine who stand out, the most startling is Vincent Cassel, making his breakthrough in his late 20s, a man on a hair-trigger with a face like an inverted triangle, sharp as a blade. The late critic Philip French described Cassel best, calling him “fiercely uningratiating”. It is Cassel who supplies the rocket-fuel of resentment; without him, Taghmaoui and Kounde might have been simply too laid-back, although again I’m not sure that Cassel is projecting “hate” as such. Our three musketeers are to come across some bizarre things on their travels, including a cameo from Tadek Lokcinski as an elderly Pole in a public toilet who emerges from a stall to tell them all about the importance of defecating regularly. There is also a very shrewd and disturbing scene in which two cops school a younger colleague in violent interrogation and the art of not going too far. The movie is bookended with the famous non-joke about the guy who falls off a skyscraper and, as he falls, people can hear him optimistically murmuring: “So far, so good … so far, so good…” A brutal landing is imminent, the movie implies, a horrible violent reckoning of racial injustice. For 25 years since La Haine came, it seems as if the fall has been continuing and the definitive landing has still not happened, or rather that we get the fall, the landing, then another fall. The violent descent has been contained and normalised. It’s more a case of “So far, so bad … so far, so bad…” La Haine is an unmissable response to an unending emergency."
"Max Richter is the genre-defying composer who works for movies, TV, theatre and the concert hall. This documentary by Natalie Johns is about what many consider his magnum opus: Sleep, from 2015 – an eight-and-a-half-hour composition with 204 movements in a plangent, ambient and mellow vein, featuring strings, synthesisers and a soprano, designed to be listened to while you are asleep. Richter has staged many spectacular overnight performances in venues where audiences are provided with camp-beds, and this film focuses on an open-air event in the Grand Park in Los Angeles. Audiences were invited to fall asleep, stay awake, tune in, tune out, and – presumably – traipse back and forth to the loos at 4am. This toweringly quixotic work is Richter’s rebuke to the frantic pace of our modern age (which is itself, arguably a form of anaesthesia), although he confesses that it cost him sleep: it was a supremely uncommercial project that had to be worked on at night, after a full day’s work on the movie music that paid the bills. It is a beguiling film, perhaps because Richter’s work is beguiling. However, it cheats a bit in showing the LA performance; the music we’re hearing appears to come from the studio, not live, something that hits you when you a notice a delivery truck with flashing lights glide in eerie silence behind the orchestra. So, is Sleep any better or different from the thousands of hours of chill-out music being provided by DJs all over the world? Well, it’s up to audiences to decide. I was reminded of a showing of Andy Warhol’s five-and-a-half-hour film Sleep, from 1964 – simply showing a man asleep – during which a member of the audience stormed up to the screen and shouted: “Wake up!”"
"In November 1970, Dennis Hopper flew from Taos in New Mexico to dine with Orson Welles in LA. Hopper was in the midst of producing The Last Movie; Welles was busily prepping The Other Side of the Wind. Both these productions would later famously combust, but on that evening in late fall, their creators were feeling optimistic, all-powerful. Welles flattered Hopper and said that he should one day play Jesus. They broke bread together in what now looks very much like a film-makers’ last supper. Hopper/Welles is the periodically fascinating, generally exasperating record of that meeting, an unearthed black-and-white home movie in which the two men get drunk and speak their minds on everything from Buñuel to Visconti, John Wayne to the Fondas. The order of the title’s star billing is intentional and unavoidable, since Welles keeps a hand-held camera trained on Hopper throughout and is content to play the role of off-screen interrogator. Flushed from the success of Easy Rider, Hopper had briefly found himself hailed as the saviour of American cinema. This film catches the one moment in his life, perhaps, where he could dare to regard Welles as the junior partner. Playing out of competition at this year’s Venice film festival, the restored footage is an intriguing relic – an offcut, raw copy. There’s something pleasingly voyeuristic about the experience of being allowed behind the velvet rope to watch these blusterers hold forth, although I expect their charms may be limited to die-hard devotees. Others will find it too much of a good thing. Give these two enough velvet rope and they’ll hang themselves with it. Eyes darting, giggling nervously, Hopper angles to turn the conversation to sex. He explains that he only became a director because he “wanted to get some more pretty ladies” but admits that basically all he’s ever wanted is to sleep with his mum. Forced off this topic, he tells a jaw-dropping story about Elvis Presley, making his first film at the age of 21 and believing that everything in the movies was true, that all the punches were real; that all the guns fired bullets. Elvis said that he could handle the fight scenes just fine, but he was concerned because the script also called for him to hit a woman and he’d never actually done that before in his life. As for Welles, he’s opaque. The great man dislikes Antonioni, scorns leftwing activists and claims to have never heard of Bob Dylan. But is this Welles’s own ignorance, or is it an affectation, a pose? Hopper would eventually take a cameo in The Other Side of the Wind and the dinner is at least in part a dress rehearsal, with Welles dipping in and out of character as the film’s main protagonist, a director named Jake Hannaford. “You’re a hard man to talk to, Jake,” Hopper giggles at one point. One gets the distinct sense that the feeling is mutual. This loquacious, long-winded affair works best as a snapshot of two men in time: the callow young gun who’s just struck gold and the legendary old campaigner who remembers all too well how that felt. Welles (or perhaps Hannaford) is interested in Hopper and suspicious of him, too. He grills the man for hours and appears to find him wanting. And the longer it lasts, the more Hopper starts to squirm. He’s unprepared, inconsistent. He’s like a smart-aleck student sitting a university exam. “I’d love the chance to change the world, any way that I could,” he splutters. “Whether it’s movies or whatever.” “How can you say that?” Welles snaps back. “Now that’s a nice smarmy statement meaning nothing. It’s charming and it’s lovable but it makes no sense at all.” And so on they go, as the clock ticks towards midnight. Welles frustrated by Hopper; Hopper tormented by Welles. Wherever these two men are today, one hopes for their sakes that they are not there together."
"Sally Potter’s The Roads Not Taken is a sad, painful, self-conscious vignette of a film with forthright performances; it’s a chamber piece in many ways, but with bold flashback excursions that come close to causing its emotional engine to overheat. Javier Bardem plays Leo, a writer in New York who has suffered a stroke and now lives, by choice, in a grim single room, attended by a carer, Xenia (Branka Katic). The only person who still appears to love him is his daughter, Molly (Elle Fanning), who one chaotic day has to take him to the dentist and optician, while dealing (via her cellphone) with a stressful work situation. Meanwhile, Leo is plagued with memories of tragedy back in Mexico with his first love, Dolores (Salma Hayek), and also with a nervous breakdown he appears to have had in his later married life when Molly was a baby – perhaps the origin of his current state. He was spending time on a Greek island, theoretically working on a book, but really in retreat from his new American family, and he became entranced there by a beautiful young woman (Katia Mullova-Brind) – a dangerous, vivid epiphany that in his stricken state he cannot explain or express to Molly, however much he wants to and however desperate she is to understand him. This is a fervent performance from Bardem whose great, bull-like head, pulsing with contained spiritual pain, looms out of the screen. He is the paterfamilias, the sacred monster who exasperates and captivates his daughter and also his ex-wife – a peppery, unsympathetic cameo for Laura Linney. (Surely it can’t be long before Bardem plays Picasso?) The film seems sometimes to be reaching for ideas and moods that it cannot fully encompass, but I loved the rapport between Fanning and Bardem, especially when Leo mortifyingly has an accident at the dentist. Molly lends him her own trousers (she herself is wearing a long coat) and buys them both a matching pair of purple jeans from a discount store."
"“There’s a suicide born every minute,” quips cynical sports promoter Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy), as he watches figure eight racing drivers dropping – or rather, flipping – like flies. Indeed, the race, with its entropic intersection, seems like utter lunacy at first glance – a one-way ticket to crumpled steel and fatal injury. Yet there’s something uniquely seductive, even irresistible, about the spectacle: the mesmerising rhythm of crashes and crossovers; the music of purring engines and screeching tyres; the way the dust from the track, intermingled with wispy exhaust fumes, catches the glow of the floodlights; and of course, the aggressively masculine bravado of the winner. That last element in particular is what sucks illegal drag racer Rick Bowman (Richard Davalos) into the community, in Jack Hill’s sinewy and stylish 1969 B-movie, Pit Stop. Initially repulsed by the sight of so much destruction, Bowman eventually agrees to race for Willard after witnessing the maniacal showmanship of Hawk Sidney (a magnetically unhinged Sid Haig), the dominant force in the sport. The maddening grin, the provocative inflections in his voice, the girl on his arm, the air of invincibility – everything about Sidney sparks a competitive combustion that burns away Bowman’s uncertainties. Merciless ambition takes hold of the newcomer – the raging desire to beat Sidney on the track and take everything away from him, to crush the man and his myth, and usurp him as the very best. Jack Hill, like so many B-movie masters, began his career as an acolyte of the legendary Roger Corman, working in various capacities on the 1963 film The Terror. From there, his filmography is splattered with violent invention, from the demented horror comedy Spider Baby, to the swaggering Blaxploitation classic Coffy. Like a sleazy alchemist, Hill transmutes shoestring budgets into cinematic gold, melting down and reshaping scrap metal into distinctive, often beautiful art. Pit Stop, originally titled The Winner, might just be Hill’s best work, a blistering study of the ruthless, soul-shredding pursuit of excellence in the dark art of vehicular carnage. The film is astonishingly immersive, not just in its virtuosic, supercharged racing set pieces (miracles of documentary-style photography, dynamic editing and rear projection), but also in its vivid depiction of the specific subculture that crystallises around these pugnacious petrolheads. Hill’s camera, awash with Austin McKinney’s gorgeous, authentically atmospheric black and white cinematography, affectionately navigates the spaces in which the competitors work and unwind – from the greasy garages in which they tinker with their machines, to the smoky bars in which they drink and dance with their fawning fans. It’s a vibrant ecosystem on the margins of society, teeming with working-class craftsmen and daredevils. And it’s an ecosystem in which Bowman – a cool, solitary hunter – is primed to thrive. A disaffected, thoroughly unsentimental loner who begins the film behind bars, Bowman falls hard and fast for his new vocation, which offers him an ideal balance between adrenaline and tranquillity. There’s the perilous self-expression of the race itself, him against the world, an extreme test of focus and a volcanic outlet for his nastiest impulses. And then there are the interstitial moments, set to the bluesy bass and fuzzy guitars of the psychedelic band the Daily Flash, during which he meditates through the processes of scavenging for parts and suturing his crippled vehicle back together. Routine becomes ritual, and ritual becomes obsession. Bowman tumbles unceremoniously out of his first few races. No matter – return to the garage, rebuild, refine and race again with a vengeance. Davalos is probably best remembered for his debut role in East of Eden alongside James Dean, but he was never better than he is here in Pit Stop. There’s an ominous sort of understatement, even minimalism, to his performance as Bowman – a constant sense of danger bubbling beneath the rigid crust. He infuses the driver with icy discipline, refusing to give anything away beyond a raised eyebrow, smothering emotions in their infancy. It’s a brilliantly controlled display of menace – a descent into remorseless inhumanity always seems only a rev of the engine away. The cost of Bowman’s meteoric rise, of course, is everything – friendship, love, libido and human life, are all wrecked and left to burn in a heap while he races on. Teammates are left to spin out, women are seduced and then spurned, until in the end all Bowman has left is his relationship with Willard, the devil in a suit on his shoulder, constantly whispering in his ear about bigger and better races that need to be conquered. The film’s most haunting image, strangely enough, is of the broken Hawk Sidney – once preternaturally expressive, now appalled beyond words as his ghastly rival walks away into a soulless future. Much more than just a micro-budget car film, Pit Stop is a devastating portrait of the empty shell that’s left behind when every last remnant of human connection is immolated at the altar of winning."
"Ostensibly an alternative biography of Laika, the stray mongrel who became the first cosmonaut, this film faithfully tracks her from her time on the streets of Moscow to her lonely demise in low Earth orbit. Incredible archive footage shows us Laika and a number of other dogs being subjected to a relentless barrage of exercises designed to mimic the incredible stress of space travel; it’s hard not to be affected by the footage knowing, as we do, that Laika is being led to an excruciating end. Space Dogs documents a cruel period in human history but the bleak tone the film-makers pursue throughout may not be the best way of dealing with it. It is designed, perhaps, to numb you to the horror of what you are witnessing but the unspeakable acts are presented without comment or context. There’s a secondary narrative here, with Laika’s story interwoven with the tale of a pair of strays navigating the barren streets of modern Moscow. Their story, presumably, is intended to mirror Laika’s intrepid journey, but the unremarkable footage acts as a drag on the film’s momentum. Narration is sparingly employed throughout, which is a shame given the quality of the writing; this is one of those films that could actually do with more exposition and insight. We see, for example, the post-mission project designed to memorialise Laika as a symbol of Soviet ingenuity – but we don’t hear from the men responsible for this state-sponsored torture. A defence of their actions would have given this otherwise beautiful-looking film a third dimension it’s lacking. Laika’s dead body is wonderfully described as a “cosmic flotsam” over the opening credits. It’s hard to shake the feeling that a genuinely arresting documentary was cast adrift somewhere along the line."
"The British actor John Boyega has criticised the treatment of characters of colour in the latest Star Wars films, saying they were marketed as important elements in the franchise but were ultimately “pushed to the side”. In an interview published by GQ magazine on Wednesday, Boyega expressed bitterness over how his role as stormtrooper Finn faded in the latter episodes of the trilogy which concluded with The Rise of Skywalker in 2019. “What I would say to Disney is do not bring out a black character, market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are, and then have them pushed to the side. It’s not good. I’ll say it straight up,” he told the magazine. He said fellow actors Naomi Ackie, Kelly Marie Tran and Oscar Isaac had suffered similar fates, while Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley had taken prominence in the lead roles as Kylo Ren and Rey. Boyega told GQ some people would accuse him of “making it up”, but the character hierarchy in The Last Jedi was hard to take. “They gave all the nuance to Adam Driver, all the nuance to Daisy Ridley. Let’s be honest. Daisy knows this. Adam knows this. Everybody knows. I’m not exposing anything,” Boyega said. He said Star Wars didn’t know what to do with characters of colour. “So what do you want me to say? What they want you to say is, ‘I enjoyed being a part of it. It was a great experience...’ Nah, nah, nah. I’ll take that deal when it’s a great experience.” Boyega became a viral sensation in June when he gave an emotion-packed speech at an anti-racism demonstration in London following the death of George Floyd at the hands of American police in Minneapolis. “I’m the only cast member who had their own unique experience of that franchise based on their race,” Boyega said of Star Wars. “Let’s just leave it like that. “It makes you angry with a process like that. It makes you much more militant; it changes you.” In his speech at the Black Lives Matter rally in London, he said: “Black lives have always mattered. We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless. And now is the time. I ain’t waiting.” In a social media post afterwards Boyega added: “I know you’re all thinking, what’s next? Where do we go from here? Because I’m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"
"As a child in the 1970s, writer-director Claudio Noce stood in the wings while a leftwing terrorist group – the Armed Proletarian Cells – targeted his father, Rome’s deputy chief of police. The trauma, he says, harried him all his life before finally finding a catharsis of sorts with the making of Padrenostro, which competes for the top prize here in Venice. This, Noce’s third feature, marks his moment of unburdening. Unsurprisingly, then, it’s a personal picture, agonised and self-questioning, almost to a fault. Noce’s alter-ego is Valerio (Mattia Garaci), an angelic-looking 10-year-old with a low-grade heart murmur and a penchant for solitary walks and wild flights of fancy. But his immediate surroundings feel horribly real. Wounded in an assassination attempt, his father Alfonso (Pierfrancesco Favino) now carries a handgun in his bag and flinches every time the front doorbell rings. Valerio isn’t sure what has happened or why, which naturally means that we’re in the dark, too. For most of its run, Padrenostro elects to view the harsh adult world from a child’s perspective. It’s like What Maisie Knew crossed with a supergrass gangster film. One day, kicking a ball in the street, Valerio meets a local tearaway, Christian (Francesco Gheghi), and the two become friends. Christian might be described as a fairytale creature, akin to a talking fox or a forest elf. He’s a teacher, a trickster; fun company but not entirely to be trusted. He is also, of course, Noce’s own invention, an aid to self-therapy. In real life the director was Valerio – but there was no kid called Christian. Should this be a problem? Ordinarily not. And yet, crucially, Noce himself seems in two minds as to how to properly fold the character of Christian in with his wider tale. Or rather, he tries to have it both ways, playing bait-and-switch with the audience to the point where one is tempted to throw up one’s hands. The kid has a habit of vanishing like a conjurer’s apprentice whenever an adult shows up, which leads us to believe that Christian’s an imaginary friend or a ghost. But then, wait, now some adults have started seeing him, which either means that he’s real, or that they’re all ghosts just like him. What can’t be faulted is Noce’s sheer boldness and ambition. If Padrenostro winds up as a bit of a mess, it’s a beautiful mess, a glorious mess: gliding from the palm-sweatingly tense scenes inside the family apartment to the sun-splashed coast of Calabria which again may be real, or some golden vision of the afterlife. Watching the film feels like taking a deep dive through the director’s subconscious, stumbling upon locked and barnacled chests perhaps even he has yet to prise open. In one early scene, just after the assassination attempt, young Valerio is handed a Super 8 camera by Alfonso’s best friend. “You want to shoot?” says the friend. “Look, it’s really easy.” And so the kid hoists the thing like a handgun and shoots his mum and his dad and his little sister by the window. Four decades later, he’ll turn the camera around and use it on himself."
"All rise for The Duke, a scrappy underdog yarn that makes a powerful case for the rackety English amateur, the common man who survives by his wits with the odds stacked against him. Kempton Bunton of Byker, for instance, is about as far removed from the Duke of Wellington as a frog is from a prince. But now the Duke is trapped behind the wardrobe in Kempton’s tatty back bedroom, which is one in the eye for the British class system and means that Kempton is sitting pretty, at least for a while. Roger Michell’s delightful true-crime caper comes bolstered by a terrific lead performance from Jim Broadbent, rattling about the red-brick terraces of early 1960s Newcastle. His Kempton Bunton is a wannabe playwright and soapbox revolutionary, a man who prefers Chekhov to Shakespeare because he feels that the Bard wrote too many plays about kings. By night he’s sitting up in bed reading books by George Orwell. By day he’s tilting at windmills, squabbling with shop-floor managers and getting under the feet of his pinched, knackered wife. As played by Helen Mirren, Dorothy Bunton is constantly cleaning up the mess left by her husband and her two adult sons. She says: “Be sure to use the coasters. You’re not in Leeds now.” The city of Leeds may be bad in its way, but the real problem is London; it’s taken leave of its senses. Down at the National Gallery, they’ve just spent £140,000 of public money to secure Francisco Goya’s portrait of Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington. “An outstanding example of late-period Goya,” sighs the curator. “Some half-baked portrait by a Spanish drunk,” says Kempton. He argues that the cash would have been better spent providing free TV licences for all the UK’s old age pensioners. Kempton, perhaps relatedly, has recently served a brief prison term for not paying his own TV licence. Michell and Broadbent previously worked together on 2013’s excellent Le Week-End, in which the actor played a middle-aged professor in meltdown, drunkenly singing along to Bob Dylan inside a poky Paris hotel. The Duke (scripted by Richard Bean and the BBC’s Clive Coleman) is a more obviously crowd-pleasing affair, precision-tooled but big-hearted. Michell does well in capturing a 60s north-east of belching chimney-stacks and rag-and-bone men; a limbo-land Britain, caught between the end of rationing and the birth of the Beatles. Kempton, one suspects, has both boots in the old world - but he can still dream of tomorrow. What a lovely, rousing, finally moving film this is. The Duke is unashamedly sentimental and resolutely old-fashioned in the best sense of the term: a design classic built along the same lines as That Sinking Feeling, A Private Function or 50s Ealing comedies. In an earlier era, the role of Kempton would have been played by Denholm Elliott or Alastair Sim. Hauled into court to account for the theft, Kempton is finally given the stage he’s been craving all his life. The man is an upstart, a liar, undeniably a crook. But he’s also an idealist, a committed socialist, and it is this side of Kempton that now comes to the fore. He teases the judge, jokes with the jury and explains that he puts his faith “not in God, but in people”. Meanwhile, up in the public gallery, sit his own band of people. The posh young woman who employs his wife as a cleaner. The exploited co-worker whom he once tried to defend. Individually, in Kempton’s view, these people are all just single bricks. But put them together and you make a house. Put them together and you build Jerusalem. "
"The directors of seven European film festivals shared the stage at the opening of the 77th Venice film festival to help kick-start an industry that they said was in danger of being usurped by streaming sites such as Netflix because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Venice head Alberto Barbera said film festivals might have a “reduced role” after the pandemic, which caused every major festival to cancel or offer a hybrid of online and physical screenings. Barbera said: “The feeling of watching a film on the large screen with other people is in the very nature of the film industry. We have to support cinemas. Many are still closed today, others will never open again.” The director added that the fight to reopen cinemas and get film festivals back in a physical form was a “battle for civilisation and for culture”. His statements were supported by a letter signed by the directors of seven other film festivals, including Thierry Frémaux of Cannes, and José Luis Rebordinos (San Sebastián) and Tricia Tuttle (London), who will both host physical festivals later this year. Barbera said that the Covid-19 pandemic had given streaming sites the upper hand in the battle for viewers, and that Netflix’s increasing subscriber numbers coupled with the permanent closure of cinemas could be fatal unless the industry showed solidarity. Frémaux, who was appearing on the stage of an event that has been Cannes’ biggest rival in recent years, added that festivals were able to give the industry a “positive thrust”, and that cinema at large needed that support now. He also warned of the ascendancy of what he called “TV platforms” during the coronavirus outbreak and said that streamers and physical cinemas and festivals needed to find a way to co-exist. He pointed to Marvel’s Avengers series as an example of films that worked both as a box-office hit and as a popular streaming option when Disney+ launched last year. Barbera was in defiant mood at the start of the festival, which is his last in charge and is taking place as Covid infections are rising again in Europe. He has defended his decision to host the event even though every other major festival has either cancelled or is hosting virtual screenings this year. As the festival opened, there were queues at nine thermo-scanners placed at entrances to the festival site on the Lido, and anyone with a temperature above 37.5°C was being denied entry. Face masks are mandatory at this year’s event, and other safety measures include socially distanced screenings and a tracking system for attendees. On Wednesday evening, Barbera, along with other festival directors including Carlo Chatrian (Berlin), will officially open the festival with a statement that bills the event as a show of solidarity with the film industry. The directors will insist that festivals are “not mere promotional showcases”, but are increasingly becoming “centres of culture”, and “opportunities for the cultural enlightenment of audiences and for education to beauty and to the richness of the film experience for young people”. Along with the release of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, which was the first major film to screen since lockdown measures closed cinemas around the world, the Venice event has now become a touchstone for an industry desperate to recovery. The event, which during Barbera’s tenure has become a rival to Cannes as Europe’s most significant film festival, has fewer stars than usual with Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Matt Dillon and Ludivine Sagnier among international talent expected to attend. This year’s event has a strong UK contingent as Hollywood names – for the most part – stay away, and Venice looks closer to home for film-makers, jury members and actors. Tilda Swinton is being given a lifetime achievement award and stars in Pedro Almodóvar’s 30-minute film The Human Voice, while The Souvenir director, Joanna Hogg, is part of the Golden Lion jury. Documentarian Luke Holland has a posthumous screening of Final Account, his film about the rise of the Third Reich, while The Crown star Vanessa Kirby has two films at the festival – Kornél Mundruczó’s Pieces of a Woman and Mona Fastvold’s The World to Come. British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir plays Malcolm X in Regina King’s directorial debut One Night in Miami, an adaptation of Kemp Powers’s play which was at the Donmar Warehouse in 2016, and is a fictionalised account of the night Cassius Clay (then about to change his name to Muhammad Ali) beat Sonny Liston while surrounded by friends including Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown. The Venice film festival opens on Wednesday and continues until 12 September."
"There is a wonderful exchange in Christopher Nolan’s latest film, Tenet, between Robert Pattinson and John David Washington. “Hngmmhmmh,” says Pattinson. “Mmghh nmmhhmmmm nghhh,” replies Washington. Marvellous.  This is how much of Tenet sounded to viewers in cinemas. The film’s dialogue has been criticised by reviewers and audience members for often being impossible to make out. Given how hard Nolan’s blockbuster would be to understand even if all the dialogue was crystal-clear, it is curious that the director has made it doubly difficult to hear the story of a screenplay he supposedly spent five years writing. But it isn’t just Nolan’s films. It’s a much-repeated claim that movie dialogue is becoming harder and harder to hear. What is going on? Mathew Price is a production sound mixer who has worked on The Sopranos and The Marvellous Mrs Maisel. “When they take the sound we record on set and kind of undermix it, it feels like, ‘What did we try so hard for?’” he says. Price believes the problem is partly that modern directors have so many more tracks to play with, causing “track overload”, the result being that “the dialogue gets short shrift a lot of the time”. When he watches films or TV shows at home, he turns on the subtitles in case of clarity issues – he is far from the only one – and will limit the TV’s dynamic range.(In cinemas the dynamic range – the range between the loudest and quietest sounds – is wider than on home TV screens, and, although the sound is compressed in the transition to TV, the range can still be so wide that you are forced to turn up the volume for dialogue, then down again for action.) Is it actually a modern phenomenon? Sound engineer Ron Bochar, who was nominated for an Oscar for his mixing on Moneyball, thinks so. “Think about it: the first few Star Wars [films], we heard them all. We heard all the lines. Listen to Apocalypse Now – you hear everything.” Price agrees: “If you watch old movies, you might hear some sound effects here and there but now they go nuts: somebody’s walking across the room in a leather jacket, you hear the zippers clink and the creak of the leather and every footstep is right in your face.” When television became commonplace in the mid-20th century and challenged cinema’s dominion, cinema needed to distinguish itself; it needed to prove that it could justify people leaving the comfort of their homes. It did so partly by becoming bigger and louder. In an era – and a pandemic – in which home streaming dominates, cinema may be forced to pull out the stops once more. “I think we’re bombarded,” Paul Markey, a projectionist at the Irish Film Institute, says of modern films. “The more expensive movies have got, the more of a bombardment they become on your senses.” For Bochar, the priority is dialogue. Working with other editors, his job is to layer a film with multiple levels of sound. As he adds layers he has to make sure he can still hear the words. “The first thing I do is create a solid dialogue track, and then everything else has to come up to it and not exceed it,” he says. “Somebody wrote the words and actors are saying those lines, so there’s got to be some priority.” He doesn’t know any re-recording artist who would deliberately obscure a story point. Sound effects and music tracks exist on faders that can slide up and down. This means that even “a crazy, batshit scene” with numerous layers of sound is easy for a mixer to control. “It really isn’t a mystery. We know how to do it.” This means that Nolan’s use of noisier Imax cameras in Tenet would not explain the problem, as some have suggested. To complicate matters, there is a disparity between the environment in which the director hears the final mix of a film and the one in which it is screened. Markey says Warren Beatty watched a screening of Bonnie and Clyde when it came out and couldn’t understand why the sound of the bullets was so quiet. The projectionist was turning the volume down. Beatty realised that projectionists, not directors, have final say on a film. Markey says that they could, for example, raise the volume of the dialogue specifically, but they never do – it would mean having to readjust it for every film. As with most problems, every department assumes that another department is to blame. Although many viewers claim that films are getting louder, Bochar says that the opposite is the problem: “All of us in the industry will tell you point-blank that generally every single cinema is playing it lower than it should be.” A studio’s reference level tends to be around 85 decibels, or 7 on the Dolby scale, he says. But cinemas will often play the film at 4 (around 75 decibels). The Irish Film Institute has been playing Tenet at 4, Markey says, because 6 was “ridiculously loud” when tested. Cinemas will not necessarily play a film at the recommended level of 7 if they feel it is too loud. In Nolan’s case, Price and Bochar are confident that the director does it intentionally. In a 2019 Reddit AMA, sound designer Richard King – who has worked with Nolan on seven films, including Tenet – said: “He wants to grab the audience by the lapels and pull them toward the screen, and not allow the watching of his films to be a passive experience.” It’s hard to imagine that Nolan is unaware of the criticism. Price suspects the director wants to make the audience work harder to understand the dialogue; he thinks Nolan believes this will make the film a more immersive, engaging experience. But, Price says, “I think he is the only one in the world who believes that.”"
"The ghosts of Victor Hugo’s downtrodden 19th-century rebels haunt Ladj Ly’s César-winning contemporary urban drama, a streetwise tale of France’s dispossessed masses, brought once again to the brink of rebellion. Nominated for best international feature at the 92nd Oscars (it lost out to Parasite), it presents a powder-keg portrait of broiling tensions, recalling both the pressure-cooker structure of Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing and even-handed vérité grit of David Simon’s monumental TV series The Wire. Taking care never to paint its complex characters in simple black-and-white strokes, this slips stealthily from astute observation to urgent action, reminding us of Hugo’s maxim that “there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.” We open in a moment of ironic harmony, as tricolour-clad revellers celebrate France’s 2018 World Cup victory, with the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe glittering in the background. But that harmony soon dissipates as our young antiheroes return to Montfermeil, the Paris district immortalised in Hugo’s 1862 novel. “It hasn’t changed much,” observes Stéphane Ruiz (Damien Bonnard), a street-crime cop newly transferred from Cherbourg. His colleagues, dubbed “the two biggest clowns” by the night patrol, are Gwada (Djebril Zonga) and Chris (Alexis Manenti, the film’s co-writer), who describes himself as “100% swine” and who “goes overboard sometimes” in policing “the brutality of the world”. Out on patrol, Stéphane learns of the warring factions who vie for control of these streets; from “the Mayor” (“our very own Obama”) to the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood (“a thug who grew a beard”), all equally reviled by Chris who behaves like a tin-pot bad lieutenant, harassing teenage girls and bullying young boys. The arrival of a travelling circus (“Gypsies, never a good sign”) and the theft of a lion cub bring an air of carnivalesque chaos, with little Issa (the remarkable Issa Perica) being thrown into the lion’s den – literally. Meanwhile, a drone camera piloted by a young peeping tom (played by the director’s son Al-Hassan Ly) offers a god’s eye view of unfolding events, capturing an act of shocking violence that threatens the precarious stability of the neighbourhood. As Salah (Almamy Kanouté) ominously warns: “You won’t avoid their rage.” Building on his César-nominated 2017 short film, Ly’s feature debut (which follows several acclaimed web documentaries) paints an admirably uncliched portrait of banlieue life, as vibrant and diverse as that of Céline Sciamma’s Girlhood. In stark contrast to the monochrome hues of Mathieu Kassovitz’s still-influential 1995 masterpiece La Haine, Les Misérables is shot in vivid colour by cinematographer Julien Poupard, whose cameras snake in and out of the action, with long takes (elegantly edited by Flora Volpelière) immersing us in this tangibly real world. There’s little sense of artifice, as young stars such as Issa Perica lend gripping veracity to scenes that might otherwise have seemed contrived or overwrought. I struggle to recall a more arresting image than that of Issa, bruised and bloodied, bursting into tears in the midst of a harrowing ordeal, only to rise again like a silent wraith in the third act, which plays like an inverted social-realist revisiting of Gareth Evans’s 2011 Indonesian action movie The Raid. A pulsing electro score by French music project Pink Noise adds sparse yet atmospheric accompaniment, with simple looping riffs building tension in key scenes, while more elegiac cues emphasise the strange melancholic beauty of the drama. It’s that sense of beauty – of the possibility of redemption – that prevents Les Misérables from being crushed by the grim weight of the world it depicts. It’s a world in which Ly grew up, and his love of these neighbourhoods, in all their hardscrabble glory, is tangible."
"Lacking much else, this VOD-bound actioner offers two unexpected comebacks for the price of one. The star is Mark Dacascos, erstwhile straight-to-video stalwart aiming to convert his nifty John Wick 3 cameo into a second leading-man career. Behind the camera is Wych Kaosayananda, formerly just Kaos, the wildly overhyped Thai tyro exported at the height of Hollywood’s millennial Asian-cinema fetish to oversee megaflop Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever in 2002. His latest is a baby step up from that – cheap, self-produced tat being preferable to aggressively expensive corporate tat – but still feels underpowered. Ironically, it’s the kind of B pic a studio would have bulked up, cut tighter and transformed into a halfway worthy rental prospect. The pitch would be Collateral updated for the age of Uber; it plays, alas, like Collateral with the handbrake on. Dacascos’s Kai is the mysterious stranger with a score to settle who jets into Bangkok at 4pm, hails the cab of fresh-faced Fha (Vanida Golten) and spends the next 12 hours shooting people clean through the forehead. Unusually for an action movie, there’s next to no real action for an hour: the plot sets Kai in front of his targets, and – pop – off we drive to the next location. We’re left with all the lowish-octane thrills that follow from watching a man ticking items off his to-do list, and Kaosayananda makes such a deathly plod of it that vast stretches appear to be proceeding in real time. Always one of the more likable DTV stars, Dacascos brings a supermarket own-brand appropriation of Keanu’s Zen chivalry to Kai’s task; we just about buy why Fha doesn’t kick him out after he starts bleeding all over her back seat. His future employment isn’t in doubt. However, bigger question marks hang over Kaos. He gives the Bangkok sights a basic nocturnal sheen – even reviving the kind of strip-joint safari we all thought went out with the demise of Nuts magazine – but also floods scenes with the deadest of dead air in a vain push for atmosphere, and seems to think two negligibly different angles of the same dull shot will make for a dynamic, DePalma-like split screen. Stick to the Murray Head song."
"Few directors this century have suffered a more precipitous decline in their critical reputation than Michel Hazanavicius. It was less than a decade ago that – hot off his terrific OSS spy spoofs, and newly flush with Weinstein Company support – Hazanavicius carried The Artist to Oscar glory. However, both his immediate follow-up The Search and Godard biopic Redoubtable were met with near-universal shrugs. The Lost Prince, a family-targeted fantasy sees the film-maker returning to the basics, possibly drawing on his personal experience as a father and bedtime storyteller: it’s very sweet, and quietly corrective not just in centralising a black father-daughter pairing, but plugging them into the kind of storybook universe western movies once deemed off limits to performers of colour. The plot turns on a feeling of being excluded. In a ramshackle tower block on the outskirts of Paris, we find mechanic Djibi (Omar Sy) bringing up Sofia (Sarah Gaye), a 12-year-old readying for her first weeks of big school. As she makes that transition – pulling away from her papa, in the direction of classmate Max (Néotis Ronzon) – Hazanavicius switches between reality and the kingdom Djibi conjures up before lights-out. This is a sprawling, American-style studio lot, presided over by Sy in tight, bright leggings as “The Prince”, a strutting, Fairbanks-like star of the nightly show, who finds himself locked out of his dressing room once Sofia declares that she’s too old for happily-ever-afters. One could easily imagine a director swamping this story’s human aspects with charmless CGI, but Hazanavicius staffs his fantasyland with character actors and grounds the action in the ups-and-downs of Djibi’s cramped flat. Sy provides an affectionate portrayal of a big goofball who might well embarrass his offspring, while Gaye displays an unusual maturity and directness for a juvenile lead. The sense of a family affair is bolstered by the presence of Hazanavicius’ wife Bérénice Bejo as a helpful neighbour. The film is a little well-behaved – success has apparently deprived Hazanavicius of the mischief that made the OSS films such a riot – but there’s imagination, heart and empathy here. Don’t close the book on this director yet."
"Who shall save cinema? Not James Bond apparently. There’s been a brand-new Daniel Craig spectacular ready to go since Easter, arguably just the thing to get punters’ actual bums back on actual seats. But Team 007 is wimping out, unwilling to splurge their product irreversibly into some potential new ruinous lockdown – and Disney has suffered a comparable bottle-loss, dumping its live-action version of the Mulan legend on to streaming services. So it’s up to the mighty Christopher Nolan to take the heroic, morale-boosting gamble and open his big new film in cinemas. Tenet is a gigantically confusing, gigantically entertaining and gigantically gigantic metaphysical action thriller in which a protagonist called The Protagonist battles cosmic incursions from the future while time flows backwards and forwards at the same time. There’s a 747 plane that crashes into a warehouse and then uncrashes back out of it, for reasons that are not immediately obvious. The palindromic narrative concept is epitomised by that coolly hi-tech, high-concept title (maybe Nolan briefly considered something similarly resonant like Radar or Noon). With its international locations and stunt set pieces along with all the temporal weirdness, it’s actually quite like a Bond film called No Time To Die To Time No. Of course it’s madly preposterous, and I sympathise with anyone who thinks that abolishing the cause-effect sequence to mess with “time” effectively cancels jeopardy and annuls suspense and moreover runs up against the illogic of what happens when the altered past meets the join of the unaltered present – what this film identifies as the “grandfather paradox”, though without solving the problem. And to some degree, all the film’s explosions (and implosions) are there to divert your attention from this basic insolubility. But for me, Tenet is preposterous in the tradition of Boorman’s Point Blank, or even Antonioni’s Zabriskie Point, a deadpan jeu d’esprit, a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility – but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination. As head-scratchers go, it’s a scalp-shredder, a skull-mangler. But it’s gloriously ambitious and I staggered out of the cinema, plucking off my face mask dizzy with Nolan-vertigo. (People wear face masks in the film also.) It’s also got moments of deadpan wit, surreality and style and Robert Pattinson may have singlehandedly made the double-breasted suit acceptable once more in men’s tailoring. Pattinson plays Neil, a dapper, and slightly louche British intelligence officer in Mumbai who makes contact with The Protagonist, played by a toughly unemoting John David Washington. The Protag, as no one calls him, is ordered by a shadowy American government agency to tackle a new cold war situation: an attack from the future from forces capable of reversing time. Washington is shown guns that suck bullets from the wall when you pull the trigger, an innovation he greets with a kind of mildly disapproving surprise, as if he is watching a TV news item about driverless Ubers. Who is going to make use of this terrifying technology and how is it to be countered? This leads our unnamed hero into contact with a mega-rich Indian contractor (elegantly played by Dimple Kapadia) and a creepy Russian oligarch (Kenneth Branagh) and his tragically poised and willowy wife Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). It is Debicki who has the most recognisable human emotions here, shouting, crying and even smiling in a way that no one else quite does, and her performance is very strong, though my tiny quarrel with Tenet is that it pinches ideas wholesale from the BBC adaptation of The Night Manager, and Debicki herself is called upon to play essentially the same role. As for Washington and Pattinson, they have to tamp down their natural warmth, though there are hints of what might even be called a bromance. But that is not the point: they are not ciphers exactly, but they are agents. The point is the phenomenal, dreamlike display itself, a vision of the end of the world. Maybe Nolan wants to meditate on the great palindrome of mortality: from dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return. Perhaps Tenet is not finally as challenging as his other temporal disruptor, the early masterpiece Memento from 2000, but there are such amazing moments in it – symmetrically recurring fist-fight scenes, revisited from different viewpoints, in which the combatants are apparently governed by different time-flows: one forward, one backward. It shouldn’t make sense. It doesn’t make sense. What it makes is amazing cinema. Wow."
"On the opening day of the Venice film festival, the arrivals are struggling to get their bearings. Things don’t work the way they did in the past. There’s a booking system to contend with and a mask policy to observe. We don’t know the names of many directors on the programme. We can’t recognise our friends and colleagues behind their myriad face coverings. It’s the 77th edition but it almost feels like the first. The new normal is weird; it’s going to take some getting used to. If the Venice selectors were looking for a fitting film to open this year’s Orizzonti sidebar, they could hardly have done better than Christos Nikou’s splendidly poignant and creepy Apples. As luck or fate would have it, this is a pandemic drama of sorts, spotlighting an outbreak of amnesia that afflicts the people of Greece. With a neat stylistic flourish, Nikou sets his tale in an ahistoric, analogue Athens, modern on the surface yet seemingly in thrall to cassette decks and instant cameras. At a time when memories are wiped and histories erased, physical media perhaps provide a crucial link with the past. The latest patient to be admitted to the “Disturbed Memory Department” is Aris (Aris Servetalis), aka Number 14842: a gaunt, bearded man who looks like Daniel Day-Lewis playing the role of Vincent Van Gogh. Aris is initially told to sit tight and wait for his family to claim him. But as the days tick by, the suspicion grows that his family has forgotten him just as completely as he’s forgotten them. Slowly, steadily, the city appears to be losing its connective tissue. Cases are increasing; the people are being rubbed clean. Nikou previously worked as an assistant director on Yorgos Lanthimos’s Dogtooth and he clearly came away infected. Apples, his debut feature, has the same deadpan sensibility and a similar line in mordant black comedy. Its action, moreover, unfolds across a series of unglamorous non-spaces (abandoned swimming baths; forlorn city parks) that might have already cropped up in Lanthimos’s 2011 film Alps. At one stage Aris rides a bus to the end of the line, right into the hinterlands, because he can’t remember his home address. I’ll admit to having a low resistance to – or perhaps a high tolerance for – the so-called Greek Weird Wave, with its reams of affectless dialogue, its unexplained absurdities and its depiction of a planet a shuffle-step removed from our own. But what prevents Apples from becoming a simple Lanthimos copycat is its comparative kindness and its abiding direction of travel. At the neurological hospital, the patients are eventually coaxed on to the “New Identity” programme, installed in fresh homes and encouraged to construct a kind of flat-pack personal history. Where a lesser director might have been tempted to point his tale towards darkness, Nikou – to his credit – adopts a more tender approach. Paired up with Anna (Sofia Georgovassili), a fellow amnesiac, Aris duly embarks on a stumbling route through an accelerated second childhood. This in turn is followed by a whistle-stop adolescence. If Nikou never quite liberates them from the shackles of the movie’s high-concept premise, he at least makes them care about these people and the new lives that they’re building. Apples aid memory. Music throws a lifeline. Towards the end of the film, Aris and Anna set forth on a jaunt out of town. They’re side-by-side and briefly happy – fumbling for the words of a song they can almost recall, at the wheel of a car that might even be theirs. "
"Troy Williams had his guard up when Katherin Hervey visited San Quentin state prison, where he was serving a life sentence for kidnapping and robbery. The director was there to record inmates for what would become the restorative justice documentary The Prison Within. Williams was the resident film-maker in San Quentin. He’s also the founder of the San Quentin Prison Report, a media company that produces radio and video from inside, giving inmates a voice and building a dialogue from within those walls. Until he was paroled in 2014, Williams kept an eye out for news and other media organizations entering the prison walls. He told the Guardian how he was wary that media would resort to fearmongering tactics, showing prisoners for what they were instead of who they are, stripping away their humanity and feeding into public a desire for carceral punishment, which favours longer sentences as a deterrent from crime. But Hervey, a former public defender, made Williams feel immediately comfortable. She was there to record a session with the Victim Offender Education Group (VOEG), a restorative justice program developed by the Insight Prison Project. In the film, men convicted of murder gather for unguarded therapeutic discussions. They accept responsibility for their crimes, weigh the hurt that they caused and identify the traumas in their own lives that contribute to their fateful decisions. Heartbreaking stories about abuse, poverty, survival and the loss of loved ones come to the fore. In an astonishing feat of empathy, the VOEG program pairs an offender with a “surrogate victim”, who is a person hurt by a similar crime, whether it be rape, robbery or murder. In tearful conversations, the offender and victim share their experiences and find common ground. In that way, restorative justice serves victims as well as the offenders, helping both heal from trauma to better reintegrate into society. Emotionally, victims are in a prison too. Williams, who is both a talking head and a credited cinematographer on The Prison Within, was a participant in the VOEG program. He later became a facilitator for a number of years. He currently lives in Oakland and, like Sam Johnson and Michael Nelson, other participants from the documentary, became a community leader advocating for restorative justice. Williams owns a company called Restorative Media and has given a Ted Talk on reintegrating back into society. He said he believed in restorative justice before he even knew what it meant. “It gave me a vocabulary for what my heart already knew,” he explained, describing the restorative process as gaining a mastery over emotions. He added that restorative justice has been in practice for centuries within indigenous and African communities, where an offender is held accountable to a village or a tribe. “It’s not like something happens, you just throw this person away,” he said. “You would find a way to reconcile with them.” Hervey and producer Erin Kenway, another former lawyer who practiced in high conflict domestic violence cases, said the intimate stories in their documentary anchors a conversation that stretches beyond San Quentin’s walls and the runtime of a single documentary. “Mass incarceration is this funnel of everything that is wrong,” Hervey told the Guardian, citing race, class and systemic oppression as widespread societal issues that contribute to marginalized people being over-represented in prisons. Kenway told the Guardian that lack of education, health resources and childcare are other contributing factors they didn’t cover in their documentary that also lead to mass incarceration; all are worthy subjects for another film. The Prison Within gestures towards the bigger picture while homing in on intimate accounts. Experts like Sujatha Baliga from the Restorative Justice Project explain how the current prison system in the US is criminogenic. Instead of healing, carceral punishment revictimizes, hurting inmates and their families; continuing a destructive cycle that begins with intergenerational trauma from slavery and colonization. The Prison Within can only touch on how the prison industrial complex operates like a new form of slavery, the argument laid out in Ava DuVernay’s documentary The 13th. The militarization of police is also outside the film’s scope, along with the trauma law enforcement inflicts on marginalized communities. But The Prison Within stays relevant to the current conversation on defunding the police, which has grown louder since the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the US. “We don’t need the overpolicing of communities that may have drug issues,” said Williams. “That’s a public health issue.” Like restorative justice, defunding the police is about healing and breaking the cycle that leads to mass incarceration. Protesters in the US call for divesting funds from a heavily militarized police force that could instead be used for education, mental health and other community supports. But opponents make defunding the police and steering away from carceral punishment sound like stretches of the imagination. Hervey admitted that, like systemic oppression, these systems are so deeply entrenched. Fixing them requires a complete mental and emotional overhaul. “We lock away what we don’t want to confront,” says the actor Hill Harper in his narration for The Prison Within, describing a system that is easier in the short term, but destructive in the long haul. Dionne Wilson is a beacon of hope in The Prison Within. She’s a former rightwing gun store employee whose police officer husband was shot and killed, leaving behind two children. Wilson, whose last name at the time was Niemi, rallied for the death penalty against the offender, Irving Ramirez. She has since been fighting to spare Ramirez’s life and abolish the death penalty. The Prison Within followed Wilson’s unexpected and inspiring transformation. She went from seeking retribution to finding empathy for her late husband’s killer. But while examples like Wilson are proof that humans who try hard enough can embrace the value of restorative justice, there are other examples that show the limits to that capacity. In 2016, NBC Bay Area reported on the impending choice California voters had to make between Proposition 62 and 66, which gave California voters the option to either abolish the death penalty or speed it up. In that report, Wilson spoke in favour of Proposition 62, while Marc Klaas rallied passionately in favour of Proposition 66. The latter’s 12-year-old daughter Polly was abducted, raped and murdered. And he wanted to make sure the man convicted of killing her served his sentence to the end. “We’re talking about baby killers, cop killers, serial killers, spree killers – and sexually sadistic psychopaths,” Klaas told NBC. When opposing restorative justice, media and politicians will prey on the community’s deepest fears while ignoring the humanity of the inmates themselves. California voted for Proposition 66. Even Williams admitted that harming a child would test his own capacity for empathy. “I’m pretty sure my thoughts are going to be not good,” he said. He wonders whether that reaction is conditioning or innate. “I want you to feel the pain that my loved one felt,” he said, describing the very reaction he had when his own brother was murdered. For Williams, time healed. “You have to be in a sad situation to take somebody’s life,” he said, finding the empathy for the person responsible for his brother’s death. “When you take a life, you feel that. That sits with your spirit. I’ve lived that."
" The musical biopic has long proved an irresistible format, synonymous with uplifting tunes, against-the-odds triumph and actors imitating famous performers. The genre is sparsely populated in Australian film and TV, however – some notable examples including Shine and The Sapphires, and the mini-series Friday on My Mind, INXS: Never Tear Us Apart and Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You. The latter, which stars Delta Goodrem in the lead role, began with you-know-what scene (“better shape up, doo doo doo!”), making it inevitable that if a Goodrem biopic were one day made – which of course would be called Born to Try – it would require at least one scene featuring an actor playing Delta playing Olivia playing Sandy: an inception of greasy musical goodness. Now we can add to the list director Unjoo Moon’s Helen Reddy biopic I Am Woman. It is a lean and likeable, if slight and a little trite, celebration of the legendary Australian-American singer, feminist and anthem-creator Helen Reddy, shot with a rich neo-noirish texture by Oscar-winning cinematographer Dion Beebe. The film’s emotional essence is reflected in that beautiful, bittersweet line from her most famous song: “Yes I’ve paid the price, but look how much I’ve gained.” The film, on Stan now, is about hard-fought success and breaking the glass ceiling, expressed through the narrative of a wide-eyed hopeful riding the midnight train to chance it in dimly lit venues. The film opens with Reddy (played with wonderful poise and presence by Tilda Cobham-Hervey) emerging from a New York subway in 1966 with her young daughter in tow. The protagonist will soon have cold water poured on her dreams, mansplained to by a music executive who informs her that male groups are all the rage (“you’ve heard of the Beatles, right?”) and insists he “can’t do anything with a female singer”. In the next scene she is at a bar performing I Will Follow Him – that sugary hymn of lovesick subservience – before confronting the manager and requesting a pay increase, to bring her up to parity with the men. This cigar-chomping chump barely lifts his head, responding by telling Reddy that these men have “got families to feed”. You can almost visually observe the unsubtle precision of Emma Jensen’s script, packing in evidence of patriarchal oppression and laying down the faultlines of an experience not just about Reddy succeeding as a woman, but earning, as the performer herself put it, “wisdom born of pain”. Things are a little more subtle in the relationship between Reddy and her good friend, the fellow Aussie expat and gossip columnist Lillian Roxon (Danielle Macdonald), who Reddy worries is unethical and possibly dangerous for her career. There’s also her cocaine-addicted husband and manager, Jeff Wald (Evan Peters), who becomes increasingly domineering as more powder shoots up his nostrils, before ultimately morphing into Sean Penn from Hurlyburly. A key question becomes: when is she going to do the song? The big one?! In one scene Reddy writes on a piece of paper the words “I AM STRONG” and “I AM INVINCIBLE”, causing my mind to snap back to perhaps the most crudely machine-tooled “insight” into the songwriting experience ever – from the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash. (Reese Witherspoon interrupts a hard-partying Cash [Joaquin Phoenix] and yells “you can’t walk no line!”. Cut to the recording studio.) Moon and Jensen don’t need a crowbar in a moment like that, because there is no moment, no sudden realisation. Dealing with the patriarchy is Reddy’s life, and every woman’s life. Despite Cobham-Hervey’s radiant performance, the great singer comes across as a limited presence: more a set of principles than a character, without a single scene in which she behaves unexpectedly or in a way that challenges preconceptions. This comes down in part to a problem common in portrayals of famous people in biopics: speculate too much about them and the portrayal becomes distrustful; speculate too little and it becomes boring. The first performance of the titular track arrives around the one-hour mark – and yes, it induces tingles. Cobham-Hervey maintains a very vertical physicality; the performance seems to exist entirely in her eyes. Moon contextualises the scene, cutting to footage of women’s liberation protests, aligning the film to the raison ‘d’etre of the song: the feeling this is an anthem; a celebration; a symbol of change. All anthems require a degree of simplicity, cutting through the complexities of human experience to create a feeling. The song nails that in three and a half minutes; the film stretches it out across two hours, reducing its impact but retaining its sentiment.  I Am Woman is out now on Stan"
"A call to boycott Netflix on Thursday over the French film Mignonnes – AKA Cuties – has been launched on social media, over claims that its young stars were portrayed in a sexualised way. The film is directed by French-Senegalese director Maïmouna Doucouré, and started streaming on 9 September. More than 200,000 tweets with the hashtag #CancelNetflix became the top trending topic one day later. A first wave of criticism, in August, led Netflix to withdraw artwork used to promote the film, which was released in theatres that month in France. At the time Netflix said it apologised for having used “inappropriate” images in its promotional material. But on Thursday, broader opposition to some of the imagery came from around the political spectrum in the United States. A petition on change.org calling on users to cancel their Netflix subscriptions currently stands at more than 600,000 signatures. DeAnna Lorraine, a former Republican candidate for Congress from California, tweeted that “Child pornography is illegal in America”. “As the mother of an eight-year old girl, I STRONGLY support #CancelNetflix,” added Beatrice Cardenas, another California Republican. The film, which received a director’s award at the Sundance film festival, tells the story of Amy, an 11-year-old Senegalese girl living in Paris, who joins a dance group formed by three other girls from her neighbourhood to escape the restrictions of family life. “The hypersexualization of girls (and boys) is disgusting,” tweeted Omar Navarro, another Republican politician. “It is morally and ethically reprehensible.”  In a statement, Netflix said: “Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children. It’s an award-winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up – and we’d encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie.” Among the voices praising the movie were American actor Tessa Thompson (Creed, Avengers: Endgame), who said on social media that she found it “beautiful”. “It gutted me at @sundancefest. It introduces a fresh voice at the helm. She’s a French Senegalese Black woman mining her experiences. “The film comments on the hyper-sexualization of preadolescent girls. Disappointed to see the current discourse. Disappointed to see how it was positioned in terms of marketing. “I understand the response of everybody. But it doesn’t speak to the film I saw.”"
"Martha and Sean Carson are an average Boston couple preparing for the arrival of their first child. They’ve got the ultrasound scans framed and mounted on the wall. They’ve got the big family car that Martha’s mother just bought them. (“Grey like her soul,” jokes Sean.) Everything’s set; the future is all scripted. Then the home birth goes awry and everything else follows suit. Their well-ordered life becomes a veritable long day’s journey into night. Pieces of a Woman is the first American picture from the talented Hungarian film-maker Kornél Mundruczó and showcases a pair of full-blooded performances from Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf. Back in his homeland, Mundruczó crafted such brilliantly strange and potent pictures as White God and Johanna. He’s jettisoned the strangeness en route, but appears to have bulked up for more power. This film roars and rages like a wronged stevedore. Sean works in construction and talks about resonances and particle physics; the way in which certain conflicting vibrations can reduce solid structures to rubble. He’s talking about bridges but he’s thinking about his own marriage. The trauma of his daughter’s death exposes hairline cracks and buried tensions. Martha is from a good family; he is a blue-collar Joe. She is cool and collected; he is a total hothead. On top of all that, they have to contend with Martha’s rich, aged mother (nicely played by the great Ellen Burstyn, with glittering, tragic eyes and a core of inner steel). The old matriarch is constantly pulling strings, waving cheques, offering unsolicited advice. She says: “Martha, if you’d done it my way, you’d be holding your baby in your arms right now.” It takes a village to raise a child, it is said, and in this case a whole city to ensure that one is laid to rest. In between the domestic squalls, Mundruczó turns his camera on a wintry Boston where snow plasters the trees and ice flows in the harbour. It’s a place (paging Cheers) where everybody knows your name and where everyone appears to be at least distantly related, from the brother-in-law who sells the Carsons the car to the cousin who doubles as their lawyer. The midwife (Molly Parker) was at fault and now Boston wants her blood. Martha, for her part, just wants what was lost: her marriage and her daughter. Viewed as an acting masterclass, the film is bruisingly impressive in its way. The principal actors raise the roof; each gets to do their big turn for the camera. But it feels a little schooled, a little staged, like a workshop at the Actors’ Studio; this impression isn’t helped by the over-insistent score, which drops like a lead weight after each full-throated exchange. If Mundruczó’s aim is to lead us through the depths of agony and despair, then we need to feel the couple’s pain in our guts; I never did, quite. Out in frozen Boston, Sean has started self-medicating again, beating a path back to the fags, booze and cocaine as a means of numbing himself against the horror-show of his life. It’s working for him; maybe it is for us, too. When Mundruczó puts in the knife, it registers as a dull throb."
"It’s an understatement to say that a lot has happened since the trailer for Disney’s live-action Mulan was released last year, shortly after Hong Kong’s controversial extradition law was put forward, which sparked immediate protests. The ongoing assault on democracy in Hong Kong has dominated international headlines, with the arrests of pro-democracy activists, newspaper editors and government legislators. With its original cinema release put on hold due to the coronavirus epidemic, Mulan is now emerging to a vastly different political landscape. On the face of it, the new Mulan is a missed opportunity for Hollywood to explore Chinese history and identity, a confused and superficial statement about Chinese nationalism. A hodgepodge of Chinese historical mise-en-scène, wuxia-style choreography, cheap orientalism and stilted dialogue, it’s also become a lightning rod for pro-democracy and human rights protests around the world.  I am still an unabashed lover of the 1998 cartoon. It was a film that reflected the complexities of my upbringing as the half-Chinese daughter of a mainland Chinese immigrant growing up in the former British colony Hong Kong. The themes of struggling to fit in, reconciling your own identity, and the pressure of making your family proud were a unique package. The presence of Chinese-American screenwriter Rita Hsiao on the 1998 Mulan writing team seems to have been forgotten: she no doubt helped to create the film’s sense of the second- and third-generation immigrant experience, subtly inserting joyful references to Cantonese culture throughout the film. The new film follows most of the original’s storyline, but major elements of the cartoon have been removed, including the wise-cracking dragon guide Mushu and Mulan’s love interest, Captain Li Shang (today a bisexual icon). They are replaced with a sister with no purpose, a phoenix who doesn’t do very much but looks pretty, and two new villains, Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee), a nomadic leader, and a witch called Xian Liang (Gong Li), who operates as Mulan’s Lacanian “double”. Li ultimately steals the film with several scenes between her and Mulan (Liu Yifei) that prickle with sexual tension as she attempts to turn Mulan to the dark side. But that’s about as close to passion as we get in this film. Perhaps most jarring is the decision made by the film’s four credited screenwriters to strip our heroine of any flaws, bestowing her instead with a mystical “force”. To do this they repurpose an element of Chinese culture known as Qi, which translates as “breath” or “air”. Philosophers describe it as a type of energy or living metabolism in all beings – though not a special, individual power. (Before he died, my Beijing born father used to hug me when I was upset in order to get rid of the “bad Qi”.) In the film, Qi gives Mulan superhuman physical powers. Unlike the animation’s average teenager, who works hard to succeed as a soldier, the new Mulan is ready made. The child Mulan can already wield a sword like a warrior. She can even fly. The fact she holds Qi is repeated too many times to count, even though the film doesn’t explore it in any meaningful way. Other changes are more sinister. China has a tradition of “gǔ wéi jīn yòng” (“Use the past to serve the present”). The Mulan legend has been adapted many times, and the character’s origins have changed to suit. Historians largely agree that Mulan was a member of the proto-Mongolic Xianbei people, who lived in northern China in the 5th century. Over time her nomadic identity has been removed, and replaced with that of the dominant Han ethnicity. So claiming this new Mulan is an “authentic” version of the legend is especially ironic at a time when China is cracking down on Mongolian cultural identity alongside the imprisonment and “re-education” of Xinjiang Uighurs. The film-makers also made no secret that they were appeasing Chinese censors. In the Hollywood Reporter, it was made known that they went so far as to edit out a love scene. However, controversy over this live-action Mulan really kicked off after the lead actor, Chinese-born naturalised-American “Crystal” Liu Yifei, declared her support for the Hong Kong police after they committed acts of brutality against Hong Kong protesters last year. This sparked the #BoycottMulan movement, which, on the film’s release last week, re-emerged in Taiwan, Thailand and Hong Kong, with ongoing protests in other countries. It has also emerged that the film was partly shot in Xinjiang. In a recent roundtable discussion, Disney’s chief creative officer Alan Horn evaded a question over the political implications of Liu’s comments, saying: “It’s not hard to offend somebody somewhere … we’re not political.” But whether Horn or Disney like it or not, the film has become political, and a symbol of Hollywood’s ongoing pandering to the CCP for funding and box office revenue despite the government’s human rights abuses.  What made the original so great was the successful amalgamation of the commercial with the artistic. It did not attempt to be anything but a children’s film, a heart-warming tale of bravery and identity with universal appeal and a strong feminist message. This new adaptation was clearly produced to reap rewards at the Chinese box office and has ended up supporting the Chinese government’s aims. However, it is bogged down with its own glossy, pastiche depictions of ancient Chinese culture – in short, a bewildering piece of cinema, “as mysterious as the dark side of the moon”."
"Sometimes it takes the onward march of technology to bring the iconic tomes of science fiction and fantasy to life in their full glory. Peter Jackson’s Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy is a huge improvement on the 1978 Ralph Bakshi version, but how would the New Zealander have managed if he’d only had rotoscope and a few bits of string to work with rather than the laser-honed CGI of Weta Digital? Frank Herbert’s Dune looks destined to follow a similar path, if the first full trailer for Denis Villeneuve’s new adaptation of the iconic space fantasy is anything to go by. The famously lurid David Lynch version, from 1984, is known for being disowned by its director (who battled with studio execs and did not get final cut) and dismissed by the critics, but looking back now it was always going to be a challenge given the fledgling nature of special effects at the time of its making. Villeneuve’s dark and doom-laden take, quite frankly, looks set to consign Lynch’s sprawling misfire to the dustbin of history. Cine-futurism’s current messiah, courtesy of the brain-teasing Arrival and quietly brilliant Blade Runner 2049, looks to have conjured a reading of Herbert’s masterwork that will draw awestruck gasps, deja vu and double-takes from hardcore fans of the books. Timothée Chalamet (as House Atreides scion Paul Atreides) looks like the charismatic, sexy keyboard player from some half-remembered 80s new romantic group whose synthy brilliance continues to echo down the decades, while Charlotte Rampling (as the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam) is tantalisingly freaky in a witchy sort of way - that strange face covering making her heavily hooded eyes even more striking than usual. But what are the Engineers from Ridley Scott’s Alien prequels doing in the movie? Ah, those are the new Harkonnens, the evil, pasty-faced inhabitants of the frightening desert planet of Arrakis, and young Paul’s soon-to-be nemeses. Life was certainly easier in the 80s, when Lynch marked out the nefarious clan by simply making them all ginger. Naturally, Villeneuve has hired Dave Bautista to play Glossu Rabban, the knuckle-dragging nephew of chief baddie Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, for the star of Guardians of the Galaxy and Spectre has become the go-to brute for these musclebound weirdo roles. Baron Harkonnen himself we see only a glimpse of in the trailer, for surely that’s a shaven-headed Stellan Skarsgård emerging from some nasty-looking primeval gloop? Skarsgård will have to go some if he’s to hit the heights of pustule-ridden ferocity reached by Kenneth McMillan in the 1984 version - presumably heart plugs (never in the original books) are out this time around. Hopefully, the foetid whiff of subconscious homophobia will go with them. Why is Jason Momoa’s Duncan Idaho, played with such exuberant, chest-bumping, hail-fellow-well-met heartiness? It’s as if Momoa still thinks he is portraying Aquaman from the DC superhero movies - surely the Game of Thrones star hasn’t just been transported in to remind us of the similarities between Dune’s doomed Atreides clan and the Starks of George RR Martin’s popular fantasy saga? What’s that you say? The Engineer-Harkonnens are not the only inclusions to recall space movies past – the new sandworms that maraud across Arrakis’s deserts now resemble giant, mobile Sarlaccs (from 1983’s Star Wars: Return of the Jedi). But again, they look so much cooler than the Lynch iterations that it’s hard to get too upset over a little monster design pilfering. The story is the same with the scene in which Paul spars with Josh Brolin’s House Atreides master-at-arms Gurney Halleck - suddenly the personal defence shields worn by both look like we imagined them in our dreams, rather than our 8-bit nightmares. Finally, Dune looks like the mad, phantasmagorical world of the novels, rather than a particularly weird episode of Tom Baker-era Doctor Who."
"While researching the Australian gold rush of the 1800s, director Roderick MacKay came across an image that immediately jumped out at him: men dressed in turbans and flanked by camels stood next to the bushmen of nascent modern-day Australia. “I stumbled upon images of these guys in traditional garb with the camel trains in the otherwise familiar Australian outback and was just like, ‘What the hell is this?’” says the director. What he’d found was a part of Australia’s history that was largely unknown until recently: the story of the men drawn from all over the British empire – known as “cameleers” – who helped build links between early Australian colonial settlements. Six years after finding the photograph, The Furnace – MacKay’s fictional account of the cameleers and the hostile Australia that welcomed them – has had its debut in the Venice film festival’s Orizzonti sidebar, bringing with it a dose of gritty outback drama to the Covid-19 affected but still glamorous Lido. Set in the late 1890s, when the British empire stretched across the world, MacKay’s film focuses on a young Afghan cameleer (Ahmed Malek) and a gold thief, played by David Wenham (beloved locally for his role in comedy-drama SeaChange, but better known to the rest of the world for his turn in The Lord of the Rings). Part western (there’s one particularly noticeable nod to Sergio Leone) and part road movie, the film has an aesthetic similarity to both There Will Be Blood and John Hillcoat’s The Proposition, as the cameleers are met by the brutal environment of the outback and the callousness of its new inhabitants. The cameleers are treated terribly in the film, and MacKay says atrocities were not unheard of, with witness accounts of summary executions by white Australians. The cameleers, who were largely Persian, Afghan, Turkish, Egyptian and Indian, were given the racist catch-all moniker “Ghans”, and used camels to transport goods across the country. “The men played a really important role in the formation of the country,” says MacKay. “They laid the foundations for the railroads and the telegraph lines and assisted with the opening up of the interior.” Filming took place on the country of the Yamatji Badimia people, a remote part of Western Australia where temperatures rose to 50°C and swarms of flies made shooting arduous – at times, the insects can be seen visibly sucking moisture from the actors’ eyes during takes. The locations were so remote that the production team had to grade the roads so they could transport equipment. MacKay’s own journey to Venice was probably the most convoluted of any of the directors who travelled to the Lido. From his home in Perth, Australia, MacKay travelled first to Qatar before moving on to Rome where, to comply with Italy’s lockdown restrictions, he holed up in an Airbnb for a fortnight before taking a train to Venice. He made the journey with the hope the film can act as a starting point for people wanting to know more about modern Australia’s history – that it might help to create “a more inclusive sense of Australian identity” and spread the cameleers’ story. “I was pretty astonished to have never heard about this before. I’ve not been taught it in high school or university and it felt like a huge historic omission that needed to be corrected,” he says. MacKay says there is “a new willingness in Australia to peel back into the past” and come to terms with it, warts and all, to understand a bit better how the country has arrived at the present. In the film, that history lesson can be stark. Wenham’s character is said to have taken part in the real-life Kalkadoon massacre of 1884, in which hundreds of Indigenous Australians were killed by police and colonists. “It’s kind of the equivalent of the Wounded Knee Creek massacre,” says MacKay. “That is a very mythic event in American westerns and frontier mythologies. But we have massacres on the same scale in Australia, but they’re still not widely known.” Setting the record straight also meant including Indigenous Australians in the narrative. The Aboriginal characters feature heavily and, as they did in real life, embrace cameleers and in some instances invite them to live within their communities. “It makes a lot of sense,” says MacKay. “A lot of the cameleers came from tribal-based cultures, deeply spiritual, nomadic people and obviously, a lot of these traits are shared by Aboriginal people. And then they both received a great deal of prejudice from the colonial Anglo-Celtic community. So that laid the foundation for this bond.” The Indigenous characters speak in the Badimaya dialect, an endangered language because so few people can speak it. One elder who was considered an authority on it died a year before shooting. That meant MacKay had to consult vastly across the community to try and understand the language well enough to use it in the film. “That was pretty daunting having to undertake that,” he says. “But it also made it so much more meaningful.” In the film the cameleers are caught between wanting to return home and knowing the gold rush could bring them vast wealth. For some of the men, MacKay found, that conflict saw them stuck in their adopted country. “A lot of these guys did actually become trapped in Australia because there was a financial barrier in getting back to their homelands,” he says. “There are stories of someone walking into the oldest mosque in South Australia and there are these ancient men there who were the last of that final generation of cameleers.” The legacy of the cameleers can still be found in Australia, says MacKay, in the stories told by their descendants.

"Regina King’s directorial debut stood out at this year’s Venice film festival. There’s the intriguing subject matter: it’s an adaptation of Kemp Powers’s dramatisation of a real-life meeting between Cassius Clay, Malcolm X, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke after Clay’s surprise win over Sonny Liston in February 1964. But there’s another reason: it’s the first film directed by an African-American woman to be selected in the festival’s history. At the event on Monday, King recognised that the success or failure of her film, One Night in Miami, could have ramifications for other black female directors. “It’s interesting because how this film performs will open doors or maybe close doors for more black female directors … that’s how things seem to work,” she said over video link. The issue of gender parity has mostly been obscured at this year’s festival by the Covid-19 crisis, which has meant a more subdued version of the event with around half the number of guests. But last year there was outcry over the fact only two films in competition were made by female film-makers, while in 2020 that number has leapt to eight out of the 18 films in contention for the Golden Lion. King’s film is not in competition, but it stands out as one of a handful of films directed by black women to have ever been recognised at the event. Venice has celebrated male black film-makers in the past: Spike Lee, Ousmane Sembène, John Singleton, Isaac Julien, Antoine Fuqua, John Akomfrah and Steve McQueen have all featured. Black female film-makers have been included too, but in far fewer numbers. The Martinique director Euzhan Palcy won the Silver Lion at the Venice film festival in 1983 for Sugar Cane Alley. Last year in an interview with the Guardian, Palcy said that despite the critical praise in Venice she struggled to forge a career in Hollywood afterwards because her films were seen as “too black”. The first US film directed by an African-American woman to be released theatrically was Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust in 1991. Ashley Clark, a critic and the author of Facing Blackness: Media and Minstrelsy in Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, said the inclusion of King’s film should be celebrated, cautiously. “I hope that this exposure helps to secure future opportunities for King to make films. For all the recent critical reappraisals and exposure for film-makers such as Julie Dash and Euzhan Palcy, neither has had a theatrically released feature film for the best part of three decades,” he said. The importance of festival recognition was highlighted after a recent investigation by the New York Times found that out of 1,034 films in the Criterion Collection, which is regarded as including the “giants of 20th-century cinema”, only nine had black directors. Palcy was the only black female director included. Dr Clive Nwonka, LSE Fellow in film studies and author of the book Black Boys: the Aesthetics of British Urban Cinema, said he hopes that King’s inclusion can act as a wake-up call to the industry. “This moment should influence the entire white film industry: the Hollywood system, the Academy, the studios, the production companies, the distributors, the agents, the festival juries,” he said. “They are the ones who should be looking at this moment and begin to unthink their assumptions and valuing of black women film-makers.” King previously pledged to work only on projects with a 50/50 gender split, during her successful awards campaign for supporting actress for If Beale Street Could Talk, which saw her win at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. At Venice, King – who made the move behind the camera after directing an episode of the TV drama This Is Us – said she was grateful to be part of the festival but was anxious for the film to do well commercially. “A woman will get a shot, and if she does not succeed, that shuts things down for years to come until an opportunity comes again for another woman to get that shot,” she said. “So I am so grateful for our film to be a part of the festival, but I really, really want it to perform well, because there’s so much talent out there and there are so many talented directors.” In 2018, Venice signed up to the 50/50x2020 pledge, which was meant to ensure gender parity on lineups by 2020. It has fallen short of that, but its director Alberto Barbera said the event is “absolutely committed” to the movement. There is no such commitment on racial diversity. Nwonka said black female directors and black women have been left behind within gender equality debates in the film industry. He said the inclusion of King’s film was a huge achievement because it is still so rare for a black film to be recognised at a major festival. “For Regina King’s film to be playing at a festival such as Venice represents a significant moment that will undoubtedly inspire other film-makers who have continued to struggle to find a major platform and recognition for their work,” he added. Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, said King’s inclusion was groundbreaking. She said: “At a festival where women directors have struggled to be programmed even after the festival committed to push for gender parity, King will rightly be the centre of attention as not only a female director, but a black female director – a group that is sorely underrepresented in this industry.”"
"Lockdown in the UK cost its cinemas an estimated £111m in lost revenue, and their annual income could be down 60% on last year’s. Abandoned filming means there are few enticing titles in the pipeline, and production safety guidelines are hampering new production. If cinemas are to survive while socialdistancing slashes their capacity, they’ll have to fill as many as they can of their remaining available seats. Filmgoers will need to show up in force, whatever their age, gender or physical condition. I’m an ardent film fan; unfortunately, I’m also male and medically vulnerable, which makes me low-hanging fruit for Covid’s scythe. An over-75-year-old is 623 times more likely to die from the disease than an under-45-year-old. Men are over twice as much at risk as women, and a dodgy cardiovascular system doesn’t improve your chances. Of course, we vulnerables have been told to crawl back out of our hobbit holes and do our bit to rescue the economy, including its entertainment sector. I know cinemas are now meant to be Covid-secure. Phone-only booking would save me from jostling at the box office and faecal transmission via paper tickets. Perspex would fence off Munchies-vendors and grubby pick’n’mix would be but a memory. One-way foot traffic would keep people out of my face, with ushers monitoring any infractions. Toilets would be sanitised regularly, and disinfectant would purify armrests. Masks might absorb fellow filmgoers’ coughs and sneezes, while blocked-off seating would ensure popcorn-munchers didn’t spray me with spittle. I could even don full PPE, according to 29 pages of guidance from the UK Cinema Association. Were I still in my salad days, these measures would have left me well-satisfied. However, even the most elaborate of safeguards can’t wholly get the better of SARS-CoV-2. The canny virus refuses to confine itself to the droplets we exhale and the surfaces on to which these fall. Those chunky globules, if not trapped by masks, obligingly hit the deck within the two-metre safe zone after a few minutes. The Covid-infected also emit much larger numbers of smaller, more lung-invasive particles. Primed with slivers of viral RNA, these evil specks agglomerate into a swirling, gravity-defying miasma that infests the air. During two hours in front of the silver screen, this cloud of death would enfold me, thickening with every unbated breath and excited gasp of those around me. Why would an enfeebled greybeard risk such an experience? After a long life much enhanced by cinema’s flickering dreams, I feel I owe the industry. Yet in spite of my generation’s pride in its sense of duty, I’m not going to risk my life just to pay off this debt. I’ll really have to want to go back. A lot. Do I? Back in March, when big-screen deprivation first kicked in, it didn’t seem too bad. Frankly, a home-cinema TV seemed likely to provide a more immersive experience than the teensy screens of the poky Picturehouse I’d come to frequent. Now, I thought, I’ll be able to catch up with all those talked-about box-set streamers. I got plugged into Succession, Better Call Saul and Fargo, and I was knocked out. These shows were brilliantly written and produced. Their characters and plots had time to grow. The movies, with their hackneyed formulas and silly, 90-minute story-arc resolutions, paled in comparison. I soon learned, however, that I’d been seduced by the cream of the crop. The vast bulk of what Netflix and Amazon had to offer turned out to be as dreary, mechanical and repetitive as anything on the big screen. The solution seemed to be to stick with the few shows of real class: after all, they were available in staggering volume. Yet after five seasons of Saul and another five of Breaking Bad, I started to grow sick of Albuquerque and its denizens. The movies may have their franchises, but in the pre-Covid age, they still unleashed copious brand new characters, stories and settings, every single week. I fell back on my pile of DVDs of yesterday’s jewels. Many of them stood up well. I almost wore out my copy of Mathieu Demy’s restoration of Les Parapluies de Cherbourg. But it was no good. Movies aren’t just timeless artefacts; they’re also an expression of their moment. I needed fresh film. By now, I was missing everything from scruffy foyers and over-priced Cokes to Volkswagen ads and spoiler-filled trailers. I even hankered for the body odour and blue glow from the texting nincompoops seated in the row in front. Yet something more was still required. I couldn’t forget the quality of the best of the streamed stuff. I wasn’t going to lay down my life for rubbish. So, what was the multiplex able to offer? The reruns of past classics couldn’t tempt me, sated as I was by my DVDs, yet there didn’t seem to be much else. I might have been ready to die for our cinemas, but the studios wouldn’t even risk their bottom line. The big stuff was being held back, endlessly deferred or re-routed to the theatres’ streaming competitors. And then came Tenet. All credit to Warners for setting the ball rolling and taking the potential financial hit. Here was a picture flaunting scale and ambition. With its 70mm and Imax spectacle, it demanded big-screen viewing. Surely this one ought to lure me back. It certainly lured back many, but we old folks are a fussy bunch. Nowadays, I no longer go for dizzying, pretentious nonsense. In my twilight years, I like a proper story that makes sense. Just another sign of being past it, I suppose. But it means I’ve given Nolan’s masterpiece a miss. Instead, ever more anxiously, I’ve been looking for something else to ease me back. Hope Gap seemed just the ticket for my demographic. Nighy and Bening: bliss. Could this be another Le Week-End or 45 Years? Then I watched the trailer. And somehow, few of the autumn’s prospects seem better equipped to give my timorous soul the shove it needs. Except for one. The building buzz for No Time to Die is quickening my senescent pulse. God knows what Waller-Bridge may have done to the script. Still, as it’s been so many times before, everything’s now down to 007."

"Against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement, and with elite universities under attack for their poor diversity records, Somalinimo celebrates the experiences of four Cambridge University students as they seek positive change and find solidarity with each other in what could otherwise be an isolating and intimidating environment. Somalinimo is also a love-letter to Somali culture: with a distinctive visual approach, it takes us inside one of the most traditional institutions in the UK as well as a British-Somali home, while inspiring a new generation to navigate their way between the two. A collaboration between the writer Awa Farah and the film-maker Alice Aedy, it was made with the support of the BFI Doc Society Fund and is being show for the first time on Guardian Documentaries. Why did you decide to make this film together? Awa: In 2018, I was researching the Somali diaspora in the UK. I was becoming increasingly tired of the monolithic, stereotypical depiction of Somalis in both literature and film. I came across Alice’s photography work on Somali women and found it beautifully refreshing. Alice: Awa told me about her time at Cambridge studying an MPhil in African Studies, a place that was not made for people “like her”, but where she carved out a powerful sense of home through the Somali women she met there. We wanted to share that story. Awa and I hoped to make a visually cinematic short film together, exploring what it means to live with the triple consciousness of being part of three marginalised groups – Black, female and Muslim – at one of the UK’s most traditional institutions, Cambridge University. And although Awa, Miske, Hafsa and Samiya’s experiences are unique, the power of their stories lie in their universality. Identity, nationality, race, gender – these are all pressing and timely themes which Somalinimo touches on. We hoped to make a film that unapologetically showcases love for Somalia’s colourful traditions and traditional dress, Blackness and Islam. When making a film about a community that is not your own, there is a particular responsibility to do so with respect and care to everyone involved and how they are represented. As a white director it was important to me to work closely with Awa, the producer and protagonist of the film, at every stage of the film production to ensure it was a true collaboration. Equally important was having strong representation of women and POC behind the camera. What was your creative vision for this film and how did you go about achieving it? Awa: What we initially thought would be a story about Somali women and their experiences at Cambridge became more like a love letter to our Somali heritage. After the interviews, we knew that telling a story that portrayed the richness and colour of Somali culture was just as important as the Cambridge aspect. We began thinking about how we could then visually merge these two worlds with the clothing, set design, architecture, and music, and it all just fell together quite naturally. Alice: Awa spoke powerfully about the way the physical spaces of Cambridge made her feel. It became important to represent those spaces visually; the spaces that could make the women feel isolated, like the dining hall; empowered, like the mosque; a sense of home, like the Somali living room set design. Awa and I wanted all four women to walk through Cambridge in their “diraacs” – traditional Somali dress – as a powerful celebration of their Somali heritage. What inspired you? Are there other films/anything that informed your approach to this project, or that you looked to for inspiration? Awa: Growing up with six sisters, I felt like I had space where I could have honest conversations about everything. I think that so much about the film is about a way of trying to make a home from home. The theme of sisterhood and a sense of comfort is present throughout. In Cambridge, among Black, Muslim, and female communities, I was able to share my experiences. This was a constant source of inspiration for Somalinimo. I was also always in awe of the access work carried out by the fantastic student organisers behind the scenes. Alice: I’m inspired by hybrid, stylised documentaries that borrow cinematic techniques perhaps traditionally reserved for fiction. We built the set design of a traditional Somali home to evoke the powerful sense of nostalgia, and of Somalia (the way the girls’ parents might have spoken about it). The Somali living room visually depicted a sense of belonging – a comfort zone – in contrast to the spaces in Cambridge that could sometimes be isolating. I was interested by how this set design would shape the conversations had between the girls within the space, and their ability to reflect on memory and family. How do you think this film resonates with the Black Lives Matter movement as well as elitism around university admissions? Awa: Since starting to make this film, times have changed a lot. People are no longer waiting around for positive change but are demanding it. There has been a massive drive to get more Black students and those from state schools into Cambridge! But getting students through the door will not be enough on its own. Segments of the film address the explicit and implicit ways elite institutions can feel alienating to Black students even beyond the admission stage. Proactive steps need to be taken to engage seriously with the systematic and structural nature of racism for students from all backgrounds to thrive once they enter elite, predominantly white, spaces. Alice: Since we made Somalinimo, the world has changed beyond recognition. The extraordinary Black Lives Matter movement has served as a poignant reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for equal representation and treatment of Black people in Britain. As storytellers we must play a role in challenging dominant narratives and stereotypes. We must tell positive stories that celebrate Black talent and experience. It’s no secret that elite universities, including Cambridge University, have extremely poor diversity records. The Black Lives Matter movement only served to highlight this urgent issue. I have been inspired by groups like the Black Curriculum, an initiative teaching Black history to 8-16 year olds, and other important campaigns to decolonise the British curriculum at schools and universities across the country. I never set out to make an indictment of Cambridge University, rather a celebration of these four women. However, I do want the audience to finish watching the film with a profound sense that every university is doing itself – and its students – a disservice by having such poor diversity records. What effect do you hope this film will have on the viewer? Alice: I want this film to inspire young women. You can’t be what you can’t see. We want them to recognise themselves in Awa, Samiya, Hafsa and Miske, powerful women creating a legacy for future generations. I hope the film leaves people feeling hopeful. Whoever you are – there is space for Black, Muslim students at elite universities and the viewers of this film can have an important role in carving out those spaces. For a long time, Somali communities have been underestimated and underrepresented in the film industry. Somalinimo’s overarching theme of identity and home represents a new generation of representation of Somalis in film. Awa: Primarily, I hope that young Black, Muslim students from state schools thinking of applying to Oxbridge can watch this film and feel that, despite all the barriers, you still have every right to make it your home and bring yourself fully.

"Steve Buscemi is one of our most prolific actors (164 credits and counting, according to IMDb), which is perhaps why his directorial output seems so comparatively, frustratingly slender. Though augmented by a fair amount of television (including episodes of both The Sopranos and 30 Rock), he’s helmed only four feature films, the most recent dating clear back to 2007. He began modestly, with an inaugural effort, Trees Lounge, that’s about what you’d expect from the indie stalwart: a seriocomic, Jarmuschian character study, laid-back and intimate. His sophomore film, Animal Factory, is a notable step up, bigger and broader and far more ambitious. Based on the novel by Edward Bunker, who co-starred with Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs, it’s a busy, character-driven take on one of cinema’s most durable genres: the prison picture. The story of a long-timer and a newbie, culminating in an attempted escape, it’s easiest to summarize as The Shawshank Redemption – minus all the hope and good feeling. Bunker appears in the film, briefly (like a ghost haunting his own story), co-wrote the screenplay adaptation and is credited as an executive producer – alongside his pal and protege Danny Trejo, another con turned actor, who plays a supporting role. But the focal character is Ron Decker (Edward Furlong), a new inmate in on a minor drug charge. Luckily, he quickly finds an advocate in Earl (Willem Dafoe, sporting a shaved head and well-worn sneer), the kind of resourceful inside man who can get things, and get things done: “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven,” explains this big fish in the prison’s little pond. “You need friends,” Earl tells the newcomer, so he shows Ron the ropes, and imparts pearls of prison wisdom like “Inmate’s an insult – convict’s the term solitudes prefer” and “Half of knowin’ how to do time is getting’ the right job”. Ron’s wide-eyed naivety makes him something of an audience surrogate, but Bunker and co-screenwriter John Steppling resist the urge to overwork him as an expositional device; much of their script is about the logistics and routines of prison life, filled with jailhouse lingo and patter (“show pass”, “lay-in”) that’s dropped in and left for the viewer to puzzle out. Bunker also colors the narrative with the kind of details only an insider would know (Earl, needing to pass information while in solitary, communicating with an ally by yelling into a toilet). “I’m just not in my element in here, y’know,” Ron moans early on, but the prison eventually breaks him, as it does everyone. Furlong’s work here is subtle but steady, as he catalogs the close calls and self-preservation that create this slow transition from a tourist to, potentially, a lifer. Dafoe makes a good mentor, convincingly putting across Earl’s hard shell, and finding the fleeting moments to let his cracks show. Earl is an honest man, and he admits that the relationship fills a need for him, without explaining what that need is; maybe it’s a public service, or a wish for connection. Or maybe it’s just a desire to be important to another human being. Buscemi casts Animal Factory with a carefully cultivated mixture of non-professionals and ace character actors, including Seymour Cassel, John Heard, Mark Boone Junior, Chris Bauer, Mickey Rourke (playing Ron’s trans cellmate with earthy humor and genuine humanity), Tom Arnold (playing against type, wide-eyed and shockingly scary) and Buscemi himself, in a short but welcome appearance as a prison official. What’s striking – but unsurprising, considering his background – is how much Buscemi trusts his actors to tell the story implicitly, in pauses, between the lines. He frequently skips dull, obligatory scenes and eschews deadening exposition, letting the emotional narratives of their faces and eyes fill in those blanks. Buscemi is clearly fascinated by the carefully controlled politics of a place like this, which runs on an ecosystem of favors, allegiances, respect and retaliation; he also keys in on how the intense racial divisions contribute to an environment where violence can flare up quickly, and at any given moment. His patient, lived-in directorial style sniffs around the joint so thoroughly and convincingly that it feels like the viewer knows where everything is, and how everything works; it’s tempting to say one could make their way in this facility by the film’s end, but who are we kidding? Earlier this year, Ellen DeGeneres fueled one of several backlashes by comparing self-quarantine to prison. If Animal Factory does nothing else, it makes abundantly clear that the prison experience is, well, nothing like that."
"His beauty, his grace, his style, his presence and — until what stunned admirers must now understand to have been the very end — his youthful, boyish openness. These made up Chadwick Boseman’s persona; an actor who had come to be loved among many things for his lightly worn imperiousness, humour and charm as T’Challa, king of the fictional African country Wakanda in the Marvel smash Black Panther. Like many actors who play kings and princes in hugely successful movies or TV shows, the regality rubs off, the royalty is a residue, but he had these things anyway. What makes his death so shocking for me is that I had so loved his performance in Spike Lee’s new film Da 5 Bloods, playing the squad leader Norman, who was killed in action in Vietnam, 50 years before four of the men under his command (played by Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr and Norm Lewis) now come back to present-day Vietnam on a fraught journey into their own pasts. Lee brilliantly recreates flashback jungle scenes for all five, but with the four middleaged as they are now, and Chadwick Boseman’s Norman as he was then, as he was in their memory. He has grown not old as those that are left have grown old: he is still the impossibly handsome and daring young leader who has the tragic military burden of persuading his men not to mutiny because of the racism of the top brass. This superbly conceived performance now assumes an almost unbearable, real poignancy: when I see the poster image of these men taking a knee at Norman’s graveside it is overwhemingly sad. We now know that Boseman was being treated for cancer, and must already have been aware of the possibility that his end was near. It had been Boseman’s destiny, also, to dramatise other African-American icons on his way to becoming an icon himself: in 42, he was legendary Jackie Robinson, the first black American to make it into baseball’s major league. This was a film which notably chose a simpler, inspirational theme over anything more complex and politically contentious, but Boseman’s performance was what supplied the complexity and texture in itself: seductive and determined, intent on surpassing his own loneliness and the prejudice of others. His Robinson was a figure shown being beset by bigotry on all sides, even by some on his own team, but toughing it out without self-pity. Already, he was assuming a kind of superheroism. In Marshall, he played Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice of the United States, appointed to the bench by Lyndon B Johnson, who made important rulings against segregation. The movie dramatises an early courtroom drama, when his Marshall had to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman, and Boseman let rip with gorgeous and extravagant theatrics as the brilliant young advocate. Something of the same physicality and athleticism — and also sexuality — went into his portrayal of James Brown in the flawed biopic Get On Up, which, though it could not quite get to grips with the more unwelcome side of its leading character, had another exquisitely fierce turn from Boseman. In 21 Bridges, he had a more conventional, generic role as a New York cop who in time-honoured style had lost his dad to criminals, and now has to solve a violent gangland crime on Manhattan which he does by ordering all twenty-one bridges connecting the island to the mainland to be closed to cut off the culprit’s means of escape — an interestingly regal move. But of course it was as T’Challa, the gloriously charismatic superhero of colour in Marvel’s afrofuturist adventure, that Boseman imposed his personality on the movies. He was sensitive, handsome and stylish with something introspective, vulnerable and self-questioning in his manner as he assumes the surreal throne. Boseman did it all with such grace that it is an incidental pain for his fans that he never got to reapply these acting gifts on playing Shakespeare on stage or screen. Like all celebrities and movie stars, Boseman was entitled to his privacy, even though through his sheer empathy and lovability, his fans had come to think that they were already part of that privacy, that they knew him. So the news that he also had cancer is such a shock. He seemed — he was — so young, always appearing at least a decade younger than his years. His great movie roles were quintessentially about youth, about the vigour and energy and idealism and having it all in front of you. Boseman now becomes the lost prince of American cinema, who had a glorious and inspirational career."
"Every historical drama involves some element of pure invention: maybe it happened like this? Perhaps she said it like that? But Michael Almereyda’s biopic of the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla (1856 - 1943), is rather more open about this process than most. Ethan Hawke, who also starred in the director’s contemporary New York-set Hamlet 20 years ago, plays the under-appreciated visionary. Now, Tesla has a clean energy company named in his honour, is thought to have predicted the internet age, and has been played on screen several times, most recently by Nicholas Hoult in The Current War. But he died in poverty after alienating his wealthy investors and consequently struggling to obtain the funding to realise his grand visions. The contrast between this experience and that of Tesla’s erstwhile employer and sometime rival, Thomas Alva Edison (Kyle MacLachlan), the Great American usually credited with invention of the electric light bulb, suggests itself as an obvious dramatic framework for a biopic. But not this biopic. Almereyda is more interested in anachronism as a metaphor for a man fully out of step with his era; at one point Edison is seen passing time at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair by scrolling through his iPhone. (Curiously, though, the film is a stickler for period detail when it comes to the dimly lit drawing rooms where most scenes take place.) Some amusingly arch performances from MacLachlan and Eve Hewson as Anne Morgan, daughter of the banker JP Morgan, draw out the humour but, as the anachronisms pile up, any attempt to follow the film’s biographical through-thread is frustrated. Intentionally, for sure, since Almereyda is aiming at a deeper biographical truth. To watch Tesla the film is to admire its ambition while regretting its follies. Much like Tesla the man, perhaps?"
"Four years ago, the Greek film-maker Argyris Papadimitropoulos made a vivid impression with Suntan: a bleakly hilarious Death-In-Venice-type affair set in a seaside resort, featuring a sad middle-aged man who tortures himself with his tragic infatuation with a beautiful young woman on holiday. Here is his follow-up, in the English language, featuring Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes from Marvel’s Captain America movies) and the Irish stage star Denise Gough, with a script co-written by the director with the award-winning British dramatist Rob Hayes (who worked with Michaela Coel on the TV comedy Chewing Gum). Sadly, despite all the talent involved, this is a disappointment: an unconvincing, undeveloped and emotionally directionless non-drama that just goes pointlessly around and around in circles. All of this film’s various moods – erotic, euphoric, tragic – are unearned and despite what is clearly strenuous effort from the performers themselves, the acting is hammy and undirected. It is the story of a love-at-first-sight passion which has to face up to the tough reality of maintaining a relationship once the initial sexy rush is over: in other words, dealing with the “Monday” comedown following the “Friday” of carefree weekend partying. The movie is in fact pointedly divided into a series of sections each repeatedly labelled “Friday” leading to what is evidently to be the deferred “Monday” reckoning. But bafflingly, the relationship in question seems to be always facing terrible crises and brutal Mondays long before this, yet after some shouting and then some carefree laughing, the reset button gets miraculously hit. It is a story which seems to be weirdly without penalty, without emotional consequence. Stan plays Mickey, an American guy in a Greek resort who is earning a living DJing in clubs and composing ad jingles, living a bleary hedonist lifestyle but secretly concerned about the serious musical career he self-sabotaged back in the US and the fact that he never gets to see his six-year-old son from a previous relationship with a Greek woman. Then at a party, he meets Chloe (Gough), a smart, sexy American lawyer who is just coming out of a painful situation with an abusive man. The spark is dazzling. They have nonstop wild sex, leading to waking up naked together on a beach and getting arrested – but it’s all just swept up in the uproarious swirl of their passion. But then they have to deal with their demons: namely, the sinister man that Chloe left behind and the fact that Mickey still has to have a difficult conversation with his ex-partner to get access to his son – a conversation which he leaves to Chloe, like the emotionally avoidant guy that he is. For me, this tense conversation between Chloe and Mickey’s ex-partner Aspa (played by Elli Tringou, who was the bewitchingly unattainable woman in Suntan) is the one moment in the film that truly comes to life. It is the one speck of grit in the oyster, the one scene where something seems to be really at stake, where things can happen with irreversible results. And so it proves – in a way. Aspa icily confronts Chloe with the truth about how lazy and selfish Mickey actually is, but seems to have taken stock of how serious Chloe is. Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into this film: parties, clubs, arguments, embarrassments, sex – and there’s even a full-on romcom rush to the airport. But I never got the impression of a genuine connection between the two stars. There was no chemistry. Gough works hard to make her role count, but she has not much to work with, and Stan is stuck with this exuberant, anarchic hipster role which reminded me weirdly of the cool Rat Pack guy with whom Alicia Silverstone has her terrible date in Clueless. The party feels like it’s over before it’s begun."
"Not to be confused with the British period drama of the same name starring Gemma Arterton and Gugu Mbatha-Raw that came out a few weeks back, this Summerland is an American-made coming-out and coming-of-age comedy, low budget but impressively high in concept. The setup posits three Gen Z young adults – straight couple Stacey (Maddie Phillips) and Oliver (Rory J Saper) with Oliver’s best friend, newly out gay man Bray (Chris Ball, also the film’s co-writer) on a roadtrip from Washington state to California to attend a desert-set music festival called Summerland, which looks like a cross between Burning Man and Coachella. The interesting queer twist is that Bray has been catfishing a hunky Christian guy named Shawn (Dylan Playfair) by pretending to be Stacey, convinced that if he could only lure Shawn into meeting him in the flesh he could coax out Shawn’s true sexuality, as yet unrecognised even by Shawn. Meanwhile, Stacey and Oliver are having their own issues around commitment and honesty. The easy, breezy script by Ball, Dylan Griffiths, and co-directors Kurtis David Harder and Noah Kentis (who collectively go by the name Lankyboy) manages to make a few smart, salient points about the fluidity of sexuality for this generation without ever feeling preachy. There is always room for gags about getting mashed on psychedelic mushrooms and the ritual complaints about uptight step-parents who just don’t get it when you borrow their swanky RV for a 1,000-mile journey. All three leads are toothsome but also credible characters with some degree of interiority. There are quite a lot of weird loose ends and a slightly deflationary denouement, but all is forgivable for its earnest sweetness of purpose."
"At last year’s Cannes film festival the poet/model/actor/filmmaker Greta Bellamacina revealed she’d been turned away from the festival site by staff because she had her three-month son with her in a buggy – the irony being that her film (she directs, co-writes and stars) is the story of a young single mother struggling to be taken seriously as a poet. Hurt by Paradise turns out to be a drifty, pretentious, London-set drama, though pretty enough, with the smudged eyeliner glamour of an edgy fashion shoot. Bellamacina’s film is self-consciously highbrow: that much is clear in the opening scene in which Celeste (Bellamacina) gets the brush off from a cartoonishly cynical literary agent who tells her that the reading public is only interested in dead poets: “Look at Sylvia Plath!” He suggests turning her poems about her absent dad into a novel. Celeste leaves in disgust, and heads back to her Fitzrovia flat, where she is raising her toddler alone, perpetually broke. Her quirky neighbour, out of work actor Stella (co-writer Sadie Brown), babysits while Celeste writes, and the pair’s odd-couple domestic bliss gives the film its most likable scenes; they have something of the gawky charm of Greta Gerwig’s Frances Ha. But as a female writer with a small child, Celeste fails some basic plausibility tests. For a start, she seems to have all the solitude she needs, with endless time to stare meaningfully out of the window. The film’s grasp of being skint has a strong whiff of privilege, too. Celeste’s sole income source appears to be winning a few quid in poetry competitions (which somehow pays the rent and keeps her in gorgeous vintage-look dresses – though she is frequently seen rummaging in her purse for money to buy nappies or pay the babysitter). And Bellamacina’s decision to use Celeste’s poetry as a voiceover adds to the plausibility deficit: “Do you think you should try and live your life so you have an exciting obituary,” she muses high-mindedly on the tube. For me, the 83-minute running time seemed to drag out into a lifetime."
"John Boyega has resigned from his role as a brand ambassador for British cologne company Jo Malone following the news he was cut out of the Chinese version of a commercial he had conceived. Boyega publicly announced his decision on Twitter. “I don’t have time for nonsense”, wrote the actor, in an apparent rejection of the company’s apology on Monday. He wrote: “Their decision to replace my campaign in China by using my concepts and substituting a local brand ambassador for me, without either my consent or prior notice, was wrong. The film celebrated my personal story – showcasing my home town, including my friends and featuring my family.” The original commercial, A London Gent, whose narrative Boyega was the driving force behind, shows the actor surrounded by candles on a film set, thinking about his childhood and his family and friends in Peckham. Scenes portray the actor on a white stallion surrounded by pals on BMX bikes on an estate, as well as walking through a local market and dancing in a club. The Chinese version, which stars actor Liu Haoran and features no black people, reuses many of the same concepts, including the structure and the horseplay motif. However, it does not appear to show Liu in Peckham or to be quite so directly autobiographical. The film has since been removed from the Jo Malone website. Earlier this month, Boyega highlighted what he perceived to be systemic racism encountered during his time filming Star Wars. “What I would say to Disney is do not bring out a black character, market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are and then have them pushed to the side,” he told GQ. The actor, who won much praise for his uncompromising protests following the death of George Floyd, also spoke about his experiences handling the racist backlash to his casting in the franchise. In 2015, the Chinese version of the poster for Star Wars: The Force Awakens significantly reduced his character’s prominence."
"Stars including Kate Winslet and Mark Wahlberg will be unveiling new Oscar-aiming films at an unconventional Toronto film festival over the next two weeks. The festival, typically viewed as a major stop on the trail to awards, will consist of a combination of socially distanced physical premieres and virtual screenings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Non-Canadian press have been advised to cover the festivities from home. “We began this year planning for a 45th festival much like our previous editions but along the way we had to rethink just about everything,” said Cameron Bailey, artistic director and co-head of the festival. “This year’s lineup reflects that tumult. The names you already know are doing brand new things this year, and there’s a whole crop of exciting new names to discover.” While masks are required within the festival’s main headquarters, where attendees often congregate, they were originally deemed optional while seated in cinemas, a point that led to concern. Organisers reversed this at the last minute, deciding to close all concession stands, meaning masks must be worn during films, following the advice of public health experts. This year, major festivals have created a non-competitive alliance that has allowed them to collaborate and share their slates. That means the romantic drama Ammonite, which was originally scheduled for a Cannes premiere, will now have its first screening at Toronto. The film, directed by Francis Lee (God’s Own Country), tells the story of the underappreciated British palaeontologist Mary Anning, played by the Oscar winner Kate Winslet, in the early 19th century. When it was revealed that the drama would focus on a romance between Anning and a female friend, played by the Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan, despite the lack of historical basis, there was unrest among Anning’s relatives. But Lee has stated that “it’s not a biopic” and is a film about women finding liberation during an oppressed time. “It’s a story about women speaking up, speaking out,” said Winslet. “I think uncovering stories where women were repressed in such a systemic way is highlighting how history has covered up those successes. We’re not going to do that any more, world.” The Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg is hoping to return to the race with the fact-based drama Good Joe Bell from Reinaldo Marcus Green, the acclaimed director of Monsters and Men, and the Oscar-winning screenwriters of Brokeback Mountain. The film tells the true story of a father whose son kills himself after homophobic bullying and his mission to travel the country to warn others about bigotry. “I’m open to however the film needs to be released,” Green said, aware of an unusual awards season that could see a number of hybrid digital and physical releases. “I do hope they will get it out this year, given everything and the election. I think it could strike a nerve.” The festival will also see directorial debuts from actors such as Halle Berry, whose drama Bruised sees her starring as an MMA fighter, and David Oyelowo, whose family fantasy The Water Man sees him starring alongside Rosario Dawson. Other stars with big premieres include Idris Elba, leading the urban cowboy tale Concrete Cowboy, and Rosamund Pike, heading up the thriller I Care A Lot alongside Peter Dinklage. Last year’s festival saw the premieres of the Oscar contenders Jojo Rabbit, Knives Out, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, and Harriet."
"Geraldine Viswanathan is a 25-year-old Australian actor and comedian of Indian descent who has appeared in a handful of movie-stealing supporting roles, including Blockers and The Package. Now comes a romcom vehicle for her leading actor talents, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky (whose script credits include Gossip Girl and Grey’s Anatomy). The Broken Hearts Gallery was supposed to be the big romcom of the summer – a little something for the ladies while their beaux piled into Tenet, possibly. Finally arriving in cinemas this weekend, it is something of a letdown: a funny but conventional glossy romcom. But there is no messing with Viswanathan, who is undoubtedly the main attraction. She plays funny and unfiltered Lucy, an art gallery assistant who has a quirky-stroke-creepy collection of mementos from past relationships cluttering her bedroom in a Brooklyn flatshare. She is dating her boss, Max (Utkarsh Ambudkar), an art-world poser whose studious man-bun is a dead giveaway to hidden shallows. After she makes a drunken show of herself at a work event, Lucy is hit with a double-whammy of getting fired and being dumped by Max. The plot is default romcom but Krinksy’s rams her script with smart-relatable lines. “I bet she has an amazing but crazy skincare routine,” whispers Lucy in awe after meeting Max’s impressive new doctor girlfriend. Lucy is a character with Bridget Jones, Sex and the City and Girls in her DNA, but Viswanathan brings something of her own to the role: an excitable sense of fun and fast-talking wit. You feel she has the sharpness for the lines she delivers, and her charisma goes a long way when Lucy meets bland, unthreatening Nick (Stranger Things’ Dacre Montgomery), who is opening a boutique hotel in Brooklyn. Lucy finds her niche installing a gallery in the foyer – collecting strangers’ heartbreak stories and breakup trinkets. Viswanathan has said the only role she expected to play in a romantic comedy as a woman of colour was the best friend; this film is pure romcom fantasy but Broken Hearts Gallery is radical in one important respect: challenging the film industry’s perceptions of what a leading woman looks like."
"There are good, sincere performances here, and it is directed with confidence. But I couldn’t make friends with this film because of some social-realist cliches and a contrived, high-concept plot. Nocturnal deserves praise for giving us a third act where so many films, of whatever sort, don’t. But this didn’t feel convincing. Lauren Coe and Cosmo Jarvis do sterling work as the two leads. Laurie is a 17-year-old newcomer at her school in a seaside town; she is doing her best to fit in, and is part of the athletics track team. Pete is a painter and decorator in his 30s who is employed to work on some school outbuildings; he is a notorious philanderer and womaniser who hangs around the sports field and soon becomes obsessed with Laurie, and she – bored with her goody-two-shoes image – starts flirting with a handsome older guy. Their relationship progresses, though platonically, and it seems in some ways more meaningful than Pete’s one-night stands. Pete is strange and obsessively guilt-stricken when Laurie starts frankly suggesting sex: has he developed a conscience? There are some nice scenes and I loved the “silent disco” sequence in which Pete tries dancing with Laurie in a boyfriend-girlfriend “date” scenario, but finally explodes with self-consciousness and walks out. Other scenes were not quite so strong: the one where the two mess anarchically around in the scuzzy seaside amusement arcade feels as if it has been done many times before in films like this. Coe and Jarvis are really good actors. They are selling it hard and the whole film is technically accomplished, but for me the story was glib. "
"The English composer Stephen Warbeck won an Oscar for his work on Shakespeare in Love, but has never directed a film before. He makes his writer-director debut, in collaboration with John-Paul Davidson (director of various Michael Palin and Stephen Fry-fronted travelogues) on this whimsical road movie that has little dialogue but plenty of music. Ciarán Hinds stars as the titular hat-wearer, who we meet dining on razor clams and rosé at an empty harbourside restaurant, with only a framed photograph of an unnamed woman for company. He inadvertently witnesses some apparent criminal activity and makes a quick escape in a Fiat 500 (the photo carefully placed on the passenger seat), followed by five angry men in their Citroën Dyane. So begins a picturesque odyssey across the French countryside, the best Provençal driving holiday you’ve never had. It’s a car chase, technically, but a slow one. Certainly, the sense of peril is insufficient to prevent both the pursued and his pursuers from stopping off for a good lunch whenever the mood strikes. And should they happen upon a live jazz band in a charming little town square, or a stranger singing an impromptu opera aria, what’s to stop them just sitting there in the late afternoon sun for a while? All this enjoyment of la belle vie leaves little time for slapstick, but The Man in the Hat is, in any case, more socially adept than his silent comedy forebears. He’s a sensitive listener (Hinds, utilising those melancholy eyes) and the people he meets along the road – the Damp Man (Stephen Dillane), the Biker (Maïwenn) – seem comfortable sharing their own tales of love and loss. It’s a Francophile fantasy that may be too twee for some, but the French tourist board will surely be satisfied."
"Bong Joon-ho’s black-comic satire Barking Dogs Never Bite has been re-released after 20 years, and in many ways it could be seen as a thematic forerunner to his Oscar-winning hit Parasite, with its vision of strange people and strange secrets in a basement. But it’s entirely distinctive on its own (bizarre) terms: a film about animal cruelty (loosely inspired by the 19th-century children’s novel A Dog of Flanders by Marie Louise de la Ramée, perennially popular in Korea) and it begins with a huge “no animals were harmed” disclaimer. As well it might. The various moments of dog-jeopardy and dog-distress will have you hiding under your seat – and a certain dog rescue scene is like something out of The Shining. Lee Sung-jae plays Yun-ju, a hapless postgrad student with a pregnant partner. The pair live in a crumbling apartment building whose front doors open outwards – which is to be important in one chase scene. Yun-ju’s worries are compounded when he realises that he is expected to pay a hefty bribe to the elderly faculty professor to get a tenure-track job. The combination of financial anxiety and disillusionment triggers a mental breakdown and he becomes obsessed with a dog in a neighbouring flat whose incessant barking is driving him mad. He decides he has no choice but to kill the unfortunate animal. In fact, his misdeeds are to involve three dogs and bring him into fateful contact with an administrator called Hyun-nam (Bae Doona) who has to press an official stamp on all “Lost Dog” notices. The movie is by turns wacky, farcical and grimly realist. The dogs might bark, but the ones doing the biting are the humans: the lazy, venal, corrupt, depressed, greedy people who have no one but themselves to blame for living a dog’s life. "
"An excellent brief documentary about a heroic grassroots political movement whose importance reveals itself more clearly in retrospect with every year that passes.  In late 1970s Britain, fascists and racists were gaining ground and members of the nervously silent political establishment were showing themselves the heirs of Neville Chamberlain and Paul von Hindenburg. A photographer and underground theatre activist called Red Saunders realised something had to be done. He co-founded Rock Against Racism to mount demonstrations and concerts against the far-right National Front and it was the great achievement of RAR to help to bring together the forces of punk, ska, reggae and the new wave – whose fanbases might otherwise be indifferent to each other – to present a united front to counter and mock the ugly bigots. This film confronts some uncomfortable truths: it wasn’t simply a matter of harnessing the innate progressive liberalism of pop music against prejudice. Some of music’s biggest names (Clapton, Bowie, Rod Stewart) were making fatuous pro-Enoch Powell pronouncements – a bleary male-menopausal phase that can’t entirely be forgotten. And some punks were themselves displaying satirical shock-value Nazi emblems that we could have done without. Rock Against Racism channelled all that energy and rebellion, culminating in a glorious free concert in Victoria Park, east London – Britain’s Woodstock. This film reminds you of the visceral power of the Clash and, indeed, the Tom Robinson Band. (Rubika Shah’s film also makes a spirited case for 999 being one of the best and most neglected punk bands.) Perhaps the most interesting case was Jimmy Pursey’s band Sham 69, which had a skinhead following. Sham 69’s appearance on the RAR bill was vital in reaching out to the white working class, who were ripe for NF recruitment. With racism now being becoming normalised in the corridors of power all over the developed world, the spirit of RAR is still needed."
"Raised in a good German family, 20-year-old Luisa (Mala Emde) is now in open revolt, part of a different breed of good family. She’s a first-year law student and ardent antifa warrior, determined to defeat a resurgent wave of neo-Nazis in her town. Her parents are part of a local hunting group and like to hang up their kills in the woods – but Luisa is now veggie and wants no part of that world. “A pity,” says her dad. “You were always our best shot.” This year’s Venice film festival has been notably lacking in big studio films and this has freed up space for the occasional rogue interloper or narrow-eyed insurrectionist. And Tomorrow the Entire World, by the German writer-director Julia von Heinz, blasts on to the Lido to tell us about harsh reality and the current field of conflict; a terrain that’s at once under our very noses and impossibly removed from the sunny tourist haunts of Venice. The tale drifts and falters when I wished it would have hit home with more conviction, but that may be partly the point. The struggle is endless, unwinnable. Everybody is compromised. We’re in the city of Mannheim, although it could be any number of others. Von Heinz’s drama unfolds in a no man’s land of underpasses, kebab shops and unclaimed ground. It’s a place of doorstep drinkers and bus-shelter smokers, a place to be fought over by left and right alike. In class, Luisa learns that the German constitution allows for pre-emptive action to be taken against non-democratic groups. But who makes that call? Who decides which group is which? It depends which end of the telescope you’re looking down. On TV, for instance, the newsreader refers to “clashes between rightwing protesters and leftwing protesters” and the blithe moral equivalence – the reductive even-handedness of the comment – immediately sticks in the craw. But, in the case of P31, Luisa’s antifa collective, it may not be entirely wide of the mark. The group is led by Noah Saavedra’s preening, macho Alfa (the name is a little too on-the-nose), who appears to have little interest in ideology and idealism beyond the opportunities they provide to pick fights or get laid. Alfa, by and large, is in antifa for the thrill, and his unconvincing relationship with Luisa is probably the film’s weak link. Or perhaps what Von Heinz is showing is a crucial changing of the guard: the way in which a new arrival such as Luisa – for all her baggage and privilege – can redirect the movement back to its core principles. Tellingly, this is a film full of flawed men. They’re either playing the role of a pound-shop Che Guevara, like Alfa, or living a lonely hermit’s existence like Dietmar (Andreas Lust), a legendary 90s radical who’s now gone to ground. The women, by contrast, are the tale’s true believers. After a scuffle with skinheads, Luisa and Alfa get their hands on a cheap burner phone. This in turn leads them to a Nazi rally by the rail tracks and a mysterious lock-up garage outside town. Proceeding along its stealthy course, Von Heinz’s tense, well-textured film treads a chilly, liminal country. Its activists are bundled in fleeces and scarves, warming themselves around matches and rollies, like soldiers in the trenches of a new kind of campaign. When a pigeon beats its wings inside a darkened multi-storey, it sounds for all the world like a grenade going off."
"Linda Manz, who has died aged 58 from lung cancer, gave one of the most haunting child performances in all cinema in Terrence Malick’s 1978 film Days of Heaven, made when she was 15. She played the young sister of a hot-tempered labourer (Richard Gere), who travels with him and his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) picking up farm work across the Texas panhandle during the early 20th century. There had never been a face like hers: bruised, scarred, angular, with a confrontational stare that could soften unexpectedly, she looked at once unformed and prematurely world-weary. “Sometimes I’d feel very old,” she says in the film, “like my whole life’s over, like I’m not around any more.” It wasn’t hard to believe. A casting call for the part had gone out to schools in New York City. “Linda came in because her teacher thought she was a real character,” said the film’s editor, Billy Weber. “When she came in to meet Terry, she looked at him and said, ‘I liked your script.’ He hired her on the spot!” She was, said Weber, “someone who barely knew what movies were. It never got through to her that the people in the movie, the other actors, had names that weren’t their real names.” Her own character had to be called Linda “because that was the only thing she would respond to”. “Linda was instinctively brilliant,” said Gere. “And with anyone with that kind of brilliance, you just give them space. Terry was smart enough and sensitive enough to just let her be. And she’s extraordinary in the film because of that.” If her striking physiognomy and unself-conscious mannerisms were spellbinding, it was her otherworldly narration, which was not in the original script, that helped lift Days of Heaven into a divine class of its own. Malick and Weber had struggled to shape the material in the editing room – Paramount was not shown a cut of the film until 20 months after shooting had wrapped – and it was during this arduous process that the idea arose to use Manz’s musings as a kind of connective tissue. Most voiceovers provide clarity or fill in gaps. This one does nothing of the sort: Manz’s elliptical stream-of-consciousness, given a hard edge by her chewy New York drawl, often goes against the grain of the image, mixing tenses and introducing digressions and non-sequiturs. “They took me into a voice recording studio,” she told the Village Voice in 2011. “No script, nothing, I just watched the movie and rambled on.” One of the most memorable passages of her narration (“There’s gonna be creatures running every which way, some of them burned, half their wings burning…”) was taken from Manz paraphrasing for Malick the Book of Revelation, which she had recently discovered and about which she was eager to tell him. “Her voice and her ability to very nakedly, but kind of pleasantly and poetically, describe her universe is mind-boggling,” said Gere. “This movie would not be that movie without that voiceover, wouldn’t be that way without the quality of her voice, just the timbre of her voice is so interesting.” Malick did not make another film for 20 years; Manz, too, soon disappeared for almost as long. Immediately after Days of Heaven she played Peewee, the plucky, pint-sized girlfriend of a gargantuan skinhead, in The Wanderers (1979), adapted from Richard Price’s novel about 1960s gangs in the Bronx. The writer-director Philip Kaufman was so bewitched by Manz that he created the character especially for her. She was also intensely powerful in her only lead role, in Dennis Hopper’s punk psychodrama Out of the Blue (1980). She played Cebe, a disaffected teenager struggling to reconnect with her ex-con father (Hopper). Whether playing drums on stage, doggedly singing Elvis Presley’s Teddy Bear as her parents’ marriage disintegrates around her or simply idling on the streets gawping at the world, Manz was electrifying. “I think I was Cebe,” she said. She was born in New York, where she attended half a dozen schools. Her father had walked out when she was two; “For a long time, I was always asking people to adopt me,” she said. She was raised by her mother, Sophie, a cleaner, who encouraged her to attend acting classes. Along with Days of Heaven, The Wanderers and Out of the Blue, she also appeared in Boardwalk and as a juvenile delinquent in the sitcom Dorothy (both 1979), which ran for only four episodes in the same year. In the early 1980s, she gave up acting. “There was a whole bunch of new young actors out there, and I was kind of getting lost in the shuffle,” she said. “So I laid back and had three kids. Now I enjoy just staying home and cooking soup.” She married Bobby Guthrie, who was the camera operator who came to Michael Jackson’s rescue when his hair caught fire while filming a Pepsi commercial. In 1997, she made a low-key comeback in Gummo, Harmony Korine’s disturbing portrait of small-town American youth, in which she brandished a gun and tap-danced in over-sized men’s shoes. What she did, said Korine, “wasn’t even acting. It was like the way I felt about Buster Keaton when I first saw him. There was a kind of poetry about her, a glow.” In the same year, she appeared in one scene in David Fincher’s thriller The Game, starring Michael Douglas. As quickly as she returned, she vanished again, leaving a mountainous untainted reputation built on the smallest molehill of work. She is survived by Guthrie and their children, Michael and William, as well as three grandchildren. A third son, Christopher, died in 2018.

"‘No one knows how this history will be written,” a soldier muses portentously in the new Chinese blockbuster The Eight Hundred. If he could see 80 years into the future, he would have the answer: as an epic, effects-enhanced patriotic action movie. While the rest of the world’s cinemas are still in coronavirus recovery mode, most of China’s 70,000 screens have been open since early August, and The Eight Hundred is a sign it no longer needs Hollywood content to fill them. It has been compared to western war movies such as Dunkirk (although there is more than a touch of Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor in there), and so far it has taken more than $400m (£308m) at the box office, making it the second-highest-grossing movie of the year worldwide. The Eight Hundred draws attention to the meteoric progress of China’s increasingly blockbuster-oriented film industry, but also to the Chinese government’s determination to stamp its authority on it. The two might be on a collision course. The Eight Hundred depicts the legendary defence of the Sihang warehouse in Shanghai, where, in 1937, an isolated battalion of Chinese soldiers held out against the invading Japanese for four days and, as the film would have it, “restored the pride of a nation”. China’s film industry might also take some pride in The Eight Hundred. Shot entirely on the giant-screen Imax format (a first for a Chinese movie), it took 10 years to make, with a reported budget of $80m. You can see where the money went. There are huge, often violent action set-pieces. The Shanghai set – a huge project that took 18 months to build – is detailed and convincing, especially the foreign concession area, populated by Europeans and Americans as well as Chinese civilians. The Japanese avoided striking this British-governed area, which was just across the creek from the Sihang warehouse, giving western observers a ringside seat. At this point, China was seeking western support in the Sino-Japanese war, so the Sihang warehouse incident was already, in part, a theatrical exercise. The Eight Hundred’s success is not quite as straightforward, though. The movie was scheduled to open the Shanghai film festival in June 2019, but its release was suddenly cancelled just days before, owing to “technical difficulties”. One of the problems with the Sihang warehouse story is that the resisting Chinese forces were from the nationalist side, the Kuomintang, who were later defeated by Mao’s communists and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. At one point, the soldiers rally round the flag, Iwo Jima-style, as the Japanese try to shoot it down – except the flag is that of the Republic of China (red, with a white sun on a blue square in the corner). It is now the national flag of Taiwan. Last year was the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, so for the ruling Communist party to be glorifying the future founders of Taiwan was not a good look. In a revealing comment, the secretary general of the China Red Culture Research Association, a government-affiliated group, reportedly said of the film: “It is a reversal of history and misleads the audience. If left unchecked, it will certainly deprive the entire Communist party of its historical basis. Once the party’s leadership is lost, the Chinese nation is bound to fall into the deep, miserable abyss of colonised and semi-colonised countries.” The Eight Hundred’s history had to be rewritten. It is impossible to know what was changed, but in the finished movie much is made of the support of the Chinese civilians across the river, who catapult over supplies and lift spirits. As for the troublesome flag, it is usually seen from a distance, and is conspicuously missing its white sun symbol. The appetite for Chinese blockbusters seems to be coming from both directions. “Because Hollywood films like The Avengers still play such a huge role in the Chinese box office, there’s a desire to displace that, or at least to have domestic films which are seen to be of as high a quality, both for the global market in terms of soft power, but also for the domestic market,” says James Mudge, director of the UK’s Chinese visual festival, which has been bringing Chinese cinema to the UK since 2011. Last year, four of the top 20 highest-grossing movies worldwide were Chinese. Leading the pack were Ne Zha, a family animation, and The Wandering Earth, an effects-heavy space sci-fi later picked up by Netflix. Last month, Chinese authorities released a document calling for more homegrown sci-fi, and suggesting such movies should “highlight Chinese values, inherit Chinese culture and aesthetics, cultivate contemporary Chinese innovation”, as well as implementing “Xi Jinping thought”. The document also called for the industry to support research and development in key areas such as visual effects (both The Eight Hundred and The Wandering Earth rely on western expertise for their effects). The bigger China’s movie industry becomes, though, the greater the urge to control the message. In 2018, the Communist party’s propaganda department took direct control of the entertainment industry. That year, the government also carried out a huge clampdown on tax evasion in the film industry, making an example of the actor Fan Bingbing, who mysteriously “disappeared” for three months. She reemerged after making a grovelling public apology and paying a fine of nearly $130m. The Eight Hundred is by no means the first film to find its release suddenly cancelled. Last February, two Chinese movies were pulled from the Berlin film festival: Better Days, a high-school bullying drama, and One Second, set during the Cultural Revolution and made by the renowned director Zhang Yimou. Zhang is an illustration of how fickle the relationship between censor and film-maker can be. In the 1990s, the arthouse darling’s films (such as Raise The Red Lantern and The Story of Qiu Ju) regularly won awards at foreign festivals, even if they were often banned in China. Zhang was gradually brought back into the fold, directing the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Then, in 2013, he was fined more than US$1m for violating China’s one-child policy. One Second seems to have disappeared completely (such disputes can take years to resolve), but Zhang’s career is by no means over. He has other films in the pipeline. “The biggest thing is not the censorship itself; it’s the unpredictability of it,” says Mudge. “The things to avoid are pretty much the same” – chiefly politically sensitive issues such as Mao, Tibet, the Tiananmen Square massacre and Hong Kong democracy – “but if you’re a film-maker or an investor or a producer, and you know that your film could get yanked the day before it’s supposed to be released, even after you’ve spent all your marketing money, it’s a problem.” It is also a problem for Hollywood film-makers, who are effectively playing by the same rules in order to get their product on to China’s screens. In a report last month, PEN America condemned Hollywood’s pro-China self-censorship. “As US film studios compete for the opportunity to access Chinese audiences, many are making difficult and troubling compromises on free expression,” it said. The cravenness could have backfired. The recent controversy over Disney’s Mulan filming in Xinjiang province, where major human rights abuses have taken place against Muslim minorities, led to a media blackout of the film in China, where it was released last weekend. Mulan only just beat The Eight Hundred to the No 1 spot, but its takings are expected to be small. It is dangerous to annoy China’s censors, but it is dangerous to appease them, too. Movie stars find themselves in a similar bind. Mulan star Liu Yifei’s support for Hong Kong police suppressing pro-democracy protests prompted boycotts of Mulan in Hong Kong and Taiwan. But to criticise the Chinese authorities would be career suicide. “It is a hornet’s nest. So why go near it?,” says Yau Yee-ning, a culture reporter based in Beijing. Most stars studiously avoid commenting on anything political, she says, and interviews are carefully controlled. “They have to see the interview questions first, and any they don’t like you have to take out. Any mention of the government or anything a little bit sensitive, they won’t answer it.” Hong Kong’s film industry once dwarfed mainland China’s, but as the balance has shifted, its own stars have been forced to pick sides. Those who have supported Hong Kong democracy have been effectively blacklisted by the Chinese industry, including Chow Yun-fat, Anthony Wong Chau-sang and Chapman To Man-chak. Others, such as Jackie Chan – for decades the global face of Chinese cinema – have sided with the mainland, and against pro-democracy protesters. In 2009, Chan, who has now lived in China for more than a decade, said: “We Chinese need to be controlled. If we’re not being controlled, we’ll just do what we want.” As a result, Chan is now deeply unpopular in Hong Kong, says Yau. “He’s getting more patriotic as the years pass, so Hong Kong people just totally rule him out now, but he’s become an international star so he doesn’t really care.” While the movies are getting bigger and better, China seems to have little interest in exporting its culture. With a home audience of 1.4 billion, the focus is still inward. The Eight Hundred is being released in 33 UK cities and 60 countries worldwide, but none of China’s recent blockbusters has made even 1% of their revenues from foreign sales. For now, it seems, China is happy to be in the position of the soldiers in The Eight Hundred: barricaded in its stronghold, fending off incursions from without, but earning the admiration of the foreigners all the same. Then again, the movie ends with the Chinese soldiers abandoning the Sihang warehouse and the ruins of Shanghai, and crossing the bridge into the bustling, multicultural foreign zone. The symbolism might not be on-message, but this history is still being written."
"A great deal of excitement greeted the news, on Tuesday, that Madonna would direct her own biopic, from a screenplay written by the singer with Diablo Cody (Juno, Young Adult). Millions of admirers of the singer’s career as an icon of music and pop culture were joined by dozens of fans of her film career in celebrating the announcement. But what does Madonna helming her own biopic presage for the quality of the movie to come? Initial signs, it must be said, are middling. In producing her own biopic, Madge is joining a recent spate of musical biopics including Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, both of which were produced by their subjects, politely received by critics, in contention for awards, and fared well at the box office. At the start of both films, there were concerns that the movies would lead to a soft-soaping of their subjects: Sacha Baron Cohen quit the Queen movie early on, saying in essence that the film was too much about the success of the band Queen and not enough about Freddie Mercury; he was replaced by Rami Malek, who duly won an Oscar. This stuff pleases the fans, and the acts of mimicry involved invariably lead to plaudits for the actors involved (not least because we all know the celebrities they are imitating, and can therefore easily judge whether the impression is successful), but does it make for great cinema? This writer would argue not. Madonna being so closely involved in the making of her own biopic could go either way: arguably, we might get closer to a full picture of the person behind the fame than ever before, by having her co-write and direct the film; equally, this could lead to an exercise lacking in introspection and self-criticism. The biopic genre hardly flies very high at the best of times: the format lends itself to rather rote storylines revolving around key breakthroughs in the artist’s life, rather than creating a fully artistic proposition, one that might look at the performer from an angle. Not every film should follow this model, of course, but I’m Not There, Todd Haynes’s magnificently awkward look at the life and music of Bob Dylan, was all the more interesting for the way it sidestepped pure facts and splintered the man at its heart into several characters. A further warning sign, of course, comes from Madonna’s previous career in cinema, which has had mixed results to say the least. Though her acting debut in Desperately Seeking Susan met with some enthusiasm, and she won a Golden Globe for Evita, Madonna is also dogged by a kind of cursed reputation as far as film is concerned: she has won a record number of Razzie awards for her onscreen performances in such mediocrities as Who’s That Girl and The Next Best Thing, and her pet project W.E. was savaged by the press. On film Madonna seems to radiate discomfort: she doesn’t lack presence, but she has struggled to commit to a performance, and always seems to come off as more herself than anybody else. There is a paradox here in that Madonna has been probably the most visually arresting artist of her time, and her career and music videos attest to an ability to use pictures really interestingly. She has also shown, famously, an ability to change and reinvent herself over the years, often with the use of the moving image. Directors such as David Fincher, Chris Cunningham and Jonas Åkerlund pop up in her videography; at least three of her music videos (Mary Lambert’s Like a Prayer, Fincher’s Vogue and Cunningham’s Frozen) are iconic works, still known and referenced to this day. All of this, I would argue, bodes rather well for Madonna’s biopic project: her video work, and her efforts to create an iconography of herself, from costumes to her Sex book, are successful because they centre on Madonna herself. For an artist who has always been so resolutely in command of her image, this film offers an opportunity to create a work that adds to her own legacy. It may be that the film we get, while likely to be propagandistic in nature, is madly fascinating in what it reveals of Madonna’s manipulation of image. After all, she is the subject that she knows most about; though her music stays resolutely away from the personal, her videos all centre on herself. That she won’t be acting in this film is a bonus. The film-maker Mark Cousins tweeted about his excitement, adding: “Autobiopics can be great: Jodorowsky, Fellini, Varda, Bill Douglas, Youssef Chahine, Sarah Polley, Joanne Hogg. So many more.” Passing over the fact that these artists had paid their dues as film-makers before getting round to their own lives, there is something to be said for the way the personal can bring out previously unheard of qualities in an artist. Polley’s Stories We Tell is confessional but also slippery, making use of stand-ins and blurring the lines of autofiction: if Madonna uses this as an exercise in myth-building, it may be that her film-making abilities are lifted to new heights.  "
"I must confess I’ve previously been a little cynical about Toronto international film festival (Tiff) audiences, with their boundless enthusiasm, their jack-in-the-box standing ovations, their need to haul bucket-sized cups of coffee with them everywhere. But gosh, how I miss them this year. The festival in its much reduced Covid-compliant form is a very different beast. The programme is considerably smaller (50 feature films compared with 333 last year) and less starry: the Hollywood studios, which habitually swoop in to test the mettle of their potential awards-contenders, are largely absent. There are no visitors from overseas and just a few physical screenings – in drive-ins, at outdoor screens and socially distanced cinemas in the festival hub. Most of the festival, for most delegates, myself included, has been an entirely digital experience. But while necessary, this mixing up of the formula has served to highlight just what makes Toronto such a vibrant, vital event in more normal times. The lack of the collective sense of discovery is particularly stinging given the fact that there are treasures in the programme that would have been bona fide crowd-pleasers if only there was a crowd to please. Foremost of these is Limbo, the second feature from writer-director Ben Sharrock. Set in the Outer Hebrides, shot in a palette of purgatorial greys and water-logged earth tones, the film brings something of the wryly downbeat humour of Elia Suleiman to this story of asylum seekers, marooned in bureaucracy and stranded on an island while they wait for decisions on their cases. It’s a marvel of tonal dexterity, balancing moments of warmth and humour against stabs of wrenching sadness. In a normal year, this might have prompted post-screening group hugs in the Scotiabank theatre. Traditionally more hug-averse British audiences can catch the film as part of the London film festival programme next month. Also screening in the London programme is Wolfwalkers, a gorgeous animated fantasy set in 17th-century Ireland and created by the team behind The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea. The distinctive animation style, which combines an angularity that evokes the sparse, stylised animals of illustrator Charley Harper with a saturating wash of Celtic mystery, will be familiar to fans of the previous two films. The central theme, which explores the collision between the delicately balanced natural world and the encroaching threat of humanity, has drawn comparisons with Studio Ghibli’s Princess Mononoke. It’s a remarkable work: inventive, agile and driven by the tumbling feral joy of its wolf-girl protagonists. London film festival punters will also get to see another of the most hotly anticipated films of Tiff: a period lesbian romance that unfolds on the drizzly beaches of Lyme Regis, Ammonite is the follow-up to God’s Own Country by Francis Lee. It places Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan (both excellent) in the kind of smouldering but unspoken sexual dynamic that will be familiar to fans of his first feature. The film divided opinion, with some critics put off by the morose dampness of the British seaside backdrop and others thrilled by the picture’s unconventional – and confrontational – depiction of Victorian female sexuality. Relationships come in all shapes and forms at Tiff, but few are as showily chaotic as that of Chloe (Denise Gough) and Mickey (Sebastian Stan) in Argyris Papadimitropoulos’s Monday. I adored this shrapnel-blast of black comedy, which is described by the director as “a romcom gone wrong” – and how! There are moments so mortifying that it hurts to watch (a drug-addled naked moped ride through Athens is real peer-through-the-fingers stuff), but for all the abrasive humour, there’s a kernel of uncomfortable truth lurking in this anti-romance. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the lovely, tentative courtship at the heart of the terrific Palestinian comedy-drama Gaza Mon Amour, by twin brothers Arab and Tarzan Nasser. A 60-year-old fisherman Issa (Salim Dau) is secretly in love with widow Siham (Hiam Abbass), but it’s not until he pulls a very priapic statue of Apollo out of the sea in his net that Issa plucks up the courage to speak to her. Family relationships provide rich material: I particularly enjoyed Concrete Cowboy, in which Idris Elba stars as a member of a real-life community of African American “urban cowboys” who break and ride horses on the streets of north Philadelphia. David Oyelowo’s directorial debut, The Water Man, is a rousing family fantasy adventure that nods to 1980s classics such as Stand By Me. And Cathy Brady’s Wildfire, a tale of sisters set in an Irish border town, is superb: forceful, uncomfortable and fiercely intelligent. And while it might not be the awards launchpad we are used to, Tiff is not without Oscar buzz. One Night in Miami, the feature film directing debut of Regina King, imagines an evening in which real-life friends Cassius Clay, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Malcolm X gather together. King’s deft handling injects energy and urgency into what could have been a wordy collision of egos; it looks like a contender to me. Best feature films Limbo (directed by Ben Sharrock), Wolfwalkers (Tomm Moore, Ross Stewart), Monday (Argyris Papadimitropoulos). Best documentary Enemies of the State, 76 Days. Best performances Nora-Jane Noone and the late Nika McGuigan, Wildfire; Amir El-Masry, Limbo; Shai Avivi, Here We Are; Kingsley Ben-Adir, One Night in Miami. Discovery of the festival Cathy Brady, director of Wildfire. Most resilient hair Chloë Grace Moretz, who remains immaculately coiffed even after dangling from the underside of the wing of a flying plane and fighting a clawed demon in the utterly ludicrous but undeniably entertaining Shadow in the Cloud. Best horse Boo, Concrete Cowboy. Most trenchant political allegory Taiwan’s parliament overrun with zombies in Get the Hell Out; the inherited pain of the Troubles in Wildfire. Most anxiety-inducing moment for germaphobes Kate Winslet pees on the beach, wipes her hands on her skirt and then breaks a pasty in half for Saoirse Ronan in Ammonite."
"As a child who grew up in China with little exposure to Disney until I was eight, the idea of a princess marrying a prince and living happily ever after was something entirely foreign. I was more familiar with the fox and snake spirits in Chinese folklore that transformed into beautiful women and sorceresses, and the cross-dressing heroines of wuxia martial-arts TV shows of the 90s. It’s no surprise, then, that Disney’s 1998 film Mulan was more relatable than Sleeping Beauty. Mulan was not only Chinese but had a mission greater than marriage – to save her father and country – and she didn’t need saving herself. For Disney, she was the first “non-princess” who did not end up marrying a prince. It was a mortal’s story: there were no spells or supernatural forces to help her fight her battles, and she did not levitate off rooftops like the wuxia women. Her only celestial remedy was a plump, cheering squad of ancestor spirits and a funny little serpent called Mushu. The emphasis on determination and strength in Disney’s animated Mulan inspired girls like me to work harder and be braver. Her story defied Chinese ideals, which for most of history held up fragility and weakness as the essence of beauty. From the frail and often sick Lin Daiyu in the great Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber to the deformities of “bound feet” that stopped upper-class women walking, patriarchal society had long-fetishised the physically compromised woman. Twenty years on and amid a resurgence of traditional notions of beauty and femininity in east Asia, the live-action Mulan was a chance for Disney to reinvent its “princess” once again and bring to life a mighty Asian warrior. But any hopes I had for a more progressive-looking action heroine were dashed after watching Liu Yifei fail to deliver the physical and emotional realities of being the only female soldier fighting in a man’s war and having to work 10 times harder – a theme, unsurprisingly, relevant today. Her physique is daintier than Zhang Ziyi’s in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon – whose portrayal of a female warrior was itself considered a way to “feminise and glamorise the martial arts” – and the endless flash-cuts to her stunt double during fight sequences also leaves the audience wondering why there was little effort to train her up for the role, fitting in with Mulan’s own transformation from weaver girl to warrior. The truth is that in an industry where “the thinner the better” goes without saying, bulking her up for the part could have had a detrimental effect on Liu’s chances of getting other roles in the Chinese film industry. It also raises the question of whether she was chosen purely as a “vase”, a Chinese term used for someone with a purely decorative effect. With Disney anxious to please the Chinese audience, producers were clearly keen to keep up Mulan’s porcelain perfection throughout the film, ensuring that her large wavy curls blew romantically over her untanned and only slightly soiled complexion. Looking dark isn’t a popular aesthetic in east Asia. Contrast this to Zhao Wei’s 2009 portrayal of Mulan, which more closely resembles a hardy, wartorn soldier. The homogeneity that such narrow standards of beauty have spawned in young Chinese performers is disturbingly striking. From martial arts shows like Eternal Love to fantasy dramas like Love O2O (both available on Netflix) the trend has shifted away from real women’s bodies towards a distinctly thinner, fairer, more schoolgirl-like appearance. A few years ago, a Beijing film director told me that going under the knife had become a rite of passage for aspiring actresses. Facial contouring surgery that shaves the jaw bone to achieve a slimmer, “v-shaped” face has also become popular and has made Seoul a mecca for plastic surgery. Such images have already fuelled a generation of women in pursuit of extreme “waif-like” aesthetics with a loathing for muscle definition. A 2018 paper found that among thousands of female university students, 27% were found to be underweight (classified as having a BMI below 18.5) because of an “ultra-thin ideal” and that the problem was potentially more severe in China than the west. It’s frustrating enough when the Asian entertainment industry propagates such unrealistic images of women’s bodies. When Disney panders to it and projects it to a global audience, it sends the message that looking like a Disney heroine will forever be more achievable than becoming one. Mulan was a chance for Disney to show Asian girls that they could be beautiful and strong at the same time, that there were no shortcuts or stand-in doubles in real life, but they too could join the army or pursue sports and be proud of the muscles they build. For now, you’re better off rewatching the animated Disney version, which will inspire you to dream big."
"Time travel has come a long way in a short time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Bruce Banner’s ham-fisted dabbling at the beginning of Avengers: Endgame swiftly quantum-leaping into Iron Man’s full-blown invention of functioning technology mid-way through the penultimate film of the studio’s phase three. But, with the news that Jonathan Majors has been cast as Kang the Conqueror in the forthcoming Ant-Man 3, it’s all about to get even stranger than Scott Lang zipping from the quantum zone to discover his underwear has inexplicably been soiled by his six-month-old self. Kang has the potential to connect the Avengers (or what’s left of them) to myriad other inhabitants of the comic-book world that we haven’t yet seen in the MCU, some of them primed and ready for inclusion following Disney’s takeover of 20th Century Fox. That’s because the supervillain has hopped in and out of multiple time lines from the ancient Egyptian era to the 3oth century, and even as far as the 40th century, like a cross between Zebedee from the Magic Roundabout and Doctor Who, finding ways to mix with the likes of the X-Men, Fantastic Four and even the Young Avengers along the way. How Ant-Man 3 director Peyton Reed deals with him remains to be seen, but Kang could easily be up there with Ultron and Thanos in terms of his impact on the next reel of Marvel movies. The fact he is being introduced in an Ant-Man movie also places Paul Rudd’s size-shifting superhero centre stage, on the mic, as far as the future of the MCU is concerned. In the comics, Kang is originally 3oth-century scholar Nathaniel Richards who discovers time travel technology invented by Doctor Doom (in his own past) and uses it to wreak havoc. (It’s possible Marvel will go a different route here, given Tony Stark is, as far as we know, the inventor of time travel in the MCU.) Perhaps the most intriguing version of the supervillain, as far as the current state of play in the post-Avengers universe goes, is the iteration who travelled back in time (in a 2005 comic-book run) to try to avoid his own nefarious future by becoming a hero instead. Once in the modern day, Richards renamed himself Iron Lad and set about helping to create the Young Avengers, a team of fledgling costumed crimefighters with links to the original team of Earth’s mightiest heroes. This was possible because the Avengers themselves had effectively disbanded, a situation conveniently mirroring that of the current movie universe. Iron Lad even romanced Ant-Man’s daughter, the superhero Stature, before being attacked by his future villain self, who turned out to be none too pleased with his youthful alter ego’s shift to the light. This could turn out to be a useful narrative line for Ant-Man 3, as Stature in the comics is the alter ego of Scott Lang’s daughter Cassie (who conveniently just aged up to a teenager during the mind-boggling events of Endgame). If that all sounds more complicated than Brexit, suffice to say that, by the end of this particular chapter, there’s also a path towards the resurrection of Paul Bettany’s Vision, one of only a handful of MCU superheroes not to make it back after Thanos’s dastardly behaviour in Infinity War. That’s if Scarlet Witch hasn’t already done the business via the forthcoming Disney+ show WandaVision. However Kang finds his way into the MCU, it will be the supervillain’s hectic time-travelling shenanigans that make him interesting. Leaping through the centuries is as much a part of the Kang DNA as binary-inspired mass murder is to Thanos, or wreaking robo-justice on mankind is to Ultron. Remove time travel from the equation and he’s just another blue-skinned, ornately-apparelled, helmet-bonced bad guy. If Marvel Studios sticks with the idea that Doom invented time travel, Kang’s introduction could be even more momentous. Perhaps Kang defeated Doom, stole his technology and wiped him from the timeline, setting up Stark as the new inventor of time travel. In this instance, the finale of Ant-Man could see the gauntlet-wielding supervillain taking his revenge and entering the picture. Maybe he even brings a version of the Fantastic Four that doesn’t make fans of the comic books want to eat their own kidneys out of the void with him."
"A monsoon of musical and sexual rapture bursts overhead in this film from director Steve McQueen, leaving condensation-sweat running down the walls and my cinematic pleasure going through the roof. It is co-scripted by McQueen with the writer and musician Courttia Newland, superbly designed by Helen Scott and gorgeously shot by Shabier Kirchner: a novella-sized feature that is part of an interrelating five-film series by McQueen called Small Axe for the BBC. Lovers Rock is an amazing, real-time urban pastoral, set in Ladbroke Grove, west London, over a single evening at a house party in 1980. Young people of first- and second-generation West Indian background show up – handing over a 50p entry fee on the door, paying extra for food and drink from the kitchen, lining up on the stairs for the lavatory, hanging out on the sofas dragged out into the back garden for intimate interludes, and dancing for hours in a rammed front room to the sound system’s sternum-shuddering lover’s rock, soul and reggae. This single night ignites a constellation of sexual sparks in its indoor cosmos, the traditional unspoken eddies of romantic disappointment, same-sex frissons, eruptions of family resentment, violent crises and an extraordinary, building musical euphoria. Lovers Rock is a cine-tab of MDMA, which through continuous immersion gradually, for me, ascended to something like an out-of-body experience. (It really needs to be seen on the big screen.) It’s a case of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning But Mostly Saturday Night. With creative audacity and clarity, McQueen hits the movie equivalent of the impossibly sweet high note that Janet Kay finds at the end of her 1979 track Silly Games, which this film showcases irresistibly. Yet for all the hedonism, there are darker undercurrents, at one remove: a brush with racism and sexual assault. McQueen and Newland leave it up to us to register the tacit associations with the violence that was, historically, soon to follow: the riots, the (still unsolved) New Cross fire. Amarah-Jae St Aubyn makes a great acting debut as Martha, nervously excited about going to the party with her friend Patty, played by Shaniqua Okwok. McQueen’s choreography shows how once there, they have to negotiate their position, judge their status, assess the possibilities, and deal with the gallantries offered by various men. Chief among these is Franklyn (Micheal Ward) and his friend Reggie (Francis Lovehall). It is Franklyn who looks to be the winner in the great game of love over the course of this night, which, in the mysterious zero-sum economy of fate, means that someone else has to be the loser, and that looks like being Patty, discontented with what’s happening for her. Everything and nothing seems to be happening in this film. It is dominated by that one continuous eardrum-melting party scene, which in a more conventional type of drama might have been a sequence lasting five minutes or so at the beginning, and – who knows? – Lovers Rock might yet turn out to serve this function in the Small Axe pentalogy as a whole. The film just offers up a continuous, non-narrative stream of fascination and pleasure in the dance scenes; it is pure intravenous atmosphere, and you are put right in the middle of the dancing, in the sweat and the music and the indoor cigarette smoke. I especially loved it when the DJ put on Carl Douglas’s Kung Fu Fighting and all the dancers, as excited as little kids, assume martial-arts poses. (I can’t help remembering Enter the Dragon from this period with Bruce Lee’s unforgettable demand to his pupil: “We need emotional content!” This film has got just that: emotional content.) And from this extended bacchanal a love story floats free: a pairing that is finally to take us, disorientatingly, outside the party to the Sunday-morning daylight and the wider world in which the characters have to show us their mastery of code-switching and whitespeak and the superhuman energy levels involved in going straight from the party to church. McQueen’s compositional sense is a marvel; the movie’s period and location is evoked with masterly skill, and the romance is wonderful. What a cure for lockdown depression."
"There’s a fine line, tonally, between knowing and smug, a line that writer-director Josh Ruben’s ambitiously contained comedy horror Scare Me treads precariously, its story of storytellers telling stories to scare each other almost stumbling over its own ego. But while there are lapses, an overindulgence here and there, Ruben mostly keeps his canny debut feature afloat and us entertained, if not exactly scared … Ruben plays Fred, a bitter 37-year-old frustrated by the fact that his desire to be a writer isn’t quite matched with his actual talent as a writer, hoping that a weekend away at a remote cabin in the Catskills might turn one of his ideas into something tangible. But he can’t move past a hokey logline (werewolves have guns … get revenge?) and his block is further compounded when he bumps into another writer also staying in the area. But the smart, sharp-tongued Fanny (Aya Cash) is a real writer, with a bestselling novel and all, and her success makes Fred feel even more of a failure. Later that evening, during a freak power outage, Fanny turns up on Fred’s doorstep and the two hunker down together, resentment brewing. To fill the time, Fanny comes up with an idea: they will take it in turn to tell scary stories to show off their creative abilities. Fred reluctantly agrees and the night starts to unravel. With such a premise, one might expect a horror anthology, the pair’s unlikely game acting as a framing device for a triptych of separate tales, but given the subgenre’s overexposure in the last decade and how miss-and-hit it so often is, it’s a relief that Ruben keeps us trapped in the cabin with them. It’s up to Fred and Fanny not only to construct their stories but to perform them effectively, a test of acting skills for both Ruben and Cash as well as patience for those with little tolerance for sitting on what closely resembles an actors’ workshop. It’s another fine line to be toed but the pair prove mostly adept at commanding the room as well as providing snarky pointers for each other, an uneasy tension expanding by the minute. The late inclusion of a third wheel (SNL’s Chris Redd playing a horror-loving pizza delivery guy) doesn’t really add much but as the film continues, it becomes clear that simply scaring and amusing us isn’t all that Ruben has on his mind. The character of Fred, who positions himself as a bookish liberal hipster, is quietly angry with a world that’s not given him the opportunities he feels he deserves while Fanny, a woman, has excelled in a way that he could only dream of (she brags that her hit novel is loved by the Guardian, no less). He’s the worst kind of toxic male, the kind who thinks a flannel shirt and a Rachel Yamagata playlist makes him woke, yet buried not far beneath the surface is a familiar stench of incensed entitlement that has him raging at Fanny’s success. How dare she when he hasn’t? Or even worse, how dare she when he can’t? While Fanny might make the odd, deserving jab at Fred’s predicament, she’s mostly encouraging (“Do the work!” she keeps saying) but the good gets buried by Fred’s inadequacy, and as beer and cocaine cloud the lines between fiction and reality, things go downhill. I’d argue that the road to violence could have been a bit shorter, Ruben allowing a little too much flab in what should be a lean little tale, its 104-minute runtime needing some snips to feel snappier. But it works for the most part because of Ruben and Cash and the spiky chemistry they share. Cash, who was a dimmed light in the obnoxiously eye-rolling sitcom You’re the Worst, is having a moment right now, with a deliciously vile performance in The Boys and now this, deftly flipping between light and dark by the minute, a confident, calculated turn that made me curious what she’d be like on stage, the whole film itself feeling more like a production adapted for the screen. While Scare Me doesn’t actually end up scaring us (the stories being told are more “Oh, OK” than “AGH, OK!”), Ruben’s tricky, goofy hybrid does just about enough for that not to really matter, its cabin-fire playfulness proving contagious, a nasty game we might not want to play but will happily watch instead."
"As rumours go, the one this week that Nicolas Cage might end up starring as Superman in Warner Bros’ Flash movie takes some beating. There’s every chance it was dreamed up to create waves in the blogosphere on a slow news day. Yet it is tantalising nonetheless, largely because this is just the sort of role no other actor in Hollywood but Cage would take on. He is, after all, the actor who felt he was perfect for the role of Kal-El in Tim Burton’s abortive Superman Lives, despite all evidence to the contrary. The excellent 2015 documentary The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened? even unearthed footage of the actor in costume, revealing a version of the last son of Krypton resembling a cross between Alice Cooper and an extra from Rollerball. And yet herein lies even more plausibility, for we already know The Flash is set to star Burton’s Batman, Michael Keaton, as a version of the caped crusader who Barry Allen meets after crossing into an alternative reality. Given that Superman Lives would have connected to Burton’s Batman films, why shouldn’t Burton’s Superman also appear? The famously comic-book-crazy Cage would surely take this role in a second. He jumped at the chance to voice Superman in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies (2018) and did an excellent imitation of Adam West-era Batman as Big Daddy in Kick-Ass (2010). Never mind that in the comics Superman is shown to be eternally in his 20s or early 30s (thanks to his Kryptonian near-immortality), the 56-year-old Cage would still play him in a heartbeat. The next question, of course, is whether we want him to. There is surely going to come a point in Andy Muschietti’s 2022 film where abundant stunt casting starts to unbalance the narrative. This movie already has Ben Affleck as (another version of) Batman, and there are even suggestions that Christian Bale, Val Kilmer and George Clooney could be asked to return. Suddenly this looks less like an intriguing big-screen adaptation of the bravura 2011 Flash graphic novel Flashpoint, in which Allen breaks the multiverse after using time travel to save his mother’s life, and a lot more like the superhero equivalent of the rather rubbish 1967 James Bond comedy version of Casino Royale, in which seven different versions of 007 appear, including Woody Allen as “Little Jimmy Bond”. There is surely such a thing as too much fan service, and, in any case, it ought to be hard to track down more than a handful of fans worldwide who really want to see Kilmer or Clooney as the caped crusader again. On the other hand, this is Hollywood we are talking about, an industry that almost waved through Superman Lives, a movie about a long-haired, emo man of steel that would have climaxed with a scene in which Kal-El fights a giant spider. And it is Warner Bros/ DC we are talking about, the studio that green-lit Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), a slice of celluloid garbage so pungently rotten that the whiff is still detectable four years later. And yet maybe they could pull this thing off. The Flash could be a car crash waiting to happen, but there is still the nagging temptation to take a quick peek through your fingers at the inevitable, horrifying carnage. As screenwriter Kevin Smith said of Superman Lives: “Now when you think about it, if somebody was to say, ‘Would you like to see a Nic Cage Superman movie?’ I’d be like, ‘Yes, take all my money cos I want to see what that looks like.’”"
"‘Lockdown has done wonders for me,” says Paul Cronin with a laugh. An English film-maker who lives in New York, he had been working off and on for 14 years on A Time to Stir, a documentary about the 1968 student uprising at Columbia University. Then, after the killing of George Floyd in May, Cronin’s Greenwich Village neighbourhood was transformed. Protesters marched through its streets, statues were defaced, the windows of galleries and banks were smashed, police cars were torched, helicopters roared night and day. It was an extended moment of rebellion and release, terror and possibility. “I’m watching what’s going on from my window and taking lots of late-night walks through Washington Square with all the wildness and craziness going on there.” Struck by the parallels between the archival footage on his computer screen and present-day convulsions, he went into overdrive, only coming up for air after he had completed the film. To describe A Time to Stir as an epic work is something of an understatement: it is 15 hours long, made up from more than 700 interviews that run to 2,500 hours. Cronin collected 35,000 photographs, almost none of which had ever been seen before. Part of what the film chronicles is well-known: campus leftists taking over key university buildings to protest against its role in conducting research that enabled US bombing campaigns in Vietnam. They took an acting dean hostage and occupied the president’s office, where they found cigars with his name engraved in gold. Their insurgency, before it was violently broken up by police, attracted the likes of Abbie Hoffman, the Grateful Dead, Noam Chomsky and poet Robert Lowell, all of whom showed up to signal their support. But Cronin’s film also shines a spotlight on a crucial, but far less celebrated, part of the story: the resistance of a cadre of pioneering black students who were indignant that Columbia, having purchased lots of nearby real estate, immediately reduced the number of housing units available to low-income residents. Worse, it had taken over a city-owned park where, against the wishes of locals in nearby Harlem, it planned to build a five-storey gymnasium with separate entrances for students and non-students. These decisions were seen as social cleansing, a form of expropriation not unconnected with what the US was doing in south-east Asia. Many of the black students thought their white peers were showy and tactically naive. “They were just talking politics,” claims Arnim Johnson, one of Cronin’s interviewees. “It’s a rap session, and then they want to do singalongs!” The relatively novel presence of black students at the university might have assured Columbia’s administrators they were in the civil rights vanguard, but many of the students saw it differently: they recall receiving lighter workloads than their white peers, being astonished at the lack of black faculty members or black history classes and feeling upset at getting stopped regularly by security guards. They were at once hyper-visible and invisible. They knew they had more opportunities – for success, for upward mobility – than their friends and family members back home. They also knew about dogs and whippings and beatings: this made them reluctant to be as showily combative as some of their white classmates. According to Manning Marable, who, before his death in 2011, was a professor of African American studies at Columbia: “The white radicals did not deconstruct white privilege in their own lives.” In the end, those white students were asked to leave Hamilton Hall, the first building to have been collectively occupied. This led to other campus sites, including Low Library where the president had his offices, being targeted by white demonstrators instead. Creating multiple fronts for protesters made it harder to disperse them, but it disappointed those who thought pan-racial unity would be easy to achieve. “In every beat of this film, one sees how different the world looked to black and to white students – and how they handled themselves in the circumstances,” says Cronin. “The entire thing happened because black students decided to throw white students out. They did not want to be out with them. Black students had thought about these issues for years in a way that white students had not.” Coalitional politics, the art of “allyship”, the intersection between race and class: these are controversial topics today. How is it, I ask Cronin, that even though there is a mini-industry dedicated to 1968-ist commemoration, the voices – yet alone contributions – of black students are so hard to make out? “It’s funny. I was asked recently: ‘Paul, how did you get the African American students to talk?’ I replied: ‘I just asked them!’ No one had ever asked them before! They were more than happy to talk. And what they remembered was very important. They told the white protesters: you’re not going to smash up Hamilton Hall. You’re going to leave it cleaner than when you arrived. You’re spilling your shit? You’re dropping your dope on the floor? You’re having a good time? You think this is theatre? No – for us black students, this is not theatre.” To think of Columbia 1968 purely in terms of black and white would be a mistake. One element of its story that Cronin brings to the fore is the importance of Jewish students. They were white, but non-white. Historically, like their black classmates, they had been treated as second-class presences. But by the 1960s, says Carl Gettleman, who helped occupy Low Library, Columbia had begun to resemble a Jewish Ivy League college: “It was in New York, and if a preppy guy went there, he was probably a loser, because if he was a winner he went to Harvard, Yale or Princeton.” According to Cronin, the incoming Jews knew all about alienation and annihilation. “Many of those that arrived on campus in 1964 and 1965 had watched the Nuremberg trials on TV when they were teenagers. Mike Locker [a student activist who published the power-structure pamphlet Who Rules Columbia?] told me: ‘If you take Nuremberg seriously, then you see that if there’s a crime being committed by your country, it’s your obligation to intervene and object.’ These were the children of Holocaust survivors and they had a hunger for justice. A lot of them were ‘red-diaper babies’; their parents were very left-wing and often lower class. Even if they were secular, they had grown up being told stories about Cossack atrocities by their grandparents.” Cronin, who grew up in London, but has dual citizenship through his American mother, says he can barely remember a time when he was not drawn to the febrile politics of the US in the late 60s. “I recently found a cassette of a Radio 4 programme about the 20th anniversary of 1968. I was only 15 when I made it!” In the past, he has collaborated on book projects with Werner Herzog and co-translated the poetry of the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, but the dominant influence on A Time to Stir is that of British TV documentaries. He says: “I grew up watching a lot of Brook Lapping series [the widely respected production company run by Brian Lapping and Norma Percy]: End of Empire, Watergate, The Death of Yugoslavia. I liked the way they took their time, moved chronologically through epic, complex histories, and showed testimonials from incredible eyewitnesses.” Perhaps unusually, Cronin does not talk about his film as being partisan or primarily activist. “There’s another Brook Lapping series, The Fifty Years War (1998) – it’s in six parts and about the Middle East, but I’ve been told it has been used in both Israeli and Palestinian schools. With A Time to Stir, I wanted it to be as fair and balanced as possible. There was no point in making it if we couldn’t hear from both the red bandana-wearing Maoists and the cops who beat them that night.” He was also keen to capture stories before it was too late. “I met a guy who told me that after his mother died, he’d thrown away countless rolls of 16mm film he’d shot of the campus protests. These stories are like knives to the heart. I have the historian’s dread of the dumpster.” The historical value of Cronin’s work became apparent this summer when William Barr, Donald Trump’s widely detested attorney general, gave an interview to the New York Times in which he claimed to have been on the “jock line” in 1968. “This was a bunch of conservative students who took offence at the radicals occupying the buildings. They felt the administration was not being sufficiently gung ho and decided to take matters into our own hands. They physically surrounded Low Library and wouldn’t let food in our out. It was all a bit theatrical. “Barr said he saw 12 people end up in hospital after a fist fight. I thought: that never happened! I’ve talked to enough people and seen enough footage. No one went to hospital that day. A Washington Post editorial used my film to discuss how a big part of the Barr story is essentially about the manipulation of memory. A few weeks ago, Barr was testifying in front of Jerry Nadler, a Democratic congressman who was also at Columbia in 1968. They were arguing about whether it was right to crack down on protesters in Portland. There’s a sense that we’re still fighting the culture wars of 1968.” Frank Guridy, an associate professor of African American studies at Columbia, teaches a class on the same topic as Cronin’s film. He, too, has been pondering its relevance today. “Columbia fashions itself as an activist Ivy. It at least tolerates student activism. It’s part of the brand in some ways. Many of the people here have very little awareness of what happened here at Columbia in the 60s and 70s. But because of Trumpism, climate catastrophe, the police brutalisation happening every single day and everywhere in this country, my students completely get the political imperatives that were driving the black protesters back then. They are feeling an emperilment that is very similar to what was happening 50 years ago. And with the university buying up parcels of land around Harlem’s West 125th Street, there are still the same questions about Columbia’s imperial relationship to its surrounding community and the social displacements it instigates.” I tell Cronin that, for me, the most telling sections of his film concern the white students discovering how intentionally violent and conspiratorial the police could be. “It’s so relevant, isn’t it? So many interviewees told me how terrified they were. They never thought it could happen to them. They had heard about police violence, but never witnessed it personally. And then, when they did, in the words of one person I talked to: ‘We had the dust of radicalism sprinkled on us that night.’ Poof! Bam! That was it! In all sorts of vexed but profound ways, the events at Columbia in spring 1968 set them on a path to thinking about the world differently, how best to work with people from different backgrounds, how to make the world a different place.” A Time to Stir is on Vimeo from 1 October"
"Hammy and stagey and campy it might be, but The Boys in the Band turns out to have a fiercely watchable soap-operatic intensity, a sustained attack of telenovela craziness, culminating in a full-on anxiety attack from its leading character. It’s based on the 1968 off-Broadway hit by Mart Crowley (who died in March this year) about a group of gay men in New York gathering for a birthday party in an era before Stonewall, before Aids, a time when metropolitan sophisticates sort of tolerated “swishiness” in the bohemian arts scene, and when Gore Vidal was saying, pour épater les bourgeois, that there were homosexual acts but no homosexual people. The play was turned into a film directed by William Friedkin in 1970 and the title is taken from the line in A Star Is Born (1954), when James Mason tells Judy Garland: “You’re singing for yourself and the boys in the band.” Now there is a new version: sleeker and smoother than Friedkin’s, from actor turned director Joe Mantello, and produced for Netflix by Ryan Murphy, whose  miniseries, Hollywood, featured Mantello in an acting role. Jim Parsons plays Michael, a semi-employed writer and closet Catholic worried about money, God and his receding hairline. A former hookup called Donald (Matt Bomer) has come to help him throw a birthday party for a friend in Michael’s exotically bijou apartment (like somewhere Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly might live). The festivities are in honour of ad-man Harold, an outrageously louche and dyspeptic performance from Zachary Quinto. Among the other guests, Hank (Tuc Watkins) is a straight-seeming guy who is leaving his wife and kids to be with Larry (Andrew Rannells), whose promiscuities are driving him crazy. Robin de Jesús is the uproariously queeny designer Emory and Michael Benjamin Washington is an African American student called Bernard. From the very first, there is no relaxation among these people. They seem more like frenemies than friends and there’s a constant static crackle of brittle bitchiness in the air, particularly between Michael and Harold, who in theory should be the most intimate. The atmosphere is even tenser when Michael’s old college roommate phones him out of the blue in a state of near emotional breakdown. This is Alan (Brian Hutchinson), a supposedly happily married heterosexual and family man, who then shows up uninvited; he is disgusted by the open queeniness, but has other more complex emotions as well. The look and feel of The Boys in the Band are different from, say, TV’s 1960s drama Mad Men, whose closet gay designer Salvatore famously leaves his wife and disappears into Central Park. The issues and themes have not been processed and repackaged in the same ironised, indirect way. We are basically getting something direct from 1968. We are drinking it neat, and, although it might seem dated, it is still challenging in 2020 to see a play or movie in which all the characters are gay. These men all gather together like suspects in an Agatha Christie mystery. But there is no mystery, not even, arguably, with Alan. The main event comes with a bizarre and emotionally sadistic game that Michael makes everyone play, when they are sufficiently drunk and overexcited. Each has to phone up the one person from their past with whom they first fell in love, and are still secretly in love. It sounds like a contrived and melodramatic premise for big speeches and flashbacks and that’s precisely what it is. And yet it delivers a punch, simply for being so vehement, so anguished and angered. There are quite a few arch wisecracks. “That’s the pot calling the kettle beige,” drawls Harold, and a weary Michael at one stage confesses: “That’s one thing you can say for masturbation: you don’t have to look your best.” The Boys in the Band appears to come from a more innocent, or at least more naive time, as yet politically unradicalised by Aids and the backlash of homophobia, when the issue was acceptance, a goal that seemed to be matter of gradually changing taste. But it’s still refreshing to watch something which is, after all, a film of ideas, a spectacle in which people speak to each other in extended paragraphs. It is all unexpectedly potent, particularly in the absurdity and petulance and pain that Parsons crams into his performance. It’s a strange, compelling dose of unhappiness."
"If James Cameron’s Avatar were a pop song it would be Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, an epic concoction that brings immense joy the first time it is experienced but eventually becomes nulled by its cultural ubiquity. Or perhaps Spaceman by Babylon Zoo, a startlingly popular effort that never got the follow-up it required to make its creator anything more than a cosmic one-hit wonder. Or so we might have thought until this week, when Cameron emerged from the creeping cobwebs of time to announce (to Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less), that Avatar parts 2 and 3 are almost ready. Avatar 2, apparently, is done and dusted, while Avatar 3 is “sort of 95% complete”. We have heard similar rumblings of activity many times over the past decade since the second-highest-grossing movie of all time hit cinemas. That was, of course, a different era: a time when cinema-goers were still excited by the prospect of watching a movie in 3D, and would happily pay through the teeth to do so. It was also before holes the size of the Grand Canyon were picked in Avatar’s plot and it was pointed out that its extraterrestrial setup was a thinly veiled white-saviour narrative and that Cameron had taken most of the story from Ferngully: The Last Rainforest – or was it Dances With Wolves? Avatar has suffered since its 2009 debut because it became not just a successful Hollywood film but the future of Hollywood itself. Its grand scale and ambition meant that every other science fiction movie was judged against it, and often found wanting. Inevitably, this led to Cameron’s radical space adventure being held not just as a cheery two-hours-plus cosmic knockabout to keep the kids entertained, but as a hubristic sci-fi attempt to Answer All Mankind’s Problems. The film-maker has not helped matters by going all Bono on us and trying to insist that the movie’s depiction of human exploitation of Pandora’s natural resources is a powerful commentary on Earth’s impending environmental apocalypse. Nothing wrong with that, you might say, except that David Attenborough does a much better job without employing a gaggle of giant blue space elves to get his message across. Putting all this aside, Avatar remains very watchable. There are freaky yet relatively novel sci-fi concepts: the use of alien bodies that can somehow be inhabited and taken over by humans, even if the whole idea is a little bit icky. Cameron’s vision of Pandoran flora is like a Hawkwindesque fever dream: not since Silent Running (1972) has there been a science fiction movie so fascinated with cool alien plants. And that’s before we even start mentioning the far-out Na’avi themselves, or the many strange, six-legged beasties they interact with via those swishy, USB-optimised tails. Stephen Lang’s Colonel Miles Quaritch is a brilliant baddie, even if Cameron did plagiarise his own Aliens for Avatar’s climactic exo-suit battle. The Canadian film-maker has confirmed the seemingly dead Quaritch will be back (somehow) in the sequels, which will see Sam Worthington’s Jake Sully and Zoe Saldana’s Neytiri travel to other regions of Pandora. Avatar 2 (now due on 16 December 2022) will have a special focus on water realms, with Kate Winslet set to play a free-diving member of a new reef-dwelling Na’avi tribe called the Metkayina. It all sounds suitably intriguing, provided part deux turns out to be a cosmic take on The Abyss rather than Waterworld in space. And it remains to be seen if Avatar’s 11-year absence will inspire new fervour for its sequels, or whether all that time away means Cameron has rather missed the boat."
"In On the Rocks, a new movie by Sofia Coppola starring Rashida Jones and Bill Murray, the city of New York appears in what was until recently its customary guise. The bars and restaurants are full, the streets are crowded, and in every scene, New Yorkers breathe on one another with outlandish abandon. “It’s a weird time to celebrate anything,” says Jones, down the line from LA, but there is something about the movie, in which she plays a thirtysomething woman whose life is in freefall, that feels like a tribute to a vanished world. “I had a child and lost my mom in the same period [as filming], and was in very amorphous emotional shape,” she says. That sense of limbo imbues every frame. The film unspools with the dreamlike pace of a Michael Cunningham novel, while Murray’s sardonic wit saves it – as in his previous collaboration with Coppola, Lost in Translation – from ponderousness. The surprise, to the uninitiated, is Jones, who at 44 is at the height of her professional powers, an actor who after years of playing supporting roles in shows such as Parks and Recreation and The Office, assumes the lead with a frank, amused intelligence that reminds us she is a writer as much as an actor. As Laura, she plays a mother of young children who becomes convinced her husband is having an affair, moving between shades of despair, panic and incredulous disapproval, brought on largely by the efforts of her rakish dad – Murray’s Felix – to prove her husband’s villainy. Felix is a charming chauvinist, the kind of formerly lovable rogue who these days would wind up on a word-of-mouth spreadsheet circulating among women who have worked with him. “Those long monologues about why men are attracted to young women?” says Jones. “It’s very hard to pull off in a way that makes you not want to vomit. That’s precisely why it could only be Bill.” Jones knows a few things about charming fathers with outsized personalities. Her dad is the songwriting legend Quincy Jones; her mother was the actor Peggy Lipton, who died in May last year, less than a year after the birth of Jones’s son with Vampire Weekend musician Ezra Koenig. It was a strange experience, says Jones, trying to focus on acting through all this, although in an odd way she found it suited her state of mind. In the case of both grief and new motherhood, “it takes so long before you remember who you are”, that you inhabit an indeterminacy “that is probably good for acting? Maybe not for other jobs, and definitely not for writing. But I didn’t know if I was coming or going, which was the perfect place for me to be, with filming.” This is, perhaps, a mark of the fact she cares less about acting than writing, or rather sees the latter as a refuge from and rebuke to the frustrations and inadequacies of the former. As a child, Jones never wanted to be an actor. Her parents raised her and Kidada, her older sister, in California, in what she now thinks of as a halcyon period in which they were encouraged to follow their own interests. “I never felt pushed in one direction in terms of career, or subjects in school, or friend groups, or anything. I felt they were just kind of amused by me and happy to have me around,” she says. “I probably have a bit of a golden wash over my childhood, but my parents did a good job of really creating this little micro-universe for me to thrive in.” The result was that Jones went to Harvard to study philosophy and religion, and wanted to be a lawyer before she joined various student theatrical societies and discovered a love of performing. What she did not love, however, was the world of professional acting after graduation, which entailed more time spent “making sure you get to the audition place without sweating off your face on the subway” than delivering lines, and partly due to the inevitable years of grinding through bad material. “You have to do a good job with lines that are not all that great, for a part that you may not want. It’s a long time before you get to do something like work with Sofia, or write something for yourself, or work with David Fincher.” In 2010, Jones appeared in The Social Network, the Fincher-directed biopic of Mark Zuckerberg, but it would be another two years before she won a lead role – in the comedy-drama Celeste and Jesse Forever – and that was in a movie she had written herself. Writing was always a refuge, she says, a way to claw control back from an industry in which young female actors have little say over how they appear. “Acting is hard because you’re being told ‘no’ all the time, which is so demoralising, and then, God forbid you should have any standards about the kind of work you should be doing. You’re not saying yes; people are saying yes to you and you’re at somebody else’s whim all the time.” It was lovely, she says, to be at Coppola’s whim, but early on in her acting career, Jones realised it wasn’t for her, at least not full-time. “There are actors who love the craft of it so much that the other stuff disappears for them. Those are the people who are perfectly suited for the job. But if you can’t feel satisfied with just that, then you are going to end up feeling a bit lost.” Not that writing isn’t without its frustrations. Celeste and Jesse Forever was the first screenplay Jones and her writing partner, Will McCormack, had ever finished, a pitch-perfect comedy that, after an initial bidding war over the script, took two years to get made after three successive companies that bought it went bust. In 2016, Jones wrote an episode of season three of Black Mirror. (It was Nosedive, the brilliant episode directed by Joe Wright in which a woman called Lacie loses her temper and triggers a terrifying domino-run of bad personal ratings online that eventually ruins her life.) A year later, Jones and McCormack joined the writing team for Toy Story 4, both leaving the project before completion, citing a culture at Pixar where “where women and people of colour do not have an equal creative voice”. It was a brave move, echoed two years later when Emma Thompson wrote an open letter explaining her resignation from the animated movie Luck, after the production hired John Lasseter, a former head of Pixar who is dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct. “Her letter was brilliant,” says Jones, who found herself able to speak out in similar terms because of what she calls her “good sense of self” and an upbringing in which politics were important. “My parents were an interracial couple living in California in the 70s. Loving v Virginia passed in 1967, before which it was illegal for a black and white person to get married – six years before they had my sister.” Her parents had an idea of the value of raising kids in a diverse community and “had friends of all different backgrounds, and ethnicities, and the thing they had in common was the love of being creative”. It still took a while for her to find her voice. “I think, like so many women in Hollywood, you grow to accept a level of discomfort around work, and especially with men, that is not OK. We just accept that that’s the way the business is and that there is something inherently sexist in Hollywood going back to Fatty Arbuckle. I think every actress would say there’s been a time or moment when they didn’t quite feel comfortable. Earlier in my career, I wouldn’t have said anything and I didn’t say anything.” As she got older, however, she felt increasingly that “it’s important for me to challenge my assumptions around authority, and equality, and where I’m ‘allowed’ to speak up and admit that I’m not comfortable in situations”. One of these was working for Pixar, a company that suffered “from deep, systemic intolerance, or top-heavy patriarchy, or top-heavy whiteness, in a way that has informed the things that they’ve made, and the way they hire and promote people. It looks like Pixar is trying to promote more female directors and to have more directors of colour. But at the same time it’s appalling that, out of 20-odd movies, one was directed by a woman – and she was fired! [Brenda Chapman, halfway through making Brave.] That’s not a mistake; it happens through complacency, and I felt the need to plainly state that. I didn’t want to condone it.” If she found her voice, says Jones, it was thanks to a self-confidence that came from her parents. She was lucky; she got the best of her dad, who had been married twice before he met her mother and had five other children. “And my dad was a different parent to each one of them. I think my older sister would say he was never around. He would admit that. I have siblings who grew up in Sweden, when my dad and their mom got divorced, and they came to live with us eventually, but my dad was around a lot [more] for me, and I feel very grateful for that. And it’s just circumstantial; it was dumb luck. He happened to be at that place in his life, and I happened to be born. I do think that shaped who I am.” On the Rocks features a tender depiction of a father-daughter relationship, but in spite of its sweetness it’s not a film without politics. In one scene, a cop pulls over Jones and Murray, who sweet-talks him out of issuing a ticket. It was a scene Jones and Coppola discussed at length before shooting. A wealthy old white man charming a cop after a traffic stop lands differently these days from how it might have done a year ago and both women felt it was important to acknowledge the shift. Turning to her father, Jones’ character says drily: “It must be really nice to be you.” On the Rocks is in cinemas from Oct 2 and on Apple TV+ from Oct 23"
"The team behind 2016’s eye-catching indie Chubby Funny – producer Helen Simmons and director Harry Michell – return with another agreeably off-beam comedy, this time with a starrier cast and a goofy, Four Lions-ish premise. It’s the tale of sibling Christian hitmen who, envious of the column inches logged by rival fundamentalists, set out to kill a Dawkins-like author at a literary festival in Ilkley. Tim (Harry Melling) is the childlike younger brother, ill-suited to grisly murder; the uptight Vic (Tom Brooke) an unrepentant sociopath. Their target (Roger Allam, master of glib dismissiveness) need not worry unduly: an astutely timed prologue shows our would-be ruthless killers stalking a rambler who looks just enough like Allam for the first of several terrible mistakes to be made. The pacing of that opening instantly elevates Michell’s film over a half-dozen recent British crime-comedies. We’re heading towards a set-piece that’s the Yorkshire Britpic equivalent of Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation’s opera-house assassination, while the gags allow supporting players to dig in and make an impression. Anna Maxwell Martin is formidably sarky as a detective aghast at having to enter the artsy-fartsy literary scene; Derek Jacobi has a classy cameo as a priest who justifies the hit with chilly mouthfuls of scripture; Matthew Steer’s brisk, funny sketch of the spineless festival chief will likely cue cringes of recognition in some quarters. Having the action observed by a roving male voice choir – representing the C of E’s safe centre ground – looks like a cheeky crib from the Icelandic hit Woman at War, but it’s a solid evening’s entertainment, assembled with an assurance rare at this budgetary level. Norwegian-born cinematographer Sverre Sørdal provides attractive glimpses of the moors (still under-utilised as a Britfilm resource), while sharp editing serves both the comedy and thriller aspects. Simmons and Michell, blessed with good ideas and the craft to do them justice, are building a notable filmography on the margins: let’s hope the industry’s moneymen are watching."
"Last month, the US Senate intelligence committee published over 1,000 pages of findings on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In a different world – or, at least, a more sane one, the kind oriented away from the distrustful chaos desired by Russian intelligence – the bipartisan report would have landed with the frisson of anticipation surrounding the Mueller report in April 2019. But in a hyper-polarized, disaster-numbed nation, its relatively damning findings faded quickly under at least seven layers of justifiably frantic news cycles. Agents of Chaos, a two-part investigative HBO series on Russian interference in the 2016 election, confirms some of the most damning findings of the Senate report – for one, extensive contacts between the Trump campaign, particularly former manager Paul Manafort, and “a cadre of individuals ostensibly operating outside of the Russian government but who nonetheless implement Kremlin-directed influence operations.” But the series, from Oscar-winning film-maker Alex Gibney, also visualizes, with first-person interviews from some of the major figures, what the rare bipartisan consensus (on facts, not narrative) cannot: the diffuse, dubiously quantifiable efforts by the Russian government – sometimes tightly organized, sometimes slapdash – to sow chaos in Ukraine and then America, the profit motives which compelled bumbling Trump figures into a “collusion” of mutual interest, and the head-spinning vertigo for average American consumers over what even happened four years ago. “There’s tremendous pressure to make sense of it quickly, rather than saying, ‘Something happened, but we don’t know yet what it means,’” Gibney told the Guardian of the drive since 2016 to pin down an easily digestible, solid narrative of Russian interference. “People would jump very quickly to say, ‘This is what it means’. And I think it’s that search for quick meaning that lead so many people down the road to conspiracy theory.” Agents of Chaos finds no single story, operation, locus of blame, or clear measure of impact by the Russian government. Instead, it explores a common purpose employed by both Russia and pro-Trump players in the US, sometimes in tandem and sometimes covertly. “Using chaos to amass power,” said Gibney. The four-hour series takes a broad look at Russian interference, delineating strategies that often get conflated into one enemy – an oil slick of reports and testimony difficult to pin into verifiable coherence. Gibney classifies efforts by the Russian government or Russian business interests – given the top-down structure of corruption in the country, it’s difficult to discern the two – to sow chaos in America into four categories: disinformation campaigns orchestrated by Russia’s Internet Research Agency, the so-called “troll factory” which injected divisive meme campaigns and partisan accounts into American social media discourse; sophisticated cyber-attacks, such as the one by the GRU, a Russian government intelligence agency, which leaked Democratic National Committee emails in 2016; Russian hackers’ infiltration into state election systems, which are criminally out of date and vulnerable to manipulation; and stoking an information system primed for outrage by widely broadcasting and encouraging support for an inexperienced showman and would-be oligarch named Donald Trump. The connections between Trump and Putin, explored in the second episode, constitute a “seduction between two like-minded people,” said Gibney, rather than the now-fraught word “collusion.” Trump initially was after a Moscow tower deal. For Putin and the Russian political system, a destabilized America is a less powerful one. “It’s all about greed, and avarice, and corruption,” said Gibney. “The agents of chaos in both countries had common interests.” Agents of Chaos fleshes out a “three-ring circus” of interference efforts with a who’s who of state and security actors, including former employees of the “troll farm” in Russia and a Russian journalist whose investigations into Putin associates earned him death threats, credible security concerns, and a severed bull head delivered to his office. Gibney interviews several top-level intelligence officials, such as lead prosecutor of the Mueller investigation Andrew Weissmann, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, former CIA director John Brennan, and Celeste Wallander, the former National Security Council director under Obama and a Russian foreign policy expert. Private investigator Glenn Simpson, who authorized the controversial and sensational dossier by Christopher Steele, speaks to Manafort’s shady connections to a Russian oligarch named Oleg Deripaska. And now-familiar names from the Trump orbit, including disgraced adviser Carter Page and Felix Sater, the Russian-American businessman determined to build a Trump tower in Moscow, offer their versions of the mess. For those who have their finger on each sluggish inch of the Trump campaign’s overtures to Russian interests – so much as hard evidence exists for a connection whose symbiosis required no explicit statement of purpose – the series will answer or explicate on outstanding questions: that the FBI’s investigation into Russian cyber-attacks began in 2014, with evidence of its activity in Ukraine, not in 2016; that security officials under Obama considered significant counter-measures to Russian hacking, including releasing sensitive information on Russian officials, but ultimately decided against it; that the FBI’s investigation into Trump officials began as a reaction to reports that the campaign knew about Russian hacking of the Democrats when only the FBI was aware of the attacks. But for the many viewers who know “Russian interference” as a frustrating and slippery murk, one difficult to parse without particular expertise, Agents of Chaos offers a crash-course – a four-hour lecture series that attempts to see Russian cyber-security, America’s vulnerabilities, and missed opportunities clearly. “The Mueller report tried so hard not to tell a story that it failed,” said Gibney. “Because it just presented facts as if it was one magnificent phone book, and the phone book contains lots of facts, but it doesn’t have much of a story.” Which isn’t to say Agents of Chaos finds conspiracy so much as evidence of mutual greed, and a literacy of the hunger for power; many in the Trump orbit’s goal was “just to make money,” said Gibney, “and in pursuit of that, they end up doing a lot of things that people misinterpreted as being somehow policy-based or enmeshed in some kind of spy game.” The efforts by the Trump campaign, from George Papadopoulos to Manafort to Page, are more bumbling and obvious than a 1,000-page, buttoned-up Senate report would suggest. “It’s both more ridiculous and more corrupt than I had originally thought,” said Gibney of the Trump associates. “I thought of it initially as a John le Carré novel, but it turned out to be more like the Godfather, or the gang who shouldn’t shoot straight.” Agents of Chaos finds the Russian efforts, as well, to be both more scattershot and insidious than many would assume. “People are always looking for the strategy,” says Wallander in the second episode. “That fundamentally misunderstands a Russian operation. They seed multiple elements, and then they go with what works.” Arguably, what worked best is the entrenchment of the perception that Russia could have a consequential impact on America’s election. As the New Yorker argued this month, the loose murk of the Russian meddling story, which easily lends to conspiracy and distrust, is more important than quantifiable impact. Regardless of debates on quantifying impact, “if the goal is disruption and confusion, then being seen to affect outcomes is as good as actually affecting outcomes.” Which is why Gibney ultimately directs Agents of Chaos, and the lessons of the 2016 election for 2020, back to American soil, and its crumbling institutions. In 2016, “our institutions – the press, a sense of the rule of law, and a bifurcated, belief-based, tribal political system – had become so dysfunctional that were ripe for the picking,” he said. “Unless we start fixing some of these problems, we’re done.”"
"Michael Lonsdale, the French-British actor whose best known role was the villain Drax in Moonraker but who also appeared in a string of films by auteur directors such as François Truffaut, Jacques Rivette and Alain Resnais, has died aged 89. Lonsdale’s agent, Olivier Loiseau, confirmed to Agence France-Presse that the actor had died at his home in Paris. Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson said in a statement: “He was an extraordinarily talented actor and a very dear friend. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.” Born in 1931 to a British military officer and his French-Irish wife, Lonsdale and his family spent the second world war years in French-controlled Morocco, before moving to Paris in 1947. Originally hoping to be a painter, Lonsdale studied acting with Tania Balachova, and began performing in the 1950s. His bilingual abilities allowed him to take roles in both French and English-speaking films: early roles included a priest in Orson Welles’s adaptation of The Trial (1962) and resistance member Jacques Debû-Bridel in René Clément’s Is Paris Burning? (1963). In 1968 he achieved a breakthrough with two Truffaut films: The Bride Wore Black and Stolen Kisses. In the former, he plays one of the men killed by Jeanne Moreau in revenge for her husband’s death, and in the latter a shoe-shop owner whose wife Antoine Doinel falls in love with. Lonsdale then made inroads into mainstream Anglo-American cinema, playing the investigator on the trail of Edward Fox’s hitman in The Day of the Jackal (1973), and in 1979 the creepy Hugo Drax in the Bond blockbuster Moonraker, alongside Roger Moore. His distinctive appearance and voice ensured he was cast in a wide variety of roles, including a masochist in Luis Buñuel’s The Phantom of Liberty (1974), embassy attache Anton Grigoriev in the 1982 TV series Smiley’s People and a French diplomat in the Merchant Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993). Lonsdale was a devout Catholic, having been baptised at 22 and joining the Charismatic Renewal movement in the 1980s. He would go on to play a string of religious figures, including the abbot in the successful adaption of Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose (1986) and a Trappist monk in Of Gods and Men (2010), for which Lonsdale won a best supporting actor César."
"Bill Murray amiably shows up on autopilot for this high-concept, low-octane New York caper from writer-director Sofia Coppola – the title of course playfully combining the specifications for a classy cocktail with a warning of imminent disaster. The film requires Murray to reprise some of his witty, man-of-the-world ennui from Coppola’s 2003 Tokyo-set smash Lost in Translation in which he struck up a friendship with a lonely, vulnerable younger woman, played by Scarlett Johansson – only now he’s a silver fox, playing opposite the estimable Rashida Jones, who is supposed to be his actual daughter. The film itself melds the daddy motif of earlier Coppola pictures (such as Somewhere from 2010) with Woody Allen’s elegiac view of classic Manhattan and the uproarious light-comedy adventures to be had without real consequence in that fabled city. Murray brings his droll, cool affect around with him everywhere he goes in this movie like an opera cloak, and it’s something that only he could bring off. But he always looks as if he could be thinking about something else, and the light sing-song intonations can betoken anything or nothing. It’s amusing in an undemanding way, but like any great comic, he still needs material. Murray plays Felix, an art dealer who has evidently grown wealthy enough not to work terribly hard and live a whimsically irresponsible lifestyle, cruising around New York in outrageously showy sports cars, or being driven everywhere by his loyal chauffeur. He is devoted to his daughter Laura, played by Jones, despite having angered her and wrecked her childhood by cheating on her mom as part of his wayward style. Laura is now married to Dean (Marlon Wayans) whom Felix cordially mistrusts as a rival for his daughter’s affections. But when Laura suspects that Dean is cheating on her with his beautiful colleague Fiona (Jessica Henwick, from Game of Thrones), she incautiously confides her fears to Felix, who then insists on putting the supposedly caddish Dean under surveillance. Soon Laura and Felix are a father-daughter spy duo, snooping on Dean from afar outside restaurants and clubs. Poor Laura needs her dad’s insights into the male roué mind, but the reminder of his own infidelity is increasingly painful. And she is exasperated when Felix wants to goof off their spying job so he can take her to classy joints that were stylish in his day. There are some cheerfully amusing moments, and I’m a sucker for the time-honoured routine when someone impatiently grabs the binoculars from someone else, thus dragging the straps across that person’s scowling face. But really the banter and the elegance needs some substance in the script and it really isn’t here, or not enough of it, and the serious moments seem glazed in a kind of negligent unseriousness. At one stage, Felix has to tell Laura that the younger woman for whom he left her mother has now died, and he is momentarily stunned at the realisation that he has outlived her. But that seems like nothing more than a minor, martini-soaked wobble. As for Laura, Jones isn’t required to get genuinely angry, but she is also too subdued and concerned to get into the spirit of farce. There are some nice minor moments. Felix’s own mother, coolly played by Barbara Bain, is still alive, and in one family scene is instantly alert to the possibility that her granddaughter’s marriage is in trouble. And I liked the performance from Jenny Slate (like Jones, a veteran of the much-missed TV comedy Parks and Recreation) who is someone that Laura has to make polite conversation with at the school drop-off as she drones incessantly on about her emotional life. On the Rocks is naturally indulgent towards Murray. No other approach could work or make sense. He is always entertaining to watch on some level and he gives a nice rendition of the song Mexicali Way. In any case, a real confrontation would mean a tragic fracturing, a tonal shift towards a different sort of film that would unbalance the whole thing. But there is no equivalent of the doomy romantic rapport that Murray achieved with Johansson in Lost in Translation. The movie isn’t on the rocks; it just timidly hugs the shore."
"It is hardly believable that there’s yet another Sherlock Holmes ripoff/spinoff – the genre named by the late critic Gilbert Adair “Shlock Holmes”. But here is Sherlock’s little-known rebellious kid sister Enola, invented in 2006 by the YA author Nancy Springer. Jack Thorne has adapted the first volume in her award-winning series and the director is Harry Bradbeer. Millie Bobby Brown (from TV’s Stranger Things) plays the imaginative, brilliant, quirky young Enola. She has grown up alone in the country with her enigmatic widowed mother, Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter), who has homeschooled her in science, literature and martial arts – this is after Enola’s terribly grand older brothers, Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin), have left home. But Eudoria herself disappears, leaving gnomic clues for Enola as to why, and then grumpy Mycroft insists on putting Enola in a stuffy boarding school run by Dickensian headmistress Miss Harrison (Fiona Shaw). So Enola has to escape, solve the mystery of her missing mum and also come to CGI Victorian London, thwarting a reactionary conspiracy to kidnap a handsome young aristocrat (Louis Partridge) who has a crush on Enola. It all rattles along amiably enough. Enola Holmes is the kind of all-star production that might once have been made by the BBC and graced the front cover of the Christmas Radio Times. Brown has a nice, easygoing way with the material, cheekily outpacing her famous brother Sherlock here and there and often doing fourth-wall breaks to smirk at the audience, and I loved Miss Harrison’s steampunky motor car. But there should have been more specifically ingenious deducting and solving from Enola – codebreaking isn’t the same thing. So … is Moriarty’s super-evil kid sister on the way?"
"From the age of two and a half, Sasha has insisted she’ll grow up a girl. She was born in a boy’s body. In his tender observational documentary, film-maker Sébastien Lifshitz’s (Les Invisibles, Bambi, Adolescentes) spends a year following seven-year-old Sasha and her family as they struggle to navigate her gender dysphoria in their provincial French home town. Cinematographer Paul Guilhaume captures Sasha in widescreen, his camera watchful as she pads delicately across the room in ballet class, growing in confidence and expressiveness with each purposeful step. Her teacher is less generous. The film is as much about Sasha as it is about her fiercely protective mother, Karine, who initially blames herself for having wanted a baby girl. A kind specialist explains that it doesn’t work that way, and that there are other children in the same situation. Heartbreakingly, Sasha squeezes her mum’s hand, her worried face breaking into a reassured smile."
"French writer-director François Ozon, 52, is famous for his prodigious output. He directed his first full-length feature, Sitcom, in 1998, and his 19th, Summer of 85, a love story about two teenage boys in a Normandy seaside town, is out in the UK this month. In between, his diverse output includes the musical 8 Women, the retro comedy Potiche, the Ruth Rendell adaptation The New Girlfriend and last year’s By the Grace of God. What were you doing in the summer of ’85?What was I doing? I think I went to Spain with a friend – I can’t remember exactly, I’d have to ask my parents. The film was going to be called Summer of 84. I changed the title because of Robert Smith of the Cure. I absolutely wanted to use their song In Between Days, and he said, “Sorry, but that came out in 1985.” So I changed the title, and he let us have the song. For me, the film’s really about 1984, because that’s when I was 16. This is your 19th film, but apparently it was nearly your first.I read the book – Dance on My Grave by Aidan Chambers – in 1985. I thought, if I ever make films, I’d love this to be my first feature. In fact, I wrote a script with a friend, which I’d completely forgotten about. It took me 30 years to do it, but it was nice to think that now I was making a first film over again. It’s a young adult novel – for teenagers at the time, gay teens especially, it was a revelation, because sexuality is never a problem in it. At the time, the representation of homosexuality in cinema – literature too – was always problematic, it was always about conflict, coming out, transgression, guilt. The book didn’t have any of that, it was just a love story. For years I hoped that Gus Van Sant or Rob Reiner or some other American film-maker would adapt it, and no one ever did. You have two terrific young actors, Félix Lefebvre and Benjamin Voisin. How did you choose them, and how did you get such uninhibited performances?I was looking for chemistry – I wanted people to want to see them together. I had a lot of problems on my earlier films, with actors saying: “I can’t play a gay role.” This time I said: “Do you have any problems kissing a boy?”, and they said no. Young people now have a great fluidity, they don’t have the inhibitions that older actors did. Maybe it’s also because they’d seen films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour and Call Me By Your Name – for them it was all very simple. The film came out in French cinemas in July, after being included in the official selection of a Cannes festival that didn’t actually happen.I was very flattered to be included, but I was sad for my actors. It would have been great for them to walk up the red carpet, but they’ll do that with other films. We had a lot of offers from streaming platforms, but I shot the film on super-16, and I really wanted people to see it on the big screen. I believe in cinemas. If you look at French attendance figures, they’re 50% down from last year but that’s because there are no American films – whereas French films are maybe only 20% down. There’s a lot going on in French cinema at the moment – a lot of variety, a lot of debate, commercial films, auteur films, some very strong personalities, it’s pretty healthy. And there are a lot of film shoots happening in France right now – everyone’s making the most of it, in case there’s another lockdown. How did you spend your lockdown?It worked out quite well, because I ended up in the country for two months. I was worried at first because I’m really a city person, but I got used to it fairly quickly. I made the most of it to read and watch a lot of films, and write a script. But I didn’t watch a single TV series, I’ve had enough of them. I just watched classics – Fellini, Kurosawa… I needed to get back to the essentials. What are you most looking forward to now?I’m looking forward to Covid being over and everyone being vaccinated, so we can take off our masks and life can start again, differently. And I’m hoping that Trump won’t be re-elected, because everyone’s hanging on the US elections, and it’s affecting the whole world, artists included. Everyone wants to know whether the world is going to get worse, or if there’s a chance of things improving. How has the new political awareness of the Trump era played out in France?Did you follow the César awards in February? Roman Polanski winning best director really shocked people, women especially. No one’s saying he’s not a great director – for me, he absolutely is – but giving him a prize at this moment feels like the response of an old world that can’t see how things are changing. But they have a rule that if you win best film, you can’t also win best director – otherwise, Ladj Ly would have won both (for Les Misérables). If you look at the Césars, Roschdy Zem, who’s of Moroccan descent, won best actor, Ladj Ly is of African descent, a lot of women won prizes, so the diversity is there. Do you think about your old films – do any of them keep you awake at night? No, I’m a very bad father, I abandon all my children. (Laughs.) Right now I’m in the present, and the future – what’s past is past. Summer of 85 is released in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema on 23 October"
"Blumhouse, the production outfit founded by Jason Blum, struck it big with unquiet souls terrorising American domesticity in Paranormal Activity – and not much has changed 11 years later, as the company launches Welcome to the Blumhouse, a diffusion line of eight thrillers in collaboration with Amazon Studios. (Four are released this year, four in 2021.) Here, the unquiet souls are the domestic inhabitants themselves – at least that’s the case in these first two films, which slot more into the psychological thriller category than the pure horror the studio is known for. Veena Sud (showrunner of the US remake of The Killing) offers an accomplished helicopter-parenting noir in The Lie (★★★★☆) – though what beleaguered divorcees Mireille Enos and Peter Sarsgaard engage in when trying to shield their daughter (Joey King) after she murders a schoolmate is probably better described as Black Hawk Down parenting. Sud – with plenty of inexorable tracking shots through the family’s chilly condo – efficiently tightens the screw as the twitchy mother and indulgent father first bicker, then are doomed together by their blood allegiances. In fact, the couple are so blinkered in protecting their offspring that it prevents The Lie from entering more psychologically torn territory that might have made it profound. Instead it’s merely car-crash compelling. Sarsgaard – an actor who often feels like a John Malkovich/Philip Seymour Hoffman crossbreed – can do this kind of equivocating mess in his sleep. But the standout here is Enos: a rictus of scarlet lipstick topped with a battery of compulsive twitches. Less classical but somehow more derivative is Black Box (★★★☆☆), which makes you wonder if Blumhouse is using its TV arm as a dumping ground for concepts that don’t quite make the cinematic cut. There are echoes of Get Out’s Sunken Place in the cutting-edge hypnosis treatment that road accident victim Nolan (Mamoudou Athie) is prescribed to recover his memories. The good doctor (Phylicia Rashad) is sweet-tongued but wearing enough maroon eyeshadow to flag that she shouldn’t be trusted. Faintly redolent of Inception, the therapy triggers unsettling flashbacks filled with blank-faced bystanders and a spider-walking revenant straight out of a J-horror flick. This pageantry registers less than the simple psychological tension that builds – and is ably maintained by debut director Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour and his largely African American cast – as Nolan questions his identity. But Osei-Kuffour – not helped by Athie’s rather stiff presence – can’t fully sell a crucial midway twist that pulls the focus away from the intriguing dynamic between a dependent father and a young daughter forced to grow up prematurely (a promising performance by Amanda Christine). Without any real stylisation to shake up Nolan’s inner realities beyond bog-standard techno-realism, this sunken place has no strong signature of its own – and little to add to the African American experience."
"Attack the Block meets A Midsummer Night’s Dream in this good-natured, charming and energetic comedy made by staff and pupils at Graveney secondary school in Tooting, London. It’s directed by English and film studies teacher Pat Sharpe, who coaxes some fantastic performances from her students, most in front of the camera for the first time; even the teatime telly silliness of some scenes feels endearing. It’s set in the fictional school of Midsummer High where half a dozen aliens crash land in the headmaster’s office seven hours before the opening night of the school play. Rufiat Awolope (a sixth former at the time of filming) plays sensible headgirl Helen who can’t decide if she likes swotty Dan (Gus Flind-Henry). Her shallow best friend Charlotte (Ramona Marquez) is seeing Louis (Byron Easmon), who falls for Helen. Scriptwriter Steve Smith wittily adapts the suitor-swapping of Shakespeare’s play to fickle teenagers, with the aliens acting as matchmakers. Trapped in human bodies, these infinitely superior beings take pity on the illogical hormonal teenagers and attempt to fix their romantic dramas. As the extraterrestrials attempt to make sense of their new surroundings the script has some fun. What is this concept of school, one of them asks. Another replies: “It’s where the young of the species are forcibly contained to receive low-grade data that the elders believe will make them functionally effective.” The film is a seriously impressive achievement by the inspiring teachers and kids at Graveney. Certainly, it’s more professionally made than a fair few low-budget films I’ve seen, though I did wonder whether the English department was consulted about using number “7” in the title, rather than spelling it out as “seven”."
"This documentary makes a pretty convincing case for the admission of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint into the boys’ club of abstract art, alongside Kandinsky, Mondrian et al. Af Klint was an outsider in her lifetime and when she died in 1944, her paintings gathered dust in her nephew’s attic. (She did her legacy no favours by stipulating in her will that none of her work should be seen for 20 years.) Today, her work is a nuisance to art history: to acknowledge her would require rewriting the entire chapter on abstract art. Born in 1862, Af Klint grew up in middle-class privilege, encouraged by her father to paint. After graduating from the Royal Academy in Stockholm, she worked as portrait painter and illustrator before turning to radical abstract works from 1906. A maverick free-thinker, she was fascinated by modern scientific discoveries as well as by spiritualism and seances, covering her paintings in an esoteric language of signs and symbols. Her mystical beliefs gave the art world an excuse to dismiss her as a kook when the work later came to light. Female art historians and writers interviewed in the film point out that that the history of art is the history of male genius. Women don’t fit the narrative. Their tone of furious resignation reminded me of that #MeToo placard: “I can’t believe we still have to protest this shit.” Depressingly, anonymity followed Af Klint to her grave – literally. After she died at 81 her nephew buried her with her mother and father in a Stockholm cemetery but didn’t bother to update the headstone. Director Halina Dyrschka asks: “How would you ever know she was here?” She could be talking about female artists full stop; yet in a photo taken in her studio, Af Klint looks fiercely present, intense and lively with bright, piercing eyes – you could imagine Saoirse Ronan playing her in a biopic."
"Some films are best watched more or less by accident: stumbled upon with little foreknowledge, so we’re led through the story without a compass. Mubi’s curation model often allows for such moments of discovery: their latest exclusive release, Two/One, is a strange, slippery puzzler well suited to a blind encounter. The debut feature from Argentinian director Juan Cabral, it’s a subtle, alluring spin on cinema’s longstanding fixation with double personalities. That genre usually hinges on twins or doppelgängers, allowing one actor to flex as showily as possible. Two/One goes another way, instead exploring the idea of two non-alike men – different in face, body, location, vocation – who nonetheless seem to share a life, perhaps even a soul. In Canada, pro ski-jumper Kaden (Boyd Holbrook) is reaching the end of his career and facing an existential slump; across the globe, in Shanghai, businessman Khai (Song Yang) is professionally successful but starved of real human contact. When one falls aleep, the other wakes; through visual cues and narrative echoes, Cabral builds the sense that their lives are obliviously connected, each moving in rhythm to the other. This isn’t a story that wants you to ask if both men sleep for 12 hours a day, or other such niggling questions: you have to forgo logic to succumb to its ruminative spiritual resonance. Cabral’s film-making is seductive enough to do that: he’s best known as the advertising genius behind the famous Cadbury Gorilla and Sony Bouncing Balls campaigns, so the man knows how to sell you an idea through elegant games of sound and image. There’s enough vivid, glimmering beauty here to make you briefly, forlornly wonder if your own other self is out there. The first film that Two/One made me want to rewatch (via Curzon Home Cinema) was Krzysztof Kieslowski’s still luminous The Double Life of Veronique, which matches the doppelgänger trope to a similarly airy cosmic conceit. As two unacquainted, similarly named women in separate countries whose lives seem curiously fused in the stars, Irène Jacob’s artfully bisected performance brilliantly sustains a pair of distinct but eerily entangled personalities. In the last film he made before switching to full-time Hollywood fare, Québécois director Denis Villeneuve made a disconcerting little entry in this subgenre called Enemy (on Amazon), a cold, crisp psycho-thriller in which Jake Gyllenhaal anxiously stalks his second self around an unforgiving urban landscape – the nature of their connection remains uncertain as the film escalates into (literally) spidery madness. It perfectly complements the bonkers, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin Roger Moore curio The Man Who Haunted Himself (Amazon again), though it’s more sleekly atmospheric. Over on Netflix, in Nacho Vigalondo’s Colossal – among the most winningly bizarre sci-fi experiments in recent mainstream cinema – Anne Hathaway’s alcoholic writer doesn’t seem to have a double, per se, but the Godzilla-like monster raising hell far away in Seoul appears uncannily wired to her thoughts and actions. Much-vaunted in the 1990s but neglected of late, Scott McGehee and David Siegel’s Suture (on Google Play) has two allegedly identical brothers swap identities, causing havoc in their world and with our perception: for we see them as two entirely distinct actors, one black and one white. And I’ve celebrated Jordan Peele’s Us in this column before, but it can’t go unmentioned here: the relationship between its tethered yet mismatched doppelgängers opens up a raging world of post-colonial racial politics. The gold standard (or the emerald-green one, to go by the film’s distinctive palette) of tricksy doubling on film, of course, remains Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (among Netflix’s few classics), which seems to emphasise different slices and shades of dual identity every time you watch it; ditto the overlapping feminine psyches of Ingmar Bergman’s hypnotic, ever shape-shifting Persona (on Amazon), in which the existential merge somehow happens before you know it, even when you know what’s coming. Fragments of both films were clearly on David Lynch’s mind when he made Mulholland Drive (on iTunes), proving himself the master of doubling characters with reckless disregard for time, space and sanity. That’s not the approach for high-concept king Christopher Nolan, who of course has a doubling exercise of sorts in his oeuvre: perhaps his most lavishly entertaining film, The Prestige (on iTunes), plays knotty identity games with an actual pair of magicians, though it falls down a bit when Nolan, being the director he is, has to solve his own puzzle. Two/One, too, is best when it just lets its foggy mystique be: the most haunting double-trouble films always keep something from us. Socrates (Peccadillo, 15) Made on a shoestring and following a gay 15-year-old fending for himself in São Paulo after his mother’s death, Alex Moratto’s impressive, affecting debut makes a good companion piece to recent British standout Rocks as a study of children failed by the adult world. Summerland (Lionsgate, 12)An easy, breezy comfort watch as summer slips away in the rearview mirror, Jessica Swale’s wartime drama about a cranky academic (an ace Gemma Arterton) thawed by the arrival of a child evacuee is attractive and absorbing, though too heavy on dewy nostalgia. Zeroville (Universal, 15) James Franco has directed a catalogue of ambitious misses, but he’s never whiffed as spectacularly as in this unwatchable adaptation of Steve Erickson’s Tinseltown satire, which plays like an am-dram interpretation of Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
"A deeply strange message from the future is what this movie is here to (re)deliver: both post- and pre-apocalyptic, a nuclear-age parable of anxiety to compare with Godzilla. Akira, released in 1988, is the cult Japanese cyberpunk animation from director Katsuhiro Ôtomo, who also created the original manga serial. (It is set in the impossibly futuristic year of 2019, so maybe last year would actually have been the time to rerelease it.) Thirty years on from a devastating explosion that razed the city, a new capital – Neo-Tokyo – has been born: sprawling, chaotic, like the LA of Blade Runner. The city is beset with violence from warring motorbike gangs, and by protesters rioting against unfair taxes. A hatchet-faced army officer says that Neo-Tokyo is “a garbage heap made of hedonistic fools”.  Biker teen Kaneda (voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) is in the middle of a confrontation with a rival mob, when his friend Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki) accidentally crashes into a bizarrely wizened child-goblin figure who has apparently escaped from a top-secret government research facility investigating this race of troll-infants with bizarre powers. Tetsuo finds that he himself now has staggering telekinetic abilities, and becomes public enemy number one for these sinister G-men. He assumes superhuman qualities, evolving into a new entity, a virtual messianic figure for this occult race of uniquely gifted or cursed lab rats. It is Tetsuo’s destiny to discover the truth about Akira, a much-rumoured godhead or wellspring of essential cosmic power that is to be found somewhere underneath the city: it may have been responsible for the explosion 30 years ago. And so the final 30 minutes of the film build to a nightmare of utter destruction – longed-for destruction, in fact, an annihilation that will wipe out this culpable, wretched world. Akira’s strangeness is very startling and sometimes bewildering. But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else."
"The cinematographer Michael Chapman, who has died aged 84, had a ringside seat for many of the towering works of postwar American cinema, including Raging Bull (1980), based on the life of the middleweight champion Jake LaMotta (played by Robert De Niro). That film, which brought Chapman the first of two Oscar nominations, was one of four he made with Martin Scorsese; it was preceded by Taxi Driver (1976), the concert movie The Last Waltz and the documentary American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince (both 1978). “His relationship with the camera and the film that was running through it was intimate, mysterious, almost mystical,” said Scorsese, who called him “a great artist”. In Raging Bull, Chapman delineated sharply the different areas of LaMotta’s life. In the ring, he used elaborate camera moves, swooping and rushing, to achieve an operatic, adrenalised effect, while a plainer style was adopted for street scenes and tense pow-wows in cramped clubs and apartments. His work exhibited breadth and grandeur but he could never be accused of prettifying a shot. “It shouldn’t be beautiful,” he said of his craft. “It should be appropriate.” Chapman and Scorsese made Raging Bull in black-and-white to evoke the Life magazine photography and TV boxing broadcasts of their youth. “In our memories, boxing was a black-and-white sport,” Chapman explained, “so it seemed perfectly reasonable to shoot it in black-and-white.” It was Taxi Driver, though, that he considered his crowning achievement. For all its grittiness, this study of a lonely, embittered sociopath (also De Niro) was hallucinatory rather than realistic. “It pretends to be documentary but in fact it’s quite theatrical,” Chapman said, pointing to the use of enigmatic dissolves, heightened colour and unmotivated camera movement, such as the unusual moment when the camera drifts away from De Niro while he is talking on the phone and stares blankly down a deserted corridor. The film’s meagre budget demanded a certain ingenuity. Chapman and Scorsese squeezed into the back of a cab driven by De Niro to roam New York at night, shooting whatever took their fancy. For the climax, in which the camera seems to float across a flophouse ceiling while it surveys the aftermath of a massacre, Chapman cut into the floor of the apartment above so that the camera could track sideways as it peered at the carnage below. Born and raised in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Chapman was the son of a teacher father and librarian mother. “I was devoted to movies as a child,” he said, singling out newsreels as a particular inspiration. In those bulletins, he saw “airplanes flying, bombs exploding, battleships firing huge cannons. Extraordinarily powerful images of a world far away.” Following his education at the Andover Academy and Columbia University, where according to Chapman “there was a system at that time where you could basically take whatever you wanted and get your degree. I suppose I was an English major or a history major in some vague way”, he was employed as a brakeman on the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. “It was a very chic thing to do in the late 1950s,” he recalled. “Echoes of Kerouac and Ginsberg and all that.” After a brief stint in the army, he married Myriam Brun in 1961. Her father, the French émigré cinematographer Joseph C Brun, objected to his daughter marrying “a beatnik ne’er-do-well” and took Chapman on as an assistant on several pictures, including Who Killed Teddy Bear (1965), a lurid, New York-set thriller cited subsequently by critics as an influence on Taxi Driver. He worked his way up to camera operator on projects with Gordon Willis, the esteemed cinematographer who became his mentor, among them Klute (1971) and The Godfather (1972). Chapman’s first credit as director of photography was Hal Ashby’s salty buddy movie The Last Detail (1973) starring Jack Nicholson, which had a rough-and-ready visual style. “The actual light in the actual locations was far more emotionally evocative than anything I could do at that stage in my career,” he said. Jaws (1975) marked his final credit solely as camera operator. He shot the abrasive Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel as a budding pianist trapped in a life of crime, an inspired remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (both 1978), the lesbian athletics drama Personal Best and the comedy Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (both 1982). For the latter, another innovative experiment in black and white, his footage was intercut with excerpts from Hollywood classics to make it appear as if the film’s star, Steve Martin, was bantering with the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Joan Crawford and Lana Turner. He worked on a second Martin vehicle, The Man With Two Brains (1983), as well as the vampire romp The Lost Boys (1987), Scrooged (1988) and Kindergarten Cop (1990). He also directed three movies: All the Right Moves (1983), a sports drama starring Tom Cruise, the Cro-Magnon yarn The Clan of the Cave Bear (1985), described by Time Out magazine as “Reader’s Digest prehistory”, and The Viking Sagas (1995), which he also wrote. He was reunited with Scorsese in 1987 on the pop promo for Michael Jackson’s single Bad. A second Oscar nomination came his way for The Fugitive (1993), a big-screen adaptation of the popular 1960s TV series. Following his final cinematography credit, on the children’s fantasy Bridge to Terabithia (2007), he taught film at the North Carolina School of the Arts. He is survived by his second wife, the screenwriter Amy Holden Jones, and by their children, Emma and Patrick, as well as by Jonathan and Andrew, his sons from his previous marriage."
"Our movie industry was just about keeping its morale steady. It was enforcing perfectly workable rules on sanitising and physical distancing and not subject to those closures taking theatre and live entertainment to the cliff edge. The pilot light of big-screen cinema culture was flickering. But it was still alight. But this is a serious blow. If it is really true that Cineworld will close 128 cinemas, putting 5,500 jobs at risk (and it is not simply a scare-story negotiating ploy leaked to the press alongside the company’s official letter to the culture secretary Oliver Dowden demanding action) then this is potentially devastating. For the first time, everyone in the industry is beginning to entertain the queasy thought: what if our cinema industry is like vaudeville? Or silent movies? Or evensong – that once widespread middle-Britain churchgoing habit wiped out by TV? Is cinemagoing finished? A loss-leader adjunct to the home entertainment industry that’s long been vulnerable to infection? I think the answer is still no. But the other question is: who is to blame for the Cineworld debacle? Big blockbuster movies are routinely nicknamed “tentpoles” for a reason. They keep the whole big top upright. The announcement is that the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, will come out next spring (a transparently vague and unreliable promise) having been already delayed from the spring of this year. It is enraging that Eon (the Bond producers) have lost their nerve so spectacularly, pulling the movie on which the industry had been relying – the big-screen exhibitors that have been supporting and nurturing the 007 franchise since the 60s. It was just as dismaying for the industry that Disney released their high-profile live-action entertainment Mulan to streaming services. But somehow Disney wasn’t stringing us along in quite the same way. Of course, the whole Bond franchise is a business: we’re not talking about a state-subsidised schools workshop tour of Romeo and Juliet. Bond movies are profitable entertainments or they are nothing, and they are produced in an unsentimental way by people who, let’s not forget, aren’t to blame for coronavirus. And yes, of course, Covid-19 might be with us for so long that this proposed delay might not be as significant as it now appears. But that will be no consolation to Cineworld employees losing their jobs right now. And like it or not, those James Bond extravaganzas – enjoyable, exciting, reactionary, daft – are consumed in a slightly sentimental spirit, and the company has effectively been trading, at least partly, on our pride in a globally popular Brit product. Cinema, like all forms of show business, needs chutzpah and courage, and this year the only big-league players to have really shown this are Christopher Nolan and Warner Brothers who boldly released their mega-action thriller Tenet into cinemas. Eon has reportedly been unnerved by the lacklustre box-office numbers for Tenet, and this long delay is apparently their idea of playing it safe. But it isn’t simply that this line of thinking discounts the possibility that No Time to Die could have built on the initial steps taken by Tenet; it is the assumption that everything will pretty much be the same next year. Will it? Or will the Bond delay and the Cineworld closure trigger a wave of anxiety that will undermine so many other areas of the service industry and the economy generally? It could be the wing flap not of a butterfly but a pterodactyl. It is possible that Cineworld might reconsider – and the James Bond franchise itself could reconsider, too. In the meantime, we have to remember that most cinemas are still open and they are showing really good films. “Use it or lose it” is an annoying cliche. But we’re staring loss in the face."
"I got a report yesterday saying it was up by…” Sarah Paulson pauses, weighing up whether she wants to reveal the extent of her daily screen time. Then she takes the plunge. “It was nine hours and 52 minutes,” she says, mock-abashed. In a day? She nods. “In a day, yes. Quite terrible. I think it was… doesn’t it break down how much of it was work? There was work on there. So I was doing some of that. But… it’s embarrassing.” We are at the start of another long screen day for Paulson, who is speaking from her kitchen, at home in Los Angeles. Her new dog, Winifred, is curled up just out of shot. “Winnie! Would you like to come and say hi?” she coos, in a squeaky voice. “I’m this person! Who does this voice when I talk to my dog!” Winnie is her first dog in nine-and-a-half years; she has the initials of her old dogs, Alice and Millie, tattooed on the inside of her wrist. “She’s very demanding and she has a lot of personality. She’s recently taken to humping me. She’s my child! Why is she doing this, this 11-month-old, precious little thing? I can’t tell you how upsetting it is. She’s not even 8lb. Her arms clamp around me and I’m like, ‘Oh, stop it!”’ Paulson is a grafting sort of actor, whether she’s playing a conservative protester in Mrs America, a suburban mother who shifts stolen goods in Ocean’s 8, or her nine seasons to date of American Horror Story. But world events have meant that she’s recently been much less busy. “Usually I’m at work and I don’t look at my phone for hours because I can’t,” she says. “But I’m just not as busy. And I don’t seem to have the ability to read right now. My ability to focus is wildly altered in this time.” Instead of reading, Paulson has been watching a lot of television: “In the olden days, back when I was a child, that would be considered a negative, because there just wasn’t a plethora of very vital, really relevant, enriching things to watch.” Television was mostly trashy then, back in the 80s. But “now I just feel like there’s such magical stuff to watch that is not so much about an escapist experience but more about connecting to other people through story.” She has become a fan of Michaela Coel: “I’mtotally obsessed with I May Destroy You. I just think it’s the most astonishing thing I’ve seen in a long time.” Paulson came into her prime in her late 30s – she is 45 now – during this new golden age of television. She has long been a familiar face, both on TV and in film. But in 2012, when she took the lead in the second (and best) season of American Horror Story, as an investigative reporter in an asylum, her career soared. It helps that she’s a fun prospect on the promotional side of things, whether that’s wondering if she is or is not friends with Rihanna, her co-star on Ocean’s 8, or reminiscing about sniffing Cher’s head as a guest on talk shows. Now she is chatty and open – we talk far beyond our allotted hour. She speaks quickly and gives long, looping, contemplative answers. She is more introspective than the goofball you’d expect from seeing her on television or red carpets, more nervy and softly spoken, but also pleasingly no-nonsense. When it comes to acting, though, Paulson transforms into her characters completely. She has played a different character on each season of American Horror Story, from a psychic to the stars to a heroin-addicted ghost, via a headmistress-witch, and both of a pair of conjoined twins. She won multiple awards for playing Marcia Clark in American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson, and her performance saw a readjustment of public opinion on Clark, who had been publicly pilloried for her appearance and ambition throughout the trial and beyond. “There’s no doubt in my mind that that piece had a very positive impact on Marcia,” Paulson says. “And it was a 20-year wait for her to have that righted.” As we speak, the notion of commitment comes up more than once. Paulson was born in Florida, but moved with her mother and sister to New York when she was a child and was raised in the city. She has acted professionally ever since she left school at 18. “I did a play, the requisite Law and Order episode, then I went to Wilmington to do a show called American Gothic. I tend to only do shows with ‘American’ in the title, it’s so weird. American Gothic, American Crime Story, American Horror Story, Mrs America...” She moved to LA when she was 21, but for years she found it hard to admit to herself that the city was home: “Even when I moved here, I wanted an apartment, I didn’t want a house. I rented apartment after apartment until I finally bought a house, which I guess was really a way of saying, ‘I live here now.’” I expected her to say that this was a long time ago, but it was in 2017. “There was something about it that felt too grown-up to me,” she says, smiling. She mentions an actor friend who invested every bit of money she earned in property. “I was just not interested in that at all. When I look back at it, I must have been really resisting the idea of growing up.” Paulson’s mother was brought up by religious, conservative parents, and was a debutante. “But that was not my mother’s way of thinking. She moved from where she grew up to New York with two young children and just lived an entirely other life.” Paulson says she sometimes feels like “a travelling salesman”, which suits her line of work. “I like the pick-up-and-go thing. I like not having to pull anything up by the roots.” Buying the house has given her roots. “It’s a recent growing-up. I have to acknowledge that it’s recent. I have come to like it. But I do continue to look at real estate websites.” We are here to talk about her latest series, Ratched, which reimagines the nurse from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and gives her a rich, fabulous backstory. (After a long discussion about the 1975 film – the patriarchy, institutions and social norms – Paulson says she does not see her character as a villain.) Like American Horror Story, it is from the stable of TV’s production giant Ryan Murphy, and marks another sort of commitment. “Ryan called and asked me, ‘Do you want to do this?’ And I thought, I don’t know that I do,” she says. Netflix commissioned two seasons, and the idea of playing the same character for so long spooked her. “I had to think, was that going to be interesting for me? Not to mention, he asked me to executive produce the thing, and that was something I had never done. It just felt like a big, giant bite to take out of something, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for it.” In the end, the fact that it terrified her is what made her say yes. “It is so odd for someone like me, because I am such a nervous kind of person, prone to anxiety, and I think if I feel terrified to do it, I almost feel compelled, that I don’t have a choice.” So much of Paulson’s recent work is dark and horror-tinged, and requires her to put herself through the mill – she runs from clowns, she is blinded by acid. Yet she admits she is “a generally fearful person”. In real life, she avoids getting out of her comfort zone. “I run from bees. I don’t like planes. But with work, it’s like…” She growls, pitches her voice low. “Give it to me!” She refers to her relationship with Murphy as “the creative marriage of my life”. He tells her his ideas often before he tells his husband, while she says she can “interpret” him with a single word. She isn’t sure why they get each other in the way that they do. “I do think we have some things in common. We were both sort of different [as kids]. We were, I think, both ‘big feeling’ kind of people.” She has asked him why he thinks they work so well, but she has decided that, ultimately, she’d rather not know. “A lot of women wanted the Marcia Clark part. I don’t know why he thought it should be me. Sometimes I think it’s a good thing to not try to understand every gift you’re given, because it could really come down to just, you know, ‘I couldn’t think of another actor I wanted to be on a set with.’” Though she hasn’t had to do it in a while, Paulson likes auditioning; it makes her feel like she’s earned the part. “I haven’t auditioned for something since The Goldfinch – the thud heard around the world,” she says, gamely, of the big-budget Donna Tartt adaptation that didn’t so much soar as fly straight into a closed window. She was a big fan of the book, and fought hard to play Xandra. “I wish the thing had been a mini-series. I think you needed to feel that passage of time, and you can’t do that in a two-hour movie, or however long it ended up being.” She shrugs. “I never saw it.” She isn’t being rude – Paulson never watches herself on screen. When The People vs OJ Simpson finished shooting, she was devastated, because: “I didn’t want that experience of picking the moments where I’m unsatisfied with what I did.” Paulson won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her portrait of Marcia Clark. She had been watching award shows since she was small, and it was a childhood dream to win one. “And to be standing there, with that thing in your hand, looking out at a sea of people, and you go backstage, and it’s a bunch of strangers, then you call your person on the phone, then you’re home or in the hotel room with the thing, and it’s just... this is so weird. It’s not a communal experience, it’s a very isolating experience.” Her partner, Holland Taylor, was away at the time, doing a play, and Paulson says the whole experience was “sort of lonely, in a weird way”. That’s sad, I say. “It is sort of sad!” she says. “I don’t want it to seem just heartbreaking, because it was glorious, it was a very wild time. But in terms of something I could experience, it felt dropped in, like, this really happened to you, you really did this, this was the response to your work, are you taking this in?” She knows it sounds trite, but she says the real reward was playing Clark in the first place. “Everything that happened around it was just icing and gravy and cherry on top, and all that stuff.” Where does she keep those gold statues? “They’re in Holland’s house. I think about bringing them here all the time, but I never do. I don’t know, it’s weird.” I assume she and Taylor, who have been a couple since the beginning of 2015, don’t live together. “But we do live together,” she says. “For the whole beginning of the relationship and the last five years, we have lived together.” They just have their own houses, and spend some time apart during the week. “Really, the change happened during the pandemic, which was: we have an opportunity to protect our relationship by spending some time apart, and I think we should do that. We spend more time together than apart, but we do have several nights a week where we’re talking to each other like this [she gestures at the screen] and we get to do what we want, when we want. Both of us are exceedingly independent people.” As two actors, have they got used to spending large periods of time in different cities, doing different jobs? She laughs. “All of a sudden, we were like, ‘Hey! You’re here! What are you doing here? Get outta here!’ It’s been good.” The internet is wild for Paulson and Taylor as a couple. Whenever they refer to each other in interviews, or on social media, there is a minor explosion of online fuss. “I don’t remember people going nuts about Michael Douglas and Catherine-Zeta Jones, in terms of their age difference,” she says, with an air of resignation, not unkindly, but firmly. There are 32 years between Paulson and Taylor. “For me, that seems to be the predominant interest in my relationship with Holland, what would be perceived by some as the strangeness of it, or the unlikelihood of it. I think people are fascinated by it, because it’s so not typical. Except for if you look around at plenty of well-known or recognisable couples, when they’re heterosexual couples, it just runs rampant, and I don’t see anybody becoming obsessed by those relationships.” On the other hand, she says, if it makes other people feel more comfortable in themselves, fine. “If it allows for more freedom, in terms of the way people think about what’s possible for them, then I’m all for the fandom of it and the excitement around it and the interest in it. What I don’t love, which is sort of a consequence of it being such public knowledge, is that there is discussion about it at all. Believe me, there have been plenty of young people on the internet who have tweeted horrifying things to me about it, and who don’t support it and who are so cruel. So it’s just a bit of a dance. But one I try to not let into my brain too often.” When normal life begins to creep back, the first thing Paulson will do is return to Murphy’s next American Crime Story, which this time is taking on the Bill Clinton impeachment. She will play Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee who secretly recorded Monica Lewinsky confiding in her about her sexual relationship with the then-president. Many saw Tripp’s actions as a betrayal of her younger friend; Tripp said she was acting out of patriotic duty. They were about a week away from shooting when production shut down, and she hopes they will start up again in the next few weeks. “For me, playing her is not an opportunity to revise history, it’s just a chance for me to share the underbelly of something that, if we do it right, will at the very least make it possible for you to go, ‘I understand now, what she was doing.’” Now, what Paulson wants to do is find joy in her job, as much as she can: “Some of the work I’m most well known for is quite dark and quite centred in emotion. And I would love to be able to do that work, and enjoy it, at the same time.” That sounds like a grown-up way to look at it. “I’m trying!” she laughs. “I’m trying to shed the six-year-old, and grow into the 45-year-old. She’s here!”  Season 1 of Ratched is now streaming on Netflix"
"Its success has been hailed as “extraordinary” – not least because no one saw it coming. The YA romance After We Collided has next to no marketing budget and zero reviews – and has taken more than £1m after just two weeks in the UK. A few weeks ago, it wasn’t even in line for theatrical release. As the box office struggles in the pandemic, the industry has sat up to take note of this grassroots success. It is “completely unprecedented”, says Delphine Lievens, a senior box office analyst at Gower Street. “To do that based on no marketing – it’s a really impressive result.” After We Collided is the follow-up to last year’s After; both are adapted from the “new adult” novel series by the US author Anna Todd. They follow the up-and-down relationship of college students Tessa (played by Josephine Langford) and Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin – Joseph and Ralph’s nephew). Tessa is a headstrong and bookish young woman with parallels – the film insists – to Elizabeth Bennet. Hardin, meanwhile, is a bad-boy Brit whose eminent unsuitability is signposted by his many Ramones tees. Naturally, “Hessa” can’t keep away from each other, as much as their parents, love rivals and life circumstances conspire to keep them apart. Cue maudlin electro-pop. The film rights were acquired in 2014 by Paramount, and the first film, After, was released in 2019, to modest results: a worldwide gross of $70m, of which $12m came from the US. It failed to achieve a cinema release in the UK, and went straight to Netflix. (The platform’s refusal to share audience data means we don’t know how it performed.) You might assume After We Collided would go down the same path, but the film’s producers, Voltage Pictures, struck a deal for independent distribution in the UK and Ireland with an obscure company called Shear Entertainment. Shear secured a first-week run at 47 locations – none, unusually, in central London. Even with that limited release on 2 September the film entered the box office at No 3, with an opening weekend total of £175,000. Other cinemas leaped on this box office life raft, and After We Collided expanded to 378 venues (more than half of all those open in the UK) for its second week – and were rewarded by an 151% increase on the opening weekend. The film’s UK box office gross currently stands at over £1.1m. All this has happened in the face of minimal critical attention – and what little does exist has been almost uniformly negative, with unflattering comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight – “the actors could be mistaken for the undead” snarked one reviewer of After. But the overlap between professional critics and the target demographic of tween and teenage girls is practically nonexistent – and since Todd’s books have a massive global audience, reviews are of limited relevance. Fans say they relate to the characters and find parallels with their own lives. “[It’s] not for people to aspire to have this relationship, as it can be quite toxic at times, but it’s so that we can learn,” explains one. Many appreciate the unflinching treatment of darker material, including sex, drugs, fraught family relationships and trauma. Hessa’s romance – not to mention the online community around it – has helped fans through their own tough times. “It’s a kind of escape from reality,” says another fan. “Jo and Hero”, as the lead actors are known, are singled out by many for their on-screen chemistry. Langford and Fiennes Tiffin may not have the mainstream cachet that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson did as a result of Twilight, but they do reach millions of Instagram followers. The fragmentation of the media landscape means that After has emerged from between the gaps, at once undeniable and undetectable. “Traditional media certainly underestimated the reach and impact of this series,” says Ben Dalton, a reporter for Screen International. Just as EL James’ Fifty Shades trilogy was inspired by Twilight, After began as fan fiction for the boyband One Direction. In 2013 then 23-year-old Todd started writing about an imagined college romance with Harry Styles on the social storytelling platform Wattpad. For nearly a year, she posted a short chapter every day, typing on her iPhone. Driven in part by Todd’s fellow Directioners, After became a viral sensation on Wattpad, drawing 1m readers before she had even finished writing. Aron Levitz, head of Wattpad’s entertainment arm, says fans would gather online ahead of each instalment: “If it was a minute late, you’d see social media explode with people going, ‘Anna, why isn’t it posted yet?’” That dialogue between writer and reader formed the basis for the community now driving its commercial success. “That’s what made it a hit: their love for the story,” says Levitz. Todd’s original stories continue to feature among Wattpad’s most read every years, having now amassed more than 1.5bn reads. Todd’s work is the blueprint by which the films are judged. While some liberties were taken with the plot in the adaptation of After, Roger Kumble – the director of Cruel Intentions, who took on After We Collided – has been praised for sticking so closely to the book. “He really gave us the ‘book Hessa’ that we wanted,” one fan says. “The movie was everything the fans were hoping for,” says another. (The next two, After We Fell and After Ever Happy, were confirmed to be in production this week.) Even now that she has industry backing, Todd calls herself a “fangirl turned author” and credits her success as her readers’ achievement as much as her own. They repay her in kind, talking of “Anna” as a friend and advocating for her work on social media (where most of the films’ marketing budget goes). Their community even has a name: “Afternators” – and they are “as loyal and rabid as any fandom out there”, says Levitz. As one member put it: “When we work together, we achieve.”Voltage president Jonathan Deckter gave credit to “the power of a strategic grassroots social campaign that spoke directly to our film’s target audience in the forum they prefer. Traditional release marketing will always have its place, but as far as Afternators are concerned, they live and breathe social.” In adapting After, Levitz says, Wattpad consulted with readers: “This wasn’t done like most development is done, behind closed doors … It was about keeping them involved, something I think traditional industries aren’t used to.” More typically, he says, audiences are treated as the “commodity at the end of a production line” that culminates with “this big bang, red-carpet moment: ‘I hope they like it!’ But we don’t have to hope anymore – we knew After was going to be a success.” The lesson from After We Collided’s success, says Lievens, is that “no distributor in the UK had identified that there was an audience for this film”. Independent distribution is usually a final resort for films considered too niche for mainstream audiences; and had Voltage not decided to push for a theatrical release, cinemas would have missed out on a cash injection of nearly £1m – from, it’s fair to assume, mostly young women. By contrast, the industry had pinned its hopes on Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster Tenet which, despite half a decade of hype, made only slightly more than After We Collided. The latter’s opening-weekend per-screen average was £4,366 compared with Tenet’s £5,358, despite showing in one-tenth the number of cinemas. Even more impressively, After We Collided also leapfrogged X-Men spin-off The New Mutants in its second week. The result suggests a disconnect between gatekeepers and cinemagoers that, at this desperate moment, may prove costly. The blindspots aren’t just age and gender. Lievens points to the “huge unexpected success” of Fisherman’s Friend, carried by regional audiences in Devon and Cornwall; and the £4.5m box office takings of Rapman’s debut Blue Story. “There were lots of old white men scratching their heads and going ‘Where did this come from?’” At Wattpad, Levitz believes there is fatigue with the old ways of entertainment and it is time for cinemagoers to be promoted to stakeholders. “In a world where more money is being spent on content than ever before, audience is going to make the difference – but the industry is not always used to listening to audience.” "
"It is fascinating to find Sir Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, posting on Twitter a scene from Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons to affirm his belief in the sanctity of the law. Since Bolt was a one-time communist, an active supporter of CND and a dramatist who wrote a hagiographic portrait of Lenin in State of Revolution, he and Cox make strange bedfellows. Yet, although Bolt was ready to defy the law in pursuit of a cause like nuclear disarmament, he still saw it, in his own words, as “the essence of organised society”. Cox’s choice of a clip from the film of A Man for All Seasons is highly pertinent but, to understand it fully, you need to know the context. Sir Thomas More has just been confronted by Richard Rich, who is part of the network of spies Thomas Cromwell is using to gather information about him. Once Rich has gone, More is urged to arrest him. More’s response is that what Rich is doing may well be evil but that it’s not illegal. He places his faith in the inviolable integrity of the law. Destroy that and anarchy follows. As More says: “This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast and if you cut them down do you think you could really stand upright in the winds that would blow then?” It’s a powerful message for today. Cox seems to have got the point. As a parliamentarian, he’s not famous for his humility: indeed he appears the antithesis of the More portrayed by Paul Scofield in the film, who was the epitome of quiet modesty. However, when Cox said this week that “the breaking of the law ultimately leads to very long-term and permanent damage to this country’s reputation” he was speaking sentiments More might have understood. Perhaps he could arrange a clandestine showing of A Man for All Seasons for Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, and Suella Braverman, the attorney general, who seem all too happy to cut their consciences to suit the current Tory fashion. But while it’s good to see Fred Zinnemann’s film being used to make a moral point, it started out as a stage play and is only one of many in the 20th century in which the individual is pitted against authority. Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan shows its protagonist taking on the Catholic church and, unlike Bolt’s More, putting God’s law above man’s. Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, dealing with the Salem witch trials of 1692 but highly relevant to the hearings of Senator McCarthy’s House Un-American Activities Committee, shows a hero who sacrifices his life to his principles. And Bertolt Brecht’s Galileo depicts a pioneering scientist who abjures his beliefs when faced with the Inquisition. Bolt’s play, when it opened in 1960, was openly compared to Brecht’s: not always in its favour as shown in a celebrated argument with Kenneth Tynan in the pages of the Observer. But Bolt stuck to his guns and argued that More was right to pin his faith to the primacy of the law, and against those who “were ready to crack it open and let in anarchy to maintain their own advantages”. Not a bad phrase to apply to the age of Johnson and Cummings."
"As America’s west coast continues to burn, this Ron Howard-directed documentary tells of the aftermath of the 2018 wildfires in Paradise, California. At the time it was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history. Paradise first entered the international consciousness via a Trumpian gaffe that seemed to encapsulate the administration’s casual indifference to climate change; the president referred to the town as “Pleasure” while touring the devastation. That clip is featured again here, this time utterly drained of even the bitterest humour by the harrowing images that precede it.Footage garnered from emergency response vehicle dashcams and survivors’ mobiles shows the now-familiar ash clouds, orange skies and deadlocked queues of fleeing traffic – no less shocking for that familiarity. In one remarkable shot, four horses gallop away from the inferno, as if having already abandoned the four horsemen in their haste to escape the apocalypse. The irony is stark: Paradise sure looks a lot like hell. It is the small-town heroes who are ultimately the film’s centre, however. These include square-jawed local cop Matt Gates, tireless school district superintendent Michelle John and the town-drunk-turned-town-mayor Woody Culleton (how’s that for living out the American Dream?). At one point the real-life Erin Brockovich even pops up to lend support to a class action suit. These displaced characters from a Frank Capra movie are now just displaced; scattered across the state, living half-lives in motels and trailers, while they await any news.Rebuilding Paradise might easily have blazed with righteous fury, but its conclusions are quieter and bleaker. There are big societal, historical and pyrogeographical reasons why such disasters now happen with increasing frequency. But none of that is the fault of these good people. They just want to go home.

"This debut feature from Channing Godfrey Peoples is lit with pride for Black Texan culture: the BBQ, the beauty pageants, historic black colleges and Juneteenth itself. This is the annual 19 June holiday commemorating the day in 1865, when enslaved black people in Texas were liberated, two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had outlawed slavery. Nicole Beharie (Shame, Little Fires Everywhere) stars as Miss Juneteenth 2004 – otherwise known as Turquoise “Turq” Jones. She is a single mother who scrimps every penny she earns working at the local bar and funeral home, in the hope that her 15-year-old daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) will repeat her glory days at this year’s pageant. This is more than mere vanity: the new Miss Juneteenth will have her tuition fees paid at the historically black college of her choice. For a woman in Turq’s situation, freedom means choosing from a limited set of options, and always with some sacrifice. It means trying to make the best decision under financial pressure and always in the judgmental glare of neighbours and relatives. She dreams of a better life for her daughter, but Kai, like most teenagers, has her own ideas.The beauty pageant has been a means to explore mother-daughter relationships before (Drop Dead Gorgeous, Dumplin’), but rarely with a black woman at its centre, and never with such unhurried specificity. Even as Turq lives vicariously through her daughter, and hitches her wagon to various unreliable men (Insecure’s Kendrick Sampson plays Kai’s father), the realisation slowly dawns that she must find something for herself. For anyone who values diverse storytelling, Peoples’ portrait of a hardworking woman on the up is a tale of hopefulness – and a reason to hope in itself."
"Therapist Dr Marianne Winter (Thekla Reuten) hopes to escape her own traumatic past in upstate New York by taking up a position treating troubled children in a remote Scottish town. However, the forbidding Victorian municipal building that houses her new consulting room offers no sanctuary, and she’s soon unsettled by a 10-year-old patient (Elijah Wolf), who claims he can control her actions with his thoughts. Repression (previously entitled Marionette) gamely endeavours to live up to the Hitchcockian promise of its title. It started out as a Dutch-language short by director Elbert van Strien 27 years ago, and here he knowingly utilises all the gothic potential of a new setting. As one visitor to Marianne’s rooms remarks: “Isn’t it a bit depressing? All this panelling, rip that out. You know what you need? Some nice bright white walls, little bit of uplighting.” Van Strien is ably assisted by a top-drawer supporting cast. Peter Mullan plays Marianne’s troubled predecessor, Rebecca Front is her hint-dropping colleague (enjoyable shades of Mrs Danvers), and Bill Paterson is perfectly cast as the practice’s benignly befuddled team leader. Such atmospherics can be a film entire. It’s a shame Repression instead gets bogged down by its big themes, which revolve around a series of undergrad philosophy questions such as, “Does the process of observing reality change nature?”, “Are thoughts like self-fulfilling prophecies?” and “Was there ever really a cat in Schrödinger’s box?” These are all inelegantly spelled out during meetings of Marianne’s book group, which take place in the back room of a pub (more wood panelling). A third-act plot twist is audacious enough to regain our attention, but Reuten and Wolf don’t quite have the charisma to fully carry it off."
"Netflix has defended the controversial film Cuties after it emerged the streaming giant is facing a criminal charge in Texas over the movie’s allegedly “lewd” depiction of children. Cuties follows an 11-year-old Senegalese girl living in Paris who rebels against her conservative family’s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a “free-spirited dance crew”. A grand jury in Tyler County, Texas, has indicted the company on the charge of “promotion of lewd visual material depicting a child”. The indictment claims Cuties appeals to the “prurient interest in sex” and the material holds “no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value”.  A Netflix representative told PA: “Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualisation of young children. This charge is without merit and we stand by the film.” The film became a target of protesters after Netflix admitted it had used “inappropriate artwork” to market it on the streaming platform. Netflix subsequently became the subject of more wide-ranging attacks and a campaign for subscribers to cancel their membership. Following the backlash, the company encouraged people to watch the movie before passing judgment. Writer-director Maimouna Doucouré said she considers it to be “a deeply feminist film with an activist message” that is a “mirror of today’s society, a mirror sometimes difficult to look into”. She said she got the idea after seeing a group of 11-year-old girls dancing in a way “you would see in a video clip” during a neighbourhood gathering in Paris. The director said she had spent the next year and a half meeting hundreds of pre-teens to learn about how they felt about their femininity in today’s society, and how they felt about their self-image in the era of social media. The film premiered at the Sundance film festival in January this year, where Doucouré won the world cinema dramatic directing award. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the calls to boycott Netflix would be a “flash in the pan” after some initial success. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall suggestws that some 2 million subscribers had dropped the service in the US and Canada over the last three months, well above the streaming service’s normal “churn” rate, but that the cause was not clear, given that many more subscribers had joined the platform during lockdown."
"There’s a moment in The Forty-Year-Old Version when frustrated playwright Radha becomes so enraged by an elderly white theatre producer that she has to be physically prevented from throttling him. He has just suggested that, if she’s unwilling to put a white character at the heart of her play about the gentrification of Harlem, she might like to help out with a forthcoming musical about the 19th-century abolitionist Harriet Tubman instead. It raises the question – how close is the film to the life of its director and star, Radha Blank, who has also spent decades beating at the door of New York’s predominantly white theatre establishment? “I have not actually choked a theatre producer… yet,” she says, “just like I’ve never won a 30 under 30 award and I’ve not had a relationship specifically with a hip-hop producer in his 20s from Brownsville. But that character [D, played by newcomer Oswin Benjamin] is an amalgam of a lot of people I’ve dated, people I’ve met in music, and I tend to skew younger, so that part is true.” Her frankness is both endearing and surprising. We’re five minutes into a Zoom interview about her debut film, which was a sleeper hit of this year’s Sundance festival, winning her the directing award for US drama and a nomination for the grand jury prize. Like its maker, the film is a life-affirming, in-your-face blast of fresh air that is perfectly timed to blow up a storm on the energy released by the Black Lives Matter movement. “It traces the rebirth of an artist with lacerating insight, a great deal of warmth and terrific comic timing,” said the New York Times, noting that its black-and-white palette recalled the iconic New York films of Woody Allen and Spike Lee. Blank cites Lee’s 1986 movie, She’s Gotta Have It, as one of her biggest influences, and a few years ago Lee invited her to join his writers’ room for the TV follow-up, which ran from 2017 to 2019. It was one of a succession of writing gigs in the past decade, including Baz Luhrmann’s The Get Down, about musical youth in the Bronx, and the record industry soap opera Empire, which for Blank put an end to years of grafting away in children’s TV while going nowhere in her first love, theatre. “I have about 12 plays that haven’t seen the light of day and became my writing samples for TV,” she says. “I’m one of the most known unproduced black playwrights. When I have a reading, people turn up. We’re hungry for each other. They need me as a playwright and I need them as actors, but I’ve only had a couple of readings and one major production.” In the film, Radha’s failure to break through is compounded by her 40th birthday and the death of her artist mother. There’s a poignant scene where she and her brother take stock of her mother’s paintings. When she made the film, Blank herself had just emerged from two months “curled in a ball”, grieving for her own mother, who was an artist and “my chief cheerleader”. Radha is “about 65% me,” she says, “but some of my friends are playing my friends in the film and all of the family photos are real: that’s my mom’s artwork, that’s my dad’s music, that’s my brother. So certain elements are very true.” Part of the survival strategy of both Radhas is to reinvent themselves as a comedy rapper, RadhaMUSprime, whose name – Blank says she didn’t realise it at the time – was subliminally inspired by Rodimus Prime, a character in her favourite childhood robot superhero series, Transformers (“There’s a moment from it that I use to open my shows, where RadhaMUSprime is fighting Megatron. I tried to get it in the movie, but without success.”) Unlike Radha in the film, Blank has never freaked out on stage. “Performing at Joe’s pub, in little dives in Brooklyn, in Norway – this was part of my healing,” she says. “RadhaMUSprime as an alter ego really did save me. What I love about hip-hop music is if you have a skill with a pen it really doesn’t matter what you look like. I used RadhaMUSprime to celebrate having a May to December romance, and I have a fat girl sex anthem. In my normal life I’m always dieting, whereas RadhaMUSprime doesn’t care. She celebrates her rolls!” The Forty-Year-Old Version is part satirical howl of rage at racial disadvantage in the theatre, and part love song to New York, where she and her brother were raised as part of an “intentional artist community” whose members spent their downtime renovating dilapidated lofts and storefronts. “I was raised around artists,” she says. “It was nothing for a jam session to start off in our house; for different activists and artists to pontificate in our kitchen, smoking a little weed, and having their arguments until 3am. People l call my aunties and uncles – black, brown, Jewish.” Her father is a jazz drummer from a dynasty of musicians, and her “uncle” Gerry Eastman still owns the Williamsburg Music Center in Brooklyn. “In that place I saw everyone from Cassandra Wilson to Joshua Redman, people who today are jazz luminaries but who were then young musicians in their 20s just trying to figure things out. So creating art was never a question. It was what we did, not necessarily as a vocation.” By the time she got to her teens, Blank began to see the downside of such a lifestyle – “struggling to pay bills, needing a little government assistance, expected to wear the same pair of jeans three times a week. I was a little embarrassed, so instead of becoming an artist I went to business school.” She ended up excelling in all the school talent shows. “It’s something I could not escape, it’s part of who I am. I just had to figure out how to make a living at it,” she says. “Then I came to Spike’s work and thought that’s someone who’s making a living and who looks like me.” As a child, Blank would watch films over the shoulder of her cinephile mother. “The reason I had to shoot the film in black and white is that there’s nothing more New York than a black and white film, and in my own way I’m retrofitting the film back into a canon that I love from the 70s and 80s, telling a story that should have been told all those years ago: this is another [type of] New Yorker. I’m a New Yorker. It’s just that the camera was angled in one direction and we had to pivot it over here.” It was also, she says, about seeing New York’s urban culture through a more sophisticated lens. “Hip-hop is often oversexualised, oversaturated. Black and white brings it to a level of cool and vulnerability that we don’t often see it at.” The film was originally intended to be a 10-episode web series. Her mother’s death, just as she was preparing to shoot the first two episodes, put an end to that – but also raised her sights. “I feel like failure is a great tool in comedy,” she says. “Adversity is a great polisher of the mirror of life.” Mirrors are a motif in the film. “I’m using the comedy and the failure and the adversity to polish the character’s mirror. It’s sometimes obscured, sometimes foggy, sometimes she can’t see her reflection. When a black woman is up on screen she usually fits into maybe five tropes: the sassy best friend, the all-knowing oracle, the hands-on-hips ‘Oh no you don’t!’ type… I’m in favour of the black woman on screen looking into herself. That’s what I’m a champion of.” Though the bulk of Blank’s satire is aimed at the white theatre establishment – the smug producer and the sleek socialite investors – she’s not above a dig at her multi-ethnic peers. There’s a comic riff on a pretentiously mystical black arts scene, as well as a sharp dig at crowd-pleasing hip-hop musicals. Did she by any chance have the work of Lin-Manuel Miranda in mind, in particular his streetlife musical In the Heights? “You picked up on that? Holy shit!” she chortles, with a shake of her glamorous gold braids. Then she dials back to serious. “When it comes to theatre in an urban environment, particularly musical theatre, it’s pretty much the same setup: this exciting place where everything is pointed at this one voice that’s speaking for the street. Then there’s poverty porn. This is not a criticism of Lin-Manuel, who is one of our genius scribes. What I’m critical of is that institutions don’t put up more plays by people of colour about the inner city, so we have a range of stories.” It just so happens that Blank has a few of them in her back pocket. “Seed [her one play that did have a full production, at New York’s National Black Theatre, in 2011] is a story that takes place in Harlem and people actually speak in rhyme, but there’s a little bit more depth than the usual representations.” It’s about a gifted child and the woman who tries to help him fulfil his potential. Then there’s her TV calling card, Casket Sharp, about a young graduate who returns to his decayed home town to settle his dead father’s funeral business, only to get caught up in a row about funeral rites between the mother of a young dead man and his gang family. She turned down the chance of turning it into a TV series because “I didn’t know whether I wanted to create a show where people were tuning in every week to black death, even though they were saying it’s our version of Six Feet Under.” She gives another shake of her head and concludes that, despite all her setbacks: “there are just some things that should be on the stage: I’ll never be done with theatre, I’m just hoping that maybe now theatre will take a chance on me.” She’s well aware of the irony that the worlds of television and film, which initially seemed so much more remote and glamorous, should have proved more welcoming. “But the beauty of this moment is that there’s no denying it. I am officially a film director. I made a film.”"
"You might not have realised it at the time – you might not even realise it now – but on Friday afternoon, something truly momentous happened: David Lynch pulled a seven out of a jar. For the most part, the burst of online celebrity visibility that marked the start of the Covid crisis has dribbled down to almost nothing. Joe Wicks has stopped doing PE lessons. John Krasinski’s Some Good News show screeched to a halt four months ago. Mercifully, nobody else has attempted another group singalong of Imagine. But David Lynch is still plugging away, updating his YouTube account twice daily. The first videos are his weather reports, where he briefly tells us about the Los Angeles forecast. But the more gripping content comes in the form of his Today’s Number Is series, where he swirls 10 ping-pong balls around in a blacked-out jar, picks one out and shows us the number written on it. That’s all there is to it. As of Monday morning, Lynch has pulled a number from his jar on 43 consecutive days, each video comfortingly sticking to the same script. “Here we go for today’s number,” he says, standing in the same spot outside his workshop. He reveals the date. “Ten balls. Each ball has a number. Numbers one through 10.” He takes the lid off the jar, puts his hand in. “Swirl the numbers. Pick a number.” He pulls a ball from the jar, shows the number to the camera, says it aloud and the video ends. Exactly what it means is anybody’s guess. Lynch is known to be a fan of numerology, and his 2017 Twin Peaks revival was full of so many mysterious numbers that all manner of websites started to tie themselves in knots trying to decode their meaning. A bruised woman, never seen before or since, repeatedly cries “119” for reasons that are never explained. The screaming tree with a human brain tells Dale Cooper “253. Time and time again”. The character played by Carel Struycken orders Cooper to “remember 430”. These numbers might be relevant, or they might not. And so it is with the jar. The comment section beneath the videos has grown into a community of likeminded numerological sleuths, trying to assign a deeper meaning to the numbers that Lynch pulls out. Overwhelmingly, the most frequently drawn number has been eight, which many took to be an ominous portent of things to come. After all, you will remember that episode eight of Twin Peaks: The Return drifted into a nuclear explosion and saw the end of the world. For the first 40 days of the series, David Lynch pulled out every number but seven from the jar. Seven is Lynch’s favourite number. Theories began to emerge. Was it deliberate? Was it rigged? Did he keep ball seven in a freezer, so he could identify it by touch? Was he redoing any videos in which he pulled a seven? Regardless, every day a commenter called Wes W wrote the same thing: “Man if tomorrow’s not a 7 I’m gonna lose it.” Wes quickly gained a large following, as the rest of the audience took to pinning all their thwarted seven-based hopes on him. Then, on Friday, it happened. As always, Lynch ran through his script. He swirled the numbers. He picked a number. He looked at it, and broke into a broad grin. “Today’s number, by golly,” he giggled. “Today’s number, Wes, is seven.”  The jubilation in the comments was unparalleled. Not only had a seven finally been picked, but Lynch addressed had addressed a commenter by name. “WES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” one wrote. “Almost made me cry,” wrote another. “I feel like I’m a part of history by being here,” wrote a third, and it made sense. If you’d been following the numbers from the start, this weird little game produced and watched out of boredom in a moment of personal restriction, the number and the smile and the call-out genuinely seemed significant. And then Wes W disappeared, without so much as a reaction. As soon as seven was called, he stopped commenting. Now the comment section has transformed into a hunt for Wes, a gnomic figure with just three videos in his profile, one of which is a clip of David Lynch and five Woody Woodpeckers thanking a cinema chain for supporting Eraserhead. Who could he be? Will he return? Was he David Lynch in disguise? Are we all just projecting a much larger narrative on to something that may be meaningless? Probably, yes, but hasn’t that always been the case with David Lynch? David Lynch is still swirling his numbers. Yesterday’s number was five. What will today’s number be?"
"The cast of Oliver Stone’s 1986 Vietnam classic Platoon heartily exchange old war stories in this making-of documentary by two of their own: Paul Sanchez, writer-director here, played Doc in Platoon and Charlie Sheen (“Chris”), who has been deployed to provide occasional narration. While Sheen had spent time in outh-east Asia before, accompanying dad Martin on the set of Apocalypse Now, he impresses on us just how inexperienced the rest these “no-name grunts” were. It was up to Stone’s fellow Vietnam vet, Captain Dale Dye to turn 33 drama school slackers into a trained rifle platoon with a two-week boot camp. Did he succeed? Let’s just say that Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller’s 2008 Hollywood satire, has a new ring of truth to it and 30 years on, only the level-headed Willem Dafoe can find the line between experiencing actual combat and shooting a movie without catering. They have, however, authentically captured the 1am atmosphere at a veteran’s bar. Every anecdote is overlong, any point worth making is made seven times over and occasional non-sequitur gems float above the relentless bed of juke-box rock. “It’s Cher, walking into my funeral parlour, and I’m going to do some low-budget piece of shit halfway around the world …” moans John C McGinley. “So I unzipped the old fly and pulled out the old friend and, yeah, I was gonna urinate on Oliver,” chuckles Johnny Depp. Stone himself never makes an appearance. That’s probably for the best, since the cast clearly despised him. His torturous methods involved forcing actors to do 30-plus takes for a single line of dialogue before revealing there was no film in the camera, and never had been. Then again, after sitting through 90 minutes of their self-indulgent reminiscence, you might conclude they fully deserved it."
"Two o’clock, Chicago time. The curtains are down against a bright afternoon sun and John Cusack, who is by reputation a late riser, takes a seat at the breakfast counter in his kitchen. For decades this storied, experienced and rather solitary-seeming actor has dressed all in black. Today is no exception. He wears a black T-shirt, black bandana and a black leather biker’s jacket. But for the incongruous cup he’s drinking coffee from (a medieval-style flagon, large as a flowerpot) Cusack could be one of those menacing motorcycle dudes who parks himself next to you at an American dive bar and starts explaining, unbidden, how he once killed a man but in error. He turned 54 in the summer. The voice is gravellier than when you knew it best, when Cusack was in his mid-30s heyday and playing those brilliant lovelorn everymen in Being John Malkovich (1999), High Fidelity (2000) and Serendipity (2001). The eyes, always so coolly narrowed when Cusack first made a name for himself as a teen star of the 80s, are more starey and tired these days. He rubs them a lot while he talks. Professionally speaking, Cusack has been on a wearying run of form of late, the past five years a hotchpotch of underwhelming thrillers. (He hopes that a new Amazon TV drama he’s starring in, Utopia, will help revive his stock.) And politically speaking, as with so many who lean left, Cusack has been left exhausted by four years of a Trump presidency. The actor was online most of the day before, getting angry at news bulletins and tweeting strangers and friends – broadcasters, Edward Snowden, a librarian in North Carolina, a chocoholic in the UK – about the president’s latest outrages. “He’s an evil fuck,” Cusack growls, “and he grinds our faces in it every day.” Back in 2012, when Cusack was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a few of the people closest to him gave speeches, his sister Joan Cusack described his character as part It’s a Wonderful Life (melancholy, sweet), part Doctor Strangelove (eccentric, political). Kate Beckinsale, Cusack’s co-star in romcom Serendipity, described him as a “bit mysterious”. Defining himself in his Twitter bio, Cusack prefers the phrase “apocalyptic shit-disturber”. Whoever is most right, Cusack is an interestingly complicated guy, both opinionated and deferential, salty and sweet. Sometimes strangers will send him messages, suggesting that he leave politics alone, stay in his lane. “You have officially ruined Serendipity for me!” they say. Or: “You used to be one of my favourites!” Sometimes, Cusack will reply: “Aww. You’ll be OK.” I ask him what he thinks about the idea that actors ought to stay in their lane, away from politics, and he takes a deep breath. (The “you” in the following speech can be taken to be directed at the person for whom Serendipity has been ruined.) “When you see children being ripped away from their mothers’ arms and put into kennels,” he says, “I’m sorry if you think someone speaking out against that is someone not staying in their lane. But let’s agree that, if you can’t figure out that that’s fascism, then we don’t have anything more to say to each other, and I don’t have any respect for you, and we should probably not talk. I mean!” When I ask if he holds out much hope for a return to political normality after the November election, Cusack puffs out his cheeks and wags his head, weighing it. “One hopes that sanity comes back. But, um, America is a bat-shit-crazy place. So you just don’t know.” And “you just don’t know” is the primary lesson a long career in Hollywood has taught him. A 30-plus-year veteran of the business, Cusack has known what it’s like to feel hot as an actor, and also what it’s like to feel the icy touch of irrelevance. When I ask about the difference between those two feelings, being hot and cold, Cusack pauses for a good long while and then says: “We-e-e-ell. I haven’t really been hot for a long time.”  Utopia, the show he hopes will warm him up, is colourful, breathless and vicious – a remake of Dennis Kelly’s Channel 4 hit, this time written by Gillian Flynn. It’s a multi-threaded drama that interweaves the stories of a gang of millennial comic-book readers, a pair of assassins and the sinister founder of a biotech company. Cusack, who can be peerlessly sinister when he wants to be (see his double turn in 2013, first as a serial killer in The Frozen Ground and then as Richard Nixon in Lee Daniels’ The Butler), plays the founder. Followers of his Twitter feed will know the powerful aversion to the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg this actor has. When I suggest to Cusack it must have been cathartic, playing a founder-saviour type, and getting to channel his deep suspicions about Musk and the rest, he corrects me: “Yeah. They’re not really suspicions so much as they’re, um, factual observations.” His unease about the Silicon Valley founder class stretches back to the 00s and his time aboard Bill Clinton’s plane as part of a celebrity delegation to Africa. Musk was on the flight, too, as were Larry Page and Sergey Brin from Google. “Too weird an adventure to pass up,” Cusack says, explaining his unlikely presence aboard. “It’s not like I’ve always been pure. No! I was the dog, and I was walked too. But then you start to see through it. You see these people saying, ‘Don’t be evil! We’re not evil!’ A nice catchy phrase. But then you see that their business becomes data-mining… You learn about what’s really happening with these companies. What their back doors are.” His strong political views evolved from that trip, Cusack says. In recent years he has travelled to Russia with the novelist Arundhati Roy to meet American exile Edward Snowden – “Ed” – and show him support. He has been a full-blooded supporter of Bernie Sanders for a while now, and though he will vote for Biden in November Cusack insists he will do so grudgingly. (“You’re voting for an extension of the neoliberal order. But the alternative is fascism. You have to vote against Trump.”) A year ago his politics got him in trouble when he put out a tin-eared tweet that he meant as criticism of Israeli foreign policy but which was antisemitic. Cusack apologised. Recently, he took to the streets of Chicago during the Black Lives Matter protests, and got rushed by a gang of baton-wielding cops while he was taking photographs. “They didn’t hit me, they just… tuned up my Vespa. Whack-whack-whack!” By queasy chance, part of the story of Utopia, which was written and filmed last year, involves a pandemic. It’s an accidentally timely subplot that Amazon has not been shy to push in trailers for the show. I ask Cusack, when he first read the script, whether it seemed at all plausible that something like this could happen, and he says yes: “Given the convergence of dystopian realities that we’ve had, whether it’s food and water shortages, endless war, global warming, it didn’t feel like it was too much of a stretch to imagine it happening. ‘Timely’ would be the wrong word, because that sounds like something that’s convenient and nice. But, for those people who have been Cassandras for a while, for those people who’ve been saying we must change, it feels like the rest of the world is catching up now.” Do you consider yourself a Cassandra? Cusack rubs his eyes again. He smiles. He frowns. He appears to think, fuck it: “Sometimes you do. If you are saying things that people might not want to hear, or things that are annoying to hear… Y’know, yeah. A little bit!” He’s gentler, honestly, than all this hoarse political speechifying makes him sound. He sister Joan once pointed out Cusack’s unconscious habit, at parties, of lowering his 6ft 2in frame to look someone shorter than himself in the eye: “To make them feel like the star.” Chatting as he sits in his kitchen, he isn’t so far away in manner from the affable, all-American boys he played so well in the 1980s. There was “Gib” Gibson in The Sure Thing (1985) and Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything (1989). As a viewer I first encountered Cusack when he played the wise and tragic college boy Denny Lachance in Rob Reiner’s bildungsroman, Stand By Me. Reiner, who also directed The Sure Thing, was a former teen star himself. Cusack remembers the director going out of his way to make him feel welcome in an industry that could be cold and cruel to its young actors. “You don’t need me to repeat all the clichés. Hollywood can be quite transactional and rough. I was lucky. I was 16, 17. Rob would invite you into his home, look after you – it wasn’t that… exploitative vibe at all. Movies were definitely the Wild West back then. But there were good people, too.” What does he remember of his first encounters with the rougher edges of the business? Cusack looks at the curtained window, holding in a smile, apparently wondering whether to tell the following story or not. “I remember, early in my career, when I was still in high school, you’d be on a movie set and at the end of the day people would go and get beer from the prop truck. And also you could get coke.” He doesn’t mean the kind with a capital C: “Like I said, the Wild West. Not that I was doing it all. But it was just sort of like, ‘Wow.’ Sort of like, ‘OK! Anything goes.’” After his breakout years in the 1980s he was in and out of work in the early 90s, till Woody Allen cast him in Bullets Over Broadway. Cusack found a cool groove towards the end of that decade, co-writing and starring in the cult comedy Grosse Pointe Blank and appearing alongside John Malkovich in the dementedly silly, but sort of brilliant, action movie Con Air. That film ended with an aeroplane full of condemned prisoners landing on a fully populated Las Vegas strip. (Incredibly, this is not the silliest scene Cusack has ever rendered for the action-movie canon. For that you need to check out the apocalypse movie 2012 and a sequence in which he drives a stretch limo through a collapsing Los Angeles skyscraper.) His career high came right at the turn of the century, when he reunited with Malkovich for the unforgettable Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze collaboration Being John Malkovich and a year later starred in, co-wrote and co-produced the movie adaptation of Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity. In 2001 he did Serendipity, which has proved durable, a well-thought-of Christmas romcom. The later 00s were not quite so fertile for him and might be best thought of as Cusack’s “with hilarious results” phase. On IMDB they summarise the plot of 2005’s Must Love Dogs as follows: “A 30-something preschool teacher looks to the personals for a change of pace and a relationship, with hilarious results.” In 2010 he starred in and produced the self-explanatory comedy Hot Tub Time Machine, a silly film that found a cult audience and doubled its money at the box office. But it was one of the last of his projects to date that Cusack was able to get real money for. “In the last few years, I haven’t been able to get projects financed,” he says. “That could be a function of getting older. Or it could be a function of being cold.” Instead, the past decade’s work has been characterised by some ace bit-parts and cameos (an eerie psychotherapist in David Cronenberg’s Maps to the Stars, the musician Brian Wilson in Love & Mercy, a soliloquising preacher in Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq) as well as some terribly average thrillers, in almost all of which Cusack appears on the poster brandishing a gun or standing next to someone brandishing a gun. “You may go make a film,” he sighs, lowering his torso over the breakfast counter, “you do all this work. And the movie sort of gets butchered in the editing room. And that happens, like…” (Cusack turns down his mouth, doing the sums) “like, nine times out of 10? So it’s not a very satisfying thing, if only one in 10 movies that you’re making work out the way they were planned.” Movie-making, he concludes, is “brutal, transactional, superficial and dumb.” Incredible, really, that he’s waited so long to get in on TV. In all his years as an actor Cusack had never ventured further into telly than a 1996 guest-spot on Frasier, even as telly became an exciting, thriving, prestigious format, a refuge for so many forgotten or overlooked actors of Cusack’s generation. He has heard it said he was once considered for the role of Walter White in Breaking Bad. Even, that he was offered the gig and turned it down. The rumour has proved so persistent that Cusack finally had to sidle up to showrunner Vince Gilligan and ask. “I said: ‘I never got offered Breaking Bad, did I?’ And Vince said no.” The new Amazon show, Cusack insists, was his first serious offer. “One of those phone calls, they want you.” And so he is waiting. For the show to come out (and maybe warm him up a little). For the presidential election in November, and the chance that Trump and his cronies will be ousted from power. All his adult life people have recognised Cusack, and tapped him on the shoulder, and said: I loved you in Say Anything (or High Fidelity, or Con Air). Sometimes a certain type of man, wary of looking soft, will insist it’s his wife who loves Cusack. Back in 2003, Cusack was at a boxing match in Las Vegas when he got one of these taps on the shoulder. “Hey, John,” said Donald Trump. “My wife loves you.” Cusack claims he shivered in revulsion even then.  When our interview is over he will be back online, barracking Trump, expressing his fury and his contempt. Before he goes I suggest to Cusack, gently as I can, that Twitter does not always look the healthiest place for him. “I would love to think about other things,” he agrees. “Poetry. Love. Anything else. But that’s just not the times we’re in. And, y’know, not all anger is just sort of somebody stuck in some rut in a basement. If you can’t be outraged on behalf of other people, or express anger at injustice, maybe that is its own rut. Sure, I might go too far sometimes. But I really just want to get across the message: that we’re sleepwalking into an incredibly dark possible future.” Cusack rubs his tired eyes. He drinks from his big tin tankard of coffee. Who knows, he says? “Maybe being outspoken hurts your career… I’m just aware it helps me sleep better at night, knowing that I wasn’t passive during this time.”  Utopia is streaming now exclusively on Amazon Prime Video"
"Joaquin Phoenix, who won an Oscar this year for his role in the film Joker, has reportedly welcomed his first child with fiancee Rooney Mara. They named the baby boy after Phoenix’s late brother, River, who died in 1993. The director Victor Kossakovsky revealed the news at the 2020 Zurich film festival after a screening of the black-and-white documentary Gunda. Joaquin was an executive producer on the film. Asking about Phoenix’s involvement in the film, Kossakovsky said: “He just got a baby by the way … A beautiful son called River.” River Phoenix, the star of films such as Stand By Me and My Own Private Idaho, died of an accidental drug overdose aged 23. Speaking recently to Anderson Cooper on the TV programme 60 Minutes, Joaquin Phoenix reflected on his bond with his brother and how media attention after his death affected their family.“River was a really substantial actor and movie star, and we didn’t really know it,” he said. “So during that time in which you’re most vulnerable, there are helicopters flying over. There are people that are trying to sneak on to your land. Certainly, for me, it felt like it impeded on the mourning process.” Phoenix and Mara co-starred in the films Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot and Mary Magdalene. They are prominent campaigners for animal rights, with Phoenix devoting much of his awards acceptance speeches to advocating for a vegan lifestyle. Two days after his Oscar win, Phoenix rescued a cow and a calf from an abbatoir. In July, a hostage siege in Ukraine ended after the president ceded to kidnappers’ demands to urge people to watch Earthlings, a 2005 eco-themed film narrated by Phoenix."
"How’s this for an official plot synopsis? “Hope and Crosby have to flee Melbourne in order to avoid two marriage proposals, and find themselves in Bali, where they find themselves vying for the attention of the princess and are targeted by thieves.” Well, those were the days, all right. Middle-aged white men literally fleeing the country because women wanted to marry them, only to find themselves lusting after an exotic princess. Road to Bali is the penultimate entry of the seven “Road to … ” films starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Not for nothing that the synopsis refers to them simply as Hope and Crosby rather than by their character names – which is something this film franchise surely encouraged, as the actors had different character names in each entry. Road to Bali is not the highest regarded of the series; that’s probably Road to Morocco, which even earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. But due to a copyright renewal snafu, Road to Bali entered public domain in 1980. So, it is technically the most “accessible” of the films in that multiple cheap DVDs and online prints exist, and you can appreciate it without having seen the other entries. There’s plenty of quarantine streaming fun to be had, traveling with this bickering pair of goofs as they make their way from Melbourne to Bali, and despite being a 1952 comedy, shot on studio backlots with what looks like stock photography establishing shots, there’s still a vicarious travel itch to be scratched given our current predicament. As the synopsis suggests, plot is nothing more than an excuse to create a string of humorous set pieces featuring visual gags, snappy one-liners and lively song-and-dance numbers. What the synopsis withholds is that the film also involves deep sea diving with giant squid, lovesick gorillas in mourning and head-shrinking cannibals. Happy trails! A remarkable quality of the Road to … series is they have so much fun acknowledging the artifice of film-making. The repeated breaking of the fourth wall addresses everything from the film’s silly structure to the actors’ real-life personas to Paramount, the studio releasing the film, in a way that suggests a curious place between highbrow self-reflexivity and lowbrow shoddiness. Sure, it all feels born out of vaudeville more than Brecht, but that’s not to say there isn’t something modernist about intercutting a clip of Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen, or having Hope’s character awake from unconsciousness and ask: “What happened? Is the picture over?” Alas, there are some icky matters – both on screen and off screen – to contend with in order to watch Road to Bali in modern day. Several of the supporting actors here would be excommunicated if they tried to wear these costumes on Halloween, and the gender politics are definitely a product of their time. There’s also the behind-the-scenes injustice for the film’s third lead, Dorothy Lamour. Despite her role in the success of the previous five films and her significant screen time in this film, Lamour worked for salary while Hope and Crosby enjoyed cuts of the profits. That wasn’t enough, though, when the gang reunited for the last time on Road to Hong Kong, Lamour was replaced by the younger Joan Collins. Which is all a shame because Lamour’s comic timing and athletic dance moves are a key reason these films work as well as they do. Credit is also due to Crosby’s frequent collaborators – the music and lyrics duo of Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke – who contribute everything from toe tappers to swooning ballads here. But like any buddy comedy, it ultimately comes down to the on-screen chemistry between the buddies. Hope and Crosby are a match made in Hollywood heaven. Watching Road to Bali – and other titles in the series – you can see how much they prefigure the high-concept buddy comedies of Coming to America or Wedding Crashers several decades later. Reports differ on how much was scripted and how much was ad-libbed, but the resulting repartee feels akin to both tightly scripted screwball comedy and the loose freewheeling improvisation of The Trip. As much as there’s an ongoing rat-a-tat-tat competition between the two characters, there’s a sweetness to their relationship, which one can imagine is as true of the performers as it is the characters. At a moment late in the film when things are looking grim, the two console each other: “At least we’re going out together.” The moment is surprisingly wistful, and not entirely played for humor. Of course, this is just for a beat. Then, it’s swiftly back to madcap pratfalls and wordplay, but not before they’re given one more reflection: “We’ve had a lot of laughs.”"
"French-Algerian film-maker Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche sends us a dispatch from a civil war with Terminal Sud, an intriguing, somewhat abstract drama about a country descending into chaos. The facts on the ground here seem to tally with the Algerian civil war of the 90s, the so called “black decade” that claimed more than 100,000 lives. But the film was mostly shot in southern France, and Ameur-Zaïmeche doesn’t hide contemporary details such as mobiles and new-model SUVs. He has said in interviews that the point is to make it universal: this could happen any time, anywhere. The approach isn’t entirely convincing, and the unfocused sense of time and place is a bit distracting and frustrating at times. But there is real power to many of the scenes. The film is told in fragments as an oppressive government strengthens its grip. It opens with a minibus stopped at a military checkpoint, the passengers held up and robbed. By soldiers or a rebel group disguised in army uniforms? Who knows. The city is a wild west. Men in balaclavas drive around in unmarked vans gunning down journalists and dragging suspects off the streets. The camera’s attention is often drawn unexpectedly away from the main event. When a man is tortured in a military prison, Ameur-Zaïmeche spends as much time watching the torturer limber up – psyching himself up like an athlete – as he does on the interrogation. Holding all these moments together is a deeply charismatic, towering performance by French comedian Ramzy Bedia. There are other doctors in the rundown hospital where he works, but he is the Doctor, a great slab of man built like a farmer, gentle and tender with his patients. He tells everyone that he is neutral but then death threats arrive. The film gathers in force the more time he is in front of the camera."
"“You’re mine until you get married,” says Bill Murray’s instantly recognisable voice in the opening of this bittersweet tale of fathers and daughters, husbands and wives. “Then you’re still mine.” It’s a refrain that echoes throughout writer-director Sofia Coppola’s very enjoyable (and deceptively deep) seventh feature, a film that knowingly lifts riffs from screwball capers and melancholy romcoms alike, writing love letters to the city of New York as it swirls from one upmarket fairytale locale to the next. Rashida Jones is Laura, a thirtysomething writer struggling to juggle creativity and childcare, who comes to doubt the fidelity of her husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans). A preponderance of business trips and an unexpectedly abridged nocturnal encounter make Laura wonder whether Dean’s thoughts are elsewhere. But it’s her perennial playboy father, Felix (Murray), who really sets alarm bells ringing, telling his daughter that all men are the same (ie they’re all like him) and gleefully insisting that they take joint action to uncover Dean’s potential duplicitousness. What follows is a whimsically comedic adventure in which Felix and Laura pursue Dean around the city (and even to Mexico), while swapping sassy Nora Ephron-style observations about the differences between men and women, with an added generation-gap edge, like Father of the Bride crossed with When Harry Met Sally. Having earned an Oscar nomination for his lead role in Coppola’s 2003 hit Lost in Translation, Murray is once again on deliciously deadpan form as the ageing lothario who has spent his life chasing women, yet longs to be loved by the daughter he idolises. For Felix, the suggestion that Laura’s marriage may indeed be on the rocks is a perverse form of wish-fulfilment, offering an excuse for him to step into the fray, imparting outdated lessons about life and love and while grandstanding as a sleuth-cum-spy, a role he’s clearly enjoying too much. Jones (who coincidentally played a dejected bride being offered fatherly advice in Coppola’s 2015 Netflix production A Very Murray Christmas) is brilliant as the writer blocked by the pressures of parenthood, whose anxieties about her husband reflect deeper worries about her own worth – her life, her talent, her achievements. That these worries should be rooted in (and fed by) a lifetime of Felix’s philandering is something Coppola’s script explores with a deceptive lightness of touch. Scenes of Dad charming traffic cops while Laura rolls her eyes are great fun (“It must be very nice to be you”), but more telling is her embarrassment when he comes on to the waitress or, worse, to one of her daughter’s ballet teachers. When Felix casually declares that he’s become deaf to the sound of women’s voices (“it’s the pitch”), Coppola cuts to the heart of the matter, forcing Laura to finally stand her ground and to remind him that “you have daughters and granddaughters, so you’d better start figuring out how to hear them”. Lovingly shot by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, who worked on Coppola’s dreamy-looking remake of The Beguiled, On the Rocks is very easy on the eye, with bangles, bracelets and watches used to illustrate an underlying theme of ownership as we flit from Raoul’s bistro in SoHo to Midtown’s 21 Club, taking in the table where Bogie proposed to Bacall. Jenny Slate makes the most of a recurrent (and very funny) psychobabbling cameo, while on the soundtrack, the dusty tones of Chet Baker spar with the French electropop of Phoenix, embodying the film’s blend of dewy nostalgia and clear-eyed modernity. On the Rocks is in cinemas now and from 23 October on Apple TV+"
"The events explored in this electrifying courtroom drama – the trial of a high-profile group of defendants on charges relating to anti-Vietnam protests during the 1968 Democratic national convention – unfolded more than half a century ago. But there’s a stinging currency here that cuts through the wafting patchouli and tie dye and makes for a forcefully contemporary and relevant piece of film-making. This is partly because of a particularly satisfying marriage between the subject matter and the showy talents of the film’s writer and director, Aaron Sorkin. Unapologetically partisan in his politics, Sorkin the writer is in his element dealing with material with a message and an articulate ensemble cast with which to deliver it. And as a director, he sheds the needy pyrotechnics that rather detracted from his directorial debut, Molly’s Game, leaning instead on the crisp editing skills of Alan Baumgarten and superb work across the board from his cast. Of the latter, Mark Rylance is on cracking, abrasive form as defence attorney William Kunstler and, playing Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman, Sacha Baron Cohen aces a rare dramatic role. But mainly, the film feels timely because it is timely. It unfolds on the frontline of a culture war that rages still. For a country that places such value on freedom of speech, America had, and still has, a prickly relationship with dissent. The trial, as Hoffman is at pains to point out, is politically motivated. It’s a flex on the part of attorney general John Mitchell (John Doman), partly intended to kick out the foundations of the countercultural movement by jailing its figureheads. And partly it’s Mitchell’s sniping retort to a perceived slight by his predecessor, Ramsey Clark (Michael Keaton).By lumping all the defendants together, the case reveals the schisms between them, tensions that Sorkin teases out with wit and relish. Clean-cut idealist Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne) has little time for the stoner stunts of Hoffman and Yippie co-defendant Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong). Radical pacifist David Dellinger (John Carroll Lynch) is “literally a boy scout leader”. John Froines and Lee Weiner have no idea why they are being charged, but in the “Academy awards of protest, it’s an honour just to be nominated”. But it’s the treatment of the eighth man on trial, Black Panther Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), that gives the film its sobering gravity. Seale’s case is eventually declared a mistrial, but not before he is subjected to racism and humiliation at the behest of the judge. A harrowing scene in which Seale is shackled and gagged is both shocking and sickeningly familiar. This is a film that examines both the past and the present day; that plots a path on the common ground between them."
"Walt Disney announced it was laying off 28,000 employees from its theme park business on Tuesday, the latest company to announce huge jobs cuts in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The entertainment company blamed limited attendance at the theme parks it has reopened and the continuing closure of others for the “difficult decision”. “As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy,” Josh D’Amaro, head of parks at Disney, wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC. “For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We’ve cut expenses, suspended capital projects, furloughed our cast members while still paying benefits, and modified our operations to run as efficiently as possible, however, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity.” Disney’s theme parks in Florida, Paris, Shanghai, Japan and Hong Kong have been reopened with limited capacity but both its parks in California remain closed as Orange county, home to Disneyland, struggles to meet local health metrics for reopening. The majority of the positions Disney is cutting are part-time. “As heartbreaking as it is to take this action, this is the only feasible option we have in light of the prolonged impact of Covid-19 on our business,” wrote D’Amaro. Disney lost $4.72bn in the three months ended on 27 June, its first quarterly loss in nearly two decades. The reopening of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has also proved disappointing as Covid-19 cases surge in the state. The news follows announcements of other large layoffs from US corporations hit by the pandemic. United Airlines and American Airlines plan to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months as passengers avoid flying. Last week Ralph Lauren announced it was planning to cut 15% of its 24,900 global workforce. On Friday the US labor department will release its latest monthly jobs report. The US is expected to have gained about 850,000 jobs in September, the fifth straight monthly gain. But the rate of recovery appears to be slowing and only about half the jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered."
"The next James Bond thriller, No Time to Die, has been delayed yet again as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The 25th instalment of the spy franchise was originally scheduled to open in April 2020 but when cinemas shuttered, it was pushed back to November. With the box office still not back to normal, the film has been pushed to 2 April 2021. This weekend is currently occupied by Fast & Furious 9 which was also delayed from a 2020 release. “We understand the delay will be disappointing to our fans but we now look forward to sharing No Time To Die next year,” a statement from MGM, Universal and the Bond producers, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, read. No Time to Die is set to be Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007 and will see him up against the Oscar-winner Rami Malek as the villain with returning cast members Naomie Harris, Léa Seydoux and Christoph Waltz. The news follows other tentpole films also moving off their dates after disappointing returns for Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, which has reached over $280m internationally but only $41m in the US, where cinemas in the three main markets – New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco – remain shuttered. A week after Tenet’s release, Warner chose to push Wonder Woman 1984 from October to Christmas (it was originally intended for a summer bow), an early sign of things to come. Soon after, Disney followed up with a long list of changes: Black Widow was pushed from its new November date to next summer with fellow Marvel adventures The Eternals and Shang-Chi also following, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story was moved back an entire year to next Christmas and Kenneth Branagh’s Death on the Nile was edged back by two months. This week also saw Warner announce that Robert Zemeckis’s remake of The Witches, starring Anne Hathaway, would be premiering on HBO Max in the US, the latest of many digital bows for films originally intended for the big screen."
"The Ghostbusters and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids star Rick Moranis has been the victim of a street attack in New York City. Footage shows the 67-year-old actor assaulted by an unknown assailant on Thursday morning while walking near his apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The NYPD have referred to the attack as “random” and “unprovoked”. Moranis then went to hospital for an evaluation, suffering pain in his head, back and hip, according to the NYPD. He then reported the attack. “He is fine but grateful for everyone’s thoughts and well wishes” a representative for Moranis said in a statement. Police are now searching for the suspect who fled the scene. The actor’s Hollywood peers have shared their support on Twitter, including Marvel star Chris Evans who wrote: “My blood is boiling. Find this man. You don’t touch Rick Moranis.” Writer-director Judd Apatow also tweeted: “This the worst news of the last two days … This is why Rick Moranis avoided our country for decades. I guess he was right all along. We don’t deserve him.” Moranis, who was a mainstay of 80s and 90s comedies, had been largely absent from the big screen after focusing his time on being a single father after the death of his first wife. His last notable film role was in 1997’s Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. In 2006 he was nominated for the best comedy album Grammy for The Agoraphobic Cowboy. Recently, he had signed on for a Disney+ sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids alongside Josh Gad and appeared in an ad for a mobile phone company with fellow Canadian Ryan Reynolds."
"Not now, haunted house horrors! Never has the prospect of watching a movie about being confined to your home and beset by unseen terrors seemed less like escapism. We’ll soon see if the pandemic has sharpened our appetite for haunted house movies or put us right off them, as they seem to be the theme of this Halloween – and almost all of them centre on women. That’s not such a surprise, really. Unlike so many areas, ghost stories and houses of horror have been almost a haven for women, on the page and on screen. You could reason that the domestic realm was seen as a female space, and the natural receptacle for female writers’ explorations of things repressed and unspeakable. Some critics have ventured that female authors identified with ghosts – invisible figures struggling to exert an influence on reality. Fittingly, their works refuse to die. Exhibit A would be the ever-adaptable Daphne du Maurier, and Netflix’s lavish new version of her 1938 classic Rebecca, the tale of a naive young newlywed haunted by her predecessor when she moves into her husband’s imposing ancestral home. Director Ben Wheatley has his work cut out following in Alfred Hitchcock’s footsteps, although his and Jane Goldman’s adaptation is working from the original text (Hitch made some softening alterations), and the prospect of Kristin Scott Thomas as the icy housekeeper Mrs Danvers is just irresistible. Then we get to Shirley Jackson, who gave us one of the most terrifying entries in the genre: The Haunting of Hill House (again, the story concerns alienated women shackled to their home), which became one of the most terrifying movies, Robert Wise’s The Haunting (Netflix’s 2018 spin-off series is also pretty good). Josephine Decker’s disorienting new movie Shirley (led by Elisabeth Moss on top form) finds some sort of parallel in Jackson’s own strange domestic setup, as the disturbed, depressive novelist and her creepy husband play twisted psychosexual games with the couple who lodge with them. In recent movies we have already been seeing a new strain of hauntings, connected to more contemporary anxieties. New Australian horror Relic, for example, gathers three generations of women in a creaky old house where nothing is stable, especially the floorplan. But the spectre haunting them could be seen as dementia, which is claiming grandma and, by extension, coming for her descendants. It is of a piece with recent classics such as The Babadook and Hereditary, where the sources of the terror are not so much in the past as the present, or even the future. Who knows if or how Covid will find its way into this eerie realm, but it is already making life resemble a haunted house horror a lot more. "
"Coverage of Cineworld’s decision to temporarily close all of its UK cinemas has, understandably, focused on the impact on employees and potential longer-term consequences for the medium. But the immediate future for Bollywood in the UK now looks particularly bleak, given that Cineworld venues host more than half of all Bollywood screenings in the UK, presenting between 40 and 50 different films a year. The prospect of reduced takings in the UK is being felt in Mumbai, where the industry relies on the territory for a sizeable chunk of its overseas revenue. “Cineworld has played an important part in bringing Indian films to the UK,” says Vikram Malhotra, CEO of production company Abundantia Entertainment, whose films include Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Shakuntala Devi. “Most Indian films have released via Cineworld. It’s an unprecedented situation and revenues from overseas markets will surely be impacted as Cineworld goes non-operational. “With the Indian cinema industry just starting to return to theatrical releases, and considering the importance of the UK market for overseas business, the loss of Cineworld will be felt widely across the industry.” Twenty years ago, Bollywood distribution in the UK was very much on the fly. If you wanted to catch the latest film, you had to find a grainy copy in one of the video shops tucked between the halal butchers and vegetable markets in the country’s bigger cities. That all changed in the late 90s with the rise of the multiplex, which enabled cinemas to broaden their horizons beyond mainstream Hollywood fare and explore fresh ways of luring in new audiences. Cineworld was still in its infancy, with only 14 venues, when it was approached by two Bollywood production companies about showing their films. It was very much an experiment for the brand, but with many of its cinemas located in mutlicultural areas, it had a ready-made market on the doorstep. And with up to 20 screens available, a venue could easily afford to spare a screen on a quiet midweek evening. The move came during a heyday for big-budget Bollywood blockbusters made for the big screen, when stars such as Shah Rukh Khan were in their ascendency and their films created the same buzz among Bollywood fans as a new Marvel adventure. “Back then, no Bollywood films were being released in the UK, so we took a chance and started playing the films at two locations,” says Stuart Crane, head of film programming at Cineworld. “We put the shows into screens of 150 seats to test the waters, but it soon became clear this was an audience that had been underrepresented for far too long. We would have weekends where our top three films in these cinemas were all Bollywood films, and would be making considerably more than most of the Hollywood product. “I think at the moment most Bollywood companies are struggling to get films made and released in general. Even when we re-opened in July we couldn’t get hold of any of the back catalogue films as the majority of the companies had employees on furlough, or were just simply closed down.” The UK diaspora became an unexpected goldmine for Cineworld and in the early 2000s, Bollywood films accounted for 20% of Cineworld’s screens. Its venues in Feltham and Ilford were the top two cinemas in Europe for Bollywood titles and Cineworld began to hold star-studded premieres. Soon, Bollywood films were creeping up the box office top 10, snapping on the heels of Hollywood blockbusters. At its peak, In 2010, My Name is Khan played in more than a third of Cineworld’s screens in its opening weekend, taking £2.6m at the UK box office “It’s the sort of numbers you would expect from a Marvel movie,” says Crane. “Even now, especially during Eid and Diwali, you can have a big Bollywood film go up against almost any Hollywood film and we’d be putting the Bollywood film in the bigger screens.” With several highly anticipated recent releases bypassing the cinema and going straight to streaming services, including Gulabo Sitabo starring Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan, many in the industry fear that Bollywood will struggle to regain the overseas foothold of its pre-Covid days. Asim Abbasi’s film Cake looked to the chain for more than half its UK exhibition. “I don’t think other cinemas provide a strong enough alternative so it will definitely be impacting Bollywood films outright and when you factor in the pandemic, it becomes a very difficult proposition to release a film with the fees and marketing costs in the UK.”"
"“To save a soul, that’s quite something.” So says Maud, the newly God-fearing subject of Rose Glass’s electrifying debut feature, which establishes the writer-director as a thrilling new talent in British cinema. Charting a razor-sharp course between the borders of horror, satire, psychodrama and lonely character study (Taxi Driver has been cited as an influence), Saint Maud is a taut, sinewy treat, blessed with an impressively fluid visual sensibility and boosted by two quite brilliant central performances. Morfydd Clark, who demonstrated such perfect comic timing in Armando Iannucci’s The Personal History of David Copperfield, is astonishing as the titular private carer nursing Jennifer Ehle’s Amanda, a once-celebrated dancer now facing the spectre of death. Maud’s duties are primarily physical: cooking, cleaning, administering medication and basic physiotherapy. But having recently started talking to God (shades of Emily Watson’s Bess McNeill from Breaking the Waves), Maud is convinced that she has been sent to Amanda with a purpose – to save her from herself. There’s a touch of Shirley Jackson about the Edwardian gothic hilltop house in which Amanda broods away her days, incarcerated yet still holding court. When she calls Maud her “saviour”, it’s hard to tell whether wonder or contempt lurk behind Ehle’s enigmatically wry smile. Yet Maud, who is haunted by flashbacks, is not as innocent as she first seems. Behind the prim exterior lies a fiery passion that is desperately searching for a purpose, a purpose she thinks she has found in nun-like mortifications of the flesh and in seizures that recall the ecstatic raptures of Saint Teresa of Ávila. In the US, where A24 has theatrical distribution rights, Saint Maud has been trailed as “from the studio that brought you The Witch, Hereditary and Midsommar”. Yet this British production is actually closer in tone to such German offerings as Hans-Christian Schmid’s 2006 masterpiece Requiem (inspired by the tragic real-life case of Anneliese Michel), or Dietrich Brüggemann’s Stations of the Cross (2014) in which spiritual sacrifice mingles with self-harm. Like those films, Saint Maud has at its centre a troubled young woman who comes to believe that God (or maybe the devil?) is working through her, a possibility that crucially is not disavowed. Instead, Glass concentrates on how that belief comes to manifest itself, on the isolation of a character out of step with the rest of the world and for whom the anarchically religious illustrations of William Blake strike a rebellious chord. None of which is to suggest that Saint Maud isn’t scary – it is! I’ve seen it three times and on each viewing I have found myself physically startled by beautifully orchestrated key moments, although crucially it has been an entirely different moment (a fleetingly contorted face here, an unexpectedly guttural voice there) that has caused that reaction each time. So subtly does Glass negotiate the shifts between intimate kitchen-sink pathos and shrieking supernatural surrealism, often within the space of a single scene, that Saint Maud seems to takes on a shape-shifting quality as it slips between the inner and outer realms of Maud’s experience. Plaudits to cinematographer Ben Fordesman (who cites Persona and Repulsion as visual references) and production designer Paulina Rzeszowska for conjuring the strangely timeless shadowy netherworld in which Maud and Amanda conduct their danse macabre, and to composer Adam Janota Bzowski, whose eerily prowling score weaves in and out of Paul Davies’s affecting sound designs. Great, too, to see physical effects (including a sly prosthetic nod to John Carpenter’s The Thing) blended with unobtrusive computer graphics to bring us into the spiralling whirlpool of Maud’s world, a world that will haunt you long after the credits have rolled."
"The English actress Samantha Morton, star of the hit television series Harlots and The Walking Dead, has publicly apologised for threatening the life of a young girl with a knife when she was 14. Morton, 43, said she wanted to “set the record straight a little bit” on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. The Oscar-nominated star was “incredibly sorry” about the incident, which led to her being charged with attempted murder and spending three days in solitary confinement in an adult cell block. She was convicted of threats to kill after she had confronted an older girl who had been bullying at the care home where they both lived. “I was mortified,” she said. “And I’m sorry to her. We were all abused. She was a child herself. Nobody looked after us properly. We were rioting in that home because they were locking the fridges at night. We were not safe.” One night on returning to the care home from a rave at which she had taken drugs, Morton saw a nine-year-old boy who she believed had been “pimped” by the bully. “I snapped and said I was going to kill her,” Morton said. “I didn’t harm her, I didn’t touch her, but I said those words. And I regret it and I am sorry.” Moved between care homes and foster families in Nottinghamshire, she also recalled her own attempt to put a stop to abuse. On a visit to her mother, who had suffered mental illness, she revealed she had been abused by a carer. The police were involved, but Morton, who was moved away to another care home, believes the two members of staff accused were merely demoted. She said she now feels “absolute forgiveness” and thinks many of those working in the care system in the 1980s were admirable, with only some abusing their positions of power. Expelled from school three times, Morton discovered her acting skills when a sympathetic teacher encourage her to audition for a drama workshop run by Central TV. It led to a role as a runaway in the television series Peak Practice. Morton has been acclaimed since then for a body of work that includes a key role in the film Minority Report and her own award-winning directorial debut, The Unloved, based on her time in care. She earned Oscar nominations for Woody Allen’s 1999 Sweet and Lowdown and for road drama In America in 2003, but reveals this high-profile recognition meant little when she was young, although it opened doors for her in the industry. She has come to consider awards ceremonies to be commercially debased, she admits. “These things are so branded now that it takes it away from the individuals. Nowadays you can’t get an Oscar without running a campaign. Back then it was more on merit, I suppose.” "
"The infamous 1978 exploitation-revenge flick I Spit on Your Grave – one-time “video nasty” and chosen by critic Roger Ebert as his all-time worst film – now gets a lengthy retrospective and reappraisal here courtesy of its director Meir Zarchi’s son, Terry. Perhaps the current febrile atmosphere – split between rampant online misogyny and strident #MeToo calls – is the right moment. Zarchi Sr is nonplussed in being asked to justify the 30 minutes of gang rape; he describes his film, with its second-half procession of wince-making retribution slayings, as simply “biblical – an eye for an eye”. Whether Terry Zarchi is persistent, or sophisticated enough, in questioning that belief is another thing. The director and cast were upset when, after struggling to sell the film, distributor Jerry Gross changed its title from Day of the Woman and sexed up the new poster (with Demi Moore, rather than actor Camille Keaton, supposedly providing the image). Which makes you wonder what kind of film they thought they were making. This is not high art, even if the sheer crudeness of staging and performance is what gives the film its brutish glow, and inflamed its critics. Zarchi Jr, though, has an unfortunate tendency to treat it like Tarkovsky. Detailing every nook and cranny of the production, the documentary is longer than the original film. Terry Zarchi may be right in drawing attention to the fact that such female-revenge narratives were unusual at the time, running counter to the reality that rape was often not taken seriously by the authorities – including the incident that Zarchi Sr says inspired him to to make the film, when, in the early 70s, he rescued a girl who staggered out of a New York park after being sexually assaulted. Now they are a familiar trope, from Kill Bill to Coralie Fargeat’s Revenge. Whether or not these films constitute feminism is a debate still raging. Zarchi Jr doesn’t fully prise open the discussion, leaving it to a panel of viewers – fans and detractors – to cast their ballots. (His attempt at impartiality is undermined by the family love-in tone he increasingly adopts, including towards Keaton for whom his father left his mother.) The rape survivor who is vociferously pro-Spit probably gets the deciding vote. "
"‘Have you ever had someone tell your story, take your voice … and replace your face until no one else can see or hear you?” These are the powerful words that Nigerian actor/director Genevieve Nnaji speaks to introduce the Netflix initiative Made By Africa, Watched By the World. Mixing new, original content with older African classics that have not previously been streamed elsewhere, this initiative, much like Strong Black Lead (2018), aims to showcase content that centres black stories but – unlike Strong Black Lead – it will be by and about Africans. It creates a path for stories that specifically address different slices of the African experience to see the light of day and reach a wider audience. Considering that there’s a growing feeling among Africans that inaccurate representation on screen is a given, that’s a good thing for everyone. So what does Made By Africa, Watched By the World give us? Netflix has purchased previously produced content and also produced its own, both TV shows and films. Kagiso Lediga and Pearl Thusi have followed up their 2018 romantic drama Catching Feelings with a TV show, Queen Sono, about an undercover spy, that premiered earlier this year. Nick Mutuma’s coming of age drama, Sincerely Daisy, is having its highly anticipated premiere on Friday, while other Kenyan films – Tosh Gitonga’s romcom Disconnect and Tom Whitworth’s Poacher – have also found a home on Netflix. Whatever you may think of the streaming platform, for African film-makers such as myself, Netflix is a lifeline. Here in Nairobi, one of the many problems film-makers face is the lack of active film distributors. After a film is made there is no way to market it or get it into cinemas, unless you go massively out of pocket. It is pretty much the same throughout the sub-Saharan continent – with the exception of Nigeria, which had a distribution boom in the early 2000s via videotapes and video compact discs, and South Africa, which has a far more modernised system with major distributors such as Ster-Kinekor and United International Pictures. Both have major limitations: these distributors essentially act as local representatives of major Hollywood studios and don’t market locally made films outside the country, and while Nigerian films did cross their borders, piracy meant they were greatly hampered. The wider reality is that Africanness in cinema has become an identity to play with. Hollywood tends to treat Africa as a homogenous location with unspecified cultures and accents. While we Africans can admire Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s Black Is King or Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther, the wall-to-wall fan adulation in the west doesn’t tell the full story. African audiences know these films get accents wrong and don’t accurately portray their traditions and cultures. For the most part, these stories are targeted at the black American experience, and to amplify their nuances and concerns. The black American experience may overlap with what African audiences consider relatable, but for the most part the social and especially political concerns do not entirely mesh. Netflix has other problems, too. It is a vast sea of content where films without big-name casts and directors may end up being lost in the mix. Lulu Wang said it best: “[The streamers] are building their brand, and when you are an established film-maker, you are a brand that they want to partner with to help build their own brand. But with newer film-makers, newer voices, you don’t have a brand.” Netflix is attempting to break its own logjam, but if it doesn’t back these African film-makers with the marketing they need, they will still struggle to find a wider audience."
"Unlike many actors, Peter Sarsgaard got some work during lockdown: an 11-minute short, shot by his wife, Maggie Gyllenhaal, on their rural estate in Vermont. Penelope, now on Netflix, is the strange, moving story of a widowed farmer, facing a sad future, broken only by a delirious evening humping a tree. “I’m never going to look at that tree in the same way again, and I don’t think that tree will ever look at me in the same way again,” says Sarsgaard. He’s on lockdown again with his family, this time in Greece, where they are shooting Gyllenhaal’s directing debut proper, an adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter. “That was the first thing Maggie told me about Penelope. She said: ‘I want you making love to a tree.’ And I was like” – a resigned sigh – “Oh, whatever. I’ll do it!” A dendrophiliac farmer is one of Sarsgaard’s less unusual roles. It is 25 years since he made his movie debut, as Sean Penn’s murder victim in Dead Man Walking. (Penn, “an inclusive, gentle guy”, took him out for dinner to apologise.) Since then, his signature role has been something sinister, or at least unsettling, making use of his purring voice and ever-narrowing eyes. He was an amiable sociopath in Boys Don’t Cry, the mad patricidal scientist in Green Lantern. When he first on Zoom he suddenly looms, darkly lit with a ginormous fuzzy beard, sitting against the rails of a cheap-looking bedhead; a creepy Rip Van Winkle stuck in a low-budget Airbnb. But any whiff of evil is soon dispelled by a big, affable smile. Are people often scared off by his CV?  “People like it! People like the bad guy. Because these are all thoughts and feelings that people have inside of them. Look at what gets the ratings just in terms of the news: people are interested in murder, they’re interested in disaster. This is some part of human nature, and it might be a distasteful one, but it doesn’t really help to ignore it.” That said, he does insist: “I do have a limit. I have turned things down that I thought were awful without any … you know.” Sarsgaard’s character in his latest movie, Veena Sud’s twisty, scary The Lie, is somewhere along the way on the Awful Spectrum. Without giving anything away, he plays Jay, an errant father who has difficult relationships with his ex-wife (Mireille Enos) and his teenage daughter Kayla (Joey King); when Kayla does something awful, the trio’s routine dysfunctionality becomes something properly horrific. Reflecting on Jay, Sarsgaard is mostly appalled at how irresponsible and ill-informed he is as a dad. “I’m a different kind of parent,” he says, “of the suffocating variety.” He knows his children (Ramona, 14, and eight-year-old Gloria) much better than that, he tuts. Parenting is, he says, “really what I’ve always wanted to do – more than acting or any of the other things I do in my life. I enjoy it. I teach my kids music every day” – oboe for Ramona, violin for Gloria. They’re a close family: the last time he shaved a beard off, Ramona kept the trimmings in a pouch for two years before “she realised it was disgusting”. He’s cut back on micromanaging, he says. “I mean, I just read Anna Karenina, and I have two children around me! So I’d say that’s a good sign.” Parts of Sarsgaard, 49, could suggest a certain luvvie self-sufficiency: the arty short films, the beard, the reading Tolstoy in Vermont soundtracked by his daughter’s oboe. He and Gyllenhaal, who married in 2009, also own a brownstone in Brooklyn, showcased in Architectural Digest last year. And yet he also seems bright, generous and self-aware. The son of an air force engineer from Illinois, he moved home more than 10 times before college. He did a play just once at school, aged 10, believing instead that he would play soccer until a succession of concussions literally knocked that on the head. “I wasn’t part of the culture of acting,” he shrugs. “I wasn’t a group person – I’m an only child. So I wasn’t at first interested in the community of theatre.” Did that swiftly change? “Over time,” he settles. “I’ll say this: if there’s some value in me being in the group, I will.” Otherwise? “If the script says that I play a loner guy that comes to town, then I will happily be that guy.” Which may or may not bring us to Sarsgaard’s bat house: a garden sanctuary for as many as 200 bats, much needed in New England, where they are now threatened. “We need bats,” cries Sarsgaard. “We need bats!” Another tragedy of the pandemic is the tainting of their reputation, he thinks. “There are things you shouldn’t do to animals,” he chides, “like maybe eat them raw, or sell them, hang out with them in close proximity. But without bats, the world is gonna really suck.”"
"The cinema of Korean director Hong Sang-soo is seductively low-key and lo-fi, and his latest is a movie-novella in three encounters. It’s so downbeat, so matter-of-fact, that the registers and nuances are almost beneath the radar of what generally constitutes filmic effect. This really is just people talking, and though they sometimes raise their voices, get angry, embarrassed, or upset, a keynote of polite calm soon reasserts itself. Hong’s camera sedately records each exchange from an undramatic distance, sometimes zooming in for something closer midway through the conversation, but not for any pointed reason. Watching this film means recalibrating your expectations so you can gauge the subtleties and absorb the sotto voce implications about relationships and sexual politics. Pretty much all the way through, nothing very sensational seems to be happening. And yet the movie’s sensational meaning is hiding in plain sight: in the title.Gam-hee is a young woman in Seoul who is a florist by trade, though no great importance is attached to that. She is played by Kim Min-hee, the director’s partner and longtime collaborator, who has acted in seven of his last eight films – but is probably best-known for starring in Park Chan-wook’s 2016 film The Handmaiden, based on Sarah Waters’s novel Fingersmith. Gam-hee has been married for five years, during which time, we learn, she has never been apart from her husband for even a single day. She is at some pains to tell people that she has been fine with this. She says things like: “We manage to have good moments every day”; and “I feel a little love every day and that’s enough.” But now her husband has gone off on a business trip so she is going around visiting some old friends, which evidently hadn’t been possible before. Gam-hee encounters three women in three sections. Young-soon (Seo Young-hwa) is a gentle, sweet-natured and slightly dowdy woman who is now divorced and lives in the countryside outside Seoul raising chickens: the woman next door, to whom the title may or may not allude, has run away, leaving a distraught daughter roaming disturbingly around like a ghost. Next is Su-young (Song Seon-mi), a pilates instructor in the city: she has a crush on a neighbour, but is also being stalked by a young poet, with whom she had a rash one-night-stand. Thirdly, there is Woo-jin (Kim Sae-byuk), who is imagined to be the manager of Seoul’s (real-life) Emu cinema and arts centre. She is a slightly spiky character.The first two encounters are planned but this third meeting, in the cinema’s cafe, is very much accidental: Gam-hee tells Woo-jin that she is here to see a film, but this is clearly a fib. In each case, the female conversation is interrupted, or disrupted, by a man. Young-soon’s neighbour pompously asks her to stop feeding stray cats because his wife has a fear of cats and so can’t leave their apartment. But could this woman’s agoraphobia be connected with her overbearing husband, not the cats? Su-young’s former lover rings on the doorbell and harangues her while she’s trying to tell Gam-hee all about her agreeable flirtation with an older, distinguished man. And after talking to Woo-jin at the arts centre cafe, Gam-hee has a very tense but revealing conversation with a famous novelist and TV personality who is there to give a sold-out reading: Gam-hee was dating this man before she got married.When Gam-hee finally meets her old lover, she can’t help giving him a shrill piece of advice: when he’s on TV, which is a lot, he talks too much. Gam-hee is irritated by his volubility, a symptom of her dismay at his public visibility; he keeps on popping up, gabbling away, while she is trying to concentrate on her new life with her husband. And yet there is every sign that this former relationship with a not-yet-celebrity was no better than the new one.Hong just places these three situations in front of us: muddled, messy, happy-sad. “None of them seems like a crisis, and neither does Gam-hee’s own life. But she might want to run, all the same."
"Rennie Davis had come to protest peacefully. The police had come to riot. Wielding batons, they stormed forward yelling, “Kill Davis!” he recalls. He was cracked on the head, knocked to the ground and felt lucky to escape with his life. It could be a scene from this year’s summer of civil unrest in America. In fact it was a demonstration outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago that descended into a violent clash with police and the national guard. The story of Davis and other organisers of the protest is told in The Trial Of The Chicago 7, a film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin that premieres on Netflix on 16 October. Its star-studded cast includes Sacha Baron Cohen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, Eddie Redmayne and Mark Rylance. In an interview with the Guardian, Davis, 80, says he was not consulted during production of the film and expresses serious reservations about how he and fellow activists are portrayed. But he also welcomes the timeliness of its release. “Coming out at this time is just really perfection,” he says by phone from his home near Boulder, Colorado. “There are some things that I wouldn’t agree with how Sorkin has characterised certain figures in the trial, myself included. But the impact of the movie is there and I certainly endorse and support it.” The tumult of 2020 – a global pandemic, economic crisis, an uprising over racial injustice – has frequently been compared to 1968, when the Vietnam war was raging, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated and major cities were engulfed by violence. From a farm community in Michigan, Davis’s political awakening came in the early 60s. He helped created Students for a Democratic Society, effectively the voice for students in the north. Davis was an activist and community organiser and joined the antiwar movement in around 1965. By the summer of 1968, Americans were dying at a rate of more than 1,000 per month in the worst year of the Vietnam war. Davis became the national coordinator of a coalition of 150 organisations dedicated to nonviolence that went to Chicago. “Our initial plan was to bring 500,000 people to Chicago and it was simply because the mayor refused to grant permits that the numbers reduced, but the result was a police riot. That’s how a presidential commission defined what happened. But it was watched on television by more people than watched the moment the first man landed on the moon. It was incredible.” Eventually the city did grant a permit for a demonstration in Chicago’s Grant Park that was so benign it included parents with babies. Davis remembers that a young person lowered a flag to half-staff, later explaining it as a symbol of international distress. “The police saw the flag coming down and basically came in and beat people as they arrested this person. We had a very highly organised team of close to 4,000 marshals so I was able to put up a human chain where arms were linked. “We faced out towards the police to just bring the whole situation under complete control in a matter of minutes. Then I announced to the police that we have a permit and you can see we are able to secure this properly, so if you could withdraw, that would be in everybody’s best interest, or words to that effect. “That just set off the police and they came crashing in. As they approached me, I literally could hear police yelling, ‘Kill Davis!’ I was hit on the head and knocked to the ground. I was on the ground crawling with my two arms trying to get away and just being clubbed and clubbed and clubbed. I think what saved me that day, honestly, was a little chain fence in the park. I was able to get under the chain fence and it gave me three seconds to get away, stand up and get on the other side. I did pass out for a while.” Davis went to hospital and was given 13 stitches and managed to avoid arrest. “The police realised I was seen as the organiser of this event so they came into the hospital and did a room-by-room search trying to find me to arrest me. One of the most amazing things of the impact we were having on the city is that there were nurses who literally risked their entire career. “This was a county hospital, they were employees of the county, and they put me on a trolley and covered me with a sheet and literally moved me from room to room to evade the police search until I could get to an exit and get out. I did, and didn’t get arrested. It really is amazing. Even today I think: wow, that was some courage there.” But the incoming Richard Nixon administration successfully pushed for the purported ringleaders of the protest – including Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden and Davis – to be charged with conspiracy to incite a riot. They were originally the “Chicago Eight”, but the case against the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale – who was silenced in court by being bound and gagged – was eventually dropped. A chaotic and raucous trial began in 1969 and forms the backbone of the Netflix movie. Davis continues: “The trial went forward with eight people and, on the opening day, the New York Times said on the front page: ‘This is the most significant political trial in American history’ – and it certainly lived up to its billing. “Certainly none of us want to go to prison for many years, so it’s not to say we weren’t mindful of the likely outcome, but quite honestly this was a group of people, myself included, who really saw the opportunity to basically speak to the country about the Vietnam war. We had different styles and we came from different organisations but, while the movie characterises us as squabbling and fighting a fair amount, it really wasn’t the case.” When the trial ended each day at 4.30pm, the accused, out on bail, would travel far to deliver speeches to crowds of thousands of people. “This was every night with every defendant and people were stamping their feet and screaming. It was really that support of, especially, students that made such a difference. “We also had press conferences at the lunch break that were larger than the press conference at the White House: the entire world press was present in a massive room that could barely hold everybody. All three networks carried our story pretty much as the lead story every single day for six months.” The trial lasted five and a half months. At one point all the defendants read the names of people who lost their lives in Vietnam. Five, including Davis, were found guilty of inciting a riot and all seven, plus their lawyer, were sentenced to prison terms for contempt of court. The convictions were reversed on appeal. Davis became friendly with John Lennon and proposed that the onetime Beatle undertake a 42-city tour to revive the waning antiwar movement and raise funds for local causes. The first was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1971, but was so successful that Nixon tried to to have Lennon deported and the tour was abandoned. Davis still recalls the day when Lennon took him to a recording studio in Manhattan: “Basically the entire audience is just me and Yoko and we sit there and I still don’t know what’s going to happen. John starts and he’s basically recording the final overdub of Imagine. It was really spectacular.” He moved to Colorado and set up a business, consulting to chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. But his counterculture streak also saw him living alone at the bottom of the Grand Canyon for four years. “Today I teach earth whispering, how to basically deepen yourself and become more self aware and things like that. It was largely triggered by that Grand Canyon experience.” Davis is played by Alex Sharp in the movie. Sorkin, known for the White House TV drama The West Wing and the Facebook origin story The Social Network, started writing the screenplay in 2007, but filming did not begin until late 2019. It is his second go in the director’s chair, following Molly’s Game in 2017. Davis has mixed feelings about the finished product. “I was the coordinator of the coalition that went to Chicago and I brought back American prisoners of war from Vietnam at a time when places where I was living were being bombed by US military. In the movie, I’m made out to be a complete nerd who’s afraid of his own shadow.” He adds: “Sorkin was seven years old when the trial was occurring and clearly had no understanding of the defendants or, maybe more importantly, the tens of millions of people that were just passionately supporting us.” Half a century later, Donald Trump is again swimming against the tide of public opinion, according to every poll, by playing down police brutality and using the Nixon “law and order” playbook to seek re-election. Hoffman, Rubin and Hayden are no longer alive but for Davis, the echoes are inescapable. “Of course, there are very decent police officers in every state but the systemic racism in the police department just can’t be denied. “It’s very similar to the anti-war movement. There was a period where the protests represented a segment of society but gradually the anti-war movement came to represent the majority of society and that’s exactly what I see happening now. It is Black Lives Matter but it’s also the women’s movement and the youth movement and the environmental movement and the Extinction Rebellion movement and how they see themselves as basically being, in a way, one voice. “They don’t have the kind of coalition that we had in the 60s but I suspect that’s going to be coming. As we move towards this kind of authoritarian tendency in the government – and the government just has really lost his way – the greatest hope right now is that movement, just as it was in the 60s.”"
"Months after the initial Covid-19 restrictions closed all cinemas, Australian moviegoers are beginning to return for socially distanced screenings across most of the country. But with most major international releases delayed, the large chains that rely on blockbusters face an uncertain future. And for independent operators, more accustomed to showing reruns of classics and local titles, the outlook is not much clearer. As indoor attendance restrictions ease in states other than Victoria, some in the industry are confident Australians who have tired of lockdowns and streamed TV series will return to cinemas for the traditionally busy end-of-year period. But operators who are still paying rent and staff, now with a smaller contribution from jobkeeper, worry that revenue may not return quickly enough to save them all. In 2019, Australia’s 524 cinemas – with 2,310 screens and 439,772 seats – recorded about 85m admissions, generating $1.23bn in box office revenue, according to Screen Australia data. IBISWorld’s William Chapman says: “Australians have been pretty reliable cinema-goers, but as the cinemas can seat more people, will they want to see the films on offer?” In a report on Australia’s cinema industry in April, the senior analyst made the bleak prediction that forced closures would drive down revenue, while Australians in lockdown flocked to the streaming platforms.  Chapman has since been analysing box office data covering the periods when cinemas have been able to reopen with reduced capacities – shaped by different indoor gathering restrictions in various states. He predicts box office revenue in 2020 will be about 25% of the 2019 figure, and expects to see aggressive tactics to draw Australians back in over the coming months. “I think cinema operators will definitely look at discounting tickets, and promotion offers, to try and entice people back,” he says. Before the pandemic, about two-thirds of a cinema’s revenue came from the box office, while food and drink accounted for about 20%, with the remainder coming from advertising. While Australia has so far been spared the wholesale closure of multiplexes seen in the UK, Chapman believes the viability of large chains will ultimately depend on how long big international releases continue to be delayed and whether Australians “will have the money to spare on a ticket given economic issues and the comparative cheapness of streaming services”. Village and Event can raise debt as publicly listed companies, he says, while Hoyts’ Chinese owner, the Wanda Group, “might have deeper pockets to fund losses”. Kirk Edwards, chief executive of Village Cinemas, says the cost of rent is a particular issue for larger chains. Because his chain – which includes 58 cinemas in Australia, including some jointly run with Event – exceeds the $50m revenue threshold, it has not been covered by rent relief codes. He says the larger operators, often in shopping centres, which demand higher rents, have struggled as a result. “Cinemas in Australia pay $280m in rent a year and the industry employs 13,500 staff,” Edwards says. “We do more admissions than all professional sports in Australia combined. “My number one, key concern for all cinemas, is that we need greater support from landlords.” Michael Hawkins, executive director of the National Association of Cinema Operators, says the industry is grateful for jobkeeper, but “without government support for rent for major chains, it will be very difficult for some operators to survive” if a second or third wave shuts cinemas again. Hawkins says delayed global releases have also put the survival of both large and small operators at stake. “Let’s not sugarcoat it, we have concerns,” he says. However he believes if operators can stay afloat for the coming months while relying on independent and Australian films, and re-screening of classics, then the backlog of delayed titles set for release will make 2021 “a very exciting year”. While acknowledging “one or two” films have broken with accepted protocol and gone straight to streaming – including Disney’s Mulan – Edwards says cinemas are part of a “global alliance” and have to accept that the release of films such as No Time To Die, the new James Bond title, has been pushed back to 2021. Village’s program is about 40% “blockbuster titles”, Edwards says. But he believes the delayed Christopher Nolan film Tenet will generate $20m box office revenue in Australia, and is a sign Australians will turn out for delayed films when they are finally released. Eddie Tamir, whose company Moving Story includes three Melbourne cinemas – Classic Cinemas in Elsternwick, Lido in Hawthorn and Cameo in Belgrave – as well as Sydney’s Randwick Ritz, is confident independent cinemas can survive by screening cult classics and niche titles in the absence of “tentpole” global films. “There’s a lot of doomsayers around, I call them ‘schadenfreudians’ of the cinema industry. Cinema has met many challengers, and has been told it’s been dying for 100 years. “We’ll keep dying for the next 100 years too,” Tamir says. While he is keen for restrictions to ease so that his Melbourne cinemas can reopen, Tamir takes confidence from the demand for sessions at the Ritz, which have included Tenet, as well as films from Fellini and Hitchcock and foreign language titles. He has established a Video On Demand streaming site, and is selling choc tops and merchandise from one cinema’s box office, but says these don’t come close to covering losses. Scott Seddon, the president of Independent Cinemas Australia, believes only inner-city independent cinemas can rely on the taste for smaller movies. Seddon runs a five-screen cinema in Raymond Terrace, north of Newcastle in New South Wales, and a drive-in screen in the nearby Hunter Valley. He says regional cinemas rely on the major international releases. “Having No Time to Die moved back to April next year was a big issue for us. We didn’t get much joy out of our reruns. Our audience wants new releases.” Seddon says the outlook for independent regional cinemas is “all pretty precarious for the moment”. He says the government now needs to provide greater support beyond jobkeeper and small grants to sustain vital community institutions. “In a regional area cinema is much more of a focal point, it means so much more to the community. Lots of our customers have disabilities, have companion cards, and are older Australians. “Their weekly outing is to come and see a film. So if we start seeing regional cinemas disappear that’ll be a huge loss,” he says. Edwards, of Village Cinemas, also believes the value of cinema will be an important part of the Covid-19 recovery. “The population is at breaking point with stress and aggravation. Cinemas are good for wellbeing, where they can escape that day-to-day hardship . “It is a place where people go and get away, we’re a world of escapism.”"
"J Lee Thompson’s gripping capital punishment drama Yield to the Night from 1956 gets a re-release: a Brit noir classic and a unique career achievement for Diana Dors as Mary Hilton, a woman awaiting execution for murder. The events leading up to Mary’s crime are intercut with her jail ordeal, attended by female wardens or “matrons” in the brightly lit cell, whose lights can never be dimmed because of suicide-watch surveillance. It unfolds like an eerie, lucid dream of squalor and shame. I first became aware of this film in 1995 when the Smiths’ Singles album came out, using as cover design the image of Dors gripping (or, ambiguously, caressing) the frame of her bedstead, like the bars of a cell. The final track of that album, incidentally, is There Is a Light That Never Goes Out. Mary is permitted a black cloth over her eyes to help her sleep, which she grimly compares to the blindfold given to someone in front of a firing squad. She doesn’t mention it, but both Mary and the cinema audience would sense the other comparison: the sentencing judge’s black cap. Mary becomes delirious as she becomes obsessed with all the tiny details in her cell: the scratches on the wall, the sheen of the enamelled tin mug, the painted brickwork, the pattern on the back of the matrons’ playing cards. Thompson’s camera records these details with unforgettable psychopathic precision. Above all, Mary is obsessed with a door in her cell that has no handle on her side. She (and we) are never explicitly told – but Mary realises that she will see that door open only once, and very soon. What lies behind it, horrifyingly, is the gallows platform, as near to hand as an ensuite bathroom. The movie was based on a novel by Joan Henry (who was married to Thompson), and both the book and Henry’s screenplay were written before the Ruth Ellis hanging, but the movie was released one year afterwards and its production and reception were surely coloured by the queasy aura of fascination radiated by the Ellis case. Interestingly, Mary Hilton is a less potentially sympathetic figure than Ellis; she doesn’t commit a crime of passion on the spur of the moment, but something planned for months – an act of revenge which, in the traditional manner, is a dish eaten cold. The opening credit sequence confronts you with the stark, wordless melodrama of the slaying, the victim tracked from Trafalgar Square to Belgravia, a nightmare of Dutch angles and vividly banal visual details looming up to the camera. Intermittently from then on, we see what led up to it. Mary is a young woman separated from her husband, living in west London and working in an upscale French-style perfume store. She falls for handsome, moody young musician Jim Lancaster (played by the actor and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Michael Craig) and they date for a while until Jim falls for a haughty socialite who toys with his affections and humiliates both him and Mary, triggering a terrible act of violence. In prison, Mary is visited by her ex-husband Fred (Harry Locke), her querulous mother (Dandy Nichols) and anguished brother Alan (John Charlesworth). The narrative of the crime is well done, but the whole film, together with Mary – and perhaps Diana Dors herself – are exalted and transfigured in those harrowing prison scenes taking place unbearably in the present tense. Where once she was blond, brassy and sexy (though open and vulnerable) now Mary is dead-eyed, almost a sleepwalker, waxy of skin, calm, quiet-voiced, enigmatically placid, unrepentant about her crime – though the fact of the capital verdict has rendered this last issue irrelevant. But it is as if Mary is awed by her insight into the reality of death. She has been inducted into the occult mystery and knows something that no one else has grasped: not the prison governor, not the chaplain, not the home secretary. As the time drags on, waiting for a possible reprieve, Mary becomes friendly with her matrons. They are not allowed to smoke, but the prisoner (oddly) is, and when the chief warden comes in, Mary will occasionally snatch the illicit cigarette out of a matron’s mouth and pretend it’s hers so they don’t get into trouble – like the decent sort she is. On her exercise walks, Mary will brood on lines from AE Housman’s A Shropshire Lad (which Jim used to read) on mortality and the brevity of life: “About the woodlands I will go / To see the cherry hung with snow.” But the British title – it was called Blonde Sinner in the US – is taken from Homer’s Iliad, with the herald telling Hector and Ajax to stop fighting because night is falling: “It is well to yield to the night.” Mary is not yielding to a natural night, however, but the artificial one of execution. Finally, two matrons are allowed to kneel and pray either side of Mary, like the thieves crucified with Christ. And as for the awful final moments themselves, it is interesting to compare this with other dramas on the same subject. We are not introduced to the hangman in the black comic way of Robert Hamer’s Kind Hearts And Coronets (1949). Shelagh Delaney’s screenplay for Dance With a Stranger (1985), about the Ruth Ellis case, does not actually show Ellis’s imprisoned life and death at all. Adrian Shergold’s Pierrepoint (2005) with Timothy Spall as the famous hangman, did not shrink from showing you the horrible scene when the door to the adjoining cell was opened, revealing the noose. None of this is what happens in Yield to the Night, but there is a terrible power in its descent of darkness."
"There’s a taste of turkey, or a can of own-brand mechanically reclaimed turkey-substitute, in this moderate TV-movie-style biopic of Helen Reddy, the Australian-born singer who came to the United States and had a string of hit singles in the 1970s, including the feminist anthem I Am Woman. She died recently, and deserved more elegiac attention than she got. Caroline Sullivan’s excellent obituary is here. Reddy found her voice among the commercial shlock of the day (this film has at one moment a shot of Reddy’s place on the Billboard 100 list, one place behind Chuck Berry’s My Ding-a-Ling). Tilda Cobham-Hervey gives a bland performance as Reddy; Evan Peters (Quicksilver from the X-Men movies) is hammy and over-the-top as the sweaty manager and husband, Jeff Wald, who snorts all Reddy’s earnings up his nose. Danielle Macdonald adds some zip with her performance as Helen’s friend, pioneering music journalist Lillian Roxon, whose personality seems more interesting than the main character’s here. The sentiments expressed in the movie are laudable enough, but the cardboard dialogue and cliched storytelling make it a wearisome watch, and Cobham-Harvey’s performance is so opaque and uninflected it feels like a lost item of pop art. When the film shows Reddy performing Angie Baby during her Vegas residency – actually, a rather disturbing song – she just croons earnestly through the track pretty much in its entirety, and there is something so inert, uninterpreted and undramatic in this sequence that the film goes into a trance of pointlessness. Each scene needed a jolt of music or energy that just wasn’t there."
"Isabella Rossellini is a busy woman. It is hard to know how the model, actor, writer, animal behaviourist and farmer finds so much time to talk about sex. But she does. In recent years, she has made numerous tiny films about the sex lives of animals under the umbrella titles Green Porno and Seduce Me. Now she hopes to take them to a larger audience – or, to be more accurate, she hopes to bring a larger audience to her farm. With theatre stymied by the pandemic, she is livestreaming a show from Mama Farm in Long Island, New York, where she lives with her sheep, goats, chickens, ducks and dogs. The show, called Sex & Consequences, is part circus, part animal cognition lecture and part penetration. In Green Porno and Seduce Me, Rossellini dresses up as different creatures to tell us how they mate. She dances, preens, teases and thrusts with a strap-on penis by way of illustration. The films are funny, educative and a little bit bonkers – not unlike Rossellini. As well as learning about the joy of sex, we also learn about its infinite capacity to invent, exploit, control and kill. Take the female praying mantis, for example. “The female starts eating his head when she is mating with him!” Rossellini says with relish. “Imagine that he has evolved his body so the nerves that control the movement to penetrate her are no longer in his head, but farther down in his spinal cord, so she can still keep eating him and he can mate with her.” Then there are the hens who eject sperm if they don’t rate the rooster; the fun-loving dolphins who explore any orifice going; the polyandrous Prunella modularis (AKA dunnock), which breeds with multiple males because it makes economic sense. We have barely started. Rossellini introduces us to snakes with two penises that use their spare member to produce a gelatinous plug, barring entry to the female for the next male; Pacific salmon that spawn just before they die; hermaphrodite earthworms and limpets that are happily self-sufficient; strategically promiscuous chimps that have sex with as many males as possible to protect their babies from infanticide; and drones that bleed to death after their penis ruptures while they are mating with a queen bee. Rossellini is on the farm when we video-call. She is dressed in black – trademark pixie haircut, dash of red lipstick, big yellow glasses, elegant as ever. The only thing that surprises me is the warmth of her smile. The younger Rossellini rarely seemed to smile. In 1982, she signed an exclusive deal with Lancôme and became the world’s highest-paid model. As the face of Lancôme, Rossellini represented an ideal – dreamy, desirable, distant. Meanwhile, in films, her characters were often too tortured (the abused nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens in David Lynch’s Blue Velvet), too cool (the sardonic bad girl Perdita Durango in Wild at Heart) or too macabre (the sultry sorceress Lisle Von Rhuman in Death Becomes Her) to smile naturally. Rossellini, 68, grew up in France and Italy, the daughter of two movie legends – the Swedish Hollywood star Ingrid Bergman and the revered Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini. Her parents were as touched by scandal as they were by glamour – Bergman was still married to her first husband when she gave birth to Rossellini’s older brother. She was denounced by the US Senate as a “vile free-love cultist” and didn’t work again in the US for many years. Her parents divorced when Rossellini was five and she and her two siblings moved into a hotel in Rome for two years, where her parents would visit them. It was hardly a conventional childhood. At the age of 14, her father bought her a book called King Solomon’s Ring, by Konrad Lorenz, one of the founders of animal behaviour studies. “A little lamp went on in my brain and I said: this is what I want to do.” But she didn’t have the confidence. “The idea of studying zoology or biology intimidated me. But I was a beauty, thank God! So I went into the family business.” Was she always aware she was beautiful? “Not so much. I was a little chubby when I was young and I was born with a deformity of my spine.” She had surgery for her scoliosis when she was 12 and spent most of the next two years in plaster. Beauty didn’t seem relevant back then. “Because I was sick, I was just happy I could walk.” Rossellini grew up adoring films, but she opted for modelling. “Because my mother was Ingrid Bergman and my father was Roberto Rossellini, I was intimidated about becoming an actress and a director.” In her late 20s, she decided to act. Did her parents’ reputation help or hinder her? “Both,” she says. “It opened doors, but the judgment was much more severe.” She remembers her first reviews – of The Meadow in 1979. “In the press, they said: ‘She looks like her mother, but she certainly hasn’t inherited her talent.’ It crushes you. If they say it today, you just say: well, maybe that’s true. It doesn’t hurt you so much.” She beams when she talks about Bergman. “You know she won three Oscars?” (Only one actor, Katharine Hepburn, has more.) “I have not even been nominated for one. But it doesn’t affect me any more. This is the great thing about getting old: things that preoccupied you when you were young cease to preoccupy you. I would have loved to have had one Oscar. Well, too bad. I have six sheep, two dogs, two children.” She bursts out laughing and says she is more than satisfied. One of Rossellini’s middle names is Elettra, the Italian for Electra – and she has often said she had something of a father complex. Her first husband, meanwhile, appeared to have a father-in-law complex. She married Martin Scorsese in 1979; they divorced four years later. After they separated, Scorsese told her it had been important to him “to think that he was in a relationship with Roberto Rossellini’s daughter”. Family history repeated itself when she and Scorsese divorced; by then, she was pregnant with another man’s child – that of the former model Jonathan Wiedemann. That marriage also lasted four years. She then had a six-year relationship with David Lynch. In 1993, then single, she adopted a son, Roberto. Three years later, at the height of her modelling success, she was dumped by Lancôme for being too old. She was 43. “I was told advertising is about dreams and women dream to be young, so I couldn’t represent that dream.” Was she shocked? No, she says, she had seen it happen with other models – and her mother in the movies. “The thing that was painful was that I had become their spokesperson and that was not valued. There is a film by the French actress Delphine Seyrig called Be Pretty and Shut Up, and that’s what I felt.” Twenty years later, Lancôme, now run by a female CEO, apologised and invited her back to model for them, which she is still doing today. The culture has changed, she says. “Women executives have a different sensitivity. Male executives only understood makeup or fashion as an instrument of seduction, because that was addressed to them. They didn’t understand that we like to put on makeup or dress up just because it’s a game; it’s pleasurable.” Look, she says. She fetches one of her face masks. The inside is splashed with red. “See. They all have lipstick inside!” She giggles at the idea of wearing lipstick no one can see. “I don’t want to wear beautiful clothes and lipstick because I want to get married.” She almost spits out the word. “I do it because it makes me feel good. I’m single and I’m doing it for me.” Today, she believes she symbolises something different for Lancôme. “I’m not there now to represent beauty; I’m there to represent a different dream. It may be defined as joyfulness; life goes on and there are many chapters. I think that’s why they keep me.” In fact, Rossellini says, she is grateful that they gave her the boot a quarter of a century ago – and that Hollywood similarly wrote her off. It was at this point that she decided nothing would intimidate her and that she would do everything she had always wanted to. She wrote books and scripts, went to university in her mid-50s and completed a master’s in animal behaviour, made films for her own pleasure, bought the farm, started lecturing and made Green Porno, which aired on Robert Redford’s Sundance TV. In 2005, she wrote and starred in a surreal short film about her father, called My Dad Is 100 Years Old. Her father was represented by a huge, heaving belly and she played all the other parts – Chaplin, Hitchcock, her mother and plenty more. “My twin sister was offended by the way I portrayed Dad. She thought it was diminishing.” But Rossellini was happy to be discovering new things about herself. “A friend said to me: you are not the daughter of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini, you are the result of a threesome between the porno star Cicciolina, Jacques Cousteau and Luis Buñuel! It made me laugh so much. I didn’t know I had this streak of surrealism and comedy in me. It’s probably what made me work so well with David Lynch.” Your work is such a contrast to your father’s, I say – Roberto Rossellini’s neorealist trilogy (Rome, Open City; Germany, Year Zero; Paisà) is as bleak as it is brilliant. Yes, she says, but as a man he was so different. “My dad made such serious films, but he was so funny. So funny. It was unbelievable. Sometimes I had to leave the room to catch my breath. And so is Marty [Scorsese]. Marty makes all these films about people shooting and brains exploding, but you sit with him and he makes you laugh so much. Sometimes I have to say: Marty, you’re making me laugh too much, you’re suffocating me.” You seem so much more confident than when you were younger, I say. She smiles. “Ageing brings a lot of happiness. You get fatter and more wrinkles, and that’s not so good, but there is a freedom that comes with it. The freedom is: I better do what I want to do now, because I’ll be dead soon. So this is my last chance. Also, there’s a serenity that comes – I had the career I had, good or bad, I did the best I could, and now I continue pursuing what is interesting to me.” She mentions the importance of being curious – always learning new things. “I’ve seen actress friends so depressed about losing their beauty. People didn’t want them any more. And I felt that, too. Studying saved me from being depressed about losing my beauty. It gave my life so much joy.” Do you really feel you have lost your beauty, I say – you look great. “Thank you! Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and think: ‘Not bad!’” In 2015, Rossellini featured in the film Joy, alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro. At the time, she said it was the first proper movie part she had been offered in six years. “Yes, and it is the last film,” she says. I remind her she appeared in Vita and Virginia, a literary costume drama a couple of years ago. “Ach, yes – a very, very small role.” But does she want the work? I get the impression that she finds movie life boring compared with all the other stuff she is doing. “It is boring!” she says with thunderous satisfaction. “I don’t want to be in that trailer in the parking lot outside a highway waiting for my five minutes for several days. I come home and there is such life – friends and the animals and problem-solving.” She says the farm is a haven from the toxicity of the US today. How does she feel about the prospect of Donald Trump winning a second term as president? “It’s very frightening. I always had a question to my parents. How could Italy become fascist, how could Germany have become Nazi? I don’t want to define Trump as fascist or Nazi, but he is authoritarian – a threat to democracy.” Has she been involved in the Black Lives Matter campaign? “No, but my son is black. He sent me a video that moved me very much. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve said to my son: if a policeman stops you, you answer like this, you don’t put your hands in your pockets, make sure to look them in the eye. If you are threatened, call your uncle, because his uncle, my sister’s husband, is a lawyer. He sent me this video with all these parents teaching their children the same thing and they were all black. When he sent that video, I suddenly thought: oh, that’s my story.” Rossellini says she has not entirely given up on movies and TV shows – not least because they get her out into the wider world. “I feel I have to work with others, because I cannot just be a recluse doing my tiny avant garde shows. My agent sometimes says: oh, Isabella, stop it, it’s a waste of time, there’s no money in it.” Despite its title, she insists Sex & Consequences is about more than sex. She explains how the show also explores animal cognition, empathy and altruism. Rossellini looks at me. “See, when I say cognition, already you just fall asleep when you hear the word. Sex is really easy. It makes people laugh.” There is another surprise in the new show, she says enthusiastically. “I have a husband!” She stands up, walks to her bedroom, and pulls back the duvet. “Look! Look! How can you not love him? He’s in bed. Let me turn the light on.” “Blimey,” I say, “that looks more like a blow-up doll than a husband.” “It’s a dummy!” she giggles. “But I treat him as a husband. In the show, I talk to him. At one point, I say to him: ‘Oh, stop it dummy, instead of stop it stupid.” Is that a metaphor? “Yes, exactly!” This may be bullshit psychology, I say, but you seem more content single than when you were married or in long-term relationships. “No, it’s not bullshit.” She takes me back 20-plus years, to a crunch point in her life. “I was with David Lynch and that came to an end [she seems to forget a subsequent two-year engagement to Gary Oldman] and then Lancôme came to an end and I needed to reconstruct my career. I had my two small children and I just didn’t have room for another boyfriend or husband. I don’t think I could do the amount of things I do if I have a husband. Husbands are time-consuming.” If you had to restrict yourself to one career, what would it be? “The farm,” she says. Rossellini tells me it is called Mama Farm because it is female-dominated. “We have so many hens, female sheep; 90 per cent of bees are female. I started the farm and I’m a mama, and my daughter has a two-year-old son, and a lot of mothers come to the farm.” Is it a feminist collective? “Yes, it’s nurturing, and maybe there is something feminine in nurturing.” At times, she says, it feels like paradise. “People work serenely, the animals walk about, there are crops and flowers. I always say: if I see a man and woman walking about naked, I’ll know I’m in Eden.” Rossellini’s daughter, Elettra, who lives next door and works on the farm, has popped round. It is time to go. I tell Rossellini it is wonderful to see her getting so much pleasure from the world. “I certainly do,” she says. “I don’t know if it’s genes, if it’s me or if it’s life. But it works.” Sex & Consequences will run on select dates from 16-25 October. Tickets for the live stream can be bought at dice.fm."
"Multiplexes may be closing their doors or reducing their hours but it is not all doom and gloom in the world of cinema. Box offices at many independent cinemas are reporting solid audience numbers, with some selling out screenings and others encouraging blockbuster fans to give arthouse films a try. “There’s no getting away from the fact that overall it’s a difficult time,” said Jason Wood, creative director for film and culture at HOME in Manchester. “We feel huge sympathy for people losing their jobs. But it’s an exciting time for independent cinema. It’s really important to recognise there is an industry beyond the mainstream blockbuster film culture.” While multiplex screenings for Tenet have sometimes been sparsely attended, often films shown by HOME are selling out. “We had a lot of love while we were closed during lockdown: people were sending donations and taking up memberships,” Wood said. One tactic has been to show films on the big screen, such as the Kitty Green movie The Assistant, that were streamed during lockdown. Some viewers saw the film online and wanted to see it on the big screen; others heard about it because it had done well on streaming. It has been a sellout at HOME. “But for me the really big success is the BFI restoration of La Haine,” said Wood. “We’ve played it now for four weeks and it’s sold out every single performance.” Bong Joon-ho’s Memories of Murder has also been hugely popular. “Many of the successes have been foreign language, a number are directed by women, some directed by people of colour,” Wood said. Another venue welcoming back audiences in good numbers is Watershed in Bristol. “We hit our September target and our October advance sales are really brilliant,” its cinema curator, Mark Cosgrove, said. Its big hits have included the British coming-of-age drama Rocks. “There is an overall crisis, but it’s in the commercial blockbuster model. Some of the reporting is suggesting that cinema is dead because the Bond film has been moved back. There’s a lot more film out there.” Meanwhile, capacity at the Queen’s film theatre in Belfast, like elsewhere, has been reduced because of coronavirus. Joan Parsons, head of the theatre, said: “We are full for most screenings at the moment, and have to turn people away. It is clear that there is an audience that want to attend cinemas, all of which have made significant investment in health and safety measures.” Not all independent cinemas are thriving, of course. WTW, a beloved family-run business that has cinemas in Newquay, Truro, St Austell and Wadebridge in Cornwall, issued an emotional plea this week for people to take a chance on the sort of arthouse film they might not normally see, or pop in for a takeaway coffee or box of popcorn. It’s director, Mark Williams, said: “There have been plenty of sleepless nights and many tears shed. It is not just cinemas that are affected. From sound and projection engineers to our local drinks and concessions suppliers, there are so many affected by the current huge challenges. We’re determined this won’t be the end.” While the cinemas of Aberystwyth, mid-Wales, defied a government ban at the start of the second world war and stayed open, Covid could force the Commodore, run by Mike Davies’ family since the late 1950s, temporarily to shut. A few good nights of James Bond can usually keep the cinema going for months, so the loss of 007, the new Wonder Woman and Black Widow films is a bitter blow. “We had Bill and Ted this week. We had almost single figure audiences which is a shame – it’s not that bad a film. The studios and distributors are being shortsighted, to put it mildly. When they finally release their blockbusters there might not be so many cinemas to play them in,” Davies said. Davies, his wife, Cindy, and son Neil are currently keeping the cinema going. “We’re doing cleaning, maintenance, everything,” said Davies. “We’re hanging on. We won’t give up.”"
"According to talent agent Archie (Peter Kim), “women of colour directors are hot right now”. Writer, director and star Radha Blank knows this (she won the top directing prize at Sundance). In her warm, funny and enjoyably rude debut, she creates a fictionalised version of herself, slyly jabbing at the way her value is perceived. Has-been playwright Radha is pushing 40 and teaching an after-school theatre programme – “You the black Shakespeare, ma!” insists an eager student. Her midlife crisis prompts an awkward rebrand as rapper RadhaMUSprime (Miss Prime, as opposed to past it) and an unexpected romance with Bronx-based beat maker D (Oswin Benjamin), sparked by fresh creative inspiration and after-hours visits to his studio. During the day, she is ground down by rewrites of her play about gentrification, Harlem Ave, given a stage by J Whitman (Reed Birney), a liberal theatre producer obsessed with “black poverty porn”. It’s a sharply observed comment on the ways women of colour are encouraged to contort their creativity in order to be consumed by white audiences."
"When I read Dan Palmer’s brave and honest coming out column in the Sydney Morning Herald last week, suddenly I was jolted back to a dark place seven years ago when I almost took my own life. The former Wallabies prop described a moment when he was driving recklessly, the feeling of “death felt preferable to anybody discovering [he] was gay.” For me, I was working as a television reporter in Townsville in 2013 and driving to an interview. Suddenly I felt this heavy urge to have an accident. With all my strength I pulled over and called my best friend who told me to go to the doctor. I did immediately. He prescribed me antidepressants which helped fight off the black dog that had been chasing me since high school. Finally, it had caught up. Unlike Palmer, I was already out. In fact, I was outed when a friend who I had one of my first sexual experiences with secretly recorded it and showed the video around school. That only confirmed what the kids already knew and the bullying went from bad to horrendous. I remember wagging almost every sports class, even though I played rugby as a kid and enjoyed it – because in those changing rooms and in that masculine environment, that’s where I copped it the most. So you can imagine my surprise when years later, a rugby club would go on to change my life. Not just any rugby club, the world’s first gay rugby club, the Kings Cross Steelers in London. Four years ago I moved to the UK seeking an adventure and trying to shake that black dog off once and for all. My flatmate was a member of the Steelers and suggested I try it out. When I ran around the oval at the first training session, unfit and overweight (thanks to the Heathrow injection) I was a lap behind everybody. I didn’t want to embarrass myself by giving up and as I finished, lagging far behind, everybody in the club stood there clapping me on. It was a feeling I’ll never forget. Then in my first game, it all came back to me. I scored the most tries. People were patting me on the back and wanting to get to know me at the pub afterwards. Finally, I had found a place where I belonged. And, as a bonus, I went on to meet and marry one of my teammates, John – the funniest and kindest person I know (not to mention a great rugby player). By this point, I was working as the Europe correspondent for 10 News. I had my own camera and decided to make a documentary about the Steelers because I noticed the sport was having this transformative effect on nearly everyone in the club. I’d heard people talk about the power of sport before, but never believed it until now. Here, queer people were reclaiming their place on the pitch – an arena they grew up being told they didn’t belong in. In fact, from this single club, there are now 80 gay and inclusive rugby clubs around the world including five in Australia. In the Steelers’ first season, they sent out 120 invitations to play against teams in Essex. Only a handful accepted. Many thought it was an April fool’s joke because the letter was sent around that time. There was the occasional homophobic sledge, but over time the Steelers won the respect of these straight burly British men because not only did they beat them on occasion, they showed them that we’re all pretty much the same. Flash forward to me taking my camera to Amsterdam to film the club at the Bingham Cup, the world cup of “rainbow” rugby. I filmed my team hoping to get enough material for a feature. I sat on the footage and a year passed. It was only when Israel Folau began posting “hell awaits homosexuals” on social media that I realised I had to tell the story of the club – and my own story. So like Dan Palmer, I too have Folau to thank in small part. My film has played in scores of festivals across eight countries. When it premiered at the New Zealand International film festival (after the All Blacks tweeted the trailer) a teenager messaged me saying he was struggling and getting bullied at school, but my film gave him hope that things get better. To me it made everything I had gone through worth it. The bullying. The self doubt and the self-loathing. I guess the lesson I learned is you have to keep searching for happiness, because you just might find it where you least expect. In my case, it was the rugby pitch.  Eammon Ashton-Atkinson is the US correspondent for 10 News First. His independent documentary Steelers: the World’s First Gay Rugby Club is in cinemas across Australia now"
"A detonation of pure acting firepower is what’s on offer in this movie version of August Wilson’s 1982 stage play. Declarative and theatrical it might be, but it’s also ferociously intelligent and violently focused, an opera of passion and pain. We see African-American musicians hanging around a white-owned Chicago studio one stiflingly hot day in the 1920s, waiting for the legendary blues singer Gertrude “Ma” Rainey to show up with her entourage so they can cut an album. The lead track is expected to be her live hit, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, and the drama imagines a certain pushy trumpeter in the band named Levee angling for his own version to be recorded. A simmering argument about how this song is to be arranged and performed forms the basis of a confrontation about race, sex and power. Viola Davis plays Ma Rainey with tremendous hauteur: Cate Blanchett’s Elizabeth I never arrived at Hampton Court with more magnificent display or more queenly prerogative than Davis’s Rainey making her entrance, with her own lovers and court favourites, sweating at the temperature, her painful feet and the incompetence of the studio chiefs. And Chadwick Boseman gives a moving performance as the fiercely talented but insecure Levee, crucified by a childhood experience of racist violence and dreaming of fronting his own band. This is Boseman’s final appearance on screen, and what a glorious performance to go out on. It is a head-butting confrontation of the galácticos: Davis and Boseman are each the immovable object and irresistible force. Amusingly, both are concerned with their feet. Poor Levee has just blown every cent on a fancy pair of shiny shoes and he is always showing them off, hopping and dancing around like a little kid. Ma Rainey’s feet, on the other hand, are in agony. We see her picking her way down the stairs at her hotel in discomfort, yet her rolling, heavy-set gait is part of what imposes her authority on the room. She gets to wear a pair of comfortable indoor slippers in the studio and doesn’t move anywhere she doesn’t want to. Levee has, quite without Ma’s permission, prepared an ingenious new version of Black Bottom that downplays her slow, bluesy vocals and gives a more demanding, uptempo orchestration for the boys in the band: Toledo (Glynn Turman), Cutler (Colman Domingo), Slow Drag (Michael Potts) and of course Levee himself with his flashy trumpet. This is with the sneaky connivance of the white manager Irvin (Jeremy Shamos) and studio boss Sturdyvant (Jonny Coyne) who sense this is how to make it a lucrative crossover hit. Ma furiously rejects the new version, sensing – accurately – that this means getting upstaged and that Levee wants to use her prestige as the launching pad for his own stardom. The only male she wants to showcase is her own teenage nephew Sylvester (Dusan Brown) that she capriciously wants to let him introduce the number, despite the fact that he has a stammer. To add to the tension, she has brought along her gorgeous girlfriend Dussie Mae (Taylour Paige), who is dangerously enamoured of Levee. So who has the power in this contest of wills? In some ways it is Ma Rainey herself – she is the talent, she must be placated, and everything depends on her – yet the band are bleakly unimpressed about her ability to connect with non-black audiences. Levee has power of his own with new ideas about music, but it is the duplicitous management who control it, and the tragedy and the violence are ignited by the band’s derision at Levee’s sycophantic attitude to these white chiefs. It triggers Levee’s own memories of racist violence and humiliation – and while others in the band get set-piece speeches, too, there is something a bit contrived in these theatrical arias. But they are delivered with such intensity, and the film has a genuine coup in its final scene, showing how Levee’s talent is to be exploited and the way black culture itself is destined to be appropriated. Boseman’s face is so open, so transparent, so needy – it is an instrument for every painful emotion. It is such a generous performance: the portrayal of a man sacrificed on the altar of his own past."
"Movie romances traditionally have what’s called a “meet cute”, that clinching moment when a couple-to-be first bump into one another. It would be hard, though, to think of a meet less cute than the one in The Night Porter, Liliana Cavani’s erotic drama from 1974. When Max (Dirk Bogarde) encounters Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), they are in a concentration camp: he is an SS commandant and she is his teenage prisoner, crop-haired, ghostly and gaunt. A twisted relationship develops. She gives him sex and he brings her gifts, such as the head of a fellow prisoner in a box. It’s the little things that mean so much. Twelve years after the end of the war, they are reunited when she checks into the Vienna hotel where he is manning the front desk. Soon it’s like the good old days all over again: they play sadomasochistic sex games, and Max tries to prevent Lucia being killed by his Nazi chums. The film, which has been in and out of circulation over the decades, is released this month on Blu-ray in a 4K restoration, giving new audiences a chance to marvel at the high-wire performances, rinky-dink dubbing and sustained mood of maudlin kitsch. They can also decide whether this is a chamber piece of singular intensity or a ghoulish dalliance with fascist porn. Or possibly both. Holocaust survivor Primo Levi called the film “beautiful and false” and said “it has nothing to do with the camps”; while the academic Jörg Heiser wrote in 2010 that Cavani turns “concentration-camp reality” into “a playground for Nazi chic”. Opinion at the time was divided. The film was treated largely with respect in Europe but savaged by US critics, with Pauline Kael in the New Yorker calling it “humanly and aesthetically offensive”. The US distributor, Joseph E Levine, exploited the furore by taking out a newspaper spread featuring hostile notices. “Selling it on the strength of its bad reviews,” said Vincent Canby, surprised to find that his own hatchet job in the New York Times was being used to flog tickets. Cavani was not pleased either. “It was misleading,” the 87-year-old director tells me from Rome. “It damaged the reputation of the film. It was seen as a sexual work and that’s not at all what I wanted to do.” Unsavoury offers began landing on her desk. “Some producers proposed to me that I make a porn movie,” she says, clutching her forehead. “I said, ‘You’re completely crazy. No way.’ They wanted Nazi porn!” It’s true that the film has always had a strong whiff of the taboo. I first saw it at the age of 15 at the delightfully insalubrious Scala cinema in London, where it could be found in outre double bills with the likes of Salon Kitty, one of the “Nazi porn” projects that Cavani turned down. A friend had told me that The Night Porter showed people having sex on broken glass, which seemed to me reason enough to pay the £2.50 ticket price. As it turned out, he was exaggerating. Though Max and Lucia do crawl on jagged shards, and fight over the sticky fragments of a broken jam jar, there is no glass-based intercourse, strictly speaking. Jane Giles, the Scala’s former programmer, remembers The Night Porter as a reliable money-spinner for the repertory cinema. “It appeared 23 times between 1981 and 1992,” she says. “That makes it a real Scala regular. It was part of a trend that started in the 1970s of sexually extreme Euro arthouse films, which put it in the Scala sweet spot. These were films that were slow to come to home entertainment, and so weren’t widely available.” It was also part of a wave of Italian pictures confronting fascism in a sexualised context: Visconti’s The Damned (Bogarde and Rampling again), Bertolucci’s The Conformist, Pasolini’s Salò or The 120 Days of Sodom. “Germany was doing it, too,” Giles points out. “But what’s different is that Italy was more like the wild west when it came to censorship and classification. What you got was this confluence of Italian film-makers dealing with their country’s fascist tendencies, combined with much freer, more explicit imagery.” The Night Porter still faced legal obstacles at home – a delegation of Italian film-makers, including Bertolucci, successfully challenged efforts to ban it. While the movie retains a disreputable air, however, its origins are anything but. Kael in the New Yorker was way clear of the mark, for instance, when she surmised that the film probably “came out of idle speculation: ‘Gee, I bet there were people sexually enslaved by the Nazis.’” In fact, Cavani, whose grandparents were part of the anti-fascist movement, had spent years making documentaries about the war. One of those was Women of the Resistance, a 1965 study of partisan fighters, during which she interviewed two women whose stories inspired The Night Porter: a teacher who took holidays each year in Dachau, where she had been imprisoned, and another woman whose family urged her to forget her experiences at Auschwitz. “I asked what it was that she could not forgive the Germans for,” Cavani recalls. “She said, ‘They made me discover a part of myself capable of doing things I never thought I would do.’ I asked, ‘What was it?’ She didn’t answer.” Cavani wrote the treatment for The Night Porter in the early 70s. The budget was tight – the production ran out of money halfway, and shooting was suspended while additional funds were raised. Surprisingly for such a dour film, the mood on set was merry. “There was a really nice atmosphere,” the director says. “It was light, all the actors got along. Charlotte had just had a baby, and she took him on set with a nanny.” Cavani has described the relationship between Max and Lucia as “beautiful”. In what way? “There was an attraction which marked Lucia for life,” she says. “When she and Max meet again, the flame has not faded. She was very young and disoriented by him. She was bowled over. She believed he desired her for who she was. And, despite everything, there was sincerity in his feelings. In its own way, theirs is a romantic relationship.” I confess to her that I can’t share this view of the film. Lucia was a child when they met. She was abused, exploited, terrified. How can what she feels for Max be love? Cavani smiles patiently. “We mustn’t generalise. Cupid shoots his arrows in random directions, and these two must have been struck. If Cupid’s arrow hits you, there is nothing you can do. Let’s be honest, nobody can really define love.”A crackling video call conducted through an interpreter may not be the best way to debate the nuances of abuse and control, so I ask Giles later what she makes of Cavani’s comments. “I’m with you on your reading of the relationship,” she says, “but I do understand what Liliana is saying. She’s found a language with which to describe her work. She’s a provocateur, and there’s an energy which allows her to take on that sort of material. If Liliana saw it as a story of abuse rather than a romance, it would look completely different. It wouldn’t have Charlotte Rampling slithering around – she would be lying on the floor, weeping and covered in sores.” I think Giles is right. Cavani needed to invest in the purity of Max and Lucia’s relationship in order to make something so sincere, foolhardy and enduring. After all, she has directed many films, including Francesco, starring Mickey Rourke as St Francis of Assisi, and Ripley’s Game, with John Malkovich at his disdainful, withering best. And yet it is The Night Porter that we are still discussing. While Cavani was overseeing this new restoration, she was asked whether she wanted to correct a cosmetic flaw in the original print. In the scene in which Max and Lucia struggle violently in a hotel room, a curly hair dangles from the top of the frame like a cedilla or a butcher’s hook. She refused to shoot another take at the time because Rampling, who had hurled herself into the scene, was exhausted. Offered the chance to fix it now, she declined once again. She tells me she sees it as a test for the viewer. If you fixate on that hair, she says, “then the film is not worth anything. We should throw it away.” But it symbolises something else, I believe: a precious imperfection. Perhaps the flaws and misjudgments in The Night Porter have done as much to keep it alive as its flashes of brilliance. They help to explain why we’re watching the film so long after its initial release, and arguing over it still."
"Mary Twala died just a few weeks before Beyoncé’s Black Is King came out. In the film, the 80-year-old embodied the story’s shaman figure, the last part she’d ever play in a six-decade career. The deep lines of her face, white paint over her eyes and red beads covering her head, made a striking impression, introducing the actor to a whole new audience. Among its other virtues, Black Is King opened a portal for western audiences to some of the best talent from the continent – some emerging, others, like Twala, already well established. But for those only just discovering her in the wake of Beyoncé’s visual album release, the best of Twala’s work is arguably still to come.  Born in Soweto, Johannesburg in 1939, Twala had been acting since her early 20s, when her sister brought her along to an audition. Her range was wide: among the many productions she starred in were Generations, the first soap centred on Black middle-class characters, created in 1993 in the run-up to South Africa’s first post-apartheid elections; and Sarafina!, which screened at the 1992 Cannes film festival.  Over her career, Twala garnered many accolades – none bigger than South Africa’s Order of Ikhamanga (silver), presented to her by the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in 2019 for outstanding contribution to the arts. She was mourned by the nation when she died at the beginning of July as a result of Covid-19. Although Black Is King was Twala’s last role, it won’t be the last chance to see her on screen. The final feature film she acted in, This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection, has been travelling the festival circuit for the past year, in advance of its theatrical release. In it, Twala plays an elder of a tiny village in Lesotho, whose deep grief sets off a defiant spirit of protest among her community against local developers. The film is the debut narrative fiction feature of film-maker and writer Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese, who was born in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru. Made under Venice’s Biennale College initiative, Burial premiered at the festival last year before competing in Sundance’s World Cinema Dramatic competition, where it earned the special jury award for visionary film-making in January. Since its first screening, it’s collected more than 20 festival awards, including best actress for Twala at the Durban international film festival. The film has just been submitted as Lesotho’s first ever entry into best international feature at the Oscars, making history even before the nominations are announced. South African producer Cait Pansegrouw brought Twala to Mosese’s attention, showing him a photo of her while they were developing the film. Inspired by Mosese’s own grandmother’s experience of being displaced from her village, the story is deeply personal, drawing, too, on universal themes of identity, progress and tradition. “When I saw the picture of Mary, I knew that this is the right canvas,” he says. “She surrendered her body as a canvas for my thoughts and observations to literally paint my painting. The painting that I’ve been having in my mind for all these years,” says Mosese. The film rests on Twala’s diminutive shoulders and she carries it ably – in the close-ups of her face mourning the death of her husband, in her small stature against the majestic Lesotho mountains, in the wails of her tears. The landscape of Lesotho becomes a character in the film, just as Twala’s character Mantoa, becomes its own landscape. “The film is almost like a performance art. It was very physical,” says Mosese. “And for her, it wasn’t a question of if we can do this. It was, ‘When do you want to do it? Should we do it now?’” As Pansegrouw and Mosese explain, the conditions in the remote part of Lesotho, Ha Dinizulu, where they filmed were tough, with a lack of infrastructure and the weather fluctuating from -2C degree mornings to 28-degree days. At times, they shot through electrical storms. But Pansegrouw says Twala was up for anything they needed her to do during the 24-day shoot, including learning the intricate Sesotho language. “I’d always go to her little room before bedtime to make sure she was cool,” says Pansegrouw. “And one night I said, ‘Mary, are you okay? Like, this is a crazy experience, are you OK?’ And she was like, ‘I’ve made many films in my life, and many films I have read. And many films I have heard. This is the first film that I see. I see it so clearly.’” Mosese thinks the growing curiosity towards the continent from outside – fanned by the likes of Beyoncé – is a beautiful thing. But he’s more excited about the younger film-makers coming up behind him, who might see in his work an accessible way to realise their own dreams, utilising great African talent, like Twala’s, along the way."
"Johnny Depp is set to exit the Fantastic Beasts franchise after being asked to resign by Warner Bros. The actor announced the decision in a statement on Instagram, one that comes just days after he lost his libel case against the Sun over claims he abused his ex-wife Amber Heard. “I wish to let you know that I have been asked to resign by Warner Bros from my role as Grindelwald in Fantastic Beasts and I have respected and agreed to that request,” Depp wrote. He then followed the news with an insistence of his innocence and a promise to continue his legal battle to prove it. “The surreal judgment of the court in the UK will not change my fight to tell the truth and I confirm that I plan to appeal,” he wrote. “My resolve remains strong and I intend to prove that the allegations against me are false. My life and career will not be defined by this moment in time.” The news was also confirmed by Warner Bros in a statement which details that his role of the villainous Grindelwald will be recast. Earlier this week, Depp lost his libel case against the Sun after he was called a “wife-beater” following stories of alleged abuse against Heard. “I have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard,” the judge said. Principal photography on the untitled third Fantastic Beasts movie was set to begin in March but was postponed after the start of the pandemic. It commenced in September with safety precautions and is unclear whether Depp filmed any scenes alongside stars Jude Law and Eddie Redmayne. The second film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was seen as a major box office disappointment in 2018 after making $564m worldwide, the lowest total of any film within the Harry Potter universe. Depp’s reprise of his role in the sequel led to a backlash at the time but was defended by author JK Rowling. “Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the film-makers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,” Rowling said. The actor’s most recent performance, as war photographer W Eugene Smith in drama Minamata, premiered this year at the Berlin film festival to middling reviews. Depp had also been rumoured to return to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise in Margot Robbie’s upcoming reboot yet he currently has no future acting credits confirmed."
"Focused, frenzied and packed to capacity with social comment, 2016’s South Korean zombie barnstormer Train to Busan revitalised a genre in an advanced state of decomposition. Its sequel – not counting the animated prequel Seoul Station – unfortunately reverts to type, favouring CGI-overloaded snafus rather than the tight set-pieces and class-based rancour that made the first film so gripping. Gang Dong-won plays Jung Seok, a broken soldier who’s escaped the Korean peninsula, now overrun by the zombie plague and in permanent lockdown. But while he’s exiled in Hong Kong, the local triad goons make him an offer he can’t refuse: that he lead a group inside Seoul to recover $20m sitting in the back of a truck after a thwarted previous extraction. Crossing the zombie flick with the heist movie promises an enlivening hybrid. But the robbery element is fairly quickly dispensed with, at which point director Yeon Sang-ho seems only to want to trudge in the footsteps of past post-apocalyptic cinema, notably Escape from New York and Mad Max. A rogue military outfit, Unit 631, now run this sector of the city, and find entertainment in throwing any human survivors they find into cage-fighting-style melees with the viral undead. Yeon injects little new life into these gnawed genre cast-offs. Despite an early mention that north of the DMZ there is no virus, the film isn’t interested in the north-south split that haunts so much Korean cinema. Instead its eye is on a different international dimension, with the expanded English-language dialogue quotient suggesting a push towards global franchise status. But the generic blockbuster feel rips the roots from Yeon’s trademark caustic misanthropy, which has fed so productively off South Korean hyper-capitalism since his 2011 animation The King of Pigs. Peninsula looks pretty when motionless, with penumbral, ochre-lit vistas of the shattered city. But the action sequences are filled with horrible, weightless sub-videogame CGI, disintegrating into World War Z-style zombie soup. A film about a virus-ravaged country under lockdown should be able to hit cogent parallels at will at the moment – but a numbing repetition is sadly the main payout."
"Slow, delicate and sparse, Luxor is coming out on digital this week just as all the cinemas close down again. If you have a chance to see it, try to view it in the dark, without distractions, on the biggest screen you can in order to approximate a cinema setting and to best appreciate its deep-breath pacing and dry-heat beauty. Writer-director Zeina Durra’s feature, her second after the evocatively titled The Imperialists Are Still Alive!, follows English surgeon Hana (an unusually subdued Andrea Riseborough, giving a great, slow-burn performance) as she recovers from the horrors of working in a Syrian war zone for an aid organisation. As she rests up at a plush hotel in Luxor, the open-air museum of a town in Egypt she used to live in years 20 before, she passes the time visiting the sights and having polite interactions with other guests and tourists, all the while considering what may be an even more traumatic assignment in Yemen. When she runs into an ex-lover, Sultan (a smouldering Karim Saleh), an archaeologist working a dig nearby, the two revive their old friendship and maybe a bit more. But the tentative romance isn’t really the point of this thoughtful study. Through a very studied use of posture, expression and even clumsy stoned dance moves, Riseborough outlines the contours of Hana’s low-key midlife crisis, the contemplation of roads not taken and lives not led, all somehow more present because of the history-steeped ancient setting of the town. Someone mentions at one point that, “the more unstable the world is, the more the supernatural comes to forefront,” which might set up certain expectations for some viewers, but the ghosts here are all strictly theoretical, or at least off-camera. Like director Joanna Hogg, Durra excels at suggesting subtexts and undercurrents threaded through everyday conversations. At all times the dialogue sounds improvised and flows entirely naturally, even when characters are paraphrasing Antonio Gramsci’s ever resonant gloss on historical chaos: “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.” Classy stuff, and a good way to get in some cinematic tourism to a place no doubt soon to feature in the possibly much trashier Death on the Nile."
"David Fincher has dreamed the life of Hollywood screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz; the result looks gorgeous, and sounds gorgeous. It’s a swooning monochrome fabrication of exactly the kind of golden-age Hollywood picture of the 30s and 40s that Mankiewicz worked on, sometimes without billing, until he grabbed a chance to create an authentic masterpiece in 1941: Citizen Kane. He finally accepted a quarrelsome co-writing credit with Orson Welles, sharing with him the film’s one Oscar, for best original screenplay. Apart from everything else, Mankiewicz helped to create a cottage industry in the world of criticism: in a famous contrarian essay of 1971 Pauline Kael declared the praise for Citizen Kane really belonged with unsung Mankiewicz – thus tweaking the nose of certain macho-auteurist male critics. Gary Oldman plays Mankiewicz, all bleary cynicism, dishevelled hair, acid wisecracks and acid reflux from the alcohol, often dictating the script of Kane from an invalid’s bed (thus weirdly reminding you of his performance as Churchill). Tuppence Middleton gives a shrewd, affectionate performance as his long-suffering wife Sara. Marion Davies – with whom Mankiewicz was acquainted via his connection with Davies’s nephew, the screenwriter Charles Lederer – is played by Amanda Seyfried and her sugar-daddy boyfriend William Randolph Hearst, the bloated old media plutocrat and Kane-model himself, is played by Charles Dance, who is a rather sleeker figure than the original. Tom Burke plays Welles in cameo. It’s a heartfelt, irresistibly watchable film, which incidentally serves up a quasi-Rosebud theory about the genesis of Kane. Fincher creates the fiction that Mankiewicz wrote the script while laid up with a broken leg after a car accident. In actual fact, he started to write it after he’d recovered from the injury, but Fincher insists on this fantasy of writing it in medical seclusion to emphasise this idea of (mostly) sole authorship. Mankiewicz and his un-merry band of writers are made to look bleary and charmless, sexist and cynical for the most part, each of them inelegantly burdened with regret for neglecting previous careers in literature and theatre. But Fincher also makes Mankiewicz more of a secret philanthropist than he was, and certainly more of a social A-lister, fantasising about the rumpled Mank hanging out at San Simeon at Hearst’s swanky parties, as the all-licensed court jester. So this heartfelt, extravagant movie is about a reporter-turned-screenwriter who didn’t get his due until the very end and even then was overshadowed. But could it be that Oldman’s smart, wised-up but emotionally wounded writer is … not really Herman Mankiewicz? The screenplay is by David Fincher’s late father Jack Fincher, a journalist and editor of Life magazine who died of cancer in 2003, and whose earlier biopic screenplay for the life of Howard Hughes was going to be the one for Martin Scorsese’s The Aviator, until it was hurtfully rejected in favour of a rival version. It should be pointed that Mankiewicz and his higher-achieving director brother Joe were themselves in awe of their own father, the scholar Franz Mankiewicz, who made terrifying perfectionist demands on his boys, which it’s said inspired Joe to excel and Herman to mask his hurt feelings with cynicism and booze. The Mankiewicz imagined here is someone who never lost his newspaperman’s sense of the world around him and the iniquities and pomposities of politicians, and the grisliness of Europe’s fashionable new fascism. In particular, he is outraged by the fake news propaganda films put out by the Hollywood studios (with Hearst’s support) to discredit socialist author Upton Sinclair in the 1934 gubernatorial race in California, creating phoney vox pop interviews. Without stressing it too much, the film gives us a Mankiewicz disgusted with Hearst, yet also fascinated and even excited in spite of himself at the creative dishonesty. A seed has been planted for the newsreel constructions of Citizen Kane itself. It’s possible to go into a kind of trance at just how beautiful this film looks, a ravishing display created by cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt and production designer Donald Graham Burt, with costumes by Trish Summerville. It’s a view of Hollywood that is unfashionable in many ways – the current view is probably more in line with Ryan Murphy’s miniseries Hollywood, which is all about correcting the erasure of anyone outside the white-heterosexual system, and that isn’t really what Mank is about. But what an addictive romantic drama it is, mixing sentimentality with pure rapture."
"It’s 2pm on polling day in Connecticut and Marielle Heller is hunkering down to await the result of the US election with her family, after venturing out to cast her vote. No, it wasn’t very busy, she says over Zoom, but it’s a small town “and I wore two masks”. We briefly ponder the nail-biting hours that lie between our conversation and publication of this article. It would be a good time for a few games of chess, except that Heller isn’t interested in chess. “I feel like I should pretend that I am. My kid has started learning how to play and was taking classes before the quarantine began. But yeah, my five-year-old knows more about chess than me,” she says. This is an endearingly unguarded declaration from a woman who has returned to acting, after the best part of a decade behind the camera, for a Netflix series that is all about the rise of a chess prodigy. For the record, I’m not interested in chess either, but despite its dogged pursuit of the perfect opening, I found The Queen’s Gambit compelling, not least because of Heller’s performance as Alma, the adoptive mother of a fiery young girl whose extraordinary gift takes her from a Kentucky orphanage to the top of the world rankings. Based on a 1983 novel by Walter Tevis, the series plunges its fictional protagonist – Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy) – into an atmospheric reconstruction of the early 1960s: Martha and the Vandellas ring out of the radiogram, but chess is even more of an exclusively white, male game than it is today and chamber versions of the cold war play out around the world in the swanky hotels where this terrestrial counterpart to the space race is taking place. The backstory to the rags-to-riches tale is altogether more homely: it shows the transition of America itself from the apple-pie values of the 1950s, which shackled women to their cookers and vacuum cleaners, to the economic and social possibilities of the 1960s. Given the nostalgic fantasies currently being peddled by rightwing movements around the world, it could be read as a cautionary tale. This thought draws a big sigh from Heller, whose professional life – in terms of the career decisions she has made and the stories she has chosen to tell – reveals both how far women have come and how much further they still have to travel. Over the last five years, she has directed three well-received films, but, despite regular listings in newspaper picks of the year, the closest she has so far come to any of cinema’s most glittering prizes was as one of eight names embroidered on Natalie Portman’s cape, in a protest at the 2020 Oscars ceremony about the absence of any female directors among the nominations. How does she feel about that? “I mean, you know, I went through it two years in a row,” she says. “With Can You Ever Forgive Me?, I had allowed myself to think something could happen, but by the time we got to last year, I was like, ‘Oh, no, now I see how this system works and why this isn’t gonna change any time soon.’” She’s currently confined at home with her comedian husband, Jorma Taccone, who wanders across the screen, waving hello, in a woolly hat. Their two-month-old baby is asleep in a bedroom. It seems a reflection of life in some dimly remembered fast lane that their daughter was conceived and born in the lost months since she finished filming The Queen’s Gambit in Berlin late last year. She took the role of Alma partly, she says, because “I just found her so tragic and sweet”, but also because she wanted a break from the responsibility of directing and was keen to work with its screenwriter-director Scott Frank, who she befriended as a fellow director but who talked her into playing the ultra-minor part of a dead FBI agent in his 2014 thriller A Walk Among the Tombstones. “I accepted it for fun but got cut out, so all you see of me in the movie now is a photograph,” she says. “But I did film a few scenes with him. And he was like, ‘Oh, you’re actually an actor.’” Heller has actually been an actor since her early childhood in California. Her dad was a chiropractor and her mum an art teacher and she was the eldest of three, all of whom have gone on to make careers in the arts and entertainment. “I was one of those probably annoying little kids who was always putting on plays with my family,” she says. At the age of eight, she went legit, joining the local youth theatre and being charged with breathing musical life into characters ranging from Rabbit in Winnie-the-Pooh to Templeton the rat in Charlotte’s Web. She left school to study theatre at UCLA, followed by London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, building a respectable acting career in downtown New York and in regional theatres around the US, but in her late 20s realised that if she wanted truly satisfying roles, she would just have to write them herself. One turning point was a midwinter audition for a commercial in New York that required her to don a bikini and throw a beach ball in the air. “I had no lines. And I thought, is this what I went to theatre school for?” She both wrote and directed her first film, 2015’s The Diary of a Teenage Girl, and it was eight years in the making. “It was really this passion project for me where I wasn’t going to take no for an answer,” she says. Based on a graphic novel by Phoebe Gloeckner, it was about a love affair between a 15-year-old girl and her mother’s 35-year-old boyfriend. Its frank depiction of teenage sexuality sent some viewers into a spin, not least the British Board of Film Classification, which to Heller’s fury gave it an 18 rating. The world just doesn’t want to think about the sexuality of young girls, she says. Her second film, Can You Ever Forgive Me? was more mainstream: a biopic of an alcoholic writer, Lee Israel, who took to forging letters from celebrities after her career as a biographer stalled. It earned a constellation of four- and five-star reviews, winning Oscar nominations for its lead actors Melissa McCarthy and Richard E Grant, and a Writers Guild of America award for its screenplay, but nothing for Heller herself. From there, she made a side-swerve from female-centred movies to direct Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, about the beloved American children’s TV presenter Fred Rogers. It was, she says now, her antidote to the Trump era, “which is to say that if Trump wasn’t the president, I don’t know that I would have wanted to make a movie about Mr Rogers, but it felt like the thing that the world needed was an example of a sensitive man who was trying to help us get in touch with our emotions, who believed in kindness over cruelty”. The Queen’s Gambit touches on some of the themes that have come up in her own films – the relationship of women to addiction and the possibility of remaining unspoilt by success. Beth is a popper of her adoptive mother’s happy pills and is followed around by rumours that her genius may be the flipside of psychosis. But Heller is not having any of it. “I hate the narrative that people have to be tortured in order to be good artists. I think it’s a solipsistic view that people use in order to be selfish. I don’t think we have to be jerks to make good art either, but somehow we as a society have romanticised that idea.” In particular, she says, it doesn’t take into account the sheer hard slog that goes into any creative achievement, whether winning at chess or directing films. “Writing, directing – it’s just torture every time and it doesn’t seem to get any easier. And yet I love them and I’m not going to stop doing them.” By the time she was on to her third film, she realised that there could at least be some sort of a technical fix. For her first two, she had stuck to the punitive hours that are the industry standard and it meant that she never saw her son awake. “He was two at the time and I thought I can’t do this to him very often, because it really traumatised him.” Then Melissa McCarthy introduced her to the idea of “French hours” – a strict 10-hour filming day with no break for lunch. Yes there was some pushback, she says, but she armed herself with the certainty that “Mr Rogers would not have wanted us to abandon our children in order to make this movie. And it was wonderful. It meant that three nights out of the week at least, I got home to put my kid to bed. For many women, that’s the difference between working and not working.” Does she think that things are generally improving for women in film? She’s anxious about overstepping her own experience and concerned that the pandemic has pushed everything backwards: “A lot of people are leaving their families behind and agreeing to go be part of a movie set where they’re not going to see anybody but those who are working with them and that’s not something I can do right now.” But the door is at least ajar. “And I feel really lucky,” she says. “I’ve had a huge amount of opportunity come my way and I know that that’s because of all of the women who came before me who have not had it as easy, who have pushed the door open for me to be able to walk through it. And I hope that I can help make it easier for people who come after me.” The Queen’s Gambit is on Netflix now"
"Cinemas across England shut down today as the new national restrictions introduced by Boris Johnson take effect. Cinemas are already closed in Wales, as part of the “firebreak” lockdown, and in Northern Ireland. However, some UK venues are still open – mainly in Scotland, where a tiered lockdown system in still in operation. Cinemas in tier 1 and 2 districts, such as the Eden Court in Inverness, and the Playhouse in Perth, are still showing films, albeit under social distancing regulations. As the ramifications of the new lockdown became clear, the country’s film distributors scrambled to salvage their release plans. For some, such as Curzon, it was an easy pivot to its own streaming platform. Others, such as Modern Films, are going with a “virtual screening” platform that allows the hard-hit venues to share in the revenue. High-profile titles such as The Human Voice, Pedro Almodóvar’s short film starring Tilda Swinton, Supernova, the festival hit with Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci as a gay couple dealing with the latter’s dementia, and Thomas Vinterberg’s Another Round, starring Mads Mikkelsen, have all been postponed. Netflix are continuing with plans to show its potentially award-winning drama Hillbilly Elegy in the few cinemas remaining open ahead of its streaming release on 24 November, but it looks unlikely at this stage that cinemas will see much of another Netflix film, Mank, the much anticipated biopic of Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz, directed by David Fincher, before it debuts on Netflix on 4 December. Jake Garriock, head of distribution strategy at Curzon, which specialises in auteur and foreign language cinema, says: “Indie distributors can be a bit more nimble. We’ve recognised from the start of the pandemic that we would have to be flexible with theatrical screenings.” Curzon’s latest release, About Endlessness, is shortly to play in Inverness, but will also be available on the company’s own streaming platform, Curzon Home Cinema, which has proved a lifeline during the pandemic. “We always have the option to launch there if cinemas are closed. Financially it would not make sense to delay a release with less than a week’s notice as the marketing budget for the film is spent.” Paul MacDonald-Taylor, head of film and visual art at Eden Court cinema in Inverness, says that it has been business as usual, given the fact the cinema only reopened a week ago. “We tend to show foreign language and art films so we don’t really rely on Hollywood product to keep our cinema going. The films we generally show are still coming out, so there’s plenty we can choose from. The distributors we usually work with have been very helpful, and it’s all been smooth sailing so far.” MacDonald-Taylor’s cinema is coincidentally staging the Inverness film festival, which will show some of the postponed titles, including Supernova, The Human Voice, and the Italian language adaptation of Martin Eden, which was also pulled from its release slot. The long-running French film festival will also pitch up there in November, as well as visiting whichever of its other venues that remain open – which so far include the Phoenix in Oban and the Robert Burns Film Centre in Dumfries. Social distancing regulations are also an issue. MacDonald-Taylor says the cinema, which is part of a multi-artform complex, is operating at 25% capacity. “It isn’t ideal, but looking back at numbers from previous years for similar films, they are remaining about the same kind of numbers. We’ve had a lot of sell-outs. People haven’t been put off.” The picture isn’t quite so positive elsewhere in Scotland. The Belmont Filmhouse in Aberdeen announced it is closing temporarily, saying that the impact of the English lockdown on UK-wide film distribution meant that “most of what we had planned to show you is no longer available”. Supply pipelines are an issue wherever cinemas are open. Daniel Phillips, manager of the Mallard cinema in Guernsey, says they have managed to find enough to fill their screening schedules, but lost one of next week’s films at short notice – the aeroplane survival thriller Horizon Line. “It’s disappointing, and frustrating from a business point of view. The film content we are able to access is fairly limited to the films we’ve had over the last few weeks. The situation is changing all the time, but we should be getting Hillbilly Elegy in a couple of weeks.” As a self-governing crown dependency, Guernsey is not technically part of the UK but is, as Phillips says, “beholden to the UK release schedules”. The island is also not subject to any Covid restrictions (other than 14-day self isolation for arriving travellers) and so it really is business as usual. “So many brilliant films we could be showing are being pulled from our schedule because we come under the UK umbrella. We would welcome any new releases at the moment.”"
"Here is a rather oddly-structured documentary-cum-mission-statement that changes its horse midstream. It starts out as a slickly shot nature film and then morphs into an impassioned screed on how mushrooms can – essentially – save the world. The central figure is Paul Stamets, a Denzil Dexterish figure who studies fungi in Washington state and is an advocate for the life form’s centrality to harmonious natural systems. (Though quite how that squares with developing lethal types of mould to exterminate termites is never explained.) If this film resembles a souped-up TED talk that’s because it presumably took wing from Stamets’ own 2009 TED talk, Six Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World, and the film contains copious excerpts from his various on-stage lectures: there’s no denying he is a charismatic and persuasive speaker, both to camera and to live audiences. This film, likewise, is a treat for the eye and ear: the liberal use of speeded-up footage of growth and decay is unfailingly spectacular, while Stamets and fellow interviewees have a gift for a memorable turn of phrase. “We will forever exist together within the micro-molecular matrix,” Stamets says at one point. “Mushrooms don’t give a shit,” says academic/author Michael Pollan, at another. Though the fungus-eye-view voiceover, by Brie Larson, with its breathy, quasi-visionary utterances, is less impressive. Stamets’ message is that fungi (which he, like the other US and Canadian interviewees here, pronounce with an off-putting soft “g”) can be put to use in a variety of helpful ways: cleaning up oil spills, assisting chemotherapy and – a little more controversially – treating mental illness. It’s this latter point, which is dwelled on with rather more enthusiasm than anything else, that you feel is the deep motivation for the hippy silver-fox speakers who pass across the screen. For long stretches Fantastic Fungi resembles the final sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey, with swirling kaleidoscopic visuals and a solemnly intoned devotion to the mystical experience. Whether you buy the fungal head trip is a matter of personal inclination; there’s quite a bit of shamanistic waffle and airy speculation about brain evolution to get through. Perhaps most eye-opening is the brief mention of fungus’ use in battling a potential pandemic – the news clip of a US president (George W Bush, as it happens) taking the threat of a pandemic seriously like a bulletin from another age."
"With his rainbow-colored tresses and prominent facial tattoos, it’s hard not to stare at SoundCloud rapper and viral sensation Tekashi 6ix9ine. The 24-year-old, who has collaborated with Nicki Minaj and Kanye West, wouldn’t have it any other way. More so than his actual music, the self-proclaimed social media “supervillain,” former gang member, and convicted felon is known for his shocking online antics and run-ins with the law. For him, no publicity is bad publicity – so does the latest Hulu documentary, 69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez, simply play into the young provocateur’s indiscriminate thirst for the spotlight? Advertised as both an “investigative documentary” and a “gangster story,” the film traces the rapper’s life from childhood up to his arrest in late 2018 on charges that include attempted murder and armed robbery. A year earlier, he had embroiled himself with the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, a violent subset of the east coast prison gang, to bolster his image and street credibility. Gummo, his 2017 music video featuring cameos from several of the gang’s members, exploded in popularity. Things escalated quickly. He rode the coattails of associated infamy to break the internet before getting in too deep. Fast forward past multiple convictions and an abbreviated prison sentence due to his cooperation with the authorities, and today 6ix9ine has reached an all-time low as one of the most despised figures in hip hop. “I was trying to find the moment where internet violence turned into real violence,” film-maker Vikram Gandhi tells the Guardian. “It’s one thing to have the symbols and look of violence with guns and gang affiliation. It’s about when the line is crossed into something else – physical violence, people getting punched in the face, groups going around shooting people – that’s when you know it’s not a show any more.” Fascinated by the new generation of SoundCloud rappers so divorced from his own conception of New York hip-hop, Gandhi discovered 6ix9ine in 2018 and picked up his camera around the time of his arrest months later. Somewhat of a prankster himself, Gandhi knows a thing or two about posturing for attention. In Kumaré, his 2011 documentary, he posed as a spiritual guru and gained a number of followers despite being a fake. In 69, he drops the costume and plunges into the life and times of the notorious figure whose invented persona became too real for his own good. Before his rise, 6ix9ine was Danny Hernandez, a first generation New Yorker born to immigrant parents from Mexico and Puerto Rico. Raised in poverty by a single mother and traumatized by his father’s absence and his stepfather’s murder, Hernandez led a difficult childhood in the shadows of anonymity before discovering the powers of Instagram and YouTube. “When I realized he grew up in Bushwick, close to where I live,” Gandhi tells the Guardian in a video call. “I realized I knew exactly the neighborhood he was from and the bodega he worked in.” Drawing from past interviews, social media posts, audio recordings, videos, court documents, and transcripts, Gandhi summons the digital spirit of Tekashi 6ix9ine without ever actually speaking to him. The rapper’s team ignored Gandhi’s interview requests and has recently denounced the documentary. But for the film-maker, 6ix9ine’s cooperation never really mattered. “When I started I didn’t know if he was going to get out of prison. He could have been sentenced for much longer. I was making the film whether he came out or not,” Gandhi explains. “In long-form film-making you will always have a narrative arc that’s beyond some people’s control. I think [6ix9ine] is inclined to do interviews where he can manipulate the narrative. He lives so much of his life online, anyway. That’s where he really exists. What would he tell me that he hasn’t already said?” Indeed, Tekashi is skilled at absorbing bad press and turning it into something positive, knowing that attention is the currency of fame. From his early days designing clothes featuring profanities drawn in big, bold letters, to his button-pushing music videos and high-profile social media beefs, he knows that provocation will rack up the “likes.” In fact, his persona relies on constantly one-upping himself in a never-ending game of dare. In his first music video out of prison, Gooba, he depicts himself as a rat, at once acknowledging his new reputation as a snitch, and shrugging off its importance. The film draws a timeline of his various sentences and controversies, yet no matter the scandal he bounces back, revealing a cold, casual attitude towards his accusers, and those he’s betrayed or harmed. “None of the information we share is new. But with [the film] we give a human face to a lot of people who in the past have just been depicted as pawns in [6ix9ine’s] story,” Gandhi says. He interviews neighbors and former friends that knew Hernandez before he was throwing gang signs at the camera. But the most poignant of Gandhi’s subjects is Sara Molina, the former girlfriend and mother of Hernandez’s daughter. Molina paints a damning portrait of her ex-beau as a physically abusive partner and indifferent father too addicted to fame to care about anyone but himself. “For everyone in the movie, [6ix9ine] is a triggering person. Almost everybody that I interviewed that was close to him struggled. It was like they were all talking about a good friend that screwed them over.” A cautionary tale about the destructive powers of fame-seeking in the age of social media, Tekashi’s story might recall that of another American villain skilled in media manipulation. “Dave Chappelle once said after [Donald] Trump was elected that we elected an internet troll as our president. I don’t think that anyone could imagine at the time that the attention that was being given to him might actually make him win.” Gandhi says. “[With Tekashi 6ix9ine], the hip hop world and the internet created a troll and gave him fame and fortune. We’re all complicit in this attention giving economy.” When asked about the objection some have towards amplifying people who have proven themselves undeserving of the spotlight, Gandhi shrugs: “I don’t have an answer on whether the film is good or bad for society, or good or bad for [6ix9ine’s] career. The only thing I can do is take a subject that is taboo and open it up. I think we have to address things instead of cancel them. Why did this thing happen? If you were someone who was obsessed with the story, or someone who regrets being a fan of his, you can look at the film and say, ‘This is what went down’.”"
"In his time, Matt Dillon has been about as quintessentially American a screen presence as you can imagine. From his early blazing-youth roles in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders and Rumble Fish; through more mature parts like the leader of an addict “family”in Gus van Sant’s Drugstore Cowboy; to a whole later catalogue of cops and lowlifes, Dillon has exemplified a hard-bitten homegrown working-class cool that you wouldn’t immediately picture outside the boundaries of American film. But of late, he has explored some challenging byways of international art cinema. He played an astronaut in French director Alice Winocour’s Proxima; he was austerely chilling as a serial killer in Lars von Trier’s The House That Jack Built; and he is currently working with the celebrated Iranian photographer and film-maker Shirin Neshat. Then there’s the altogether enigmatic Nimic - an elliptical 12-minute vignette by Yorgos Lanthimos, the irreducibly outre Greek auteur behind The Favourite and Dogtooth. Not the strangest thing about it is the title: in Nimic (with an “n”), Dillon plays a cellist who has a life-changing encounter with a female mimic (with an “m”). On FaceTime from Albuquerque, Dillon gives a broad grin. “European films tend to be a little more open to interpretation – this falls on the speculative side of things. What is it about?” He laughs. “I remember saying to Yorgos, ‘I know what you’re doing.’ And he said …” – he gives a cagey sideways look – “… ‘Really?’ And he did not budge. He stuck to his guns.” Dillon sees Nimic as “a poem, in a way. I think there’s a lot to do with identity.” It was shot in Mexico City, giving a distinctive flavour to a fictional city that’s never identified. “It’s a very old-world city in the new world.” And there was something uncanny in the air, in keeping with the film’s stalkerish theme. “I actually had this feeling that I was being followed throughout – if you’ve ever been followed, it’s a very strange feeling.” As someone who become a screen idol in his teens, Dillon probably has more experience of being followed than most of us. In the 80s, he was as much like a rock star as any movie actor of his generation, adorning countless bedroom walls following roles in Coppola’s SE Hinton adaptations The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. Today, Dillon – voluble and friendly, with a deep-baked, gravelly voice – is 56, craggier and heavier, with a salt-and-pepper beard, but you can still recognise that kid with the poster-friendly broody brow. He made his debut aged 14 as a teenage rebel in Jonathan Kaplan’s 1979 film Over the Edge; the story goes that he was discovered by a casting agent while bunking off school in New York’s Mamaroneck, Westchester County. “I wasn’t in class, you could say that. I think why I ended up doing that movie was because I connected so much with the character. I recognised this kid, he was a juvenile delinquent – he was in a much worse place than I was, probably.” Since the 80s, Dillon’s career has had its highs and lows, but the highs have been pretty notable, including the Farrelly Brothers’ There’s Something About Mary and a 2005 adaptation of Charles Bukowski’s autobiographical Factotum. There was also the racist LA cop in Paul Haggis’s 2004 Crash, which won the best picture Oscar and earned Dillon a string of awards nominations. At first, Dillon was worried that people would identify him with the character; now, he connects the role with the state of America in 2020. “‘Put your hands against the wall’ is a thing of the past – now it’s like, throw ’em on the ground, choke ’em out and maybe shoot ’em. You can’t treat citizens this way, and African Americans bear the greatest brunt.” Differently troubling was the surprisingly bleak figure he cut in The House That Jack Built – a typically confrontational exercise by von Trier, about whom Dillon is nothing but enthusiastic. “I don’t have any interest in serial killers but I wanted to have an experience, because I like this guy – I think he’s a great artist, I wanted to discover something.” He admits to having qualms about the film, not least because of the harrowing scene in which Jack terrorises one of his victims, played by Riley Keough. “I almost didn’t do the movie because of that scene – it was hard for me to even go there in my mind. It wasn’t because of the violence, it was because of the degradation, the way he talked to her.” Even after shooting, he was reluctant to watch the finished product. “Lars was really insistent that he wanted me to watch it with him. I was like, how am I going to get out of this?” Then his co-star, the late Bruno Ganz, told him the film was the most interesting thing he’d ever seen. “Not one of the most interesting,” Dillon says with emphasis, “the most interesting thing he’d ever seen. I was like, ‘Whoah!’ So I told Lars I’d watch it.” Now Dillon is in Albuquerque shooting Land of Dreams, directed by Neshat and her collaborator Shoja Azari, and co-written by Jean-Claude Carrière, the legendary co-author of several Luis Buñuel classics. “It’s somewhat political – it’s dream-like, but subtle.” Set in the near future, Land of Dreams is about an Iranian census worker on a mission to collect dreams; Dillon plays a security officer. “I’m driving this big old Harley Davidson, like the Marlboro Man kind of American. I’ve always thought you’ve got to be careful about the cliche stuff - but also embrace the archetype.” Dillon has also been pursuing other things close to his heart. We first spoke in September at the San Sebastián film festival in northern Spain, where Dillon was premiering El Gran Fellove, his first documentary feature as director. It’s an exuberant portrait of the late Francisco Fellove Valdés, a Cuban jazz singer who developed his own version of the American scat style and became a TV and recording star in Mexico in the 50s. The film is built around footage that Dillon shot in 1999 when he accompanied his friend, musician Joey Altruda, to Mexico City to persuade Fellove, then 77 and largely forgotten, to record for the first time in 20 years. The singer was initially puzzled, and had no idea who Dillon was – he just called him “Mateo” – but he took up the challenge eagerly, and comes across in the 1999 footage as animated, avuncular, mischievously inventive in the studio. The film is a vivid celebration not just of Fellove, but more generally of Latin music, which Dillon – an avid collector of 78rpm records – discovered in the early 80s, after hearing a Charlie Palmieri piano number in a New York taxi. He enthuses about the music in an erudite torrent of names and styles – Guapachá, Chano Pozo, filín, dengue – intermittently punctuated by emphatic finger snaps. He got to investigate Havana’s record shops on a 1993 visit, during a critical period for Cuba. “You could get the rice but you couldn’t get the beans, there was coffee but there wasn’t milk. It was a difficult time, but it was a very magical place.” These days, Dillon spends an increasing amount of time in Rome with his Italian partner, actor-choreographer Roberta Mastromichele, but briefly made it back to New York last month. “This asshole …” – he’s referring to the soon-to-be former president of the US – “… said, ‘Have you seen New York? It’s a ghost town.’ That’s the kind of guy he is – he throws the biggest city in America under the bus, he wants to give it a black eye. But it’s not true – when I got back to New York, it couldn’t have been more lively.” Before that, in September, Dillon was on the jury of the Venice film festival. The award he immediately enthuses about is the one for best young actor, which went to Iranian teenager Ruhollah Zamani in Sun Children, about Tehran street kids. It’s a role, you can’t help thinking, not so different from those he played when he started out. “I never lived a sheltered life,” Dillon says, “so when I became a famous actor, I didn’t withdraw. I was going to hang out, so I continued to hang out with the same troubled kids I was hanging out with before. I just became more worldly.”"
"The news that not one but multiple Covid-19 vaccines are on the way to pharmacies and hospitals worldwide came as a relief to us all, a confirmation that some semblance of normality would return in the next 12 months or so. But for the makers of Songbird, an audaciously assembled pandemic thriller that imagines a not-too-distant reality where Covid-23 has killed more than 100 million people, it dumps a truckload of dust on the film’s fearful “what if” worst-case scenario, edging it even closer to science fiction. For many of us, the recent good news might make it more palatable to watch something intended to squeeze tension out of a situation that’s already quite tense enough. There’s a distance now, at least for those who are lucky enough to be healthy and safe, that allows us to see it for what it is rather than what it might show us about the future. It was spawned from an idea in March that got the green light in May before a shoot in July and now a digital release in December, a spectacular turnaround helped tremendously, no doubt, by the blockbuster producer and deft string-puller Michael Bay. The British director and co-writer Adam Mason, whose previous credits have been small-scale genre movies, has crafted a rather ingeniously constructed film that tries to tell a big story with little resource, using a locked-down LA as a backdrop. It’s remarkably slick, if a little rote in its plotting, working best as a fascinating historical document of how some creatives found their way around the rules during an impossible time for a struggling industry. It’s the first major Hollywood movie to have been created not only during the pandemic but also about the pandemic, a fact that lifts a perfectly solid thriller into something of note, something to be studied in years to come. It’s 2024 and in the Songbird version of events, things haven’t got any better; they’ve been getting progressively worse (“It’s the end of the world, bro,” someone tells us in one of the many dour clips shared in the opening montage). The latest virus is the deadliest yet, with a 56% mortality rate. That has led to a strict divide between those who have immunity (which carries a much-sought-after yellow bracelet) and those who don’t (forced to stay indoors at all times). If you fail the daily “temp test” or you’re close to someone who does then you’re forcibly relocated to a Q-Zone, essentially a concentration camp where you’re left to die. Nico (Riverdale’s KJ Apa) is one of the lucky ones, a “munie” allowed to move freely across the desolate city, delivering packages and slowly saving for an escape to Big Sur, where things are somehow magically safe. He’s hoping to take his girlfriend, Sara (the Disney channel alum Sofia Carson), but she’s trapped in her apartment with family, a precarious predicament that quickly turns dangerous when her grandmother falls ill … In the brief runtime that follows (the film is wisely just 84 minutes long), Mason and his co-writer Simon Boyes attempt to meld together a Romeo & Juliet-lite love story with a sub-Contagion thriller which bravely expands out to an ensemble piece with Demi Moore and Bradley Whitford as a rich, insulated couple selling immunity bracelets, Alexandra D’Addario as a cover-singing YouTuber, Craig Robinson as Apa’s wheeler-dealer boss, Richard Jewell’s Paul Walter Hauser as a disabled veteran and Peter Stormare, in laughably pantomime villain mode as the nefarious head of sanitation. Despite the many familiar ingredients of Songbird (some of which start to feel musty by the convoluted last act), there’s an undeniable jolt in seeing a glossy thriller rooted in a version of the grim reality we’ve all been facing this year. Taking elements we’ve come to know so well (from the viral terminology we spout daily to the isolated way we now live) and using them to create an even scarier world is, at times, mightily effective, if also a little bit exploitative to some. The scenes that work best are the ones that feel less fantastical – a sex scene involving added protection, a wife forcing her husband to burn his clothes after he returns to the house, the horror of waking up with a fever – but it’s perhaps the schlockier ones that act as the sugar sweetening the bitter taste these might leave. It’s not a film with much depth to it but when it does deal with the thornier hows and whys, it’s interestingly cynical, reflective of living and working in a country where things have been mishandled quite spectacularly. Rather like The Purge, it sets up an intriguing world of possibilities but keeps the focus frustratingly tight – an unavoidable decision in this instance, but it does make us crave the bigger picture. Apa and Carson’s love story is a rather milquetoast hinge for the plot that doesn’t really carry us through emotionally, although there is an added weight to the power of their big kiss at the end (both for the characters and for them as actors). Songbird is an acceptably watchable thriller that’s more notable for what it achieves technically than anything else. For many, the topical gimmick will prove irresistible but for others, it will be repellent, making the decision to avoid an expensive, anti-escapist rental all too easy. Either way, it’s headed to the history books."
"At Club Knuckledust, clients have access to a range of dodgy entertainment, ranging from basic sex-club fetish fun to watching homeless ex-soldiers suffering from PTSD kill each other in a cage arena. Manager Serena (Camille Rowe) slinks about in polyester lamé frocks arranging the brutality and profiting from the betting, her evilness presumably meant to be signalled by her American accent. But it all goes wrong one night when a veteran conscript, given the fighting name of Hard Eight (Moe Dunford), goes rogue and refuses to let himself get killed in the third round. A variety of eccentric characters are introduced as the action toggles back and forth between flashbacks, showing what happened immediately next in the terrordome, and a subsequent police investigation and interrogation of Hard Eight. For example, there’s a deaf bodyguard (Guillaum Delaunay), a henchman with a nasty mullet (Gethin Anthony), a pair of inept hitmen called Happy and Hot Lips (Phil Davis and Matthew Stathers) and the enigmatic Chief Inspector Keaton (Kate Dickie, a wonderful actor who inexplicably keeps taking jobs in rubbish like this). Luridly coloured, handheld cinematography seems designed to distract from the shabbiness of the sets, while the muffled dialogue and too-loud backing tracks make it nigh on impossible to work out what the hell is going on. It’s hard to imagine many will care as the film seems designed to be watched while drunk. Perhaps in that state the discordant shifts between the bizarre attempts at humour and more sombre dramatic material would make more sense."
"If you had money on drive-in movies making a comeback in 2020, the year’s most talked-about actor being Laurence Fox, and the biggest Hollywood hit being Bad Boys for Life, then you invented Covid-19 and should pay for your crimes. You could call 2020 a year of winners and losers; but, frankly, it was mostly losers, the biggest being cinema itself. Things started out promisingly. Parasite won big at the Oscars, and last year was the biggest ever at the British box office. This year was set to surpass it, with blockbusters such as No Time to Die, Black Widow, Fast & Furious 9 and West Side Story on the way. Twelve months later, we’re still waiting. The studios postponed their big movies because the cinemas were shut; the cinemas strove to safely reopen, but had no movies to put on. It became a chicken-and-egg situation: most chickened out; the few that didn’t got egg on their faces. Tenet threw an odd bone to the spectacle-hungry public but took a substantial hit, grossing £270m worldwide (director Christopher Nolan’s Inception took £600m in 2013). The year’s overriding movie story is one of cinema’s losses and streaming’s gains. At the start of 2020, the chief concern was that Disney was going to rule Hollywood for ever; by the end, Disney was posting multibillion-dollar losses and conducting a “bloodbath” of personnel. Its one consolation was the streaming service Disney+, which launched in March just as the world was hunkering down at home. Its original target was 50 million subscribers by 2022. It gained 73 million in nine months.  Like the rest of us, Hollywood’s main pursuit this year has been catching up with Netflix. Major players shifted their chips from cinema into streaming: Universal’s Peacock, Paramount+, and most of all Warner’s HBO Max. Warners, which took the hit with Tenet, are set to release Wonder Woman 1984 simultaneously on HBO Max and in cinemas in the US. In December it announced it was doing the same for all 17 of its planned 2021 releases, including The Suicide Squad, The Matrix 4 and Dune. This is bad news for cinemas, which depend on exclusive, advance access to new movies – especially the big franchise titles. Some smaller films benefited from the blockbusters’ absence: the London teen drama Rocks, for example, or horror Saint Maud, but a lack of festivals also hurt the non-blockbuster end of the market. There’s the horrible feeling we might be witnessing the end of cinema as we know it. The future might not be so bright for streaming either, though. Competition grows ever fiercer. And when cinemas and the rest of the world finally reopen, people might feel like getting the hell out of their houses. The numbers are already difficult to stack up for studios. A decent blockbuster could make $1bn in cinemas; that’s a big shortfall to make up with streaming. Added to which, small-screen movies have yet to create genuine, franchise-generating buzz. Streaming is also a convenient place to bury bad movies, so let’s at least be thankful for the bullets we dodged in 2020, such as Artemis Fowl, Scoob! and The New Mutants. Ultimately, it’s not studios or streamers who get to decide – it’s us. If we want to watch movies in cinemas again, that’s where they will go. Covid will be over one day, but cinema doesn’t have to go with it."
"There are moments of sweetness and sadness in Maite Alberdi’s documentary about an old people’s care home in Chile. But I couldn’t make friends with this film because of its pointless and twee contrivance, which undermined its genuine ideas. Not fakery exactly, but an exasperating lack of candour as to how this whole thing has been set up. We begin by seeing a Santiago private detective, Rómulo Aitken, who has placed an ad in a paper for an elderly man to be a spy or “mole agent” in an old people’s home, posing as someone needing short-term respite care. With the aid of gadgetry such as hidden cameras and microphones he must find evidence of elder abuse. The detective’s client is evidently a woman whose mother, Sonia Pérez, is in this home, and the daughter is worried. So a very sweet and lovable widower called Sergio Chamy is finally recruited and installed as a resident. But wait. The documentary, it turns out, already has a crew in this place, working openly with the home’s permission, having apparently assured it that they wish only to make an uncontroversial film about life there. The vast majority of the footage is from this team, with only a few seconds of the “secret” video from Sergio’s hidden cameras. So … when did Alberdi get involved? When she saw the newspaper ad? Or did she herself have the idea for a care-home film, and cooked up this semi-serious “mole agent” idea to give it a quirky spin? Either way, Sergio does not discover any elder abuse, only the residents’ loneliness and unhappiness and the scandalous way their relatives don’t visit them: a malaise in society which we are finally sort-of invited to accept is the real abuse. As for Sonia Pérez’s daughter … we never see her. Was the whole “abuse” worry a fictional premise? Sergio himself has real gentleness and is a lovely character, and there is some amiable comedy about how he is starting to enjoy himself in the home. But he is marooned in a tricksy, gimmicky film."
"This is nothing to do with Ron Howard’s movie about Don Ameche being rejuvenated by aliens. German director Leonie Krippendorff has created a coming-of-age awakening in the 2018 summer of love, with swimming-pool rapture, yearning bedroom reveries and rooftop party scenes in the Kotti Kreuzberg, Berlin’s Kottbusser Tor district. There are also some noodling YA-style video-journaling inserts, which are an acquired taste. It’s a bit derivative and the metaphor in the title is right on the nose – but Cocoon is also seductive and well-acted. Fourteen-year-old Nora (Lena Urzendowsky) nerdishly keeps caterpillars in jars in her bedroom, the sort of childish hobby that many people of her age have junked in favour of Instagram. She hangs out with her older sister Jule (Lena Klenke) and Jule’s friend Aylin (Elina Vildanova) who tolerate her, just about. Nora and Jule are pretty much abandoned to their own devices by their alcoholic mum Vivienne (Anja Schneider), who is bleary to the point of being comatose, but a birthday gift she receives from an old friend hints at a more complex intellectual past: Judith Butler’s book Bodies That Matter. Poor Nora disgraces herself one day in school when she gets her first period in middle of gym class, and the person who comes to her aid afterwards is super-cool Romy, played by Jella Haase, and it isn’t long before Nora and Romy are texting and hanging out and Nora realises that she likes Romy an awful lot. But is Romy just as into boys? Urzendowsky is very good as part of a young and vivid cast and the extended dreamy scenes with nothing much happening – or perhaps everything happening – are well managed. The film conforms to the coming-of-age template in that romance is followed or superseded by friendship and maturing personal growth. Urzendowsky keeps it all together."
"This German romantic drama – a handsome commercial for Studio Babelsberg, near Berlin, the world’s oldest major film studio, as well as for cinephilia in general – cheekily suggests that any dude off the street could direct a movie.  Strapping Dennis Mojen is Emil, a feckless East German soldier who, in 1961, is trying to blag work at what was then the state-owned DEFA studio. He stumbles into sassy dancer Milou (Emilia Schüle), a stand-in for a big French diva currently in residence. Sparks are starting to fly when the Soviets throw a geopolitical hissy fit and – very rude of them – sunder the lovebirds with the Berlin Wall. Not so much The Lives of Others as The Lives of Extras. Dare to Dream is also, as its marketing hasn’t been slow to point out, La La Land-ish, with its photogenic lovers on a meta-filmic quest. Emil, who is supposedly banned from the studio, concocts a plan to rescue his love affair by posing as a director and whisking up a new version of Cleopatra that will attract the French star – and her beautiful stand-in – back to Babelsberg. But the La La Land resemblance is superficial: there are no true musical numbers and, with the protagonists less aware of the film history into which they waltz, not quite the same self-conscious spring. Instead, it hews to a classical approach and an unabashed belief that directing boils down to – as Emil’s wide-eyed revelation has it – “what you feel when you’re sitting in the cinema”. Martin Schreier’s film knows its crowd-pleasing priorities – not to mention a framing device in which a crinkly Emil relates the dawn of his romance to his grandson while walking back to a house where … You can see where this is heading. But Dare to Dream also has enough about it – the central wheeze, the moment of crucial improvisation with which Emil salvages his directorial career and a confidently staged finale – to amuse on its own terms. At the very least, Babelsberg shouldn’t lack bookings post-Covid."
"This modestly budgeted but not unambitious crime thriller set in the deep exurbs of London stars Bradley Taylor as Mark, an ex-con with the angry frightened eyes of a whipped pitbull. Not long out of prison and struggling to find legitimate work so he can sidle back into the lives of his young daughter (Oriana Rodrigues-Cova) and suspicious former partner Jules (Angela Terence), he gets some “tree work” clearing branches in the forest. There he’s surprised to find his mouthy one-time cellmate Alan (Cary Crankson, entertainingly violent) also on the job. The two pal up again and before you can say “parole violation” they’re lured away from the path of righteousness and offered work assassinating rivals for some gruff gangsters, led by Caddy (Frank Harper, alumnus of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). It all goes predictably wrong as Mark fails to curb Alan’s brutal, erratic instincts and the film’s midsection chalks up an unfeasibly high body count as blunders turn into minor disasters and then major screwups. Debutant writer-director Will Thorne, who comes from a background producing/directing light entertainment on TV, displays a knack for juggling gruesome violence and black humour and draws sturdy performances from the cast, who have an easy rapport with one another. (A bunch of them all seemed to have worked together on a 2013 film called Rock and Roll Fuck’n’Lovely.) But there is a derivativeness about the script that means the big twist is exasperatingly easy to spot early on. Still, props for the grey desiccated look to the cinematography and production design that evokes the exhausted, depressed feel of shabby English neighbourhoods, knackered garages and provincial night clubs with bad drugs."
"The patchy cinematic record of novelist-turned-screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis includes the classic Christian Bale-starring adaptation of American Psycho and 2013’s The Canyons, a soft-porn showcase for some of Lindsay Lohan’s best work – plus plenty more forgettable and regrettable nonsense besides. Even so, this schlocky take on a series of real-life tragedies represents a new low. Ellis’s script, directed by Tim Hunter (The Failures, River’s Edge), is based on the largely debunked theory that a series of young men found dead in or near lakes and rivers in the American midwest between the late 1990s and the 2010s were victims of a serial killer or killers. Jake (Ronen Rubinstein) is a strapping college athlete whose general sense of unease is compounded when he starts receiving menacing text messages. The sinister, synth-heavy soundtrack and white van lurking in the edge of every frame suggest Jake is right to be concerned, but everyone else in his circle, including girlfriend Keren (Mia Serafino), dismisses these fears as paranoia. Several examples of Ellis’s trademark affectless American youth are present and correct here. They drive around, listlessly discussing how so-and-so “seems super stressed and bummed-out lately” or “has been acting really weird”. Only the slow-arriving bludgeoning and torture scenes distinguish this from a dead-eyed Californian reality show, in the vein of The Hills or Selling Sunset. The violence is gruesome, but the constant deployment of cliche – along with the casting of Crispin Glover, an actor who specialises in theatrically creepy oddballs, as the hammer-wielding man under the dark hood – only intensifies the sense of pantomime implausibility. With the addition of some decent jump-scares, Smiley Face Killers might have passed muster as a gender-swapped slasher flick, but it’s too under-researched to take seriously as true crime."
"We are waiting in an age that believes in symptoms of malaise. We wonder if we might be slipping. The picture business feels dead on its feet. So it’s easier to suppose that the new movie, Mank, was made out of a kind of death wish. Does director David Fincher, or Netflix, really think that audiences are going to care about the California gubernatorial election of 1934, or pick up all the name-dropping the movie indulges? Why is it David Fincher if no one gets murdered? Why the screen time for Louis B Mayer, Irving G Thalberg and David O Selznick – middle-initial celebs the audience can’t place? And why has the demented project hired a 39-year-old actor, Tom Burke, to play Orson Welles, who was 25 in 1940, when it mattered? You have to start with the prodigy named Orson. Finished with formal education by 16 (in 1931), the kid from Kenosha, Wisconsin, had soared. By 1938, he was infamous, and loving it. He had co-founded the Mercury Theatre (with his dear friend, John Houseman); he had mounted a Harlem production of Macbeth, done as a voodoo rite; he had directed and acted in Caesar (as in Julius) and Heartbreak House (playing a man in his 80s); and he had been the guiding radio voice – baritone, seductive yet often on the edge of bogus – for the Mercury Theatre of the Air. It was in that capacity, at Halloween 1938, that he spooked the nation with a version of HG Wells’s The War of the Worlds, in which gullible chumps could believe New Jersey was being invaded by Martian zombies. Welles was besieged with offers from Hollywood to make a movie – almost any movie, and on his own terms. He knew it all. He was a maestro. “There but for the grace of God, goes God,” people said – or was it the mischievous Welles who said it? In that dense, paranoid club, Hollywood, he was loathed, feared and envied. Then he bumped up against an obstacle. Granted carte blanche for his movie debut, he couldn’t decide what to do, or how to write it. He grew frustrated and angry with this dilemma, and he was a large boy with a frightening temper. There was a furious fight at Chasen’s restaurant where Welles threw hot dishes at Houseman. This ended the most sustaining working relationship Orson would ever have. Houseman was highly creative though overawed by Welles, and half in love with him – maybe two-thirds – and he is presented in Mank as a fusspot stooge. Houseman was suddenly an outcast. Whereupon, Welles thought to enlist Herman J Mankiewicz as a rescuing screenwriter. Mank was 43 in 1940 (Gary Oldman is 62). He was brilliant but washed up, a famous wit and a chronic drunk. He had never written anything remotely like Citizen Kane – and he never did again – but he was intrigued by the scheme of a film about a great American achiever, just as he was fascinated by the outrageous, childlike Orson. Orson was full of ideas (and it was a given that he would play the great achiever). But he guessed the writing would be better done without his presence. Mank had had a driving accident. With a leg broken in three places, he needed bed rest. Thus a lovely setup was devised: Mank would be shipped off to a desert ranch with a good secretary to write a draft of the script. But there were worries: Mank was incorrigible, adept at finding booze in a desert, and not exactly disciplined. He needed looking after. The idea arose – and it had to come from Orson or have his approval – that Houseman might be the ideal caretaker at Rancho Verde on the edge of the Mojave desert. If his wounded love could be wooed back again. Houseman consented, and I think he realised that Welles wanted him for one devious reason: that the great achiever in their story would be based on Orson. Later on, the legend spread that the figure resembled William Randolph Hearst. There were several touches of Hearst in Kane. But the notion of a dazzling, arrogant talent – an outstanding performer – was a reflection of Orson’s seething ego. And he knew that no one knew that guy better than Jack Houseman. There would be fierce arguments over who wrote what: Orson and Mank shared the writing credit, and the only Oscar Kane received. That argument over authorship goes on. But the situation is of three pretenders and manipulators playing a kind of chess. There is no reason for this film now without it grasping that reckless game. Instead, Fincher idles away two hours with stuff that doesn’t matter – a feeble, confused and tiresome gloss on what Hollywood was like in the late 1930s, instead of an explanation of how this extraordinary, subversive film came into being."
"Errol Morris calls it the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern approach to history. “Don’t interview Hamlet,” says the Oscar-winning documentary maker. “He’s going to be, after all, endlessly equivocal. Why not interview Rosencrantz and Guildenstern? It’s a different way into a story, and sometimes a different way in can be really insightful and interesting.” Morris’s latest work is not, therefore, a biographical film about Timothy Leary, the high priest of LSD described by Richard Nixon as “the most dangerous man in America”. Instead the protagonist is Leary’s ex-girlfriend Joanna Harcourt-Smith, who got high with him in Europe, went on the run with him to Afghanistan and pressed for his release from prison in America. My Psychedelic Love Story serves up a cavalcade from rock stars to the filthy rich, from counterculture gurus to sinister government agents, as the hopeful flower power of the 1960s gives way to a darker decade: Nixon’s war on drugs, the Watergate scandal and the type of conspiracies and paranoia that infused films such as Three Days of the Condor. “It’s quite a collection of characters and a portrait, in many ways, of an age,” says Morris, 72, speaking by phone from his office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “My focus wasn’t primarily on Leary and trying to answer these questions, is he a good man, is he a bad man, did he betray people, did he not betray people? “I’ve heard over the years a lot of negative things about Leary but again, that’s not the underlying idea of the film. In many ways, it’s a little girl’s story, falling in love and being plunged into this kind of 70s nightmare. It’s interesting for that reason alone.” Among the film’s beautiful montages and visual effects are recurring cartoon snippets from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. With its combination of innocence and trippiness, it is a fitting metaphor for the free-spirited Harcourt-Smith. She was born at the Palace Hotel in St Moritz in Switzerland in 1946. Her father, a commander in the British navy, died when she was 10. Her mother was a wealthy heiress who “bragged she made love with Mussolini”, Harcourt-Smith recalls in one of many casually dropped eye-popping asides. She is disarmingly frank about her childhood in Paris. She removes her spectacles and breaks down when recalling how she yielded to pressure and falsely accused a gardener of inappropriately touching her; he was consequently taken to prison. Conversely, when she sexually molested by her mother’s chauffeur, her mother would have none of it, observing coldly: “Good chauffeurs are hard to find.” Such experiences, Harcourt-Smith says, were a motivation to seek out Leary, a prominent psychologist who pushed the idea that psychedelics could “cure” trauma. She quickly fell under his spell and the fact that he was a fugitive from justice – he had escaped from prison in California, where he had been serving a 10-year sentence for drugs offences – only added to the allure (“I always wanted to be with an outlaw”). It did not matter that he was 26 years her senior. She says: “I loved him. I had known him for six weeks. We had travelled like shooting stars across Europe, taken acid every day, plunging into the maddest romantic relationship you could ever imagine.” They went to Vienna and Beirut but on arrival in Kabul were instantly arrested by American agents. Harcourt-Smith poignantly recalls how Leary accompanied her to a hotel toilet in the Afghan capital. “He got down on his knees. I don’t know why it still just makes me cry today. It was such an act of tenderness in that moment that was frenetically terrifying. Timothy getting down on his knees, carefully, minutiaesly [sic] cleaning the toilet. I felt protected in this moment of horror.” The couple were flown to California where Leary went back to prison. Harcourt-Smith wrote him daily letters, coating the stamps in LSD, and smuggled more acid to him via her belly button when she visited. She was also the public face of efforts to win his release. Eventually, after three and a half years, he walked free – but only on condition that he become a federal informant. It was regarded as a rank betrayal by the millions he had urged to “turn on, tune in and drop out”. Some blamed Harcourt-Smith for effectively putting a nail in the coffin of the 1960s. Allen Ginsberg, the beat poet, wondered if she was “a sex spy, agente provocateuse, double-agent, CIA hysteric, jealous tigress or what?” In the film she describes how the accusation left her questioning for decades whether she had been manipulated into becoming a government pawn, a “Mata Hari”. Morris, whose works include The Thin Blue Line and The Fog of War, reflects: “She asks herself, ‘Was I a CIA plant? Was I being used by the federal government in some way?’ Without ever really knowing the answer. “My guess is that they were involved in some way. It’s a high-profile case. Leary was, of course, of interest to the federal government, enough of an interest that they pursued him to Afghanistan – extradited him or kidnapped him or however you want to describe it – and brought him back to California. So that much is part of the story. That much we definitely do know.” Leary and Harcourt-Smith tried to begin a new life in a witness protection programme but there was to be no happy ending. They argued and one day Leary suddenly disappeared; Harcourt-Smith still appears puzzled and hurt. At 30, she started over, marrying more than once and becoming a mother and grandmother. But those LSD-fuelled adventures with Leary, which she had hoped would heal past traumas, lingered as a trauma of their own that took decades to get out of her system. In 2013 she published a memoir, Tripping the Bardo With Timothy Leary: My Psychedelic Love Story. Then she made contact with Morris and he read it. “I thought there was a movie in it, but I can’t say that I had some clear understanding of what that movie would be. I knew I liked Joanna from talking with her on the phone and then the interview turned out to be something unexpected.” Morris interviewed Harcourt-Smith for about 15 hours over two days last December at a house in Boston using his signature “Interrotron”, a system in which two teleprompters connect to two cameras and allow for the interviewee to look directly into the interviewer’s eyes. The coronavirus pandemic forced Morris to abandon plans for dramatisations and other context, ensuring a tight focus on Harcourt-Smith and her narration. To go back to his Hamlet analogy, it is a chance to dwell in a long soliloquy. The film-maker says: “It’s something that I very much like: the character that is investigating themselves in the course of the story that they’re telling. It’s true in any good exploration of a character. “I was asked, I suppose at the time of Fog of War [an epic interview with former defence secretary Robert McNamara], which was done with the Interrotron, are you aware you only interviewed one person, which was kind of heretical, not the way these things are usually done or not the way they were usually done in the past. “My thought has been if you’re telling a story about a crime, the mystery of who did it or what transpired, you want to interview a lot of people. You want to try to encompass the mystery to examine it. But if you’re trying to examine a person, their underlying psychology of who they are, how they see themselves, better to interview one person and only one person. “In many ways, My Psychedelic Love Story is a return to that earlier form of constructing a movie. Even though you hear Timothy Leary’s voice and you have an extraordinary tape that came out of Vacaville [prison], it still is a first person story, primarily with Joanna Harcourt-Smith.” But just as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, it comes as a shock at the end of the film to discover that Joanna Harcourt-Smith is dead. She succumbed to breast cancer last month at her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the age 74. It is hard to reconcile this fact with the vivid, mischievous, luminous presence on screen in My Psychedelic Love Story. Morris spoke to her two or three days before her death. “I was able to show her the movie before she died and I understand she may have watched it five, six, seven or more times,” he says. “I suppose even nicer to hear than the fact that she loved the movie is that the movie gave her comfort.” Thanks to Morris, something of her will live on forever on film. He muses: “We have these distinctions between drama and documentary. Sometimes they’re clearcut, sometimes they’re not so clearcut, but there’s this idea that there is no element of performance in documentary and that is just untrue. “Speaking as somebody who has made a few of them over the years, performance becomes a very big part of them and she’s very much alive in front of the camera in a way that seems quite extraordinary.”"
"Here is a promising idea for a scary movie that proves to be unscary and uninteresting in the most baffling, frustrating way. It starts out with a weird echo of the Hangover movies, then morphs into a variation on classic horrors such as The Wicker Man and even Rosemary’s Baby – but with none of the dark impish wit that you’d hope for with borrowings like those. Maggie Q plays vacationer Christine, who one morning wakes from a heavy sleep in her rented Airbnb on a lovely little Thai island, alongside her equally insensible partner Neil, played by Luke Hemsworth (brother of Liam and Chris). Money and passports are missing and they can’t remember what on earth went on the previous night. A video on Neil’s camera indicates that it was something extremely disturbing, perhaps connected with the typhoon that is supposedly on its way to the island and the existence of a strange ritual ceremony involving the entire local community.  Christine and Neil do their best to forget the awful things they have seen on the video and to escape the island somehow, and they figure they can count on the Airbnb owner Samantha (Alex Essoe). But the Thai locals, with their opaque manner and incomprehensible language, are not reassuring. Quite aside from the rather casual way Thai people are cast in the role of sinister predators and pagan conspirators, there is the dullness of the execution: moderate performances with borderline-embarrassing “What’s going on?” acting and endless drone shots over the Thai landscape. One to miss."
"Carlos Casas’s Cemetery arrives on the arthouse streaming service Mubi, a slow sensory film with a magnetic pull of strangeness; it may test the endurance of even Mubi’s hardcore highbrow audience. Somewhere between an experimental art piece and a nature documentary, there’s no story here in the normal sense, and it’s almost entirely wordless. Which is not to say that Cemetery is silent; wildlife audio recordist Chris Watson has put together a wondrously rich sonic landscape of nature sounds. The setting is Sri Lanka, where an elderly elephant called Nga makes his way to the mythical elephant graveyard. In the first chapter Nga and his human keeper – a mahout – live alongside each other deep in a forest. Casas has said that Nga is a well-known elephant in Sri Lanka, as famous as George Clooney; though surely he’s more of a Bogart – lugubrious and leather-faced. The camera lingers for 30 or 40 seconds at a time in closeups of different parts of Nga. It gets right up to one of his orangey-brown eyes, almost comically tiny on such a huge head. You find yourself searching for meaning, and Casas is perhaps saying something here about our need to anthropomorphise the natural world. Elsewhere, he creates the point-of-view of the elephant, lumbering through the trees. In chapter two, poachers arrive, violating the scene with guns and charging the atmosphere with danger. Chapter three feels almost like a parody, as Nga approaches the graveyard in the dead of night: for over 15 minutes the screen is almost entirely black, though the soundtrack is alive with insect chirps. You could just as easily picture this film playing on the white walls of a gallery as a cinema – if either were open."
"‘This might be the safest place on Earth!” Uh oh. A flamboyant entrepreneur is reassuring a group of tourists in a glass elevator at his volcano theme park – built on an active volcano in the Pacific Rim. The tourists are about to descend 150 metres inside the volcano. A cute kid pushes her nose up against the glass in wide-eyed wonder. Double uh oh. Skyfire is China’s first big budget disaster movie, an earnest emotional blockbuster with disappointing special effects that barely register on the Richter scale of excitement. What it does have, however, is a credible female hero in the Tom-Cruise-dangling-out-of-a-helicopter-in-Ray-Bans mould. She is Meng Li (Hannah Quinlivan), a hot-headed young volcanologist who works at the theme park. When the volcano suddenly erupted 20 or so years ago, it killed her scientist mother. The next eruption isn’t due for 150 years, but Meng Li has detected unusual activity in the core. The park’s owner is entrepreneur Jack Harris, played by English actor Jason Isaacs with a Trumpy orange tan. His scenes are mostly in English and the movie is directed by a Brit, Simon West (Con Air and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). Harris won’t listen to Meng Li’s concerns. “Give the guests free drink” he snaps as the volcano starts spewing; he’s a textbook corporate bad guy. Actually, all the characters in the film are thumbnail-sketches – even Meng Li, who is driven to finish the research project her mother began on the volcano. Her estranged dad, also a scientist, shows up for a bit of family healing and father-daughter heroics, rescuing holidaymakers and folk from a nearby village. The best action set-piece is a vertigo-sufferer’s worst nightmare, with passengers leaping from one cable car to another mid-air. But mostly this isn’t the thrill-ride you might be hoping for. There’s plenty of fire but, oddly, not much heat."
"This end-of-the-world comedy premiered at Sundance in January 2020 – in the Before Time – and, had the coronavirus pandemic not struck, directors Alex Huston Fischer and Eleanor Wilson’s unabashedly micro-budget lark might have felt slight, contrived or negligible. Instead, given the circumstances, it feels oddly prescient, resonant and surprisingly moving, although it doesn’t quite stick the landing. Still, for the most part it manages an adept balance between satire, sincerity and sheer silliness that’s ultimately winning. The basic donnée has childless, heterosexual millennial couple Su (Sunita Mani from Glow) and Jack (John Reynolds) yearning to disconnect for a while from all the electronic dummies we can’t stop sucking on: phones, laptops, digital assistants. A friend offers them a cabin to stay in where they can enjoy lazy hours in a rowboat, to learn how to split logs with an axe (Jack is hilariously bad at this), and time to really connect with each other and their deepest feelings. After watching an unexpected meteor shower (shades of The Day of the Triffids), Su and Jack are puzzled when they notice a fluffy pouffé-like sphere on the floor that they don’t remember seeing before. Even more concerning: something has eaten all the sourdough starter and artisanal whiskey. Fischer and Wilson tease it out for an unexpectedly long time before they have the pennies drop in their protagonists’ heads that something is terribly, terribly wrong. Before that, much mirth is had with the two of them being perfectly oblivious to all the clues and signs around them, like random people running through the woods in terror in the background, or aliens scooting just out of sight like real-life sonic-speed hedgehogs. The joke is that urbanites are just too good at tuning out noise and craziness, and are useless when it comes to real survival skills. Jack even resists getting a rifle they need for protection because having a gun in the house dramatically increases your chances of accidental death. Mani and Reynolds present just likable enough figures that as much as they’re fun to laugh at, you don’t want to see them either shot or brain-drained by evil extraterrestrial fake-fur bean bags."
"The displacement of theatrical releases during the pandemic, forced into an often confusing digital netherworld, has meant that we have little to no idea just how well certain films have performed this year. Studios are reticent to reveal how many of us are willing to fork out $20 for a night on the couch. While, yes, we’ll all survive as a people without ever knowing the numbers attached to Scoob!, there is something a little disheartening about never knowing what an impact the lesbian-led Christmas comedy Happiest Season would have had at the box office. Originally intended for a wide cinema release from Sony, its very existence as a shamelessly mainstream and unashamedly gay studio crowd-pleaser was in itself a small victory, with queer stories still kept within the restrictive outskirts of Hollywood. Instead, it’s now headed to Hulu in the US, which brings with it by no means a small audience, but one accustomed to a more diverse set of stories, a low-stakes click less of a bold statement than a ticket. Commercial impact is obviously not the most important way to judge a film’s success, especially as streaming continues to extend shelf-life, but for one as rare as this, for penny-pinching, tunnel-visioned studio execs, having proof, as depressing as that might sound, that, yes, a mass audience will happily head to see a gay movie, remains important (it’s no coincidence that Happiest Season was given the green light just two months after Love Simon became a modest hit in 2018). It’s therefore a shame that we’ll never get to see any tangible result but in a way it also takes the heat off, allowing Happiest Season to be exactly what it is without any added hurdle: warm comfort food at a time when many of us need it the most. The set-up (one that bears more than a passing resemblance to Jenna Laurenzo’s 2018 Thanksgiving comedy Lez Bomb) sees girlfriends Harper (Mackenzie Davis) and Abby (Kristen Stewart) heading into two very different holiday seasons. For Harper, it means travelling to see her Waspy family while for Abby, whose parents died a decade prior, it means pet-sitting and waiting for Christmas to be over. But on a romantic December evening, Harper invites Abby back with her, a grand statement to her family who have never met Abby before. On the way, Harper fills her in on one slight issue: she’s not come out to her family and to survive the holiday, they must pretend to be friends. It’s a situation that many queer people can loosely relate to: dating someone whose comfort with their sexuality is far less progressed, and it can be an unpleasant, at times psychologically unhealthy, place to be in. While the writer-director Clea DuVall (best known for her presence in front of the camera in The Faculty and Girl Interrupted) and the co-writer Mary Holland have used it as the basis for a zippy holiday comedy, there is also a growing awareness throughout of the emotional weight that comes with such deception. So while Happiest Season works remarkably well as a straightforward Christmas movie, a wittier, warmer cousin to The Family Stone perhaps, there’s also a level of nuance and grit that one wouldn’t usually expect from something quite so festive and quite so glossy. There is a certain amount of self-censorship and performance within any family dynamic, and having fun with how that plays out is a vital ingredient of broad comedies such as this (seeing your other half around their family for the first time is an adjustment regardless of the sitcom set-up). But what makes Happiest Season that much more effective is that for queer people, self-censorship and performance are already a part of so many other dynamics, a deeply embedded awareness of difference that requires us to construct and break down a wall of protection depending on the situation. Harper’s family – perfectionist parents played by Mary Steenburgen and Victor Garber and sisters, one brittle and joyless played by Alison Brie and one puppyish and perpetually sidelined played by Holland – have a more uncomfortably airless dynamic than most and for Harper to be gay when her box-ticking script has already been written for her seems impossible and it causes a rift between her and Abby, who starts to question whether she wants to be taken back into the closet by someone she thought she loved. The subtle choreography of what it feels like for Abby to be left out of Harper’s family, to be treated as a friend rather than a partner, to see her usually warm and affectionate girlfriend freeze in front of her, is quietly aching to watch for it acts as a reminder for Abby that no matter how progressive things might seem, there is always going to be a gap between how we want things to be and how they are. Stewart, who isn’t always the most comfortable in a broader studio setting, works incredibly well here, selling her nervy, and often very funny, comic moments while also adding depth to some of the last act sentiment. There’s an effortless chemistry between her and Davis as well as her and Aubrey Plaza, playing Harper’s secret ex with a bittersweet backstory, who gets to be more than just a bitchy spanner in the works. So many of the characters, who could otherwise have been treated like one-note types, get more flesh than usual from Dan Levy as Abby’s best friend to Holland, who threatens to steal the whole movie with her consistently funny, and actually rather tragic, ignored sister act. Near the end, DuVall and Holland put a few steps wrong with some slightly over-egged physical comedy and a final “No, I’m sorry” meet-back-up-cute that doesn’t land with enough of an impact, but they also avoid some obvious cliches, refusing to smooth out some of the film’s established creases, so while the happy ending is happy it’s not one without caveats. Happiest Season exists within well-worn framework but still feels fresh, a sprightly and substantial comedy that will be an immediate addition to the Christmas movie rotation for many, including myself. We may never know just how many people would have paid to go see a mainstream gay movie such as this but there is something comforting about a wide cross-section of families gathering over the next month to easily watch, and enjoy, it together, a pre-warmed blanket of a movie to remind us that lesbians aren’t just for depressing period dramas and fetishistic thrillers, they’re for Christmas too."
"This is a candid, sober, well-acted debut by the first-time director Ruthy Pribar which won her the Nora Ephron award at this year’s Tribeca film festival – an admirable choice, though it’s up for discussion as to how exactly it “embodies the spirit” of Ephron as the winner is supposed to.  The setting is Jerusalem where Asia (Alena Yiv) is a Russian Jewish incomer to Israel. She is in her mid-30s, working as a nurse and looking after her teenage daughter, Victoria, or Vika, whom she had very young – excellent work from Shira Haas. Vika has never had a boyfriend; as for Asia, she has a kind of friends-with-benefits relationship with a doctor, Stas (Gera Sandler), who for unexplained reasons connected with his own situation can’t take her back to his place.  In any case, Asia is not ready to think of settling down, and now that Vika has more independence, refusing to do so might give her more freedom. But a health crisis with Vika creates a crisis in the way Asia thinks of herself as a woman and a mother, and causes Asia and Vika to become close to a nurse in her hospital: Gabi (Tamir Mula), whose own feelings have to be taken into account.  There is intelligence, intimacy and delicacy in the way the drama is presented, which takes it above the level of TV movie of the week. But I wasn’t entirely convinced by a plot turn concerning a certain startling proposal that Asia puts to Gabi, who is looking after Vika. It’s not clear if we are supposed to see it as a well-intended but misjudged idea that reveals a rather cavalier attitude to Gabi, or if it is a bold and courageous plan, revealing her own dedication. There are some very good performances."
"There is a tendency among audiences – including, sometimes, even the best of critics – to judge movies by how much we warm to their characters. An “unlikable protagonist” surfaces again and again in reviews as a strike against a film: a problem, certainly, in a romantic comedy where you’d rather throttle both leads than applaud their happy ending. But it’s not so in every case, and few film-makers have dedicated themselves to testing the viewer’s sympathies as consistently as Martin Scorsese. From Taxi Driver through to The Wolf of Wall Street via The King of Comedy and Goodfellas, his cinema specialises in antihero figures as hard to love as they are to look away from. Even in more conventional story forms, he complicates things: Cape Fear muddied the victim-villain boundary between Robert De Niro’s psychotic killer and Nick Nolte’s corrupt family man, while The Age of Innocence honoured the spirit of Edith Wharton, denying audiences a clear outcome to root for in a love triangle between variously cool, compromised or manipulative participants. Yet the ne plus ultra of Scorsese’s fixation with, shall we say, challenging protagonists remains Raging Bull, the director’s first and greatest foray into the often fusty realm of the biopic. Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader’s subject was a well-known one: former world middleweight champion boxer Jake LaMotta’s autobiography had been published in 1970, cementing a celebrity legend built on equal parts sporting prowess and turbulent personal chaos. Robert De Niro latched on to it, convinced it would make an ideal vehicle for his gutsy talents; over several years, his attempts to persuade Scorsese to develop it proved fruitless, with the sports-averse film-maker professing no interest in making a boxing film. Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler had recently made a fortune (and won an Oscar) by steering the underdog blockbuster Rocky; right after that, they’d tasted failure by producing Scorsese’s still-underrated musical megabomb New York, New York. One wonders what their joint thought process was as they, too, set about talking Scorsese into Raging Bull: having experienced the director’s artistic particularities at their most extreme and expensive, they must have known another Rocky-style box-office fighter wasn’t on the cards. But LaMotta’s story itself made that clear enough: rarely has such top-tier talent and major-studio investment been ploughed into a film about, pretty much any way you slice it, a grade-A asshole. Even with LaMotta on board as an officially credited consultant, the finished film makes no attempt to conceal that truth. As we follow him from the early 1940s to the mid-1960s, LaMotta enters proceedings a selfish, violent, abusive hothead and leaves them much the same way, only with the accumulated baggage of career decline and bodily damage. In between, we see him mentally and physically torment two wives, proposition underage girls, and viciously alienate his loyal brother and manager – the ugly violence of the film’s domestic drama scarcely distinguishable in intensity from the brutal, blood-spilling boxing footage that punctuates it. In screenwriting-manual terms, it’s not much of a story. We follow LaMotta’s boxing career through a few alternating highs and lows, before segueing into his woebegone second calling as a standup comic and nightclub owner; his marriages gradually dissolve, passing through shouting matches but ending with a whimper; his tortured love-hate relationship with his brother (a character excised from the script’s first draft, but the principal source of tension throughout) remains in limbo throughout. More is lost than is learned or gained. Yet as realised by Scorsese and performed by De Niro, the result feels vital: a study of unchecked masculine anger and thrashing insecurity that feels exhilaratingly unbeholden to Hollywood requirements of redemption and catharsis. In a genre dominated by stories of triumph over adversity, Raging Bull offers us the tougher reality of triumph and adversity existing side by side, before the latter eventually swallows the former: not all wounded men heal, or learn to stop wounding others. Between Michael Chapman’s grainy, fluid black-and-white cinematography and the film’s organic, untidily layered sound design, Scorsese’s chosen aesthetic seemed to expressly recall the postwar Italian neo-realism that reached American cinemas when LaMotta was in his prime, and if so, that was no empty affectation: like that movement, Raging Bull sought to strip its storytelling of undue romance and aspirational artifice, to present working-class life as it was for many, with its unvarnished share of unlikable people. Even the targets of LaMotta’s ire aren’t softened or sweetened for our sympathy. His teenage bride Vickie (brilliantly underplayed by Cathy Moriarty in her screen debut) is a remote, elusive figure, hardened by mistreatment into a fixed, opaque emotional state. Joey (Joe Pesci, beginning his sporadic, long-term Scorsese collaboration) is more expressive but harshly so, kinder than Jake perhaps only because he lacks his physical menace: interestingly, Scorsese and Schrader give us nothing of the brothers’ family or upbringing, but an inheritance of violence is clear in their every shared scene. The hard veneer shared by those closest to LaMotta winds up telling us a great deal about his cracked one: Raging Bull never invites us to like this growing ogre of a man, but gradually folds us into its own empathy for his crazed, cruel interior, stunted by a lifetime of enforced fighting. Unsurprisingly, mainstream audiences did not bite: released at the end of 1980, the film took a modest $23m in the US, only just making back its budget. Respect for Scorsese’s artistry was enough to earn the film a leading eight Oscar nominations, though it lost most of them: Academy voters, much like general punters, don’t especially care for clear-eyed studies of irredeemable figures, particularly with Robert Redford’s fine, emotionally stirring family melodrama Ordinary People as a perfectly credible alternative. De Niro, at least, managed to take best actor. His competition was resistible, and in all likelihood, the sheer method-y physical feat of his performance – famously, he gained over 60 pounds to portray the older, ruined LaMotta – helped persuade those cool on the film itself. That would have been the wrong reason to award the right performance, however: what makes his LaMotta chilling and indelible isn’t merely his ballooning form or his expert voice manipulation or his visceral commitment to the pummelling fight, but his hard-won excavation of a broken soul in a character whose vulnerabilities don’t necessarily elicit sympathy. In a stroke of peculiar genius, Raging Bull closes on De Niro’s LaMotta reciting Marlon Brando’s immortal “coulda been a contender” monologue from On the Waterfront: an actor threading a character’s bruised bravado through that of another actor, as reality and performance and delusion clash and clatter in the ring. Forty years on, Raging Bull still doesn’t go easy on its subject, on its star, or on us."
"Ed Murray, a brother of the actor Bill Murray who inspired the 1980 cult comedy Caddyshack, has died. A statement by William Murray Golf, the Murray family’s golf wear company, said: “It’s with the heaviest of hearts that we announce the passing of the legend Ed Murray. “His loss is a hole that will never be filled. Thank you for always being so gracious, Ed. Our hearts are with his lovely family. Rest in paradise, to a true family man and a gentle, sweet soul. May we honour your memory from this day forward.” The statement did not specify Ed Murray’s age or cause of death. Murray started caddying aged 10, the statement said, before receiving a scholarship for golf caddies and attending Northwestern University. He served as inspiration for the character of Danny Noonan, played by Michael O’Keefe, in Caddyshack, which also starred Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield and was co-written by another brother, Brian Doyle-Murray. Directed by Harold Ramis, the film follows the story of Noonan, who works at an exclusive golf course. The comedy developed a cult following, with ESPN describing it as “perhaps the funniest sports movie ever made”. According to a 2015 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Ed Murray was a businessman who worked in broadcasting and later stockbroking. He said he started caddying at the Indian Hill club in Winnetka, Illinois, carrying a bag for professional Sam Bernardi. He also caddied for golfer Chick Evans, evangelist Billy Graham and comedian Bob Hope. “People are equal on the golf course and they were all gentlemen,” he said. According to the statement from William Murray Golf, Ed Murray was “named after the family patriarch” and “introduced the Murray family to this wonderful game of golf”. Another brother, the actor Joel Murray, wrote on Twitter: “Ed was the nice Murray who remembered everyone’s name.”"
"There’s a long history of rightwing antipathy towards progressive racebending – if we can even call it that – in the movies. From Idris Elba as Heimdall in Marvel’s Thor films to John Boyega starring as stormtrooper Finn in the Star Wars sequel trilogy and even Halle Bailey as the Little Mermaid, there’s something about seeing black people in roles that might once have been played by white actors that really gets under the skin of organisations such as the Council of Conservative Citizens. The fact that nobody has any idea what levels of melanin Norse gods and mermaids had, or what the imperial troops looked like with their helmets off in the original Star Wars trilogy seems to have been conveniently forgotten. Lately, the culture war seems to have moved into more insidious territory. Rather than just spitting bile on horrible forums that the rest of us can happily ignore, fascist types have taken to “review-bombing” movies that don’t fit with their worldview, a process whereby trolls target a film’s user-generated IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes rating in an effort to stop people seeing it. The latest movie to suffer is the fantasy drama Come Away, which stars the British actor David Oyelowo and Angelina Jolie as parents of a young boy and girl, Alice and Peter, who use their imaginations to overcome family strife. The “problem” here for those of a certain disposition, of course, is that the film (out in the US at the weekend and available in the UK from 4 December), is intended as a prequel of sorts to Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, meaning that both children are presented as being of mixed race. “I would be lying if I said I was surprised by it,” said Oyelowo of the review-bombing during an interview on Tamron Hall. “I’ve had other films that have had this done to them. Famously, we saw John Boyega having to deal with this because people didn’t like the idea of a black stormtrooper or Halle Bailey as the Little Mermaid. “For me personally, to see Keira Chansa as Alice from Alice in Wonderland or Jordan Nash as Peter, that’s what I didn’t get to see when I was 12 years old and I know that it would have slightly changed and reshaped my world view about where I fit in the world,” he said. “And at the end of the day, these are fictional characters in a fantasy fairytale, so it’s not any kind of displacement in terms of history. It’s just seeing these kids in the middle of this fantasy, which I think most kids would like to see.” Perhaps rather than asking themselves how these famous literary characters could possibly be played by people of colour, those opposing the film might consider looking at things from the opposite direction? Director Brenda Chapman reveals in an interview with IndieWire that she almost passed over Oyelowo’s profile when considering who should play the role of Jack, Peter and Alice’s dad, before realising he was the perfect choice. “I was disappointed – oh, it’s too bad, I’d love to work with him – and I moved on and then I sort of went back to his name like, wait a minute, why not?,” said Chapman. “And then, going through the story in my mind, it was like, I don’t need to change anything. It would open up the story so much more.” Seen from this perspective, the proper question might be whether it would be fair to deny Oyelowo the chance to appear in the role simply because the original tales of Alice and Wonderland and Peter Pan were written at a time when the demographics of Victorian and Edwardian Britain were different from those of today. Is it that important to follow supposed historical precedent, especially when dealing with fantasy worlds where fairies and dragons really exist and it is possible to fly, shrink down to a tiny size and even meet invisible cats? As Elba once said of his casting as Heimdall: “Thor has a hammer that flies to him when he clicks his fingers. That’s OK, but the colour of my skin is wrong?”"
"Of all the things you might expect to hear come from the mouth of Tahar Rahim, the charismatic French-Algerian star of the hit prison thriller A Prophet and the new serial-killer series The Serpent, the least likely must be: “Have you ever heard of Tring?” Yet here he is, speaking over Zoom from his home in Paris, and dumping on the sleepy Hertfordshire market town. “There’s nothing to do there,” he says. “It’s got, like, a main street and that’s it.” It’s unlikely the 39-year-old would ever have visited but for the pandemic, which interrupted the shooting of The Serpent, a BBC/Netflix production, for five months. Once filming resumed in August, a return to the original locations in Thailand was out of the question. Somewhat implausibly, Tring stepped in. As it turns out, the break was beneficial. For one thing, Rahim’s second child was born earlier this year. He and his wife, the actor Leïla Bekhti, now have a three-year-old son and an 11-month-old daughter. (The couple met in 2008 while shooting A Prophet.) For another, it gave him a chance to reflect on his work so far, playing the remorseless real-life murderer Charles Sobhraj, nicknamed The Serpent because of his ability to slither out of the clutches of the law. Sobhraj killed at least 10 young backpackers making their way across south-east Asia in the 1970s. They were poisoned, strangled, stabbed and, in some cases, burned alive. An extraordinary series of identity thefts, arrests, escapes and even a jailbreak followed, making him a shameless media star. As recently as 2014, GQ magazine ran a splashy interview with this “funny, enigmatic, absurd and engaging” psychopath. “Usually I start building a character from the inside,” Rahim tells me. “I try to find bridges psychologically between me and him, but here there was nothing. Regular people, balanced people, we don’t know what it is to not have empathy. He’s a murderer, a manipulator. He’s what you don’t want to be.” The solution was to begin with the external. “Those who had met him talked about how he moved and spoke, and I started to assemble the puzzle. I thought of him as an animal. Of course, a serpent. But which one? Ah – a cobra. It stares at you. Then boom! – it strikes.” Actor and character couldn’t be more different. A broad, Robert De Niro-style grin regularly engulfs Rahim’s face, reducing his eyes to little dashes. But, as Sobhraj, he scarcely smiles and doesn’t move unless it’s imperative. “Tahar is such a beautiful soul,” says the former Doctor Who star Jenna Coleman, who plays his accomplice, Marie-Andrée. “The way he played Charles was very contained, which is not Tahar at all. He isn’t a still person: he’s really quite fidgety. He was going to the gym because he had to get rid of this dark, dynamic energy he was carrying with him.” Rahim transformed himself physically, too, topping up his fake tan every few days, shaving his body hair (“It hurts, man!”) and wearing facial prosthetics when playing the older Sobhraj. The result is a sleek, almost laminated look. He intended initially to meet the man himself, who is now 76 and in poor health in prison in Nepal, but decided against it. “I wanted to see how he would con me,” he says. “Then I thought, ‘I don’t want to meet this type of guy. I’ll find another way.’” Does he worry that it will feed Sobhraj’s considerable ego to see himself portrayed by a handsome, talented movie star? Rahim swivels sideways in his office chair so that he’s sitting in profile while he ponders the question. “Maybe he’ll say, ‘They’re all talking about me!’ Maybe he’ll think it’s bullshit. I don’t know.” Isn’t it ghoulish to tell his story at all? “It’s in our nature to want to find out about him,” he says. “The less you know, the more you’re attracted. Fascination and repulsion – a very human feeling.” His own interest in Sobhraj dates back to when he was 14, growing up as the youngest of 10 in Belfort, a city near the French-Swiss border. He read a book about the killer that he found on his brother’s bedside table, and dreamed of one day playing him. “You think at that age that being a great actor is about picking the crazy parts. Over the course of my experience, I’ve realised that being a simple, normal guy might be the hardest thing to do.” It was as just such a simple, normal guy that he made his acting debut in 2005, playing a version of himself on French TV in Tahar, Student. Presented as documentary, this was actually scripted reality, with Rahim reenacting for the camera scenes from his own life. After appearing as a drug dealer in the TV series The Commune, his blistering breakthrough came with A Prophet. One of the joys of that film lies in seeing an actor, as well as a character, take shape before your eyes. Just as the young convict Malik is transformed over the course of two-and-a-half hours (and six years of prison time) from toerag to kingpin, so the actor playing him goes from face-in-the-crowd to fully fledged star. “It’s like I went up the red steps at Cannes,” he said in 2010, “and never came down.” That makes it sound like a lottery win, when in fact Rahim is famously industrious and indefatigable. “His work ethic is off the chart,” says Coleman. “He has this magical ability to keep on mining. On The Serpent, he would always want another take. He’d ask Tom Shankland, the director, for ‘one for free’. In the first week, it was, ‘Tom! Tom! Tu m’en laisses une libre.’ After that, it was shorthand: ‘Une libre?’ In those moments, you have no idea what he’s going to surprise you with. He’d steal a glass from me or suddenly kiss me. You never knew what was coming.” Ask Rahim about his approach and he puts it simply. “I look at my director and I say, ‘I’m your soldier. Whatever you ask me, if I can do it, I will.’” Rather than being dragged along in the celebrity slipstream immediately after A Prophet, he took his time weighing up offers, eventually starring with Channing Tatum in The Eagle, set in the second century AD. It would be a stretch to imagine a part further from kingpin Malik than this Gaelic-speaking warrior daubed from Mohawk-to-toe in loam. “I’m always trying to go in a different direction,” he says with a mischievous smile. His tastes skew toward the arthouse, with intense dramas such as Our Children, The Past and Heal the Living dominating his CV, though he also played a burglar mistaken for Santa Claus in Le Père Noël. That knockabout comedy, he says proudly, will be the first film of his that his kids get to see. He recently starred as Judas alongside Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara in Mary Magdalene, but for nearly a decade he rebuffed Hollywood’s advances. “A lot of what I was sent had to do with terrorism.” Given his Arab roots, he explains, he “didn’t want to be a tool for that sort of thing”. When he did agree to explore the theme – in the gripping 10-parter The Looming Tower about the US intelligence failures that helped make possible the 9/11 attacks – it resulted in his most complex performance to date. He played the FBI agent Ali Soufan, who was instrumental in efforts to thwart al-Qaida. Rahim’s American accent today is a hangover from that role, his native French cadences surfacing only sporadically. After The Serpent, he will be alongside Jodie Foster and Benedict Cumberbatch in The Mauritanian, out in February. He plays Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was held without charge in Guantánamo Bay for 14 years. Along with The Looming Tower, this suggests a bold philosophy emerging in his choices. What does he want his body of work to say about him? “If I can be part of a piece of cinema that teaches people something,” he says, “I’ll be happy.” And if the role is in English, so much the better. “I feel freer acting in English. Your face moves differently, your mouth, even your body. It makes you forget about the habits you used to have as an actor. It puts your soul in a different place, so you rediscover what you were at the very beginning.” Which was? He grins and swivels in his chair again. “A virgin.”"
"Psychological horror Saint Maud has emerged at the front of the pack for the British independent film awards (Bifas), closely followed by supernatural thriller His House and Rocks, the widely acclaimed film about east London schoolchildren.

"There’s no point in a fictional family reunion where long-buried resentments don’t painfully but cathartically resurface – and maybe no point in such a family reunion in real life, either. Dictynna Hood’s flawed, interesting low-budget indie is a vehemently performed, slightly Shakespearean drama, set over a few days in a Dartmoor farmhouse – the title appears to be about the area’s standing stones, though there are reminiscences of a shivery childhood visit to Stonehenge. Here, ageing matriarch and former hippy Marianne (Anna Calder-Marshall) and her testy husband Richard (Oliver Cotton) have summoned the extended clan for Marianne’s birthday because she is very ill, and possibly even dying. (“Here’s to the remission of sins and cancer!” runs one toast over the fractious dinner.) This movie might gain some attention because its star, playing the couple’s son Owen, is no less important a figure in British public life than Laurence Fox, and filming this could have been his last straight acting gig before he tasted the crack cocaine of “alt-right” celebrity. But let the record show that he gives a thoughtful, intelligent and extremely capable performance. Owen’s relationship with his Lebanese partner Carrie (Raia Haidar) is extremely troubled, and he hates his roguish uncle Jack (Greg Hicks) who has brought along his new, younger partner and baby. What terrible thing has Jack done? Hood has an intriguing visual technique in this movie of using old photos and Super-8 footage as sudden flashback-glimpses which are triggered in the drama – but also using “new” photos of what is happening now, perhaps to show that these moments themselves are destined to become memories: it is a kind of distancing effect, an “essay drama” rhetoric. However, another distancing effect is a bit less effective and rather odd. The baby in the story is often openly shown to be a doll, a fake. And sometimes the outbreaks of temper and emotion are a little contrived. Yet this is a fluent and distinctive, and heartfelt, piece of work with a strong sense of place."
"Bong Joon-ho’s climactic Oscar triumph in February with his scabrous satire Parasite seems now like something from another era. It was maybe the film world’s last happy international event and talking-point before the industry was plunged into lockdown, chaos and a fearful sense that things might never be the same again. But the spectacular success of Parasite brought a welcome revival on UK streaming services of so much of this director’s great back catalogue, including his remarkable Memories of Murder from 2003, based on South Korea’s then unsolved Hwaseong serial murders of the late 1980s – the film sparked an upsurge of interest in the case, and led finally to the culprit’s identification in 2019. Parasite continues to exert a grip, and even had the distinction of getting a luxury-connoisseur black-and-white version released. That was certainly an intriguing new slant, though in my view not as good as the richly and densely coloured original.Parasite, in all its cruelty and ingenuity, actually seems even more claustrophobically appropriate to our new world of hunkering down uneasily together with our families, and forming bubbles with other households, or perhaps transgressing, going into bubbles where we have no business and disobeying physical distancing rules. Perhaps the film is fundamentally about precisely this – the abolition of distancing rules, a world in which the underclass are cramped together and then get up close and personal with the overclass. It’s a film whose satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy. The anti-heroes are a dysfunctional family of parasites: dad is laid-back loafer Ki-taek (a wonderful performance from Bong’s veteran repertory player Song Kang-ho) and the mum is former track star Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin). The son is Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), a lazy young guy who never made it to college, and the daughter is Ki-jung (Park So-dam), a very cool customer with an artistic gift for web-based fraud. By fraudulently posing as a college student, Ki-woo gets a chance to tutor the teenage daughter of a very rich family who live in a spectacular modernist house in the grander part of town. Cunningly, Ki-woo can see how to get every single member of his family employed in this household – as a second tutor (daughter), housekeeper (mum) and chauffeur (dad), all pretending to be unrelated and complete strangers to each other. They are a whole family of cuckoos in a luxurious new nest. But the host family’s younger kid wonderingly points out that they all smell alike – and that they smell of poor people. Parasite is about an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers: it is about status envy, aspiration and materialism, about the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants whose intimacy so easily congeals into hostility. It’s comparable to the 1963 Joseph Losey classic The Servant in which Dirk Bogarde’s valet somehow gets the psychological upper hand over his master. And Parasite is also part of Korean cinema’s rich seam of “servant” dramas: like The Housemaid by Kim Ki-young in 1960, remade in 2010 by Im Sang-soo and also Park Chan-wook’s classic servant class mystery drama The Handmaiden.What it’s also about is visibility: the richer and more successful you are, the more visible you are – and financial shame or debt erases people, photoshops them from the picture, pushes them down into the basement of society. And Parasite gestures at something else: parasites are not in fact destined to be the underdogs forever. When their insidious, predatory work is complete, they become the masters: they are the face of power. Parasite positively hums with malice."
"It’s rare to encounter a film like The Father, a sterling, Oscar-worthy chamber piece of inarguably high quality but one that I would hesitate before instantly, enthusiastically recommending to most. It’s exquisitely acted and impressively, at times ingeniously, directed, and yet it deserves to be accompanied by a severe warning, one that will prove indispensable to certain viewers who’ll not just find it difficult to watch but close to impossible. It’s a drama about dementia that plays more like a horror, lit by a slowburn terror that something awful is happening to its elderly protagonist Anthony, played by Anthony Hopkins. He’s convinced that it’s some sort of trick, a pack of unending lies being told by his daughter Anne, played by Olivia Colman, whose stubborn inconsistency starts to read as some form of gaslighting. Rather than placing us with a beleaguered family member such as Anne as many films about this subject often do, writer-director Zeller, adapting his acclaimed play, forces us into Anthony’s fractured, unnerving, exhausting world where not only details shift but faces and places do, all within the blink of an eye. Sometimes his daughter is someone else, played by Olivia Williams, sometimes she’s married, sometimes she’s not, sometimes he’s in his flat, sometimes he’s in hers. What could have been another worthy disease-of-the-week movie is transformed into something far more terrifying and in turn, far more effective. It’s an unspeakably uncomfortable subject for those who know what it feels like to watch someone slowly disappear and it’s a film that will rightfully be avoided as a result. I can’t say that it provides much in the way of solace but it does humanise a character who we’re used to seeing patronised from a distance, with precious little depth. Aging on screen is still handled with kid gloves and with broad strokes, if handled at all, whether that be a result of our collective obsession with youth or a fear of truly confronting what comes next. But in Zeller’s tough-minded yet empathetic film, he refuses to shy away from the grit as well as the humanity, never losing sight of just how Anthony is feeling and how terrifying this grind of confusion must be. The most heartbreaking moments are often when he pretends to understand what he’s being confronted with rather than angrily reacting, a sad acceptance of a life of whiplash unpredictability. We’re in his flat for the most part but Zeller avoids the obvious accusation of staginess by constantly rearranging what we see in front of us, making us as confused as Anthony, dragging us deeper into the fog along with him. Our emotional investment is also secured by a sensational performance by Hopkins, registering every flicker of confusion and anger and upset in ways that slowly shatter because we not only see an elderly relative but we also see ourselves and what might happen when our brains start to betray us too. It’s the best he’s ever been, after a period of lesser challenges, a detailed and devastating turn that reminds us of the sheer, hard-to-rival power he possesses as an actor. The Father is a hard film to endure but then so it should be."
"During quarantine and its long, unending tail, my mind has often returned to Shirley, the psychodrama from director Josephine Decker and screenwriter Sarah Gubbins that imagines a chapter in the life of the mid-century horror master Shirley Jackson with her signature slippage of sanity. For one thing, the author, played exquisitely by Elisabeth Moss, was agoraphobic, often trapped for months indoors, the weight of anxiety consuming her house like gnarled, enchanted roots. It’s somewhat relatable. But the film’s standout is its slow-burn coda, as Shirley awaits her narcissistic husband, the literary critic Stanley Hyman’s (Michael Stuhlbarg), verdict on her latest novel. For nearly three minutes, the camera holds on Moss’s face, as Stanley paces out of the frame and finally, torturously delivers his review: “Your book is brilliant, darling.” You could be a sommelier of human emotion and still not catch every strand of feeling Moss seamlessly imbues each head jerk, eye twitch, labored breath. Among them: dread, resentment, triumph, rage, relief, the elation of outpacing demons, the frustration of knowing you’ll never fully be free. It’s a masterclass scene on top of an already incredible performance, a second hit for Moss this year (after the Invisible Man). Bouts of agoraphobia and writer’s block come and go, but for Shirley and many before and after, the tripwire that is (male) validation remains. Adrian Horton Mads Mikkelsen: fine actor, handsome bastard, meme king, drily witty interviewee, star of a Rihanna music video. Does he have to be a good dancer too? That Mikkelsen has moves is no secret: the 55-year-old Dane trained at a Swedish ballet academy in his youth, dancing professionally for a decade before turning to acting aged 30. But no film had fully capitalised on those skills until the startling climax of Another Round, Thomas Vinterberg’s mordantly funny, moving drama about voluntary alcoholism, in which Mikkelsen’s jaded schoolteacher – back on the booze that nearly ruined him, laden with conflicting emotions over the death of a friend and the uncertain status of his marriage – dances it all out in the street, amid hordes of revelling, newly graduated students. On paper, it sounds impossibly hokey. On screen, it’s beautiful and bittersweet and laced with danger: not a purely joyful moment of catharsis, but a visceral release that could turn to self-destruction at any moment. Beginning hesitantly before recklessly giving in to his own body, Mikkelsen plays (and dances) the scene exquisitely – many a Hollywood musical director will wonder how they could have missed him before now, but this vodka shot of choreographed splendour is all the more thrilling for coming out of the blue. Guy Lodge In his new film Tesla, writer-director Michael Almereyda has the good sense to realize that fidelity to the facts only holds the biopic form back, stifling more expressive ideas about our notion of a famed figure in favor of awkward, literal restaging. Almereyda takes a relaxed attitude to the details of electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla’s life, fine with the odd iPhone or Macbook here and there as a nod to the far-reaching technological influence that the inventor and his peers would have for generations to come. The film fully leaves its own reality behind in a seeming non sequitur coda that sees Tesla busting out an admirable karaoke rendition of Tears for Fears’ Everybody Wants to Rule the World against greenscreen backdrops. The song’s lyrical content presents a clear pun, landing like a punch line at the conclusion to a movie about brilliant men angling for their piece of history. But Ethan Hawke’s performance sells the emotionality of the moment, each word weighted with the painful knowledge that he and his cohort cannot stop the runaway train they’ve sent careening into the future. Charles Bramesco A modern and merciless spin on the classic novel, Leigh Whannell’s #MeToo horror movie takes HG Wells’s invisible bogeyman, and transforms him into the sociopathic ex-boyfriend of every woman’s nightmares. Donning a hi-tech invisibility suit, Adrian terrorizes his former beau Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) by committing violent pranks and systematically cutting her off from her inner circle. It’s typical abuser behavior that alienates the victim by making her seem insane and unstable. In a last-ditch effort before things go dramatically south, Cecilia convinces her sister to meet at a crowded downtown restaurant where she hopes to prove, with recently discovered evidence, that she’s not as crazy as she seems. Adrian wouldn’t pull any funny business in a public place, would he? Turns out he would. And in a genuinely shocking scene that upends what appears to be a rare stretch of catharsis and calm, a shiny knife levitates next to Cecilia’s head as she pours her heart out at the dinner table. The two women exchange disturbed glances before the weapon slices open her sister’s neck, and is placed immediately in Cecilia’s hand. It’s an expertly choreographed moment that unwinds drastic, life-changing consequences with a few strokes and in a matter of seconds. No one is safe and no place is off limits. And with the right tools, it only takes an instant to turn an innocent person into a raving lunatic. Beatrice Loayza It’s unlikely 2020 will be remembered for the laughs but this hilarious-yet-horrifying scene strikes just the right tone. The set-up: Sacha Baron Cohen, in double disguise as Borat as an “American”, buys his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) a cupcake with a little plastic baby figurine on top. In her excitement, Tutar accidentally swallows the figurine. So they head to the nearest “doctor”: actually a pregnancy centre in North Carolina run by anti-abortion Christians. Their every line is wide open to misinterpretation. “I have a baby inside me and I want to take it out of me,” Tutar tells the pro-life pastor. “I feel bad because I was the one who put the baby in her,” says Borat, slapping himself on the wrist. “I was just trying to give my daughter pleasure.” And so on. Appallingly, despite believing he is dealing with a genuine case of pregnancy by incest, the pastor insists Tutar keep the baby: “God is the one who creates life, and God doesn’t make accidents.” It’s multi-level brilliance: classic comedy of misunderstanding made all the funnier by the pranked pastor’s unwitting contribution, but also biting satire, revealing the true awfulness of Trump-era conservatism. History and comedy students alike should be studying it in years to come. Steve Rose Composer Lin-Manuel Miranda admitted that he will never top Hamilton’s emotional rollercoaster musical number Satisfied. Agreed! The song has Renee Elise Goldsberry showing off an exhilarating singing-and-rapping range reminiscent of Lauryn Hill, as her character Angelica pines for brother-in-law Alexander Hamilton (Miranda). But Satisfied’s emotional arc isn’t complete until a much later trap number: The Reynolds Pamphlet. In the show’s most breathtakingly intimate confrontation, Goldsberry’s Angelica returns to the stage to support her sister after Alexander makes his extra-marital affair public. The sequence brilliantly pivots between the private blow to the public humiliation. We lean in so close you can see Goldsberry’s jugular veins throbbing as she drops that crushing refrain: “God I hope you’re satisfied!” And then it takes a step back to catch pamphlets and dancers flying across the stage, while Daveed Diggs’s Thomas Jefferson chants, “Never gonna be president now.” The salt-on-the-wound is Jonathan Groff’s King George III’s hilariously petty prance across the stage, which left me gasping for air. Radheyan Simonpillai The release of Tenet was meant to make 2020 less complicated. Films would be back on the big screens and punters would be back on the reclining chairs lapping them up. But even by Christopher Nolan’s standards, Tenet was an exhausting tangle of quantum mechanics. The camp villainy of Kenneth Branagh’s Russian oligarch Andrei Sator was a welcome relief then, a reassuringly one-note performance that cut through the riddles, including the four-directional palindrome referenced by his last name. But pride comes before a pratfall, and while little in this film was ever truly final, the satisfactory smoothness of his exit brought the silver lining of slapstick to a cloud of complexity. All it took was a bullet to the chest, a slick of sun-screen, a shove and a polished deck, and we cheered the slip, boink, splash as he belly-flopped postmortem into the water. Among the film’s reversals, replays and ‘temporal pincer movements’, the unstoppably lo-tech forward motion of his long-awaited demise saved Tenet, and my night out – if not, as hoped, cinema itself. Pamela Hutchinson The day-into-night-into-day last call of Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets claims to be unscripted, which makes its heartbreaking climax all the more memorable. As the characters swoop around one another like increasingly inebriated electrons, we giggle at their slurred japes, but stop dead at moments of unmasked honesty. When Michael, the older ex-actor with a face that looks carved from rock, is saucily reclined on “his” couch, tousling the hair of young musician Peter in an ironic T-shirt, the shot is tight on their faces in near-erotic repose. The film’s lack of judgment is temporarily dropped. Michael sees a younger version of himself in Peter, and warns him to get help – to “get out” – while he can. “There is nothing more ‘oh my fuck is he ever gonna go away,’ than a guy who used to do stuff, who doesn’t do stuff no more, because he’s in a bar,” he says. The younger man is, sadly, too far gone to hear him. Jordan Hoffman There were few films this year that made me miss the cinema experience quite as much as body swap comedy horror Freaky, a shoulda-been-a crowd-pleaser stuffed with show-stopping *insert audience reaction* moments. Taking a goofy premise – what if Freaky Friday but a slasher movie killer and his victim – and squeezing a surprising amount of fun, humour, queerness and, shockingly, heart out of it, Happy Death Day writer-director Christopher Landon made me desperately wish I was seeing his follow-up on a big screen surrounded by equally thrilled cinemagoers. The scene that made me most curious to know how a packed Friday night crowd might receive it is both modest and audacious, a quieter moment in an often loud movie that takes place in the dark backseat of a car between two flirtatious high schoolers. The obvious twist being that one of them is a shy girl stuck in the body of a grown man (“a mass murderer with yellow teeth”) played with thought and specificity by a never-better Vince Vaughn, finally able to confess her feelings to a longtime crush. What’s most engaging about the scene is that none of it is played for laughs and instead it’s rather sweet, a bullied girl finding a way to feel empowered and, oddly, desired, while in a man’s body. The kiss that comes is a surprise to the pair and within such slick straight studio framework, a surprise to us as well. Benjamin Lee Roy Andersson’s films are all about moments – laid end to end there must be about two dozen in this meditative film about disillusion and failure. (Not everyone gets Andersson; you really have to suspend all normal expectations and just let it unfold.) Each shot is a single scene of intensely felt emotion, mostly (but not always) revolving around late-life frustration and despair. The priest who has lost his faith, and is physically pushed out of a doctor’s office at closing time; the “honour killer” sobbing with regret; the woman on a station platform with no one to greet her. But it’s the strangely optimistic scene near the end that endures: snow falls with hypnotic beauty, and a gloomy looking man announcing to a barful of strangers that “everything is fantastic”. At first, he is totally ignored; but one by one the others turn round and – sort of – agree. “I think so, at least,” repeats the gloomy man; that is a mantra anyone could be proud of. Andrew Pulver I loved Charlie Kaufman’s latest, right til the last half hour or so when it lost me the moment they started ballet-dancing and I felt not just confused but disappointed in myself for being so dim – an unhappy sensation. But the first two-thirds, in which new, ill-matched yet weirdly in-sync couple Jessie Buckley and Jesse Plemons head to his parents for supper, and then the parents turn out to be David Thewlis and Toni Collette on maximum wackiness, was terrific. The first completely genius bit, in my book, comes just as Plemons is giving Buckley an uncomfortable house tour and she, mindful of being in a remote creepy farmhouse and of every horror cliche - and the grisly pig story she’s just heard in the barn – queries why the cellar door is so riddled with scratches. Plemons bats it off – a dog, he says, clearly stalling. She asks more: what type, what name, where? “So many questions,” Plemons stutters, in a corner, reaching for boilerplate answers – Jimmy, a border collie, out playing. Yikes. The doom in your stomach grows. And then, of course, in comes Jimmy! And he’s a collie who’s been outdoors! The relief! Jimmy shakes his fur dry. But he doesn’t stop. He just keeps on shaking, very fast, back and forth, like an absolute demon. A tiny thing and absolutely terrifying. Within 30 seconds Kaufman has done it all: pulled the rug, put it back, ripped out the floorboards. You’re left giddy and flailing, and totally suckered by the sensation. Catherine Shoard"
"“Do you have as good a chance of becoming president as someone from a fancy neighbourhood?” A teenage girl is interviewing a boy in her class. They’re pupils at a middle school in a banlieue on the outskirts of Paris known by its official départment number, “the 93”. It’s the poorest place in mainland France. Her classmate replies: “If I said ‘yes’, I’d be lying.” He is Guy-Yanis, a super-bright, charismatic boy of around 13. He’s a positive kid, and goes on to say that he tries hard to counter the prejudices people have about the 93 as a crime-ridden no-go zone. This documentary from Eric Baudelaire is a reminder of how much we can learn from the way teenagers see the world. Another kid brings a philosopher’s reasoning to the question of evil, and why the world needs bad people: “It’s good we’re not all the same. Otherwise there would be no problems, no stories.”  Baudelaire gave cameras to the school’s film club to capture their everyday lives over four years. A crew also filmed their conversations about everything from movies to politics, racism and Islamophobia. There’s a heated debate between Guy-Yanis and another boy about whether Guy-Yanis is Ivorian or French (his parents emigrated to France from Côte d’Ivoire). “You’re 100% French! As French as cheese!” It’s these encounters that give the film its energy and optimism. On the other hand, unkind as it may be to point out, the footage shot by the pupils at home, bittily edited and put together without much in the way of explanation, is a slog. Still, what a worthwhile, inspiring project – and the kind of opportunity that might go some way towards putting the kids from the 93 on a level playing field with those from more privileged backgrounds."
"Wonder Woman 1984 is set to make its British big-screen premiere this week, and for cinema owners it marks the last chance to salvage something from a terrible year. While there is no hope that the Hollywood blockbuster sequel will emulate the £25m UK box-office take of the first Wonder Woman film, cinema owners are desperate for new fare to entice Covid-cautious movie fans back to the big screen. Last weekend, the first since cinemas in England were allowed to reopen after the second lockdown, Will Ferrell’s Christmas comedy Elf topped the box office, 17 years after it was released. It made just £48,000 in ticket sales across the UK and Ireland. Wonder Woman 1984 is the only bona fide blockbuster to stick with a premiere this year, as studios opt to shift seat-filling hits such as Jurassic World: Dominion and the James Bond film No Time to Die to 2021 or beyond to avoid a pandemic box-office flop. “This is the first big tent-pole release in a long time, and we do hope its broad popularity will bring some of those movie fans concerned about whether cinemas are safe back to the big screen and see that they are,” said Preston Benson, founder of Really Local Group, which has opened its first cinema in Catford, south London. “It is really important that we are getting an opportunity to premiere it.” Tim Richards, chief executive of the UK’s third-largest chain, Vue, has said it is only “marginally” worthwhile from an economic perspective to reopen around 50 of its cinemas across England. Cineworld, the UK’s biggest chain, has kept the doors to its 127 theatres in the UK and Ireland shut since October, when the Bond premiere was officially moved to April 2021. Financially, this year is a write-off for cinema owners, with analysts at Omdia estimating that the UK box office take will be just £360m – 29% of 2019’s £1.25bn and the lowest since 1992. By the end of the year, Omdia expects British cinemagoers to have attended between 40 million and 44 million times: the lowest total since records began in 1928, and well below the nadir of 53.8 million in 1984. “Cinema owners have reopened the best-performing sites they can, to make what they can, to try and recoup something in the middle of the pandemic,” said David Hancock at Omdia. “No one begrudges them that.” Except that, in the US, the premiere of Wonder Woman 1984 has sparked fury from the film industry. Warner Bros is releasing the film – and its entire slate of 21 films next year, from Dune to The Suicide Squad – on its HBO Max streaming platform at the same time as they debut in cinemas. The move has outraged theatre owners, who rely on months of big-screen exclusivity to make their business models work, and figures such as the British director Christopher Nolan have criticised the studio for putting out the releases on “the worst streaming service”. AMC Entertainment, owner of the Odeon cinema chain, warned last week that moves like Warner’s were harming its business, which was burning through cash at a rate that was “not sustainable”. Warner Bros’ parent company, AT&T, is desperately trying to play catch-up in the streaming wars by pumping exclusive content on to HBO Max, which has about 12.6 million registered users and is a minnow compared with rivals such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon’s Prime Video. “Warner Bros’ move isn’t about cinema – it is about trying to boost subscribers to HBO Max, which isn’t a successful streaming platform in the US yet,” said Benson. “We wish them well, but a movie like Wonder Woman is meant for the big screen and is not meant to be streamed.”"
"In 1998, a doping scandal rocked the Tour de France when a team masseur was caught with a pharmacy of banned substances in the boot of his car before the first stage in Ireland. The incident is the inspiration for this solid, workmanlike Irish drama with a strong performance by Louis Talpe as Dom Chabol, a fictional Belgian cyclist looking down the barrel of retirement at 38; he just can’t imagine life beyond cycling. And like most of the peloton, he’s doping; everybody’s doing it. Talpe looks every bit the pro cyclist, lean and light, not a pinch of fat on him. And he plays Chabol with a charisma-free dullness that’s convincing for a sportsman with tunnel vision, blocking out everything non bike-related. The details of life on the cycling circuit feel well-researched, too by director Kieron J Walsh, though his script, co-written with Ciaran Cassidy, goes heavy on exposition to explain the finer points of cycling. Chabol is a support rider, or domestique; it’s his job get the team’s flamboyant Italian leader Tartare (Matteo Simoni) over the finish line. So when Tartare takes a wee mid-race (staying on his bike) Chabol gives him a little push so that he won’t drop pace. Chabol is an unsung hero, sacrificing his own dreams of winning the yellow jersey for the greater good of the team. Off the bike, the drama gets a little shaky. The night before the grand départ Chabol receives a call from his sister. Their dad has died, but it’s obvious he has no intention of quitting the tour to fly back for the funeral. Meanwhile, the cycling authorities are stepping up random drug testing. On the plus side, he meets a gorgeous young Irish doctor Lynn (Tara Lee) who takes him to the pub for a Guinness or five. What the film does very well is show how doping became so normalised. It’s as much a part of the team’s routine as a post-race rubdown."
"A sunburnt and badly wounded David Wenham, looking haggard and sounding hoarse but radiating as much gravitas as ever, slogs across outback Australia as a gold thief in The Furnace, accompanied by a young Afghan cameleer (Ahmed Malek) with whom his character develops an unlikely friendship. Or perhaps “business associate” is a better way of putting it. On the ground propped up against a log of wood, grumbling about how he must find somewhere to rest “before the dingoes get me”, Mal (Wenham) soon reveals he has in his possession two 400oz crown-marked gold bars: a veritable mother lode of riches. But Mal doesn’t walk so good, being potentially on death’s door and all, so he needs the help of Hanif, the cameleer, to reach the titular location. There they can indulge in a kind of proto money-laundering operation; the bars inscribed with the crown can be melted down and transformed into untraceable gold. The pair have to get there first, though, which proves easier said than done – the task of navigating the land and its obstacles laying the foundation for a kind of roadless road movie, set in Western Australia circa 1897 and commandingly written and directed by Roderick MacKay. The first-time feature filmmaker captures an intriguing stillness derived heavily from the land, which is vast and unforgiving, of course; it wouldn’t be an Australian western (the genre is also known as the “meat pie western”) if it wasn’t. MacKay avoids spectacle and dispensable action, reserving his ammunition for occasional confrontations – involving, shall we say, disagreements between lawmen and vagabonds who desire that gold. In addition to the partnership forged between Mal and Hanif, which gives the film a cross-cultural dynamic, there is a racially diverse set of supporting characters including Chinese immigrants, Islamic, Sikh and Hindu cameleers, and the Indigenous Australian community. Hanif is a good friend of Woorak (Baykali Ganambarr, who was stunning in The Nightingale) and has a close bond with the local Yamatji Badimia people, able to communicate with them in Badimaya dialect. Any film involving characters roughing it across brutally tough terrain in pursuit of gold exists in the shadow of John Huston’s great film about prospecting and paranoia, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, in which Humphrey Bogart sweltered in the sun and paid a heavy price for his greed. Great meat pie westerns – among them Sweet Country, Inn of the Damned, The Nightingale and The Proposition – are usually about revenge and “hard justice” rather than wealth and belongings, although the 1946 whip-crackin’ adventure The Overlanders is a notable exception, about a drover determined to keep his cattle. In that classic film the great Chips Rafferty was guaranteed to survive and triumph – because he was principled, he was decent, he embodied old time values, he was just bloody fair dinkum. Wenham, gawd love ‘im, has an oeuvre not defined by characters with such nobility (unless one considers Johnny “Who’s paying for my bus fare?” Spitieri an upstanding member of society). And thus his path is not guaranteed. Hanif, played more broadly and very impressively by Malek, is a different kettle of fish: the significantly younger moral centre of the film, who is empathetic and intelligent albeit still establishing his outback smarts. During one conversation he drops the phrase “there but for the grace of God,” which triggers a stern rebuke from the somewhat differently wired Mal: “There’s no grace or God out here, son,” he says. “There’s just the land and all its spoils.” The dangerous cretins walking that land allow MacKay to confront dark aspects of the Australian psyche, spotlighting various kinds of racism and posing interesting questions about national identity. Who are Australians? What values do we stand for? How do we treat minority communities? The Furnace, however, never feels overtly polemical or even political; these questions feel like organic extensions of the drama. Confronting the past was also a key part of Sweet Country and The Nightingale – two films that are more pointed politically and cinematically richer than MacKay’s. The director has spoken repeatedly about how Australia “has only recently begun to willingly peer back into its past, warts and all, to better understand how it has arrived at the present”. The western is not just an enduring genre but tied to the very narrative foundations of cinema, with highly significant early works such as The Great Train Robbery arriving in 1903 and the world’s first feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang – an Australian production – landing three years later. The emerging category of historically revisionist meat pie westerns, to which The Furnace belongs, suggests that the land, with all its spoils, accommodates many more histories to revisit and many more stories to tell. We’ll have to wait and see how many David Wenham stars in before the dingoes get him."
"Never Rarely Sometimes Always, writer-director Eliza Hittman’s reticent, watchful film on two 17-year-old girls’ journey across state lines for an abortion, is about as opposite in tone to the incendiary, patronising anti-abortion movement in the US as one can get: understated, devastatingly spare, resonantly attuned to the unsaid, be it pain or the friendship tested by a healthcare system that leaves so many seeking reproductive care on their own. There are numerous ways to go about depicting the obstacle course that is abortion access in the US – HBO Max’s Unpregnant, released this year, routes the same premise into a mostly charming road-trip buddy comedy – but this is one of the most quietly powerful films of the year in its utter lack of pretension. The Sundance breakout allows the girls’ navigation of the hurdles – legal, financial, logistical, emotional – to compound into a searing portrait of reproductive healthcare in the US that lingers like a yellowing bruise. So much goes unspoken – you don’t hear Autumn (an impressively inward Sidney Flanigan) tell her cousin and best friend Skylar (Talia Ryder) that she is pregnant. Their decision to secretly schlep to New York from their small Pennsylvania town, where state law prohibits abortion for minors without parental permission, is swift, mostly tacit. Nor is there a word on the volatile political environment and legislative assault on abortion access that presaged the film’s release: 12 states enacted a form of abortion ban in 2019, some barring the procedure from as early as six weeks, before many, including Autumn, know they’re pregnant; Alabama attempted to ban abortion outright. Hittman observes this thicket through the eyes of one lost in it: the dismaying search for answers through Google, the condescension and confusion sowed by the town’s “crisis pregnancy centre”, an increasingly common facility that purports to counsel women on reproductive healthcare but in practice advises against “abortion-mindedness”. In New York, the obstacles become more diffuse and surprising – the girls navigate Port Authority, lug suitcases through a subway turnstile, hit up a skeevy yet approachable stranger from the bus for money. Hittman’s vigilant, passive style turns the city into an amorphous, shadowy challenge; midtown is far from unknown to moviegoers, but, under her direction, it becomes unfamiliar and suspect, the girls’ safety a bristling open question. Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which takes its title from the answers on a patient intake form read aloud to Autumn by a Planned Parenthood receptionist in a scene that drew raves at Sundance, is almost too spare in its observance of the girls’ bond and journey. But it’s ambitiously unsettling – I realised in the final scene that I’d kept my jaw clenched the entire movie. Since its release, the reproductive healthcare environment in the US has grown only more hostile with the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett, a longtime favourite of the anti-abortion movement, to the supreme court. The court’s strengthened conservative majority will be a generational fight; this film carves out an aching, vivid space in its long shadow, by paying sustained attention to a journey more American women will likely have to take, if they’re able."
"David Oyelowo is tired of talking about racism. After all, he has spent a professional lifetime doing so – not surprisingly, as this has been the focus of many of his films. So it was with some relief that he found himself starring in an escapist children’s movie that has nothing to do with it. Yet two months before its release, Come Away hit the headlines – as a racism story. Come Away is a fantasy about a fantasy; the whimsical tale of parents bringing up young children who just happen to be Peter Pan and Alice from Wonderland. Oyelowo plays the father, while Angelina Jolie plays the mother. Astonishingly, the fact that Alice and Peter are mixed-race has fuelled a campaign against the film. In October, it was reported that IMDb, the online database of film information, had taken down user ratings for Come Away after it had been “review-bombed” – a group of people had left negative feedback to artificially lower its ratings. Many films that get review-bombed are about race or gender and feature non-white or female leads. Oyelowo is appalled but not surprised. What type of things were the bombers saying? “The comment I read that made me realise I had to call the IMDb website to make them aware that we were being subjected to these racist comments was: ‘Here we go again – Hollywood seeking to erase our whiteness.’” The irony is, Oyelowo says, these people are treating Peter Pan and Alice as if they were historical figures. “This is around a story that is fictional, fantasy and a fairytale.” His voice rises in disbelief at the madness of assuming Peter or Alice have to be white. “You just put your hands up and say OK, this is why people have a problem with John Boyega being a stormtrooper or with Halle Bailey being cast as the mermaid in The Little Mermaid. This is why an all-female version of Ghostbusters is a threat to certain men because it’s an encroachment on what they deem to be their territory.” All the movies he mentions were review-bombed. This wasn’t the first of Oyelowo’s films to be attacked. A United Kingdom is a powerful biopic, released in 2016, about Seretse Khama, who became king of the British protectorate Bechuanaland (which became Botswana) at the age of four, then went on to renounce his throne for the love of a white woman. Khama eventually became Botswana’s first president in 1966. As well as the inter-racial relationship, Oyelowo believes there was something else that made the film a target. “You’re seeing an aspirational black character, someone you might admire, someone your young child might look at and say: I want to be like them. Seventy-five per cent of the comments we got on our Facebook page for that film were racist and Fox Searchlight had to take the page down.” Oyelowo, aged 44, is at home in the San Fernando valley of Los Angeles when we Zoom. The actor, who was born in England to Nigerian parents, has lived here for 13 years. His family – wife, Jess, and four children – are now naturalised Americans, and Oyelowo’s accent has morphed into an urbane transatlantic hybrid. He shows me around his office. It wouldn’t be much of a challenge if you were playing Through the Keyhole. There are posters from his films (Come Away, Selma, Gringo and Don’t Let Go) and one from a Royal Shakespeare Company theatre production of Henry VI. He was 24, only two years out of drama school, when he became the first black actor to be cast as a king in a major production of Shakespeare.  He made his name in the BBC spy series Spooks, and is a quietly remarkable actor. He inhabits his characters profoundly and with subtlety. Oyelowo has given so many fine performances – unravelling army veteran Peter Snowden in one-man movie Nightingale; supercilious reporter Yardley Acheman in The Paperboy; impassioned chess-teacher Robert Katende in Queen of Katwe, Khama in A United Kingdom. Then there is his note-perfect Martin Luther King in 2014’s Selma, the historical drama about the voting-rights marches in the US south.  Even more amazing than his performance was the fact that he didn’t win an Oscar for the role. How did he feel when he heard he hadn’t even been nominated? “I felt I had failed the legacy of Dr King.” Did you swear? “No, I did not. Maybe in my head. I went into my walk-in closet and sat on the floor for a while.” Is it true he wasn’t nominated for an Oscar because he was wearing an “I can’t breathe” T-shirt at Selma’s premiere? “There is no way of us knowing whether us protesting the murder of Eric Garner had a discernible impact on the film in terms of the Oscars,” he says. “But we did have incoming phone calls to our producers saying: ‘What the hell are they doing stirring shit?’ And [one Academy member] was bold enough to say that to one of the trade papers.”  His non-nomination (along with the snubbing of Ava DuVernay in the best director category, and the fact that all 20 acting nominations went to white actors) led to the founding of the influential #OscarsSoWhite protest movement. Oyelowo has been one of its beneficiaries. “I became an executive member of the Academy and have had a massive hand in the wave of black and brown people who have now been admitted to the Academy.” This has irrevocably changed the way the Academy votes, he says. “I have no doubt that Get Out and BlacKkKlansman and Black Panther and many other films that have now been celebrated may have also been marginalised.” Like King, Oyelowo was raised in the baptist church. He was born in Oxford, spent his early years in south London and moved with his family to Lagos at the age of six. Oyelowo descends from a regional royal family, but he has often compared being a Nigerian prince to being prince of Islington, where the family lived on their return to the UK when he was 14. His father was treated like anything but royalty in England. “He was subjected to statements like: ‘Go back to where you came from.’ He was spat at and had hot coffee poured on him.” Britain might be more diverse than it used to be, Oyelowo says, but he’s not convinced it’s less racist. “My brother, who is a healthcare professional in the UK, was on the train not long after the Brexit decision and that exact phrase was used to him on the tube. ‘Go back to where you came from.’ So no one can tell me Brexit wasn’t at least in part about race.” At school Oyelowo was bullied for being a swot – other black students called him a coconut. His faith kept him going throughout. He joined a drama group because he fancied a girl, and that’s where he met Jess, also an actor (she has featured in a number of his films) and born-again Christian. By the time he was 20 and at drama school, they were engaged. They told friends that they would not have sex with each other till they married two years later. Drama schools are not renowned for restraint, I say – did your fellow students think you were a strange couple? “Absolutely. There was utter bemusement. I had a friend who mocked me so mercilessly. He would shout from across the set: ‘You going to take her off and pop her cherry, are you?’ Just the most awful things. But yes, Jess and I were virgins when we got married. It’s tied to our faith, but it’s also who we are, and what we connected over.” They promised each other they would never be apart for more than two weeks because they had seen too much “divorce and dysfunction” in the acting world. “So much we have done in our life together was mocked. And to be perfectly frank we’re having the last laugh.” In what way? “I love my wife even more than I did 24 years ago. Our marriage is strong … because of some of the foundational choices we made early on.” He has always insisted on the two-week rule being written into his contracts, and he says it has started a trend. “We’ve seen other people emulate that, which is the greatest compliment they can pay us.” Oyelowo describes himself as a missionary. “I have an incredible platform in telling stories,” he says. “Jesus used parables consistently to make his point. He was a storyteller. I’m not here to proselytise Christ and be a preacher in that sense, but I do like to think of myself as a bringer of good news.” This does not mean saccharine narratives, he insists. “The Bible is a violent, R-rated book, not a Disney sort of book. I like to think I’m bringing the good news, the redemptive news in narratives that do not shy away from darkness and reality.” Oyelowo has always believed that to be a successful missionary he has to be proactive. So he moved to the US with the family in 2007 because he thought there were more opportunities for a black actor. Even with Donald Trump in power, he would take the US over Britain. “Nowhere on earth has been better at covering up racism in my opinion than Great Britain. The thing I like about living in America is that racism comes at you head on. In the UK it sneaks up behind you. I constantly came up against the old boys’ network in the UK – this Oxbridge clique that I wasn’t a part of and felt patronised by. Here the class system is money and success. If you succeed, people will invite you in, not because they are so egalitarian but they are so scared of missing out on something.” For Oyelowo, the fight for diversity does not end with race. Few big-name actors have worked with as many female directors, from Brenda Chapman (Come Away) and Amma Asante (A United Kingdom), to Mira Nair (Queen of Katwe) and DuVernay. “Women get to the emotion of the film a lot quicker.” He pauses. “I hope that doesn’t sound in any way diminishing of what women bring, but if my job as an actor is to hold a mirror up to humanity, a huge part of that is the emotion of the character, and I want a director who is unafraid of looking at the emotion.”  Oyelowo has started producing, directing and writing in recent years to ensure he gets to tell the stories he thinks need to be heard. As a producer on Come Away, he convinced Jolie to take the part. His directing debut, The Water Man, which premiered at the Toronto film festival in September, is a family adventure that nods to Spielberg. And he is set to star in and produce an adaptation of the former Guardian journalist Gary Younge’s portrait of gun violence, Another Day in the Death of America. Five years ago he claimed he could only get a lead role in a studio movie if Ryan Gosling couldn’t play it. Is that still true? He thinks about it, and smiles. “That has changed. Come Away is evidence of that.” Our time is up, but Oyelowo continues talking. He says he dreads the thought of seeing another interview with him banging on about racism. “But I recognise the need to still talk about it because I am standing on the shoulders of others who were denied the chance. I’m jealous of my peers. Benedict Cumberbatch never has to talk about his race, neither does Tom Hardy.” Ah, but they have to talk about their poshness, I say. “I feel so bad for them having to talk about their poshness!” He laughs. “Look, the day I know I don’t have to talk about racism is the day I’ll know we have real progress.” Come Away is released in the UK on 18 December"
"It is time to officially retire the “Is Die Hard a Christmas movie?” debate. We will never find consensus on this matter. It is too partisan a subject. The lines have become too entrenched, and the prospect of changing anybody’s mind on the matter is all but impossible. As much as it hurts to admit, we will never truly know whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie, even though it definitely is. But that’s OK. The death of this debate means that we now get to start all over again with a bunch of new films. I would like to propose that the following films are also Christmas movies, and that they should be enjoyed around an open fire by the entire family every Christmas for ever … This is arguably the most definitive Christmas movie of the last decade. Remember the scene where Tony Stark wears his prehensile Mark XLII suit technology for the first time? There’s a Christmas tree in the background. Or the scene where Happy Hogan is critically injured when a man spontaneously combusts, destroying Grauman’s Chinese Theatre and killing scores of innocent people? There’s a Christmas tree in the background. Or the scene where the antagonist attempts to murder the president by blowing up Air Force One on live television? One of the passengers is wearing a Santa hat. Merry Christmas everyone! Jaws is not a Christmas movie. Jaws 2 is not a Christmas movie. Jaws 3-D is not a Christmas movie. But in an early scene of the fourth film in the series, Jaws: The Revenge, Brody’s son gets in a boat and a great white shark bites his arm off. He screams for help, but nobody can hear him. Then the shark returns, bites a hole in the boat and murders him for good. And why did the good citizens of Amity Island fail to respond to his cries? Because they were all too busy singing The First Noël on the beach. This means that Jaws: The Revenge is 100% a Christmas film, and everyone should watch it on Christmas Day straight after the Queen’s Speech. A Force of One is a 1979 martial arts film in which Chuck Norris plays a karate champion tasked by the police force to track down and kill the mysterious karate expert responsible for killing several narcotics agents (and also Chuck Norris’s adopted son) with the power of karate. The poster for A Force of One is a photograph of Chuck Norris sitting naked in a triangle. It was co-written by The French Connection’s Ernest Tidyman who, just one year after its release, declared “I only wrote it to buy my mother a house”. Anyway, there is a surprising amount of tinsel in this film. Apart from one scene where the lyrics of the song Baby It’s Cold Outside are debated at length, Charlie Kaufman’s latest isn’t very heavy on traditional Christmas signifiers. But hear me out. There is snow. There are tedious journeys to have awkward dinners with people you don’t like. There are conversations so long and monotonous that the participants end up abandoning their sense of identity. It is totally a Christmas movie. At one point Gunnery Sergeant Hartman tells his troops: “Today is Christmas. There will be a magic show at zero nine thirty. Chaplain Charlie will tell you about how the free world will conquer communism with the aid of God and a few marines. God has a hard-on for marines, because we kill everything we see.” Is this the only reference to Christmas in an otherwise bleak and dread-soaked war movie? Yes. Is it enough to make it count as a Christmas movie? Also yes. A classic like Rocky IV comes packed with plenty of iconic moments. The death of Apollo Creed. The frozen training montage. The exploding fists. The robot. But these standout scenes help to mask the fact that Rocky IV is actually a festive extravaganza on a par with It’s a Wonderful Life. For instance, do you know when Rocky’s climactic fight with Ivan Drago takes place? On Christmas Day. And do you remember how Rocky Balboa ends his final post-fight speech (the one where he inspires Mikhail Gorbachev to stand up and applaud him for making a humanist case for the conclusion of the cold war while draped in an American flag)? By wishing his son a merry Christmas. This is just about as Christmassy as it gets."
"John Boyega has said he is genuinely worried that his impassioned speech at a Black Lives Matter protest in London in June will have damaging consequences for his career. “Absolutely. I still have those thoughts,” he said in an interview, reflecting on the moment when he addressed the rally so memorably and powerfully. The actor told the Radio Times about his and his family’s experience of stop and search, and the timeliness of his latest role in Steve McQueen’s drama Red, White and Blue. At times fighting back tears, the Star Wars actor told the protest in Hyde Park: “Black lives have always mattered. We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless. And now is the time. I ain’t waiting. “I’m speaking to you from my heart. I don’t know if I’m going to have a career after this but fuck that.” Boyega was asked if he was genuinely worried and he said he was. “I understand, looking from the outside in, it might seem ‘oh, you’ve been in this and you’ve been in that.’ But how many actors do you know who have been in big franchises? It doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to have stability for the rest of your life.” In Red, White and Blue Boyega portrays Leroy Logan, a black officer who joined the Metropolitan police in the 1980s. The drama opens with police harassing a young Logan, an experience the actor has a direct connection with. “I’ve been stopped and searched,” he said. “And my dad, who was a Pentecostal minister, got stopped on the way back from church. I was little. Everybody knows, especially if you grew up in Peckham, somebody who’s gone through the darkest scenarios with the police.” Red, White and Blue is one of five new dramas in McQueen’s anthology Small Axe, which explores the experiences of the West Indian community in London in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Another is Mangrove, which tells the story of the Mangrove Nine trial, one of the first in modern Britain which put police racism in the spotlight. One of its stars, Letitia Wright, said TV executives needed to be challenged more on issues of diversity and representation. “These questions are always aimed at the artists. They should be aimed at studio heads and commissioners,” she told the Radio Times. “These stories are being written, they are there, so it’s about those gatekeepers opening that door and having that conversation.”"
"The first thing anyone ever heard in the movies was jazz – in cinema’s first sound film, The Jazz Singer, of course, a creaky 1927 backstage drama that now only really has historical-milestone status to recommend it. (It’s on Amazon if you’re curious.) By now, happily, the cinema of jazz is a sophisticated, richly stocked subgenre, with British director James Erskine’s Billie (Barbican Cinema on demand) the latest addition. The tumultuous life and death of Billie Holiday has long demanded a major documentary study, and Erskine’s film digs in with the advantage of a vast, hitherto unheard interview archive: candid testimonies from friends and associates such as Count Basie and Tony Bennett, recorded in the 1970s by the late journalist Linda Lipnack Kuehl, for a planned biography that never came to pass. They lend credible immediacy to a doc that otherwise takes a familiar approach to a tragic-fallen-star narrative, and works as a Holiday primer for uninformed viewers. The performance footage, unsurprisingly, is a joy – notwithstanding the questionable artistic decision to colourise a significant portion of it. Doesn’t that voice have enough shades of its own? Sadly, if you’re curious to compare it with the Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues, starring Diana Ross, there’s no streaming solution. But several more recent jazz documentaries would make apt complementary viewing. On Netflix, you can see both Liz Garbus’s Oscar-nominated What Happened, Miss Simone?, which examines Nina Simone’s musical genius and political fire to rousing effect, and Kasper Collin’s I Called Him Morgan, an exquisite, hugely overlooked elegy for the lesser-known life and career of trumpeter Lee Morgan. Marrying heartsore interview footage with deeply ambient evocations of 1960s New York by genius cinematographer Bradford Young, it deserves to be as much of a classic as, say, Bruce Weber’s starkly intimate Let’s Get Lost (on iTunes), a portrait of Chet Baker at the raddled tail-end of his life that has unsentimental empathy to match its curious photographer’s eye. That, in turn, can cue a doc-versus-fiction comparison with Ethan Hawke’s deeply invested turn as Baker in Robert Budreau’s splintered, interpretive quasi-biopic Born to Be Blue (available on Google Play). The jagged rhythms of jazz, after all, invite more experimental approaches: Don Cheadle’s peculiar, clattering Miles Davis biopic Miles Ahead (Netflix, again) certainly favours one, telling you less about Davis’s life than his general mystic aura. Meanwhile, with its tour-de-force Forest Whitaker performance, Clint Eastwood’s melancholic, musically crisp Charlie Parker biopic Bird (on Amazon) is one for the purists. And if it’s just facts and footage you’re after, the brisk, enjoyable documentary Blue Note Records: Beyond the Notes (iTunes) – covering the legendary record label’s history from Coltrane through to Norah Jones – gets the job done nicely. But the spirit of jazz is often best found in films that shed any biographical concerns whatsoever. French director Bertrand Tavernier’s entrancing ’Round Midnight (on Chili) envelops real-life jazzman Dexter Gordon in smoky, invented, after-hours drama. Spike Lee’s Mo’ Better Blues (on YouTube), underrated on its release, offers prime Denzel Washington and a twitchy air of rebellion in its free-fall character study of a trumpeter living wild. Finally, classic, loose-limbed jazz musicals such as Cabin in the Sky (YouTube again) need no plot or focus whatsoever: when talents like Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong take the stage, we jump and sway and dance with them. The Painted Bird (Eureka, 18) Jerzy Kosiński’s 1965 Holocaust novel was controversially discredited as a memoir, but makes suitable material for Czech director Václav Marhoul’s vivid, visceral three-hour epic of waking horror. Following a child’s gruelling trek across an unspecified eastern European wasteland at the end of the second world war, it’s almost ostentatiously punishing, but marked throughout by ghoulish beauty. What We Wanted (Netflix) Austrian director Ulrike Kofler’s debut feature has been selected as his country’s official entry for the best international film Oscar, and you can see why. About a married couple beset with infertility struggles on what turns out to be a momentous summer holiday, it’s a polished, emotionally string-pulling melodrama that Hollywood, back when they still did glossy grown-up fare, would have remade in a flash. Stage Mother(Altitude, 15) Way back in 1997, gay Canadian director Thom Fitzgerald made an artful, psychologically nuanced debut with the fragmented coming-out tale The Hanging Garden. He’s drifted somewhat from that standard in his perky, sitcom-style latest, which stars Jacki Weaver as a churchy Texan conservative who inherits her late son’s San Francisco drag club: it’s bright-pink marshmallow fluff, but the irrepressible Weaver sells it. Girlfriends (Sony) Claudia Weill’s landmark 1978 indie – made on a shoestring budget of $80,000 – finally gets the Criterion Collection release it deserves. Unusual for its time (hell, unusual even now) in its frank, casual depiction of female friendship separate from the concerns and influence of men, it holds up beautifully: loose, funny and affecting, while its enduring influence on film-makers such as Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach and Lena Dunham is plain to see."
"If hit Netflix documentary Tiger King had you championing the big cat cause, here’s the animal rights-respecting action-thriller you should watch next. Transformers’ Megan Fox stars as Samantha O’Hara, the gun-toting girl-boss of a mercenary crew in South Africa who must retrieve a high-value hostage from a band of Islamic militants-cum-ivory-poachers. It’s a money-making mission though, not a humanitarian one, and any heroics are performed reluctantly: “If I die because I’m doing the right thing, I’m gonna be so pissed,” says Sam. The action rattles along at a decent pace, punctuated by regular mauling deaths as Sam’s utterly expendable crew hunker down in an abandoned “lion farm”. It’s not just the local al-Shabaab cell that threatens their lives; they’re also being stalked by a lioness gone rogue. Clearly, Fox v Lion was intended to be Rogue’s big, dramatic showdown, but the computer-generated imagery is so pathetic it barely registers; a free augmented reality app could magic up more fearsome predators. Instead, it’s the contrast between Samantha’s dead-eyed, implausibly groomed professionalism and the full-throated compassion of the al-Shabaab leader (Adam Deacon) that intrigues. This is thanks mainly to an energetic performance from Deacon, whom some will remember as a mainstay of British urban drama until his falling out with Kidulthood’s Noel Clarke. Rogue isn’t offering nature-documentary realism, but director MJ Bassett is a former wildlife presenter whose interest in the South African grassland goes beyond mere backdrop. This is explored through the conflicts of Pata (South African star Sisanda Henna), a Maasai tribesman, turned al-Shabaab fighter, turned mercenary. Fox is undoubtedly at the apex of this filmic food chain, but it’s those further down who are enabling it to function."
"Christmas is coming. And if anyone is not convinced it’s the most wonderful time of the year, here’s an excessively Christmassy Victorian-set musical on Netflix to batter you into good cheer. In many ways, Jingle Jangle feels like a fairly boilerplate family movie (think Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or Willy Wonka) but with one big difference: the characters are mostly black. There’s a brilliant scene where a group of children have a snowball fight on a Dickensian cobbled street. Their ringleader is brainiac child genius Journey (Madalen Mills), a 10-year-old girl. As the kids pelt each other with snowballs, a song by Ghanaian singer Bisa Kdei plays, and Journey and her friends break into African dance moves. Their ethnicity is not the point of their characters or of the scene, but their culture and heritage are seen and celebrated. Forest Whitaker plays Journey’s inventor grandfather Jeronicus Jangle. As a young man, he owned world-famous toyshop Jangles and Things, maker of steampunk-inspired gadgets. But Jeronicus lost everything when dastardly apprentice Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Key) stole his book of toy blueprints. Thirty years later, he is a broken man, played with gentle mournfulness by Whitaker, an actor perpetually enveloped by a grey cloud of disappointment. The big surprise is that he can sing too, belting out the movie’s big R&B-ish duet Make It Work (written by John Legend) with Anika Noni Rose. Playwright and film-maker David E Talbert serves up a cinematic buffet that’s heavy on the sweet stuff, as Journey attempts to salvage her grandad’s reputation. It’s a film that may be a bit sugary for some tastes, but it’s made with real care and craft: from exquisite stop-motion inserts to the blast of energy dance routines by Kylie choreographer Ashley Wallen and stunning hair design from Sharon Martin – creating Victoriana styles inspired by natural afro hair. I did wonder, though, if it was necessary to make Journey quite such a paragon of kindness. She reminded me of those books about great women written to inspire little girls – Marie Stopes or Coco Chanel smiling pleasantly on every page. Nice-girl Journey could perhaps have done with a few more character traits. But that’s a small beef with a film beaming with positivity – and yuletide good cheer."
"Canadian writer-director Thomas Robert Lee’s follow up to his little-known debut Empyrean, Blood Harvest simmers with unease and lingers in the mind – but bites off more than it can chew, leaving a little too much undigested narrative. That said, there’s quite a bit of lusty scenery-chomping on offer from the cast, giving this a charming luridness that could generate a small cult following. For reasons that are never entirely clear (and which suggest there was a major whittling down of ideas before the final edits), Lee posits a fictitious religious community in the Canadian prairie who all wear Amish-style antiquated 19th-century garb and speak with the Irish accents of their ancestors, even though the year is 1973. While almost all the townsfolk cleave to a version of Church of Ireland Protestantism, Agatha Earnshaw (Catherine Walker), a single woman living both literally and figuratively on the edge of the community, has gone all in for some kind of pagan blood magic cult with a coven of crones quite separate from the town. By letting this satanic craft club (each seems to have a funky crocheted and knitted lace shawl) drink the blood of her 17-year-old daughter Audrey (a translucent Jessica Reynolds) every so often, Agatha has managed to keep her homestead fecund while the crops and livestock of her Christian neighbours wither and die. Also, for reasons never entirely clear, she’s kept Audrey’s very existence a secret, too, hiding her in the house whenever someone comes by. But like an evil version of Disney’s Tangled, this teenage Rapunzel is ready to rebel against her controlling mother and exact a rather disproportionately cruel revenge on the townspeople for being mean to mom. As an exercise in world-building, this is pretty evocative and impressive stuff. Nevertheless, despite the fact that “harvest” is in the movie’s title, Lee fails to sow and reap spooky payoffs with the same skill deployed in similar features about freaky pagan-antiquated communities such as The Village, The Wicker Man, The Witch or Midsommar, to name but a few. Still, Nick Thomas’s cinematography is terrific and frequently unsettling."
"Ever since the mid-1970s when George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house at 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, Long Island, for $80,000 without realising it was haunted, the horror genre and the real estate industry have been in a lucrative relationship. Three years after the The Amityville Horror in 1979 came Poltergeist, in which real-estate developer Steven Freeling finds his family home in a gated California community menaced by malevolent spirits who make themselves known through a hand that emerges from TV static. “They’re here,” announces Freeling’s daughter. The Selling, a crowd-funded film populated by unknowns that barely made a ripple when it was released in 2011, is a delightful satire of real estate horror movies, 86 minutes of the hybrid genre that’s arguably the hardest to pull off: the comedy horror. It’s populated by films and series that are either too pleased with themselves (Wes Craven’s Scream, Zombieland), get the ratio of horror to comedy wrong (An American Werewolf in London) or don’t realise how funny they are (The Shining, The Others). All too few horror films quote Nietzsche, but, in the opening of The Selling (AKA The Selling of Scarry Manor), useless estate agent Richard Scarry (Gabriel Diani) can’t think of any good advice to offer a pair of house prospective hunters so he falls back on the quote of the day from his phone. “Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” The couple look at him blankly. “So there’s that to think about,” he counsels idiotically. The quote proves pertinent, though. This is a film about seeing monsters and becoming monstrous. There be monsters in the latest house on Scarry’s books and he winds up battling them so he can flip the property on to unsuspecting rubes. To be fair, he is in extremis: he needs to make money fast as his mother’s cancer treatment won’t pay for itself. Is it wrong to sell a house without telling prospective purchasers it’s haunted? This sort of moral conundrum must be playing out, even as we speak, all around the world where estate agents are tasked with selling homes where horrors happened. True, Fred West’s home in Gloucester was bulldozed, but Dennis Nielsen’s in Muswell Hill still stands – I had a friend who was shown around it by an estate agent who only when pressed disclosed its hideous past. Already his co-worker, the superbly chilly and diabolically manipulative realtor Mary Best has run screaming from the property and palmed it off her books on to Scarry’s without disclosing its appalling secret. The expression on her face as she scarpers down the street unerringly recalls those of guests on the 90s makeover show Changing Rooms after Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen stencilled their living room. If you were being serious in your analysis of this film, and you really shouldn’t be, The Selling is a metaphor for America. There were already humans living in America before the Europeans arrived but they got squeezed out so that interlopers could monetise the asset from sea to shining sea. Scarry Manor is emblematic of the colonisation of America, serious face. But it’s also funny. When Scarry shows a couple the property, cabinet doors fly open, water pours unbidden from taps, and the walls start to bleed. He opens one door and nearly gets sucked into a trans-dimensional wormhole. “Sometimes,” he deadpans. “the bedroom closet becomes a portal to the spirit realm.” After the ghosts drive away all potential buyers, Scarry enlists the help of a priest played by Barry Bostwick. When Father Jimmy turns up to perform an exorcism, he stands on the front path in silhouette like the eponymous exorcist of William Friedkin’s movie (The Selling drips with jokey homages to past horror movies). As soon as he begins his exorcism, Father Jimmy screams and clutches his heart. But it’s a scream of delight: the original features include some excellent stained glass. When Scarry fails to exorcise the ghosts, a waitress called Ginger Sparks (Etta Devine) with extensive knowledge of the spirit realm offers her services to cleanse the property. She tries everything she knows including goat sacrifice but only makes matters worse. The spirits decide house haunting is fun, but not as much fun as possessing the protagonists in the film’s final reel. This is where The Selling becomes a convincing depiction of the hell we’re living in, a world where estate agents are diabolically possessed. Our heroes have become monsters. As for Gabriel Diani and Etta Devine, they went on to make Diani & Devine Meet the Apocalypse in 2016. What they should do now is make a sequel of The Selling fit for our Covid age, using found footage, like that from Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch, culled from virtual house tours. Zoom calls that start in the middle of the night. Ghosts that you can’t mute. Spirits that pop up in FaceTime and reach through the computer screen when you start a property slideshow on Zoopla. Now that would be scary."
"Anyone feeling nostalgic for the 70s/80s heyday of squishy, sociopolitical body-horror will find plenty to feast on in this uproariously gory yet satisfyingly cerebral second feature from Canadian writer-director Brandon Cronenberg. Set in an alternate version of the early 21st century, it’s a tale of cyber-surveillance and physical transference that taps into timely fears while also addressing age-old issues of identity, alienation and being an impostor in your own life. Andrea Riseborough brings a chilly anxiety to the role of Tasya Vos, an assassin for a sinister industrial espionage company that transplants the consciousness of its agents into unwitting hosts to carry out covert hits, like a much nastier version of Inception. It’s a job laced with danger, not least because the “possessor” can become damaged or infected by their time as a psychological parasite, losing track of their own identity, a predicament perfectly captured by Riseborough’s minutely attuned performance. For her latest assignment, Vos “possesses” the body of Colin Tate, boyfriend of Ava Parse (Tuppence Middleton), whose father, John (Sean Bean), is the CEO of an American mega-corp. Having studied her target’s speech, habits and mannerism, Vos inhabits Tate – brilliantly played by Christopher Abbott, effectively doing an impression of Andrea Riseborough doing an impression of Christopher Abbott. Imagine the Carl Reiner comedy All of Me, in which Steve Martin’s body is accidentally filled with the soul of Lily Tomlin, as reimagined by the son of horror maestro David Cronenberg, who has clearly inherited his father’s early enthusiasm for extreme visceral cinema. In his somewhat underrated first feature, Antiviral, Cronenberg posited a world in which celebrity infections could be marketed to adoring fans – a sly satire on a modern malaise with a creepy clinical edge. With Possessor, which he started writing in the wake of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden’s nightmarish revelations, his focus is on the construction of identity (themes of gender fluidity are buried deep in the narrative DNA) and the invasion of privacy in a time of access-all-areas information. There’s a down-to-earth sociopolitical subtext to the satirical sci-fi plot, which speaks to an age overrun by companies whose data-mining knows no boundaries. But there’s also a strong emotional thread, exemplified by Vos’s separation from her own family, to whom she has become a danger, and from whom her boss (played with relish by Jennifer Jason Leigh) is determined to keep her apart. Cronenberg’s decision to shoot the special effects in camera, and to rely on prosthetics and practical effects rather than post-hoc computer graphics, pays huge dividends. Scenes of faces melting and bodies merging have a satisfyingly tactile feel, harking back to the experimental cinematic trickery of Georges Méliès, albeit with added 21st-century oomph. There’s a real physical depth to Possessor that helps keep the story grounded even during its most outlandish flights of fantasy. Plaudits to cinematographer Karim Hussain, who invests every scene with an air of off-kilter eeriness, and to composer Jim Williams, whose previous credits include Julia Ducournau’s cannibal classic Raw, who conjures an aural landscape that ranges from the brooding to the booming, from intimacy to insanity. Possessor will doubtless prove too gleefully gory for some audiences and too oblique for others, like a half-remembered dream, full of ellipses, open-ended questions and violent eruptions. Like its twisted antiheroine, I’m just eager to go back in.  Possessor is available on VOD platforms"
"My friend Steve Turney, who has died aged 59 of Covid-19, was a publicist in the film and television world who in more recent times became a TV sales and acquisitions manager, responsible for financial deals with production companies and studios to buy and sell their library of TV programmes on licence. Steve was born in north London, the only child of John Turney, an engineer, and his wife, Rita (nee Cook), who worked in a bank. Educated at the Stationers’ Company’s school in Hornsey, he became a diehard Arsenal supporter, with Charlie George a particular favourite. On leaving school he joined Walt Disney Distribution as a sales statistics clerk before moving, in 1978, to Columbia Pictures as assistant to the media services manager. I was working in the PR department there, and so we met. I was immediately struck by his openness and willingness to help others – a trait that never waned. After Columbia, Steve was lured to Walt Disney’s theme park in Orlando, Florida, where he donned a Mickey Mouse costume and entertained families for a year. He liked to remind people that his job title there was “cultural representative”. Thereafter he matured rapidly into a talented publicist, promoting films that were being released in UK cinemas by getting coverage in newspapers and on TV and radio. Among the films he promoted were Sister Act and The Muppet Christmas Carol, both released in 1992. He became particularly popular with film critics for treating them all to a curry after a screening, for his infectious laugh, and for his penchant for inappropriate jokes. Steve’s rise through the PR ranks was speedy and impressive. He worked variously for the film-maker Zakiya Powell, the British Pavilion in Cannes, the Association of Independent Producers, JAC Publicity, and Medusa Pictures, where he was head of publicity.  The transition into TV sales came in 1994, when he joined Lumiere Pictures as a sales executive. Then he moved to Goldcrest Films International, where he was responsible for theatrical, TV and video sales across the globe. In 2006 he became director of sales at 20th Century Fox Television before creating Blink, an independent television sales company which he ran as a sideline to his other work. Recently he had joined Power Entertainment as senior vice-president of sales and acquisitions, having formerly been vice-president of sales for the company between 2011 and 2015. He is survived by his mother."
"This romcom delivers festive cheer with its premise alone: Kristen Stewart is brought home for the holidays to meet her girlfriend’s shrill, overbearing family. But Harper (Mackenzie Davis) is not out, and so Abby (Stewart) is amusingly deemed her “orphan friend” and shoved, quite literally, back into the closet. Directed by Clea DuVall, who starred in the 1999 queer classic But I’m a Cheerleader, the film cannily features a Drag Race cameo, an end-credits song by Tegan and Sara and Stewart in a fantastic velvet tie. With the exception of Harper’s wacky sister, Jane (co-writer Mary Holland), the film mostly shies away from camp, playing out in a more grounded register. Stewart is low key and likable, creating real emotional stakes and strategically using her signature shoulders-down shuffle. A pity, then, that she and Davis don’t quite have the romcom chemistry needed to secure the film’s place in the Christmas movie canon."
"There’s a Rocky-like energy about Huracán, a film that combines a gritty feel for the unloved urban landscape with a psychological-thriller plot and a setting in the ultraviolet world of mixed martial arts. Star Cassius Corrigan even looks a bit like the young Sylvester Stallone, but he’s gone one better: Corrigan is starring, writing and directing in this, his feature debut.He plays Alonso Santos, a troubled young man in Miami who is diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder by a sympathetic court-appointed therapist named Isabela (Yara Martinez). Whenever Alonso feels threatened, his aggressive alter ego “Huracán” emerges. And since he’s on parole, facing homelessness and making his living in the (almost) anything-goes arena of MMA – AKA cage fighting – that’s fairly often. Isabela takes it on herself to help Alonso by guiding him to the childhood source of his trauma. There’s no guarantee of success, since her methods are experimental and her professional boundaries are vague. Corrigan’s performance also teeters on the line between vulnerability and menace throughout, making for plenty of entertaining suspense. While most therapists would probably balk at this depiction of their working practices, and the use of serious mental illness as a plot device is cliched and questionable, yet Huracán succeeds as a portrait of a man on the edge. It has a Loachian way of eliciting naturalism from non-actors (real-life Muay Thai champion Grégory “Cheetah” Choplin is particularly effective as Alonso’s tough coach), and, on Alonso’s lonely jogs through the streets of Miami, the camera finds the same tropical twilight quality that Oscar-winner Moonlight so beautifully captured.  He’s not yet a heavyweight, but in the (almost) anything goes arena of film-making, Corrigan has clearly got what it takes."
"The intelligence and even-handedness of this documentary about the provocative fashion photographer Helmut Newton makes a change from the fawning tone you get in a lot of fashion films. It’s a flattering “authorised” portrait, featuring interviews with famous Newton muses Charlotte Rampling, Grace Jones and Claudia Schiffer. But director Gero von Boehm deserves points for not ignoring the “porno chic” controversy surrounding his more extreme fetishistic images of naked women. There’s a brilliant clip of Newton appearing as a guest on French TV alongside Susan Sontag, who accuses him to his face of being a misogynist. The film benefits from terrific behind-the-scenes footage of Newton on the set of his shoots. “Don’t look poverty stricken. Look incredible!” he instructs a model. Newton himself looks as if he’s just stepped off a yacht in the French Riviera – a mischief-making youthful octogenarian, trim and tanned. He was born in Germany in 1920 into a Jewish family and fled the Nazis in 1938. In Australia, he met his wife, June, and in Paris made his name photographing a particular type of women – amazonians who projected sex and glamour. Men he had little time for; they were accessories – like a hat or a pair of shoes. Newton died in 2004 in a car accident in Los Angeles. In an archive interview, Newton says that his photographs put women in a position of power – his model is always dominant, looking down at the man looking at her. That’s not always true. Certainly not in his infamous shot of a woman on all fours, naked but for a horse saddle on her back. Some of the most interesting commentary here comes from Isabella Rossellini, who thinks that Newton’s photographs exposed how some men feel – how attraction to a woman can make them feel resentful and angry. Another former model believes he held a mirror up to misogyny in society. You might prefer Sontag’s simpler take. A fascinating film."
"The amazing artistry of 77-year-old Swedish director Roy Andersson is illuminated in this tribute, a documentary that follows the work on his latest film, About Endlessness, which emerged last year to much acclaim at the Venice film festival (and which is due for UK release in November). Andersson himself is renowned for his brilliant tragicomic visual gags and dreamlike visions, with hints of Beckett, Fellini and Monty Python. (He acknowledges here, too, the influence of Breughel and Goya.) Andersson emerges here as a slightly mysterious figure, smiling beatifically like the much-loved elder statesman that he is, speaking in general terms about his art addressing the frailty and vulnerability of human nature, but giving little away about himself. The documentary creates what looks like a rather artificial narrative crisis about his heavy drinking: we glimpse him furtively swigging from a bottle; his behaviour becomes erratic, he checks into rehab and quickly checks out (to everyone’s exasperation), yet there seems to be no long-term damage to his latest triumph and the subject is not seriously mentioned again. The film does not really discuss his own personal or married life, and it doesn’t talk about his lengthy interlude in TV commercials that lasted for 25 years, from the release of his critically dismissed feature Giliap in 1975 to the sensational Songs From the Second Floor in 2000, which formed the bedrock of his current reputation. What the film does show is the overwhelming importance of his personal studio, which he created in 1981 from the shell of a huge townhouse building he bought in Stockholm. It really is a studio in the artistic as well as movie sense, and vital for the Andersson style. Almost all his unmistakable tableau scenes are created in that building with stunningly clever model and greenscreen work: those eerie, hallucinatory perspectives leading the eye from the figures in the foreground to the pinsharp details in the far distance. The staggering “train” scene in You, the Living (2007) itself deserves an award, and I would have liked to have heard even more about how the magic was fabricated there. But maybe Andersson (understandably) doesn’t want to reveal too many trade secrets. A valuable introduction to the movies and to the man. "
"Within the framework of any good mystery is a well-modulated supply of red herrings, designed to wrongfoot us and the detective we’re watching, ideally enough to intrigue rather than irritate. In writer-director Evan Morgan’s unusual neo-noir The Kid Detective, it’s not just a suspect or a motive that’s a red herring, it’s an entire genre, a strange rug-pull of a movie that starts in the middle of the road before ending up off a cliff, in a way that both works and doesn’t, a fascinating gambit nonetheless. We begin the film in a candy-coloured small town, a Sundance movie universe a whisker away from being too twee, where the improbably named Abe Applebaum (The OC’s Adam Brody) is living in the shadow of his former self. As the title suggests, he was a kid detective, gaining local fame at a young age for solving low-stakes mysteries, from a missing cat to stolen charity money, charming and impressing those around with his precocious pluck. When a local girl goes missing, Abe’s pre-teen skills understandably come up short and years later, he’s a local joke, the town drunk, an adult detective whose business has dried up. But when a high-school student asks him to find out who killed her boyfriend, he spots a chance for redemption. Appearing out of nowhere, a theatrical release stateside announced with just a week to spare and a rushed trailer shoved out just days before, there’s something oddly well-suited to The Kid Detective’s jolt of an arrival. Morgan’s buzz-free buzz-kill will probably take its small audience by surprise, sight unseen, and for optimal viewing purposes, purists might prefer a total avoidance of specifics concerning the film’s dark tonal shift. But while not knowing that a shift is coming might make it all the more effective for some, there’s an argument to be made that even the slightest of forewarning will make a great deal of what comes before it that much easier to consume. Because while there’s a certain throwaway charm to watching Brody pleasantly shamble his way through what feels like a late 90s indie (it plays like a shaggy, if less potent, riff on Zero Effect at times although a prolonged setpiece involving a closet is incredibly, uniquely funny), there’s also a “Sure, what else?” overfamiliarity to the material, a slightness that makes it hard to deeply invest in what’s sleepily unfolding in front of us. But in the last 20 minutes, Morgan wakes us up with a sharp left turn concerning both the nature of Abe’s investigation and the nature of Abe himself. It’s not exactly a twist per se but more of a step back to see the bigger, bleaker picture, the gentle quirkiness of the first act fading fast, the cutesy all-American facade of the town curdling into ugliness. What’s most surprising about the finale is how Morgan takes us to the brink and then leaves us there. After a reveal of startling nastiness, he softly skirts around a happy ending before, in a dour last scene, defiantly refusing to give us one. It’s almost too abrupt, with a beat or two missing, to truly land, but I admired its audacity and then how unsettled I felt after, like realising at a later age what really happened to your childhood pet who was “sent away to a farm”. Abe’s reheated slacker antics are reframed with a sudden depth and Brody’s performance works so well because of our limited expectations of him as an actor and the uncomfortable arc he shares with his character: of someone whose fame faded with age. It’s a surprisingly deft turn in an odd little film that might not hit every high note but its diligent avoidance of ending up where we expect it to makes it hard to shake, a disquieting crime drama where solving the mystery isn’t enough to make things better."
"Cinemas across Europe have expressed their outrage at the decision by Hollywood studio Disney+ to bypass a big-screen release for the new Pixar animation Soul and debut the film on their streaming platform Disney+. The International Union of Cinemas (UNIC) released a statement saying the decision has “shocked and dismayed all cinema operators”. The statement said: “The vast majority of cinemas across Europe and indeed many regions of the world are now open and able to offer a safe and enjoyable return for audiences. Cinema operators have invested massively in offering the safest possible experience to their audiences on the basis of a promising schedule of new film releases. Yet again, however, they find a distributor delivering another blow.” Soul, which features Jamie Foxx as a jazz musician whose soul is separated from his body, is due to screen at the Rome film festival this week after it had its premiere on 10 October at the London film festival. However, Disney appears to be following a similar model that it used to release its recent China-set adventure yarn Mulan, which was pulled from large-scale theatrical showings at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead was later released as a premium offering on Disney+. However, it appears Disney does not currently have plans to charge extra for Soul, which will be made available on 25 December. But UNIC, whose president is the UK Cinema Association’s chief executive Phil Clapp, warned that Hollywood’s decisions “risk causing irreparable damage to key markets” and that when the studios want to release their blockbusters again, “it may be too late for many European cinemas”."
"Edward James Olmos is an actor-film-maker with a long history of advocating for Latino screen representation, and he has cast himself as something of what you might call a “magical Latino” stock character in this environmental courtroom drama. He plays Santiago, the right-hand man of Fred Stern (David Strathairn), a recently widowed California almond farmer, who is locked in a legal battle with a big bad oil firm. Santi always has some old-west wisdom to offer his old pal, such as “Don’t confuse fightin’ with livin’”; or “Who knows the true meaning of ‘covfefe’?” It’s a forgivable indulgence, since The Devil Has a Name is also providing juicy roles for several other character actors who have long been underserved and unappreciated. Former child star Haley Joel Osment and Pablo Schreiber (“Pornstache” from Orange Is the New Black) are both having a high old time as scenery-chewing grifters with nefarious motives, while Martin Sheen recycles some of that President Bartlet twinkle as Stern’s dragon-slaying lawyer. The real revelation, though, is Kate Bosworth, a rising star of the early noughties (Blue Crush, Superman Returns) who never quite rose. As Gigi Cutler, however, she’s a new woman; a swaggering, cigarillo-chomping, femme-fatale version of cinema’s great rapacious oil men, who’ll drink your milkshake and probably your whiskey, too. In Olmos’ and Bosworth’s home state of California, oil companies polluting groundwater is a real issue. But unlike the films Dark Waters or Erin Brockovich, The Devil Has a Name isn’t grounded in a specific case and loses much of its moral power as a result. Any poignance Stern’s David-v-Goliath fight might have possessed is undermined by a flowery script that’s over-fond of quick comebacks. To hear Bosworth curl her lips around some of these zingers though, almost makes for a fair trade-off."
"In May, as their city began to emerge from the paralyzing grip of coronavirus that killed over 33,000 residents, New York City-based film-makers Alex Gibney, Ophelia Harutyunyan and Suzanne Hillinger started retracing still-raw recent history on film. They tracked whistleblowers, and noted comparisons between the disastrous sprawl of coronavirus in the US and South Korea, which received their first positive coronavirus diagnoses on the same day: 20 January. Meetings were held by Zoom, interviews by remote camera draped by a shower curtain – a large, amorphous ghost, compliant with quickly adopted social distancing guidelines. The resulting film, Totally Under Control, is a clinical, point-by-point recounting of America’s preventable slide into the coronavirus pandemic. It’s a damning list of mistakes, foreseeable crises and political squabbling splayed across a coherent timeline intended to be released just ahead of the election, “so that people could render a judgment about how the federal response had been”, Gibney told the Guardian. The two-hour film focuses primarily on the early days of the pandemic: the missed opportunities from January through April which led to America’s spiraling coronavirus present, an unending “first wave”. Though there’s plenty of sense still to be made from the pandemic summer – the surge of cases in the US sun belt and, more recently, an outbreak within the White House (a title card reveals the film wrapped just one day before Trump announced his positive diagnosis via 1am tweet) – the film-makers generally stuck to their mandate of early-stage diagnostics: forensic re-evaluation of January, February and March, “because that’s when all the death, all the economic destruction could’ve been prevented”, said Gibney. “As human beings, we forget things really quickly,” Harutyunyan said. “Especially when you’re living through it, you might forget what happened three months ago.” The film offers a chance to be “reminded about the decisions and actions made by this administration”. Through first-person interviews, news footage and, yes, a literal timeline, Totally Under Control visualizes the US government response to Covid-19: a foreseeable mess of overlapping issues – some systemic, some deriving straight from a White House more concerned with political optics and petty rivalries than accuracy. The film includes numerous public health experts who raised the alarm in January, when the CDC director, Robert Redfield, privately warned Trump about the risk of the virus as the president insisted, in a now infamous claim the film takes as its title, that everything was “totally under control”. Dr Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority turned government whistleblower, recalls asking the health and human services director, Alex Azar, a Trump appointee known for doubling the price of insulin as a pharmaceutical executive, for $10bn to launch pandemic preparedness plans in January, only to be denied and publicly undermined. Lab executives and physicians recount the frustration of flying blind without testing for a month, as bureaucratic red tape slowed approval of testing to a halt. Former Obama-era officials such as Beth Cameron, who helped develop a “pandemic playbook” on how to handle an infectious crisis, and the former HHS director Kathleen Sebelius, explain how lessons from the swine flu of 2009 and 2014 Ebola crisis went unheeded by the Trump administration. And Max Kennedy, another whistleblower from within the Trump-appointed taskforce led by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to handle the shortage the medical supplies and ventilators, reveals the White House response to be a farcical circus of inexperience. Not represented, however, is the perspective of those from within the CDC or HHS, despite several outreach attempts, according to the film-makers. After months of unreturned calls, it became clear that for those inside the government response and the CDC in particular, “their messaging was being controlled”, said Hillinger. “What we were experiencing was being mirrored by what the rest of the country was experiencing, of not being able to get a straight answer from the CDC, of not being able to understand how decisions were being made, when people knew things.” In the final month of editing, Hillinger heard from sources that contacts in the CDC were wary about phone and email surveillance; shortly after, Politico revealed emails demonstrating how the health and human services spokesman, Michael Caputo, a Republican consultant who worked on the Trump campaign in 2016, attempted to undermine or contradict CDC reports on the coronavirus to align with the president’s rosy view. “That was really scary to see,” said Hillinger of the rank politicization of an institution long held in international esteem. “We’re still able to tell the story without these interviews, but I think it’s deeply concerning to not be able to hear the truth from the folks on the inside.” Totally Under Control identifies numerous errors and Trump-sown chaos, but focuses in particular on arguably America’s most pivotal mistake: the failure to introduce widespread testing in February and March, resulting in a “missing six weeks” of fumbling toward crisis without the ability to map its spread. The numerous failures – a botched CDC test, unwillingness to quickly scrap the compromised test part and proceed anyway, FDA red tape which required labs to send applications by mail, among many other roadblocks – squandered the critical window for containing the virus. What makes the lost month “even more galling and infuriating”, said Gibney is the existence of a pandemic simulation, code-named Crimson Contagion, run by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2019 which stressed the importance of rapid, widespread testing. Yet the warnings went unheeded as the virus seeped through the US. “They knew all this,” Gibney said of the administration, “and yet they refused to act.” Where to assign the blame? In part, an American culture of scientific hubris, both within and outside of the CDC. In part, bureaucratic agencies gutted of expertise and experience by the administration, with heads appointed for political considerations rather than qualifications. But the buck ultimately stops with the president, said Gibney, one who has repeatedly demanded a slowdown in testing to lower America’s official case numbers. “Trump had the obligation to speak honestly to the American people and also to marshal the forces of the federal government to mount a response,” he said. Instead, America experienced a “sclerotic government response that is amplified by leadership which doesn’t seem to care”. Gibney said he recognized a parallel “prison of belief” between Trump cronies and the subjects of his prior films, such as Theranos’s Elizabeth Holmes (The Inventor) and the Church of Scientology (Going Clear). “He runs his administration in a way which prizes loyalty above all else, as if he’s kind of a mafia don,” he said. “But then what’s demanded of people is that they begin to adopt and absorb his own magical thinking.” Retracing the events also demonstrates the influence of non-elected officials who can mold longstanding federal institutions in their image – Azar and Caputo’s steering of information favorable to the president’s view, for example, or Kushner’s feckless taskforce. “If anything, the pandemic has really exposed exactly those kinds of high-level decisions can affect us in a very intimate way,” said Hillinger. “When you vote for somebody, you’re not just voting for them; you’re voting for all of the other political appointees that they may put in power. And those people, and the decisions that they make and the way that they communicate, have a direct effect on your life.” Given America’s polarized information landscape, it seems unlikely the film will play to people not already familiar with or amenable to the truth of a mishandled federal response. Still, the film-makers maintain that visualizing as many factual reports as possible into a coherent timeline for the record is justification enough. By presenting a narrative sequence of events, “people will see very clearly that the problem here was not a virus that overwhelmed us,” Gibney said. “The problem here was an inept, bungled federal response. If it changes some minds, great. And if it reinforces the opinions of others, great. “We went after a fact pattern. And we’re going to present that in a narrative form to people, hopefully seen as widely as possible.”"
"Body of Water is a sombre, painful British movie from first-time feature director Lucy Brydon. I’m still not sure what I think about this film’s overall narrative direction, or how other people affected by the issues are going to take it – but it certainly functions as an unflinchingly forthright examination of what is at stake. The film concerns a family dysfunction over three generations: Stephanie (Sian Brooke) is a photographer and single mum who has an eating disorder, depression and drug problems, and while she has been away in one of her many stays in rehab, her angry, troubled teen daughter Pearl (Fabienne Piolini-Castle) has been living with Stephanie’s mum Susan (Amanda Burton) who has enough to worry about with her imminent wedding to her new partner Annette (Kazia Pelka). Stephanie returns home with her problems unsolved and perhaps even further complicated by her relationship with her handsome nurse Shaun (Nick Blood), who is coming round and offering his home number for chats more readily than other professionals might. She also has an unhealthy, addictive relationship with social media, where she posts pictures of her emaciated body for likes and attention – the validation she isn’t getting in real life. Online, she feels seen. Body of Water addresses something often overlooked: eating disorders aren’t just for teenagers, and this shows that some of Stephanie’s mortification and pain is that she, a grown woman, feels infantilised both by the disorder and the treatment. She is excruciated by self-consciousness about her body and so this is a catastrophically bad time to be trying on (awful) bridesmaid’s dresses – in shared clothing store changing rooms with Pearl, what’s more – and then coming out to show them to her watchful and dissatisfied mother, Susan. In another sort of movie, that would be a scene of the purest black comedy. Not here. The return to Susan is in one way the worst things that could have happened, although Stephanie’s relapse (if it can be called so) can hardly be blamed on her mother. A sobering, difficult but intelligent drama. "
"A quarter of Vue’s UK cinemas are to shut three days a week in an effort to reduce costs after delays in the release of a string of blockbusters. The UK’s third-largest cinema chain will reduce its opening hours to four days a week at 21 of its 87 sites, keeping them shut on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. This comes after the rival chain Cineworld announced it would temporarily close 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse sites in the UK, leaving 5,500 employees with no work. Vue said in a statement that it had safely reopened its cinemas across Europe this summer but would now only operate from Friday to Monday at 21 sites across the UK to ensure it was “financially well placed” for the uncertainty ahead. “We remain committed to ensuring that Vue has a long-term future, to protecting the livelihoods of our staff and keeping our doors open to ensure our cinemas continue to serve the communities they operate in,” it said. “We came into this pandemic in a very strong position after a record 2019 and a record start to 2020, and we are looking forward to returning to full steam as soon as Hollywood studios start releasing the content which audiences are clamouring for.” Vue’s move follows the delay to the next James Bond film, No Time To Die, until April next year. The Marvel film Black Widow, the sci-fi blockbuster Dune, and Jurassic World: Dominion are also among the high-profile titles delayed as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Vue’s chief exective, Tim Richards, said last week that the Bond delay had caught the company by surprise. “We reopened on the basis that we were going to be getting movies that then didn’t arrive. There are a lot of players that do not have the size and scale Vue does that will not survive,” he said. “We will survive, we just need movies.”  The rival chain Odeon has also confirmed that about 30 of its 120 cinema sites will shut from Monday to Thursday. The AMC-owned cinema chain recently emailed loyalty customers to notify them that some cinemas will operate on a weekend-only model for the time being. Five of the Vue branches with reduced opening hours are in London, including the chain’s large cinema in Leicester Square.

"Pixie is her name and trouble is her game. “She won’t just break you, she’ll take a Kalashnikov to your heart,” is the warning at the start of this hectic gangster comedy from St Trinian’s director Barnaby Thompson. It features a strong lead performance from Olivia Cooke as Pixie, the step-daughter of a smalltime gangster in the west of Ireland. She’s written as a 21st-century femme fatale, a woman who uses her brains, beauty and cunning to sucker a succession of chumpish men into helping her rob drug dealers of MDMA with a street value of €1m. Her grand plan is to run away to art school in San Francisco. The tone of the film is Father Ted-meets-Tarantino, with a smattering of Ferris Bueller and In Bruges. There’s a legion of influences here, and what’s on screen is perhaps never quite enough its own thing. But still, there are some genuinely funny moments: the joke underpinning the whole thing is that gangster priests control drugs in the area, and are led by kingpin Father Hector (Alec Baldwin, disappointingly bringing nothing much to the part beyond a splash of Hollywood dazzle). Pixie’s heist involves robbing Father Hector, and when that goes awry, she hits the road with a holdall of MDMA, a body in the boot of the car and two gormless lads from the local pub. Cooke really is terrific, easily carrying the movie with her swallowed-a-lightbulb screen presence. I wondered if naming her character Pixie was a little dig at Hollywood’s Manic Pixie Girl cliche – the female characters who exist only to help men change and grow. By contrast, Pixie is her own woman, out for what she can get: an amoral, selfish free spirit. And yet, is she still a male fantasy? The script, written by the director’s son Preston Thompson, doesn’t do an awful lot to peel away the layers of seductiveness to find the real woman. But maybe it’s just not that kind of film."
"Although the first Two By Two film from 2015 was almost the cartoon equivalent of a war crime, this sequel is merely annoying for the most part, and even has fleeting moments when it’s sort of OK. That said, the script is still super-derivative and the retina-searing palette should carry a health warning. Aboard Noah’s ark, which is somehow still stuck at sea since the last film, the assembled species are getting fractious. Dave, the only surviving adult of a race of big, fluffy, psychedelically coloured creatures called the nestrians, tries to keep the peace as head chef by serving a green slop that looks like guacamole on the turn. This, unsurprisingly, satisfies neither the carnivores nor the herbivores.  Dave and his partner Hazel, a pseudo-vulpine creature that’s the last grown grymp, also struggle to raise their two offspring, a wussy boy nestrian named Finny and a bolshie female grymp called Leah. When the two kids fall off the ark in a storm, they end up discovering a desert island populated by dozens of other nestrians. But their leader, a battle-worn matriarch named Patch, is none too keen on letting the ark residents repatriate to this paradise. A pink jellyfish who talks in a high-squeak infantile voice comes to the rescue. There’s a volcano involved as well, and blue gas that comes out of the nestrian bottoms when they fart. The crosscutting between assorted storylines is especially hectic even by the standards of this kind of film, and younger kids may struggle to keep up, but the animation is a little smoother and more comely than that of its predecessor. Meanwhile, the numerous Irish accents in this English-language version, reflecting the film’s co-production background, makes for a pleasant break from the dubbed-in American phonetics preferred by most cartoons of this nature."
"Liam Neeson was 56 when Taken came out in 2008, launching his vengeful vigilante phase. Twelve years on, he’s still churning out serviceable action thrillers like this one, despite that screen persona spilling over into a controversial 2019 interview. Neeson stars as Tom, the honest thief of the title, also known – much to his irritation – as the In-and-Out Bandit. Tom’s late-in-life bank-robbing spree has netted him $9m, but he decides to go straight for the love of a good woman called Annie (Kate Walsh), and that’s when the trouble starts. Tom and Annie are just two divorcees in cosy knitwear, trying to make a go of things, but Tom’s good intentions fall foul of a pair of corrupt FBI agents, Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Hall (Anthony Ramos), who decide to take the money and frame him for murder. That means Tom must make use of whatever weapons he has at his disposal – fists, guns, explosives, cupcake delivery trucks – to get the truth out. The corny romance plot is actually rather sweet, but Honest Thief still lacks the elegiac tone that made Robert Redford’s recent film, The Old Man & the Gun, a richer take on a similar storyline. Tom quaintly refers to Annie as “my ladyfriend” but is in every other respect indistinguishable from an action hero half his age. It seems there’s no time for reflecting on lost loves while barrelling through Boston in a hot-wired car. In fact, this film’s real propulsive, emotional motor is nothing to do with a woman, but rather the age-old entanglement of lawman and outlaw. Tom and his pursuer, Agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan), are divided by circumstance yet united by the kind of unshakable integrity that lesser men – like Agents Hall and Nivens – could never begin to understand."
"François Ozon gives us a histrionic dose of photolove drama in this watchable if not especially profound young-love heartbreaker, which earnestly insists on the resounding emotional power of Rod Stewart’s classic track Sailing. It’s based on Dance on My Grave, the pioneering YA novel of gay experience by British author Aidan Chambers, published in 1982. This is a very 80s story, and the picture quality has that washed-out summer-faded quality that reminded me of the era’s denim and the films of Eric Rohmer. Félix Lefebvre plays Alex, a teenage boy who comes to a seaside town in Normandy with his parents. One day, while sailing his dinghy, Alex gets into difficulties, and is miraculously saved by David (Benjamin Voisin) a boy Alex’s age who happens to be sailing his own dinghy. There is an instant spark between them and they begin an affair in which David is clearly the dominant partner. Things are complicated when an English au pair, Kate (Philippine Velge) befriends them both, and the story is told in retrospect with Alex in police custody for reasons that are not clear. At first, Summer of 85 seems to occupy a generic Venn-overlap between a summer of sexual awakening, a coming-of-age drama and a dark psychological thriller. Alex at first icily breaks the fourth wall to say something chilling to us directly – a mannerism that is not repeated and misleads us about the nature of the film. As time goes on, it becomes a soapier, soppier tale in which the lovers make solemn oaths to each other to dance on the grave of the one who dies first, a gesture easily misunderstood. In some ways, the older generation upstage the leads. David’s widowed mother is played by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, who makes something genially eccentric of the role. When Alex is brought dripping wet to the family home after his dinghy mishap, she insists on taking him for a bath, undressing him and then, after a smirk at his nakedness, remarking that his mother can, indeed, be proud of him. Like much of the film, it’s not clear how intentional the absurdity is. Similarly odd is M Lefèvre, played by Melvil Poupaud wearing glasses, horrible clothes and sporting a bald patch. This is Alex’s weirdly predatory literature teacher who encourages his creative writing, and does everything but rub his thighs with his sweaty hands – and is especially keen on Alex’s autobiographical piece about the relationship with David, to whom Lefèvre may have offered a close mentorship the year before. There is tragedy in this story, but the grownup questions of guilt and loss are de-emphasised."
"Targeting the demographic intersection between geeky YA fiction readers, folks interested in psychology that doesn’t go much deeper than an internet quiz, and supermarket puzzle magazine fans, this sci-fi-inflected thriller is moderately satisfying as long as you don’t think about it too much. In a bland Arkansas suburb that happens to have been the home town of tech billionaire inventor Atticus Virtue (Chad Michael Murray), five very different high-school kids are invited to take part in an exclusive competition at his secluded mansion. The prize is a lifetime supply of chocolate … oh, sorry, no … the prize is the mansion itself – but the Willy Wonka parallels are about as blatant as the nominative determinism of the mysterious benefactor’s surname. Only this time, given Mr Virtue has been detained, the role of maybe-malevolent host-guide is taken by the disembodied voice of the house’s sentient computer, Haven (voiced by Star Trek alumna Marina Sirtis), who sets the kids a series of problems to solve that may be more dangerous than just counting jelly beans. The title character Max (Sydne Mikelle) is a shy-but-pretty-under-her-flannel-shirts coding champ with daddy issues; she pals up with Connor (Tanner Buchanan), the school star lacrosse player, who turns out to be a more sensitive soul than his jock reputation would suggest. A popular girl obsessed with her online image (Jade Chynoweth), a bully (Emery Kelly) and a gaming addict (Jason Genao) fill out the quintet. Before the night is over, all of them must confront their darkest fears, generated with simple effects and the magic wand that is a screenwriter’s “because tech” justification. This is hardly profound stuff, although the most creepy and resonant aspect is arguably the plotline revolving around the popular girl who gets stuck in a bathroom staring into a mirror version of herself that’s much nastier than the real thing, a simple cinematic sleight-of-hand that depends entirely on Chynoweth’s skill in projecting bitchy malevolence. A darker, hipper version of this movie might have made her the protagonist and proved more amusing to watch than the simpering leads we have here."
"The response to our callout in March for the experiences of people working in the film industry affected by the growing coronavirus crisis was overwhelming. Many hundreds of people shared their stories with us; stories suggesting that the bigger picture back then – of Cannes continuing, of Chinese cinemas starting to reopen, of multiplex confidence holding up – might be optimistic. Seven months later, the industry faces unprecedented challenges. The announcement that Cineworld, the UK’s largest cinema owner, would shut its premises until further notice has triggered a wave of similar closures from major chains – and many smaller venues. Cineworld blamed its move on the decision to postpone once again the release of No Time to Die, the 25th James Bond film, until April next year. Was that the start of the final credits for cinema as we know it? Or is a new narrative beginning to emerge? We caught up with the film industry workers we spoke to in March. They reveal how the summer that changed the sector forever has affected them. Philippa Lowthorpe, director of Misbehaviour and The Third Day What she said in March: How she feels in October: We were so sad about Misbehaviour, but as time went on and everyone else was having such a terrible time, it put things into perspective. Luckily for me I went straight from Misbehaviour to The Third Day, which is on now. We’d finished filming it and were just editing when the pandemic hit. The producers saw the it approaching like a juggernaut and were very quick off the mark to organise things. I was able to work at home in Bristol on this fantastic computer system, while the editor was in Surrey. It was amazing to reinvent how you work. The top of my house is now my little office: during the day I was doing The Third Day, then in the evening I was doing Misbehaviour publicity. It did feel a bit weird being at home, with my family all here and the dog wandering from room to room, but we were so lucky to have a roof over our heads and something to do, and we are so grateful for the technology that allows it. As a mum and woman film-maker, how much would I have loved to have worked like this in the past? I hope that some of these ways of working can be adopted permanently. We finished the finale of The Third Day two weeks ago. Now I am sitting reading film scripts, thinking, how on earth will these get made? I doubt if anyone will want to make things about a pandemic, we are living in it and it is too close. The scripts that make sense to me are the ones that take you out of your life. Or the more urgent political ideas reflecting, say, Black Lives Matter. Personally, I was very, very lucky I was doing something already. I feel so sorry for the people who were about to do something. I still have a cutting with all the review stars we got for Misbehaviour above my cooker. Just so I know it wasn’t a dream. Blair Barnette, film art director, who had all her future projects cancelled over a one-hour period What she said in March: How she feels in October:I’m still not working, I’ve tried a few things but they keep falling apart. In the film industry, some things have come back but not really to any great effect. There’s really not enough work for everybody, and it’s winding down again now. I have done some volunteering to keep my sanity, I’m helping out on a friend’s short film right now and I was shortlisted for a new BBC crime drama set in Liverpool – but Liverpool has just locked its doors so the show has just gone on hiatus. Because my partner is ill and needs my help I really have to stay in London. Just as things seemed to be getting back to normal, everything reversed. Right now my aim is just to get through each day. Traditionally the film industry starts to slow down around this time of year – October through February not many people are doing things as the days are shorter. It’s very seasonal work – and it seemed like the season that our work is the busiest also happened to be Covid season. I have been getting a furlough payment of just over £500 per month, for two of us to live on. It pays for our groceries so we are not starving. I got a bounceback loan, but that’s nearly all gone and I am not sure how I am going to pay it back. The credit card companies have been good and put a freeze on everything, so our outgoings were not so bad, but the rent was inflexible. We had to move out of our flat, and we are living somewhere where the landlord is more sympathetic. The rent is delayed but we still have to pay it – so we get more in debt each week. I am absolutely stressed out. I’ve never been in debt before, and now I have a ridiculous amount. I just don’t sleep. I can’t see myself digging out of the debt – I am getting so many brown envelopes that I am afraid to even open. So I think I am going to have to wrap up my company and start again somehow. On top of it all our particular neighbourhood in east London seems to have turned into the wild west. There’s been so much crime. We rented a van and within 12 hours it had been stolen, and we are being held responsible by the rental company, even though it was in a locked car park. We’ve had six burglaries in four months – even our garden tools were stolen. You just couldn’t script it. Kevin Markwick, owner and manager of Picture House, Uckfield, East Sussex, which closed in line with government advice a week before lockdown, and remained shut for more than four months What he said in March: How he feels in October: It’s tough, there’s no denying it. Not least because we’ve been abandoned to our fate by the big studios, who seem content to sit back and let it happen. But there’s enough content out there for us to be able to cobble a programme together. We’ve also been doing event-cinema’s greatest hits, and that’s kind of saved us. Audiences for things like the NT Live’s Present Laughter are quite significant – we actually had a sellout the other night. As long as that sort of thing keeps coming we can keep our head above water. We are down to a skeleton staff yet we are still not breaking even. Our reserves will run out eventually but we can can keep going for a while and will be OK should the BFI step up with the cinema part of the culture recovery fund. We will need some of that to get us through until … well, who knows how long? The outpouring of support from the local community has just been really heartwarming. [Now we just need to] keep the supply of films going. Rebecca has been looking strong this week, and it’s our older audience that are coming, not the younger audience, which is counterintuitive. But we’ve worked really hard: keeping everything clean, one-way systems, all that. We’ve had no problems, people are very relaxed about it. The restaurant is also holding its own. We were lucky we had something in the tank, what with the opening two months of the year being the best we ever had. Not everyone was fortunate enough to be in that position, so some have gone to the wall. But I think the independents can be pretty resilient because we can be fleet of foot and move quickly, unlike corporate behemoths like Cineworld and Vue. But we need the multiplexes to survive, because no one is going to release big films to a handful of independent cinemas. Studios don’t seem to understand there is a wide world out there, and that we’ve all got to take a hit. So the Bond only makes half a billion dollars – why can’t they make a billion dollars on the next one? They seem to think they can make money by sitting there doing nothing. It seems such an odd way to behave. This may be genius or a disaster but I am actually converting our third screen into a high-end luxury screen, with little tables and food service. We decided to do it after lockdown, to improve the offer as well as take advantage of social distancing. I want to do everything I can to help us survive. This place has been here for 100 years, and we as a family for 55 years. I’m not going down without a fight. Rebecca O’Brien, producer of Ken Loach’s films What she said in March: How she feels in October: I’m in the Scottish highlands where we’re just about to go into production on a remake of a French thriller called My Son, which is being directed by Christian Carion. It’s an eight-day shoot starting at the beginning of November, and while Covid does make it even more difficult, I am delighted to be just working on something. Ken and I had had been planning to make a film in August. But we needed to have been getting the show on the road when the first lockdown started, so we had to call it off. Sixteen Films is only a small company, and we make one film a year, if we’re lucky. Without Ken’s film, we’d have struggled to keep going. Then I got a call from some French producers about My Son, and that was an absolute gift: now we have a film for this year, and it has made a real difference. To do it we’ve had to take over a whole hotel, and everybody who comes in has to be tested. We are a bubble, which is a good thing – knowing everyone has been tested makes you feel secure. People need to be reassured, especially off the beaten track where we are. They are concerned that outsiders will bring the illness in. But the problem with Covid is that we are still not guaranteed we’ll get to the end of the shoot. It depends on what the Scottish or UK government do: we might be in lockdown any minute. To make a film you need certainties and there are no certainties with Covid. If there’s a lockdown in the next four weeks we’ll be blown out of the water. Because it’s a French-British co-production, half our crew are French, and it’s been particularly difficult for them, what with the quarantine and that they are so far away from home. And now we can’t even go to the pub. Tricia Tuttle, BFI festivals director What she said in March: How she feels in October: In March, when I reflected on the overnight, forced pivot to digital of BFI Flare, our LGBTQI+ film festival, we assumed the worst of it – the dreaded Covid restrictions – would be over by autumn. Little did I imagine we would be delivering the London film festival in an ambitious hybrid digital/physical form all over the UK. As we were planning the LFF this summer, we occasionally wondered if people would be so fatigued with zoom and screens that it would diminish the festival. But everyone who loves cinema wants good news stories, and LFF really has been one. Across the country, a “full house” of 800 people watched the LFF digital cinema premiere of the restoration of Mohammad Reza Aslani’s 1976, presumed-lost Iranian gem, Chess of the Wind (the “Persian lovechild of Tennessee Williams and Ingmar Bergman”); together we dried a tear after the premiere of Harry Macqueen’s Supernova, a gay love story about a couple struggling with early onset dementia; and Elisabeth Moss wowed sell-out physical and digital audiences as a wickedly funny Shirley Jackson in the eponymous biopic on the horror writer. It’s vertiginous. We went from the sky crashing in with the move of key autumn blockbusters and the closure of Cineworld, to a collective mini-euphoria of Saint Maud, by British debutant film-maker Rose Glass (who won the IWC Bursary at LFF last year), storming the UK box office. I am an optimist. Perhaps we’re glimpsing how hopeful, and hopefully resilient, real cultural cinema is when the venues aren’t flooded with films that have infinite marketing spend. Tammy ‘TS’ Botkin, writer/director of Legacy of the Fighting Filipinos What she said in March: How she feels in October: It’s been challenging. We were unable to film our last two planned shoots, one in the US and one in the Philippines. A woman guerrilla I wanted to interview hasn’t been able to return to the US from the Philippines – and where she is now is too remote to reach. We also lost touch with others we were hoping to speak to. Big donors pulled out because they’d been watching the pandemic wreak havoc with their portfolios, and they haven’t returned. Then we had others who said: talk to us after the election! We took a look at what we had and decided we owed it to our elderly veterans to finish telling this story as soon as possible. Because we couldn’t reach our subjects safely, we made the decision to include more animation to complete the film. The problem is that animation is far more expensive than talking-head interviews. Now we’re seeking funding for that. We continue to enjoy support from the Filipino-American and veteran communities for our audience build, and we are talking to distributors. Another bright spot: I got to celebrate the 103rd birthday of one of our featured veterans via Zoom. Mr Almeda decided, for some reason, to show up as a disembodied head that was inverted on screen. He was quite amused with himself. And he was really pleased to have a bunch of people wish him a happy birthday from a safe distance! But it’s been tough getting to a fine cut in post [production]. The National Archives remain shuttered. Our editing crew has worked on deferment. I had to take a second full-time job just to keep things going, processing grants for families to keep them from being evicted. It’s also been challenging for my producing partner, Amanda, who’s deaf. Trying to get people to make pretty simple accommodations once you’ve switched everything to phone and Zoom has created a lot of issues. There are days I get up and say, ‘We’re doing this!’ and we all plough forward. Then there are days when we all have to drag ourselves to our feet and curse our way through. But we remember: our veterans did not have an option to quit. We won’t either. Kevin Macdonald, Oscar-winning director What he said in March: How he feels in October: We didn’t take our film to the fall festivals in the end, because they didn’t really exist in a way that seemed to make it worthwhile for the financiers. It’s a frustrating time to be involved in a film that is designed and then sold as a theatrical proposition, territory by territory – with all of them following America. We’re hoping to take it to a festival in the spring instead. But who knows? The uncertainty is, if anything, greater now, and that sense of jeopardy for cinemas has reached fever pitch. Nothing has become any clearer. And I’m getting more pessimistic because it’s just gone on so long. I think audiences would have gone to see Bond. They could have still had very good numbers. Around Christmas people might have taken the chance – and cinemas would have made it as safe as possible. I think it was a real opportunity to get people to go back. I can understand the decision, but you wonder whether, six months down the line, there will be any cinemas left in which to show these hugely expensive films. I’ve been back to the cinema a few times in the past few months and it was actually really nice because every screening was practically empty. I didn’t understand a word of Tenet, but there was something extra exciting about it because it was on the big screen. At least production has opened up again and shooting is possible, if tricky. Things are being made, but for streaming. I’ve been editing Life in a Day 2020, 10 years after I made the first film – and it’s been a real antidote to those other anxieties. It reminds you of the wider world. There’s a lot of joy there, as well as a lot of darkness and misery and people suffering from Covid economically and physically. We’ve had some brilliant contributions from far-flung farms in Russia and people living in communes in the middle of Siberia. You sort of think, actually life can still go on. And anything to do with nature feels much more alluring than it probably did eight months ago. I still think people want escapism; films that are feelgood. During the Great Depression people liked jolly musicals with dancing girls. Now, everyone’s on edge, so something that’s entertaining is paramount. But they also yearn to be well-informed. I think the echo chamber of the media and social media has got people down and they want to be able to rely on their sources of news, and for that news to be thorough and well-researched. So documentaries may come out of all this quite well, if they can react to that appetite to understand the world and those fears about misinformation. Kelly Jeffs, CEO of the Light House cinema, Wolverhampton, which closed in line with government advice What she said in March: How she feels in October: We’ve been closed since 20 March. The government said cinemas could reopen from 4 July but we weren’t in a position to do so. My team has been furloughed for the entire time. There are 19 on the books and four salaried staff. My operations manager and I have been there for more than 20 years. In May, we got some funding from the BFI, part of the resilience fund, which helped cover costs to bring me off furlough so I could look for other fundraising and keep some sort of communication strategy going. In August, we launched a crowdfunder for a month and we raised more than £12,000 to help towards reopening costs. It was great to re-engage with our supporters and we had fantastic support on social media and lots of press, and the mayor of Birmingham came and donated. We’ve just been offered some smaller grant money from the BFI, which has given me some sort of hope that they care, and we’re now waiting on the decision for more major funding from the DCMS. We’re at a fork in the road. If we don’t get funding, there’ll be some difficult decisions ahead. I’ve never worked from home before, and it’s been a very difficult transition to go from being immersed with people all the time – audiences, staff, my peer network – to suddenly not seeing anybody. There have been some tough weeks where I’ve felt really isolated and others where you connect with the team again and it’s really helpful. It’s been great over the past month or so to have new products coming through, and things like the London film festival. The whole debate around the future of cinema has kept us busy in terms of thinking of the effects and opportunities of multiplexes closing. I don’t want to start sounding insensitive, but we have to think about repositioning ourselves if we can get up and running again. I understand the Bond decision. It’s not just about people consuming a film, it’s about the sponsorship and partnership deals – watches, cars, pure consumerism. But it does all trickle down to a small, independent cinema like ours. We’ve had all the recent Bonds on release and had a really good bread and butter income from them. Sometimes I still wake up and think, “Really? Is this what’s happened?” And then it starts to become a bit of white noise in the background. That’s one reason I think has meant things aren’t going to plan: people are tired, there’s a malaise. And it does make you question whether your own cultural organisation is absolutely necessary. Should it be a priority for society? And then you think, well, actually, yes. The arts is the fifth biggest contributor to the economy in this country. And our cinema was never exclusive. No one would ever have said they wouldn’t come to us because we were cliquey. We were a family. Samantha Kent, film costumier What she said in March: How she feels in October: I thankfully did qualify for maternity allowance. My little boy was born during full lockdown in mid-June. The allowance takes me to March [2021]. What was panic a few months ago is now relief as at least I have some money coming in and I’m not competing for the jobs that are out there. My main concerns now are whether there will be an industry to return to, and any childcare. Or will I, like many mothers, be forced into giving up my career? Michael Reynolds, treatment writer in LA What he said in March: How he feels in October: I’m happy – and I must say, surprised – to report that I’ve been paid for all 12 of those outstanding jobs. I’m very lucky. I’ve had issues getting paid for a couple of jobs begun right after the restart in June, but if I emerge from this experience having gone unpaid but once or twice, I’ll consider it a remarkable escape. Advertising fell off a cliff during the initial lockdown but seems to be coming back – if not to levels of production in 2019, then certainly to a point where I’m marginally busy. That said, Covid has accelerated a process of personal disillusionment that started a long time ago. I know that all of us – literally every American – is in some way complicit in a system that pushes consumerism and myths of meritocracy as cover for a kind of corporate serfdom. I am certainly part of it. But I’d naively thought Covid and the realisations about “what matters in life” might change people enough to change the systems. I didn’t expect revolution, but perhaps a kinder, more considered approach to work, to what we’re putting out into the world. Something like, “Is this the life we want to lead and the world we want to inhabit?” In macro, this doesn’t seem to be happening. Many of the “Covid ads” have been spectacularly cynical and craven – Wells Fargo (as always) wins the prize – and at least in my limited experience, there has been very little pushback against the resumption of life and orientation as they were before all of this happened. But I’ve had some really meaningful conversations with colleagues who have become strong friends. I think in any job, there’s a mask you have to wear to conceal your deeper feelings, and when there are clients and pressures and the need to please, the need to keep your job, you wear the mask tightly. These last six months, a number of people in my work life have opened up about their deeper beliefs and ideals in a way that’s made me feel a part of a hopeful and positive discussion. It’s been a bit like discovering the robots were human all along. Finally: I’ve had ambitions of “making it” in film/TV for a long time. This period has helped me to see how these ambitions – and my failure to achieve them – have contributed to a lot of unhappiness. I can only control what I can control, which for me has meant focusing on things I like to do and that make me feel alive rather than striving to succeed so I can fill the void. Life is happening here and now, it is short, and this is the only one there is. Jesus Garces Lambert, Mexican director working in Rome, who made a video diary about the pandemic with other ex-pats What he said in March: How he feels in October:After the documentary I had been working on before lockdown was called off, I started developing a bunch of projects at home with big production companies – though not about coronavirus this time. We were supposed to start filming one in October-November, everything was looking super good, but with the pandemic returning it has been postponed to 2021. So I have to change the way I think as a film-maker. One project meant filming in Miami, but the producers didn’t want to take the responsibility of sending a crew there. Instead I concentrated on being more local, filming just in Italy, like the project we were supposed to start in October – but after the second wave started the protagonist said: “OK, I don’t want to have anyone with a camera near me” and that was that. Financially I have just about kept going. When you are a freelance you are used to this sort of situation: you have very good months, and then put money aside for when you don’t earn anything. There’s really no money in development in Italy, but the producers wanted to work with me and paid me a little. I have also been filming some interviews for American companies who can’t come to shoot in Italy. Production companies here are not insured for pandemic, so you have to sign a release for if you get ill. Otherwise you won’t work. If nothing happens in the next six months I might have to sign up as a fruit picker. But I am confident – even though we don’t know when this is going to end. Jo Rae, owner of Kraken Films What she said in March: How she feels in October: Everyone thought we were going to come out of the worst of it by the autumn, so it’s beginning to really hit people hard. A very close friend has started getting anxiety attacks aged 50. If you haven’t suffered the blues before, they’ve really gone into the mean reds, to quote Breakfast at Tiffany’s. It has rattled me a lot but because I’ve suffered from clinical depression for 20 years I’m a bit more used to dealing with it. Still, across the industry, those mental health issues have been really exacerbated by the lack of financial support from the government – and their lack of recognition of the arts. It’s been a real knife in the back. Our creative industries are world renowned and respected and then the government tells you to retrain in tech. My mum is an 82-year-old former ballet dancer and she was livid at the Fatima ad: “They don’t know what hard training is! Your toes can fall off!” It’s so insulting. It’s as if art is just something that’s nice to have. I think there should be a one-day blackout across the entertainment industry. Let’s see how people get on without music, Netflix and so on. Something needs to happen; I know so many companies who are just going under. Still, I’m far more positive than I was in March. I made a decision early on not to just wait. I wanted to find out as much as possible about how to survive in the new world. I’m a qualified Covid supervisor for film sets now. I did my own shoot, for a four-minute film on anamorphics, and I wrote and produced a self-funded short film, based on the experiences of lockdown back in June – basically to keep myself busy and mentally occupied. There are two types of people: those who just complain – for the right reasons – but perpetuate this really negative vibe. And there are the others who just want to move forward and make content. My company was six months old in March. It was exhausting but I just had to keep the conversations going."
"Getting a small, independent movie into cinemas is a huge challenge at the best of times. Ironically, it might be easier in the worst of times. Which, thanks to Covid, is now. That is what Guy Davies found with his new film Philophobia, a coming-of-age romance set in his home town of Stroud. With the big studio movies now in hibernation, cinemas are hungry for new content, which means opportunities for smaller fare. So Davies decided to take the initiative. “I’d been banging on doors all year with the film,” says the 29-year-old film-maker, “so I just thought: why not go directly to cinemas?” Philophobia is as indie as they come. Davies found investors by putting an ad in his local paper. He also did all the marketing and online materials himself, even getting the posters printed. He didn’t have sales agents or professional help, or any idea of what he was supposed to do; he literally just looked up some cinema people and began cold-calling and emailing them. “I started with a few local cinemas, just hoping to release it in Gloucestershire and the surrounding area, but once got some booked in, I guess word spread.” Now Philophobia is set to release in more than 50 UK cinemas, including the Showcase and Vue chains, and central London locations including Leicester Square. “I felt like there was a gap in the market and we could probably take advantage of that,” he says, “but I wasn’t expecting to get anywhere near the response I did.” Philophobia will not be everyone’s cup of tea (think a broodier, dreamier Sex Education). Some plot elements are very familiar and the gaze is somewhat boy-centric, but it is heartfelt and handsome, with a promising young cast. Furthermore, the themes and modern-day setting should appeal to young adults, probably the least catered-to demographic in cinema right now, and also the least afraid to actually go to them. Davies was partly inspired by the success of After We Collided, another YA romance, which was independently released in September, again with zero marketing. It came in second to Tenet at the box office, and has taken £3.5m in the UK so far. (Davies cannily got cinemas to play the trailer for Philophobia in front of it.) A new ecosystem could be emerging here. This time last year, Joker was hogging more than 650 UK screens, and the forgettable Addams Family remake another 550. With the big studio movies felled by Covid, some light is reaching the forest floor. The result could be space for new talent, catering to new audiences. With some enlightened cinema programming, this could sustain the industry through these lean times – and beyond. Davies’s advice? “You have to be a bit relentless. You’ve just got to keep knocking on the door and hope for the best.” "
"It was the year of the abdication crisis, the Jarrow marches, the Battle of Cable Street and the launch of the BBC’s television service. Beyond Britain’s shores, the world was edging closer to war. In Christchurch, then in Hampshire but now in Dorset, people were flocking to the Regent Centre in 1936 to watch movies such as Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times and Mr Deeds Goes to Town, starring Gary Cooper. The Regent had been built five years earlier by a local entrepreneur at a cost of £25,000. In the middle of the decade, new owners gave it a plush makeover, featuring a deep rose, gold and silver colour scheme and art deco signage. The cinema thrived. But in 1973 the march of the Rank Organisation reached the south coast town, and the movie theatre became a Mecca bingo hall. Thankfully not for long: Christchurch council bought the property in 1983, and leased it to a charitable trust to run it as an independent. Now, as cinemas across the country are shutting their doors or curtailing their opening hours as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Regent is bucking the trend. Next month it will reopen after the completion of a £350,000 restoration project funded by the local community. “It is a bit of a gamble, to be honest,” Gary Trinder, chair of the trust and a cinema historian, told the Observer. “None of us knows quite what’s coming next. But people were desperate for us to reopen.” Trinder, who oversaw the 2009 restoration of the Grade II*-listed Plaza cinema in Stockport, had a clear vision for the Regent. “We wanted to recreate the way the cinema looked in the mid-1930s. Converting an idea into reality is always a bit worrying, but we’re extremely pleased with the result.” Fourteen different paint colours on the cinema’s walls – “a bit too vibrant, left over from the bingo days,” said Trinder – were replaced with a classic palette of deep rose with features picked out in gold, silver, black and dark brown. A bespoke carpet was ordered from a specialist firm, which consulted its historical files to create a pattern of silver leaves on a mulberry background. New seating, made to a traditional design and upholstered in deep red moquette, was supplied by another specialist company. “They look like period cinema seats, but they’re vastly more comfortable,” said Trinder. The restoration was planned long before Covid-19 disrupted the world. Funds had been raised by a £1 levy on ticket sales, donations and the sale of seat plaques. By the time the cinema closed at the start of lockdown, contractors had been appointed and orders placed with specialist suppliers. “We were committed by then,” said general manager Matthew Vass-White. “We’d planned for a five-week refurbishment. If there was a very slight silver lining to lockdown it was that it gave us more time to do the job.” The Regent had been riding the crest of a wave, with record-breaking years in 2018 and 2019. “Last year, we had 155,000 admissions and were named top independent cinema. We went into lockdown from a better position than some independents, but we can’t sustain zero income forever,” Vass-White said. When the cinema reopens on 12 November, with a screening of a Michael Ball and Alfie Boe performance that was cancelled during lockdown, a maximum of 170 seats out of 509 will be occupied because of Covid-19 restrictions. The cinema’s cafe – usually run by the trust’s 200 volunteers – will remain closed but people will be able to buy a drink from the bar. The pandemic means the cinema will be operating at a loss for the foreseeable future. “Reopening is a way of reducing our losses, rather than making money,” said Trinder. “Every person who comes through our doors helps. If we ever get back to break-even point, I’ll be absolutely delighted. “This is a critical moment for cinemas. Forty per cent of cinemas in this country are run by independent operators. Those with small reserves will be pushed under, but the big multiplexes will rebound.” He reserved particular fury for the distributors of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, who pulled its release for the second time this month. “We were just about to show the Bond film when we closed in March. We were going to reopen with it in November. It would have been a shot in the arm for struggling cinemas.” As well as reducing its capacity by two-thirds, the Regent has invested £10,000 in Covid-19 compliance equipment and has doubled its cleaning operation. But Vass-White said he was constantly – and anxiously – awaiting further changes to Covid-19 regulations. “The future is unknown for all independent cinema operators. We have fantastic community support, so we’re hopeful. And at the moment, we’re all good to go.”"
"Flash Gordon fans worldwide can only imagine what might have been. Futuristic artwork – including lots of phallic imagery – that was created for an aborted 1979 feature film about the cult spaceman superhero and his intergalactic adventures is to be published for the first time. The production was to have been directed by one of Britain’s foremost film-makers, the late Nicolas Roeg, who had made Don’t Look Now, a horror story starring Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, and The Man Who Fell to Earth, the arthouse science fiction drama starring David Bowie as an alien. His Flash Gordon film would have starred Debbie Harry, lead singer of the American band Blondie, as Princess Aura, the seductive daughter of Ming the Merciless, the tyrannical dictator, who would have been played by Hollywood movie star Keith Carradine. But the production was abandoned before Roeg had cast his superhero after he fell out with its producer, Dino De Laurentiis, the movie mogul who made Barbarella, a 1968 science-fiction comic adaptation that turned Jane Fonda into a sex symbol. De Laurentiis had dreamed of three Flash Gordon films. He only made one, the 1980 version directed by Mike Hodges, which became a cult favourite, with huge conventions worldwide despite disappointing reviews. The film has now been restored by StudioCanal to mark December’s 40th anniversary of its original release. Flash Gordon was originally created by Alex Raymond, the American artist. In 1933, publisher King Features asked him and writer Don Moore to create a rival to the 1929 comic strip Buck Rogers. Flash Gordon made his newspaper debut in 1934 and became an instant hit, read by more than 50 million people a week in 130 newspapers worldwide. John Walsh, a film-maker and author, has retrieved about 40 designs for the Roeg version from the British Film Institute (BFI) archives: “It’s public knowledge that Roeg worked on the film’s development. What hasn’t been seen is its artwork.” Walsh will feature the artwork in his forthcoming book, Flash Gordon: The Official Story of the Film, to be published on 20 November. One image depicts Flash Gordon confronting Ming for a sword fight on top of the emperor’s royal spaceship. “It is a vast sequence that could not have been realised using 1970s technology,” Walsh said. “This image has more of the flourish of the original Raymond comic strips from the 1930s.” The artwork was created by the production designer, Ferdinando Scarfiotti, who went on to win an Oscar for The Last Emperor in 1987. But most of the imagery suggests a very different film, Walsh said: “It would have been a much more sexually explicit sci-fi romp. Dino chose Roeg, who died in 2018, because he’d worked on The Man Who Fell to Earth, which is science fiction and a very good film, but it’s as far from comic strip melodrama as you could get.” Of the artwork, he said: “Everything’s quite organic. They look like plants… Ming’s spaceship is the most conventional of the designs, but most of the spaceships are a cross between phallic imagery and orchid flowers, reflecting a more adult tone based on the sexualised imagery of the 1930s strip. “I interviewed John Richardson, who had worked on its special effects for four months before De Laurentiis pulled the plug. He said, I asked Nic one day ‘what do you see Ming’s spaceship looking like?’ He replied, ‘I see it like a heaving, mucus-covered placenta’ [though that] differs from the design shown. “Richardson was taken aback because he was expecting something that had much more of a 1930s Chrysler motor look to it. “Instead, Roeg was taking it in a completely opposite organic direction. In a sense, Dino was right to pull the plug.”"
"Here’s a charmless comedy drama set in Brixton, London, about the lead singer of a crap rock band (called the Undefined) who gets diagnosed with throat cancer. He is the horrifically irritating Aaron (Alex Gillison), a man with the unwinning combination of a Kurt Cobain haircut, eyeliner and Russell Brand’s fondness for a chest-exposing T-shirt. Despite having practically nothing interesting to say he is forever breaking the fourth wall to bang on to the camera in grandiose mockney. Aaron formed the Undefined in secondary school with his mates. Now in their mid-20s, they’re still playing gigs in local dives to audiences of underage kids with fake IDs. But the band is Aaron’s life, so when his oncology consultant – a candidate for cinema’s least convincing medic – explains that chemotherapy is not compatible with his lifestyle, Aaron skips his treatment. “What’s more important, rock’n’roll or life?” his on-off girlfriend implores. South of the River is a pretty depressing watch, with not much in the way of entertainment or humour. A subplot involving Aaron’s bandmate Jackson having pretensions to being bisexual like David Bowie could have been written in 1987. Director Joe Watkins gives us the film’s best performance as Jackson, a warm, affectionate wally, though even Guy Ritchie would find his unreconstructed banter about “birds” and a “bit of crumpet” dated. This feels like one of those low-budget British films that was presumably aimed as a TV issue drama but wouldn’t make the cut."
"It was less licence to kill and more dramatic licence. Donald Trump’s claim that the late Sean Connery assisted him in getting planning applications passed in Scotland fell apart quickly on Sunday when the chair of the planning committee said the James Bond star was not involved. In a series of tweets, two days prior to the US election, Trump paid tribute to Connery, saying he was “highly regarded and respected in Scotland and beyond”. It was announced on Saturday the James Bond actor had died aged 90. But his claim that Connery stepped in and shouted “let him build the damn thing” in connection with a big development raised eyebrows in Scotland. He tweeted that “everything went swimmingly” with his development plans after initially “having a very hard time getting approvals”. In 2008 Connery is reported as saying of the project: “During tough economic times, this is a major vote of confidence in Scotland’s tourist industry and our ability to rise to the challenge. I look forward to seeing a new gem in the north-east that is good for Aberdeenshire and good for Scotland.” But Martin Ford, the Aberdeenshire councillor who was chair of the planning committee that initially refused Trump’s application to build the resort, told the Guardian: “Mr Connery was not involved in the due process that led to the granting of planning permission for a golf resort at Menie. He did not submit a letter of representation to the council, appear at the planning hearing, or at the public local inquiry.” Ford added: “Opinions offered in press articles are not material considerations in decisions on planning applications.” Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said: “Scotland and much of the world is mourning the loss of a great spirit. Sean Connery’s contribution and life’s work was immense, real and lasting and everyone with an ounce of class is reflecting upon just that today. Tributes are great from all sources but this is not a time for tweeting silly claims or indeed responding to them.” David Milne, a near neighbour of the Trump golf course in Scotland, and the US president’s most vocal local critic, said the claim that Connery helped him land planning permission for his golf resort was “utter bollocks”. Milne said Connery had never played the course, despite Trump’s invites. The actor was offered the honour of becoming the first member of Trump’s golf resort at Menie, north of Aberdeen, with membership number 007, which the property mogul built after bulldozing a very rare dune habitat as well as overriding local planning rules. Trump had said that he wanted the star to play the first shot on the course. But when the resort was opened two years later, Trump played first balls with former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie instead. The pair did know each other, however. Connery and Trump were photographed together at several events in New York, including the Johnnie Walker Dressed to Kilt fashion show in the early 2000s."
"I was 17, and just beginning university, when Requiem for a Dream descended on cinemas like an opaque, bruise-blue mist. Notwithstanding the no-under-18s restrictions stamped upon it by stern censors in the UK and elsewhere, I like to think I was the optimal age for it. Darren Aronofsky’s addiction drama may be cross-generational in its focus, but with its unremittingly punishing storytelling and frenzied, all-systems-go cinematic energy, it represents a very young person’s idea of how a very adult film looks, sounds and spasms. I loved it, even as it followed me through a tertiary arts education to the point of overkill: its poster gracing umpteen friends’ dorm rooms, its Clint Mansell/Kronos Quartet string theme – and its countless remixes – soundtracking all manner of student theatre pieces and presentations, its formal and literary flourishes seized upon by many a hip professor seeking a modish mutual reference point. If this sounds like the prelude to a revisionist takedown, I thought it might be one too. It’s 20 years since Requiem for a Dream was released, and at least 15 since I last saw it: revisiting it this week, I was prepared for it to be as dated and artificially edgy as a turn-of-the-millennium tribal tattoo. In a sense it is. There’s no mistaking Aronofsky’s film as a highly styled product of its era, its hopped-up editing schemes and plethora of lens choices and gimmicks a glossy refinement of 90s indie aesthetics and Tarantino-patented extremity. It doesn’t miss a trick, and doesn’t want us to miss any of its tricks either. Some critics called it over-directed at the time, and more of their colleagues would probably join them today; a generation of more restrained kids as old as I was then, quieter rather than shock-inclined in their anxiety, might even agree. And yet. Certainly, a large part of Requiem’s stylistic mania amounts to auteurist showing-off. It was Aronofsky’s second film, coming two years after his scrappier, more cryptic but equally out-to-dazzle Sundance sensation Pi, and with more money and bigger names at his disposal, he set out to prove himself as the pre-eminent artist-provocateur of his indie class. Still, in choosing to adapt Hubert Selby Jr’s cultish 1978 novel of New York junkie miserablism – and very faithfully, at that – the then 31-year-old film-maker found about the ideal canvas for his ugly showmanship. The novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction on a quartet of characters: three of them connected in their youth and knowing submission to heroin, and the fourth an elderly Brooklyn widow, drawn obliviously into amphetamine psychosis by solitude, TV fixation and irresponsibly prescribed diet pills. It’s a slender story that makes its essential points early, often and obviously: we’re all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren’t necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts. Scripted in collaboration with the author, Aronofsky’s interpretation doesn’t complicate things any, but it does bring to the material an electrified sensory charge that hasn’t quite been replicated in any other addiction drama. In all its flash, slam-bang technique, it vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath. Aronofsky’s film-making is neither subtle nor tasteful, two words you wouldn’t tend to apply to heroin addiction either. Its excesses feel grounded, however oppressively, in the hellish experience of all its characters – it’s surely the most stylishly made drug drama ever to escape any accusations of glamorising the scene. As two young, beautiful, kohl-eyed lovers bound by needles and deferred dreams, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly initially seem veritable poster children for that quintessentially 90s concept of heroin chic. By the time the film reaches its notoriously grotesque, despairing climactic montage, crosscutting between the amputation of his gangrenous arm – a body-horror image more unforgettably gross than any cursed cigarette-pack photo – and her going ass-to-ass with another woman for a braying, paying audience, any concept of “chic” is firmly off the table. Such is the paradox of Requiem for a Dream, which pushed the envelope in its explicit, from-the-inside view of addiction and its spiralling consequences, while maintaining a philosophical perspective as cautiously moralising as any Just Say No public service announcement. What real shock value it had was tied mostly to Ellen Burstyn’s indelible, progressively unhinged performance as frail, sweet-natured shut-in Sara Goldfarb, whose short-term chemical solution to her loneliness and body-image issues winds up frying her brain as drastically as any class-A drug. Burstyn’s fearless turn hooked this impressively abrasive film an Oscar nomination it would never have received in any other category – and with it, an older audience that probably wouldn’t have considered seeing a film about three young, damned smackheads. It probably surprised them as much as it did any student-age punters drawn in by the vogueish, subversion-promising marketing: “the cinematic heroin nightmare for the whole family” wasn’t anywhere to be seen on that ubiquitous poster, but it wouldn’t have been far off. Two decades on, Requiem for a Dream doesn’t look especially cool – but then, it never really did. Rather, its numbing, slightly-sick-in-your-mouth power remains undiminished, as does the hard-driving impact of Aronofsky’s film-making: it set the pace for a filmography marked by earnest, grandiose outrageousness, from the ludicrous, ravishing romantic folly of The Fountain through to the magnificent, unapologetically narcissistic artist’s self-diagnosis of his recent Mother!. As someone born closer to the year 2000 than I was might say, Requiem for a Dream didn’t have to go so hard. But I’m kind of glad it did."
"If you like being shocked, creeped out and righteously infuriated by documentaries such as The Great Hack and The Social Dilemma that explain how our data is being mined by nefarious forces, then you’ll love People You May Know. Directed by Katharina Gellein Viken and Charles Kriel – who also appear on screen, and are together as a couple and bring their infant daughter along with them on their travels – this investigative work is as much a travelogue as an exposé. It starts in London in 2018 with US-born Kriel serving as an adviser to the DCMS committee report on disinformation and “fake news”, as it attempted to turn over the slimy rocks to gather whether Cambridge Analytica had sinister influence on voters supporting Brexit and the 2016 US election. From there Kriel, Gellein Viken and various researchers follow the trail of breadcrumbs back to the US where they uncover links between several disingenuously titled rightwing organisations using Facebook and other digital resources to target/influence people who attend fundamentalist Christian churches, those with substance abuse problems, folks inclined to vote Republican, and the like. Eventually, the film-makers work their way to a conference for the big kahuna, the Council for National Policy, the little-known umbrella organisation that networks so many of the others together; the CNP is an outfit that can count Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon and many other minions of evil among their membership. Kriel manages to film them surreptitiously by wearing a crucifix with a tiny camera hidden inside, which is genius. The dot-connecting of how it all works, persuasively explicated through the use of nifty animated graphics and material gathered under the terms of fair use, is very persuasive. At the same time, the protagonists and their merry band of determined historians and hackers are a personable, relatable lot, especially when they demonstrate moments of compassion and understanding as to how seductive all this rightwing or religious rhetoric can be. Gellein Viken, for instance, is awed by an app one church has constructed that gets to parents, especially mothers, by offering a countdown of exactly how many more days they have to shape their child’s values before they come of age. Empathy like that will be needed to beat back the forces of dark money and delusion in the near future, starting with the US election."
"The “secrets” here are in fact well known, having made headline news across the world in 2019: the discovery in the Saqqara necropolis, just outside Cairo, of scores of mummified animals, including a lion cub, and an untouched tomb from the 25th century BC. But what makes this an exceptional documentary is the focus on the entirely Egyptian archaeological team, doing their bit in a quiet way to decolonise Egyptology and to demonstrate the emotional connection between the locals and the ancient civilisation they are unearthing. In truth, excavating the pharaonic monuments has always been a multinational affair, with dig teams from all over the world pitching in. But the dominant images of British chaps in pith helmets or the Indiana Jones-style maverick are hard to dispel; this film’s aim, apart from simple wonderment at what the excavators find, is to assert Egyptian ownership of the country’s heritage and history. And it does it really rather well, if you filter out the somewhat superfluous race-against-time narrative that has been added over the top. Much more effective are the meditative interviews the film-makers conduct across the whole team, from the excavation director to the anthropologist working on skeletal reassembly to the digger’s foreman. Another tiny gripe: the interviewees are introduced only by their first names, a slightly patronising move which means it takes some disentangling to find out that they are in fact world experts in their fields. The film’s richly coloured photography, precisely defined sense of topography and nicely conceived illustrations combine seamlessly to make clear what could be a confusing welter of information from two parallel digs. The finds are extraordinary, and the commentaries on them by the participants are equally wonderful. This is fascinating stuff, smoothly put together, and carrying genuine human interest."
"A sprightly and mischievous cameo from Mick Jagger is one reason to enjoy this movie. Donald Sutherland’s brief performance as a reclusive artist is another. It’s a suspense drama-thriller from Oscar-nominated screenwriter Scott Smith who has adapted the 1971 novel by crime author Charles Willeford. Claes Bang plays a somewhat raffish and disreputable Milan-based art critic, James Figueras. He is an egotistical individual with a morbid fear of flies (probably because of a sense of his own insignificance, buzzing parasitically around the greatness of artists). Figueras is having a passionate affair with a beautiful American, Berenice (Elizabeth Debicki), who dropped in to one of Figueras’s breezy, specious lectures and was amused in spite of herself. Figueras asks if she will come with him for the weekend to the home of Joseph Cassidy (Jagger), a fabulously wealthy art dealer and connoisseur who has just extended a mysterious invitation to Figueras to visit him at his gorgeous lakeside villa. Cassidy’s invitation is due to the fact that he has a secret houseguest, the legendary, reclusive painter Jerome Debney (Sutherland) who now lives in a cabin on Cassidy’s estate, working on paintings that he will show no one and Debney has a capricious interest in Figueras’s posturing columns in the press. But Cassidy himself has a terrible, Mephistophelean proposition to put to Figueras – who is in no position to refuse. It’s an entertaining and eventful melodrama with some thoughts on art that might put you in mind of Yasmina Reza’s stage-play named after the subject. And Jagger, though never quite an actor as such, puts in a very good-humoured and game performance that takes this beyond stunt casting, playing the manipulative art dealer, spring-heeled with athletic malice, grinning like a relief map of the Lake District and with a distinct whiff of sulphur about him. It would be great to have Keith Richards play the aged, cantankerous, whiskery painter Debney. But you can’t have everything."
"Pulpy, structurally a touch otiose, but eminently watchable throughout, this based-on-real-events crime drama tells two entwined stories. One is about a French-Canadian drug addict called Daniel Legér (Antoine Olivier Pilon, from Xavier Dolan’s Mommy), a stand-in for actual historical figure Alain Olivier, who becomes the entrapped fall guy for a disastrous drug sting organised by Vancouver police officers in Thailand. The other half, snipped together via tricksy editing to disguise which events are taking place before the stories converge, is about the determined if showboaty journalist Victor Malarek (a role flatteringly filled by Josh Hartnett) who delved into Legér’s case. As Legér’s appetite for heroin draws him deep into a shady conspiracy involving his shifty boss Glen (comedian Jim Gaffigan) and assorted character actors in ill-fitting plainclothes led by an undercover cop named Cooper (Stephen McHattie, a study in crag and crotchetiness), it gets harder to back out. In a way, the same goes for Malarek, who ends up losing two journalist jobs and – almost – his wife (Amanda Crew) and infant daughter when he gets too close to the truth. Using blanched lighting setups and grainy effects, the film evokes those gritty 1970s true-crime films such as Midnight Express and The French Connection, and that’s always a good thing. Props are due to the production design team who have dug up every rotary phone, cruddy early-80s computer terminal and plasticky office chair needed to populate the newsroom sets and dens of iniquity. Pilon and Hartnett make for sturdy, complementary leads, strong enough to keep you from noticing that they are only ever in two scenes together."
"Sacha Baron Cohen’s aim in releasing his Borat sequel less than a fortnight before the US presidential election is explicit: to influence its outcome by causing maximum embarrassment to the current administration and its allies. America under a second Trump term, said Baron Cohen last week, would likely “become a democracy in name only”. His film finishes by urging viewers to vote, and leaves them in little doubt for whom. Yet any film’s ability to swing such results has long been reckoned marginal, depending as it does on undecided voters also being among the converted to whom the movie is preaching. In a close race, many film-makers still calculate that’s a chance worth taking; also released on Friday was Totally Under Control, Alex Gibney’s damning exposé of the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic. Whether the timing of such films is primarily about campaigning or capitalisation, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm has fast become this autumn’s must-see movie. Media coverage of its climactic sting, in which Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani reaches into his trousers in a hotel bedroom with the actor playing Borat’s daughter, has, says Steven Gaydos, Variety’s executive vice president of content, translated into “a billion dollars’ worth of free publicity”. The producers’ outlay was already relatively low, says Gaydos, thanks to a reliance on social media marketing – and the avoidance of a theatrical release. By going straight to Amazon Prime Video, the film has forgone the chance to be seen on the big screen in exchange for saving “tens of millions of dollars”. The dividends are likely to be considerable. So much so that questions are now being asked about whether Baron Cohen, while trying to save the election, might have been able to save cinema had he embarked on a more conventional release strategy. The irony is stark: as vultures circle the multiplexes, along comes a populist movie everyone really wants to see. Could the bumbling Kazakh reporter have done for the industry what Christopher Nolan’s Tenet failed to do in August – and what James Bond didn’t have the stomach for? “I don’t think it matters what they put in cinemas in areas where moviegoers don’t feel safe in groups indoors,” says Anne Thompson, editor-at-large of IndieWire. While many cinemas across Europe and east Asia are still open, the continued closure of most screens in the US – and heightened scepticism over their safety – means salvation is simply out of reach. “Comedy films have really been in decline at the box office, even in the case of sequels,” says Delphine Lievens, senior box office analyst at Gower Street Analytics. She points to Bill and Ted Face the Music, which went straight to streaming in the US but did have a theatrical release in the UK, where it has taken £1.2m. “That’s a result that could be attributed to the pandemic but it’s almost half what the Russell Crowe thriller Unhinged has taken.” Baron Cohen’s films have opened on the big screen in the US to consistently diminishing returns. Borat made $128.5m (£98.6m) there in 2006; The Brothers Grimsby $6.9m a decade later. Meanwhile, he has had happier experiences on streaming channels, with Showtime for satire Who is America? and with Netflix for Mossad drama The Spy and Aaron Sorkin’s The Trial of the Chicago 7. “Some film-makers really miss being able to go to cinemas and hear an audience laughing at their film,” says Gaydos. “Baron Cohen isn’t likely to be one of them.” How exactly Amazon Prime scored the rights over their key rival remains unclear, but it’s clear that Borat Subsequent Moviefilm will be by far the biggest hit yet for their Original Movies division. Despite expensive acquisitions, the outfit has so far failed to make inroads with either awards bodies or mainstream audiences. Titles such as Manchester By the Sea, Honey Boy, Chi-Raq and You Were Never Really Here won kudos and the odd prize, but a real smash has eluded them (neither Amazon nor Netflix allow the audited release of viewing figures). Borat 2 will change that, while remaining consistent with a stable of titles made by highly distinctive voices, lured from the studios with the promise of full creative freedom – as well as cash. Baron Cohen will not save cinema, but in failing to do so he offers a clear indication of the sort of films that may be able to thrive in a post-multiplex world. Streaming, with a worldwide simultaneous release, is a given, as films increasingly rely on the water-cooler of social media for promotion. This element of urgency also means more movies are likely to directly engage with current affairs, or even to attempt to set the agenda. Topicality will be key, as audience tastes have altered during the rollercoaster news cycle of 2020. Speaking to the Guardian last week, the Oscar-winning director Kevin Macdonald said that he suspected what audiences wanted during the time of coronavirus – and the subsequent depression – was twofold: feelgood escapism and well-sourced reportage. “Everyone’s on edge, so something that’s entertaining is paramount,” said Macdonald. “But they also yearn to be well-informed. Documentaries may come out of all this quite well, if they can react to that appetite to understand the world and those fears about misinformation.” Borat’s artful mix of agitprop, fly-on-the-wall reportage and stunt comedy is therefore ideal. It is also viral-friendly: each sting ripe for ripping into a three-minute video that gets disseminated everywhere. That it is powered by prank interviews and hidden cameras, creative tropes felt by some to be old-fashioned, is no barrier to success, thinks Gaydos. “Yes, Candid Camera is more than 50 years old,” he says. “But if someone can figure out a fresh ‘gotcha’, there’s no rule saying it can’t work because it’s already been done. If that were the case everybody in Hollywood would pack up their tents and retire.” Plus, the stable of potential victims has never been greater. “Social media seems to have turned every demographic into potential media whores, including aged politicians who want their 15 minutes of fame extended. People are addicted to wanting their voice heard.” That may also mean Borat’s shock value is dampened. With a real world so generous with its jaw-droppers, it can be hard for art to compete. “When Borat first arrived in 2006,” says Gaydos, “you’d never seen anything like it: it was transgressive and disruptive and shocking. Today, Borat feels like just another day at the office. This moment in time is crazier than Borat. And that’s not good for Borat.”"
"This latest from François Ozon, director of such wildly diverse offerings as Sitcom, Under the Sand, 8 Women and The New Girlfriend is a bittersweet saga of love and death, a coming-of-age tale based on Aidan Chambers’s 1982 novel Dance on My Grave. Shifting the setting from Southend-on-Sea to Le Tréport in 1985, it centres on Alex (Félix Lefebvre), a death-obsessed teen in the throes of doomed first love, whose morbidly romantic story plays out with the sensual artfulness of classic Ozon, combined with the accessible vigour of an 80s American teen pic. We first meet David (Benjamin Voisin) at sea, a beautiful vision riding the waves to rescue the hapless Alex after his little boat capsizes. David takes Alex home to his widowed mum, played with nervy energy by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, who undresses and bathes the new arrival (“All David’s capsized friends go in the tub!”) and tells Alex that “my David needs a real friend”. Yet with his flick-knife comb and razor-cut smile, David is clearly much more than a friend, taking Alex’s breath away as he weaves through oncoming traffic on his motorbike, chasing an elusive moment of speeding ecstasy that is always just out of reach, like the green light in The Great Gatsby. All this thrilling young love unfolds in flashback, intercut with later scenes in which an apparently traumatised Alex faces questions about a terrible event for which he is being held accountable. Is Alex somehow responsible for the dreadful fate awaiting David? The only person able to reach Alex is Mr Lefèvre (Melvil Poupaud), the caring but slightly creepy teacher who tells him to try to write about what happened, seemingly prompting the self-questioning memoir narrative. Ozon first read Chambers’s novel as a teenager and his adaptation blends the prickly joy of that first encounter with the stylistic confidence of a film-maker revisiting an old flame. Gorgeously shot on super-16 by cinematographer Hichame Alaouie, this has the tangible texture of its retro setting, filtered through a nostalgic lens that seems to supersaturate the image, amplifying emotions. Pop music plays a key role, with the Cure’s In Between Days bookending jukebox selections that trip from the melancholia of Bananarama’s Cruel Summer to the jump-around sounds of Movie Music’s Stars De La Pub. In one key scene, recalling a memorable moment from the 1980 film La boum, Alex finds himself in a nightclub, swaying slowly to the headphone sounds of Rod Stewart’s Sailing while those around him (including David) cavort to more frenetic disco beats. But whereas in La boum, Richard Sanderson’s Reality created a momentary bubble of intimacy for Sophie Marceau and Alexandre Sterling’s characters, here Alex is alone is his reverie, highlighting not only the differing paths that he and David are on, but also the sense that this “friend of my dreams” may be just that – an invention, a projection, reminding us that we do indeed live as we dream, alone. Well-observed background details add weight to the story, from David’s Jewish heritage and suppressed bereavement about his father to the subtly sympathetic figures of Alex’s parents, who seem to understand more than he imagines. There’s also a strong thread of black comedy, not least in a cross-dressing sequence that somehow manages to intertwine agonising anguish with near-slapstick absurdity – just one example of the tonal balancing act that Ozon so deftly maintains."
"In Adrian Shergold’s uneven thriller, actor Cordelia (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) continues to suffer the aftershocks of trauma from an event that took place 12 years prior. When her twin sister (also played – though less convincingly – by Campbell-Hughes) leaves her alone in their London flat for the weekend, the fragile Cordelia begins to spiral, convinced a stranger has been rifling through her knickers. Johnny Flynn is fun to watch as sleazy upstairs neighbour and violinist Frank, and with its flocked wallpaper, claustrophobic hallways and dingy paisley curtains, the flat helps create a creepy atmosphere. Still, tension is frequently punctured by clunky dialogue. “I got mired in real life, and Rada was useless,” Cordelia says wistfully."
"The Climb begins with heavy panting; it’s pitch dark. But writer-director (and lead actor) Michael Angelo Covino is teasing us: what appears to be a sex scene cuts to a different shared experience. Best friends Mike (Covino) and Kyle (Kyle Marvin, who co-writes) are in the south of France on a stag do, struggling to breathe as they cycle up a particularly steep hill. An extended tracking shot that lasts nearly 10 minutes captures an awkward conversation, in which best man Mike confesses he has been sleeping with Kyle’s fiancee. Using Covino’s 2018 short of the same name as a starting point, this smart indie drama uses a series of vignettes to explore the ebb and flow of Mike and Kyle’s relationship. Thanksgiving, Christmas, a funeral and a ski trip all provide different vantage points from which to view their increasingly stale bond. The camera is an attentive and curious observer, Zach Kuperstein’s fluid cinematography capturing the constantly shifting power in any given room. “Are you guys playing Never Have I Ever?” asks Kyle’s girlfriend Marissa (a lively Gayle Rankin), raising an eyebrow at the drunken thirtysomethings. “Yeah, we’re catching up,” replies Kyle. The film is shrewd on male friendship, suggesting that a lot of men are vulnerable and crave intimacy, but are often too poor at communicating to truly reach for it. In cinemas from 23 October"
"I laughed hysterically during the first scene of The Climb, Michael Angelo Covino’s brilliantly original indie bromance. The setting is France, where two Americans – best friends since childhood – are on a cycling holiday. Mike (played by Covino) is head-to-toe in Lycra, obnoxiously spouting cycling terminology. His out-of-shape friend Kyle (co-writer Kyle Marvin), is trailing behind, puffing and panting. Mike waits for the start of a particularly tough climb to confess he’s been sleeping with Kyle’s fiancee. Kyle: “You’re like a real-life Judas!” Mike: “On the plus side, that makes you Jesus.” At one point, Kyle gets off his bike and carries it, running up the hill in pursuit of Mike. Tragedy and slapstick run through the film and it is very funny. The Climb charts the ups and downs of Kyle and Mike’s toxic friendship over a dozen years or so – and I can’t think of a film about male friends told with such microscopic attention to detail.  It’s structured in seven chapters. Chapter two takes place at a funeral a few years later – the first time the men have clapped eyes on each other since the bike ride. The tables have turned. Mike is going to seed, drinking too much, disappointed by life – and it becomes apparent that he is a rampant narcissist. Meanwhile, nice-guy Kyle has lost weight and achieved minor success writing advert jingles. If he feels a flush of schadenfreude at seeing how ropey Mike looks, he’s disguising it. The chapter ends with a hilarious graveside altercation involving a shovel. Co-writers Covino and Rankin are friends and observe their characters beautifully. They don’t ignore the female roles, either. Gayle Rankin is just as memorable as Kyle’s partner, Marissa – like everyone here, she feels like someone you might know. My only disappointment was that I had to watch it at home: I wanted to be in a cinema laughing at the inappropriately funny bits with other people."
"I loved Italian neorealist films as a teenager because they always featured somebody struggling to find themselves in a city. Miracle in Milan, directed by Vittorio de Sica, is a magical film about a young man who arrives lost and alienated but is gradually absorbed by an equally poor society that takes care of him. He finds amazing revelations in the simplest of things. I love the beginning, where it’s so cold, the sun comes out and all the people jump into the slightly warmer circle of heat. Then when the clouds move, they rush to follow the circle. It’s phenomenally simple, but it shows how even the poorest of people can depend on the simplest of pleasures. I loved Bicycle Thieves, also directed by De Sica, about an impoverished worker who goes everywhere on his bicycle, putting up posters, until someone steals it. As a fairly poor young man, I felt intense empathy. I also loved La Strada by Federico Fellini, which was haunting. These Italian films were full of mystery, magic and inspiration and made even the smallest elements something to relish. I hardly watched any English films: they seemed a little dull in comparison. I rarely went to the theatre as a teenager. It seemed very old and rather deadly. Maybe I was sitting too far back, but I was amazed how empty and thin it all seemed and how you had to strain to hear, compared with the movies. I began to understand theatre more after studying at drama school and learning the difficulties of movements, learning lines, communicating and gesture. But film was always my great love. I especially loved the American movies of the time, such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront, which I eventually staged myself. French cinema also appealed to me. Hiroshima Mon Amour is an astonishing movie, and I was madly in love with Le Trou by the fantastic French director Jacques Becker. That was real cinema to me. I rarely saw a British film until I was in my early 20s, when I suddenly found one I thought was amazing: Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. I have always loved jazz, because you can move and dance to it. I learned jive as a teen and I became very adept. I loved the movement and the elegance compared to rock’n’roll; it’s so ornate and clever. I’d go to dance halls where you dressed immaculately to parade your style. I was a big fan of musicians including Dave Brubeck, George Shearing, the Ink Spots and the wonderful Miles Davis and Charlie Parker. Then I started to learn to love classical music. I’d go to HMV on Oxford Street in my lunchtimes to try out records in a booth. I discovered Darius Milhaud. I loved La Création du Monde, which describes the early stirrings of plants, the growth of trees, the movement of seas and the arrivals of humans on Earth. I’d never heard anything like it. On the reverse side of Milhaud was Aaron Copland. I discovered his El Salón México and Rodeo – tremendous, physically exciting pieces full of movement, dance and activity. I was quite precocious and always exploring. I loved Stravinsky’s Petrushka and some of the other wonderful experimental composers, such as Shostakovich. I was fascinated by Les Enfants du Paradis, one of the great French films of all time. It was shot during the war and it’s about the theatre of mime. At the beginning, Jean-Louis Barrault does the most exquisite mime that I’ve ever seen, over the mistaken identity of a pickpocket. It is such an astonishing piece of silent cinema; it made me fall in love with mime and want to study it. A woman called Claude Chagrin had moved to London. She was a student of Jacques Lecoq, one of the foremost mime teachers in the world. She held classes in London and I went every week for a year. Then I went for a summer course in Paris with the master himself. It helped me to understand more the mechanics of the theatre through movement and how so much can be expressed through an understanding of the symbols of movement. That was one of the great learning experiences of my life. I’ve loved mime ever since and it’s always been the backbone of my performances. I loved the impressionists as a teenager. The sweetness of Renoir always moved me. I also loved Van Gogh and Chagall, and Dalí was a great favourite; I always found him totally fascinating. But I also opted for the more radical and fell in love with Hieronymus Bosch and Bruegel. I find their paintings so incredibly detailed, with such phenomenal brilliance in their technique. I love Gustave Doré. His scenes of the slums of 19th-century London are astonishing. I started writing poetry as a teenager and have recently gone back to it – I’m having a book published called Poems for the Working Class. It’s all about the terrible, funny, sarcastic and sardonic events of our modern age. Goethe’s Faust fascinated me as a teenager. It’s an amazing play, but it’s very complicated, so it takes concentration. I was delighted to appear in Philipp Humm’s contemporary adaptation last year, The Last Faust. It’s about the temptation of someone who has surrendered all moral integrity to achieve power and success. Trump is a perfect example of Faust. He’ll do anything to signal his decrepitude to the public. Like Faust, those who crave power, experience and sex sacrifice their souls. We see a lot of this today when people will do anything to achieve a limited thrill. This horrible Covid is the result of this Faustian pact to kill and taste anything to achieve some kind of enlightenment and relief. To me, the hunters who go to Africa and kill just for the thrill are the sickest people on Earth. The wet markets in China and Thailand are full of the horror of slaughtering animals, and now we’re paying for it. The Last Faust is on Amazon Prime"
"Here is an extraordinary, transfiguring leap from stage to screen. Ian Rickson’s production of Uncle Vanya was cut short by lockdown in the final weeks of its run. Now, in collaboration with director Ross MacGibbon, he has not merely captured his original staging but dazzlingly reinterpreted it. This is not, like the NTLive broadcasts, an attempt to transmit a theatrical event. It is a new thing. The film crackles with fresh intensity – and gains new shadows from the timing of its release. Chekhov’s 1899 play is prefaced by shots of the cast arriving – dungarees and masks – at the Harold Pinter theatre for the first time since March: shaking out umbrellas, walking into an empty auditorium. As the action begins, something extraordinary happens. We are transplanted in time and place – there is nothing 21st-century British about Rae Smith’s lofty, crumbling design, the sodden glimmer of Bruno Poet’s lighting or old Nana with her long dark dress and bun, patiently waiting on everyone. Yet the stage is charged with the climate of Covid-19. That combination of sluggishness and highly tuned irritability, the feeling of time mysteriously slipping by, maliciously cheating people of their lives, is everywhere: in Toby Jones’s crosspatch, crumpled Vanya and Rosalind Eleazar’s Yelena, so heavy with disappointment she is scarcely able to move. The lassitude of Chekhov’s characters is sometimes spoken of as if it were a mental elegance: here, it is plainly toxic; everyone might be hung over after a too-long afternoon nap. When I saw this on stage in February the use of direct address to the audience struck me as too blunt. Filmed close-ups banish this difficulty - it is as if we have a direct wire into the speakers’ brains. The strong original cast is enhanced by the addition of Roger Allam, effortlessly condescending as the pampered professor. In this sharp modern version by Conor McPherson, the environmental alarm of the play is more startling than ever. It is often said that an elderly play is nevertheless a play for today. This one truly is. Susannah Clapp is the Observer’s theatre critic. Visit unclevanyaplay.com for cinema screenings"
"Out in time for Halloween, writer-director Neil Marshall’s tidily assembled, witty and cheerfully gory horror flick from 2002 gets a rerelease. And how nice it is to reacquaint ourselves not just with this low-budget/high-concept thriller, but with a simpler, gentler time when the only things we needed to be afraid of were jump scares, werewolves and the dark. A cast comprised mostly of game but limited performers and a few familiar, considerably more competent, character actors who went on to have reasonable careers (such as leads Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd and de facto human villain Liam Cunningham) are compelled to scream, run and get covered in fake blood as they play British soldiers on manoeuvres in the Scottish Highlands. You can tell that McKidd’s Cooper is meant to be the film’s closest thing to a good guy because in the prologue he refuses to shoot a dog simply to prove that he will obey orders from Capt Ryan (Cunningham), during a tryout to join special forces. Later, Cooper must help save Ryan when they find him wounded, the only survivor of an attack from lowlit monsters, werewolves who only in brief flashes look like background artists in furry suits. Poor Pertwee, meanwhile, as the representative of good military leadership, has to spend a lot of time with fake intestines flopping around his midriff. But it all comes together satisfyingly in the end,. This was Marshall’s debut feature, and he shows off an innate knack for blending genre elements, especially horror tropes, with other stock features. You can easily draw a clear line through this to his later work, including the excellent all-female-cast horror-thriller The Descent, Roman-era war film Centurion, and assorted episodes of upmarket TV he later worked on, including a couple of crucial, action-intensive Game of Thrones episodes. Especially given how quickly effects look dated over time, Dog Soldiers has aged pretty well."
"Here is Pixar’s charming, bewildering and beautiful new animation about life after death and life before death – and that title incidentally reminds you how we got the word “animation”. It’s a free-jazz fantasia about a sad and lonely musician, with globules of Frank Capra, 60s psychedelia, 80s body-swap and an old-fashioned stairway to heaven that put me in mind of Pressburger and Powell. But the keynote is pure Pixar: that intense, childlike, ever-renewing rapture that inside all of us, there is this secret existence and identity that the outside world knows nothing about. The story is a deeply strange and complicated one: a where-are-we-going-with-this journey that occasionally messes with the rules of narrative and character consistency. But it makes its own kind of sense when the film arrives at a mysteriously moving epiphany: a montage of moments and glimpses that hint at an existence higher than the one in which we are following our all-important showbiz dream. Soul initially seems to indicate that the choice is between the glories of being a famous jazz musician and the selfless heroism of being a great teacher. But the story ultimately (and enigmatically) gestures at the idea that this is a false choice, or no choice at all, and that we are looking in the wrong direction. And it’s all in that swirling constellation of images. I didn’t think it was possible to be moved – really moved – by the simple image of night-time New York with its lights bordering Central Park’s vast rectangle of darkness. But that’s what happens in this weird, lovable story, directed by Pixar’s Pete Docter and written by Docter, Mike Jones and Kemp Powers. (Powers is also credited as co-director.) Our hero is Joe (voiced by Jamie Foxx), a tired, middle-aged, African-American guy in New York whose passion is jazz, a calling to which he has evidently sacrificed his personal life: he is now single and still taking his laundry to his elderly mother who runs a tailoring and alteration business. Nowadays, poor Joe earns a few bucks with a part-time job teaching band at a high school, but still yearns to play jazz piano in front of an adoring, connoisseur crowd. But just when he is faced with finally abandoning his jazz dream in favour of a bittersweet Mr Chips destiny of inspiring young people, a former student of Joe’s gets him the chance to play with one of the most famous jazz musicians in the world. And just when Joe’s life could hardly get more dramatic, he falls down a manhole, loses consciousness and enters a strange otherworld domain, a quasi-heaven existing both before and after and during death, in which this spectral “Joe” is expected to mentor an errant, brattish, not-yet-born soul called simply 22 (voiced by Tina Fey). So what can soul-Joe and 22 do but go back to Earth, alighting in comatose body-Joe’s hospital bed; 22 accidentally invades Joe’s body and soul-Joe invades the “therapy cat” which the hospital authorities have placed on his bed, in the hope that its furry ministrations would awaken him. So Joe and 22 take off across New York in the wrong bodies, on a mission to get Joe that jazz gig. And their adventures can sometimes get even more confusing. When 22 speaks to Joe’s buddies through Joe’s mouth but with her own voice nobody seems to notice. Perhaps the convention is that they hear Joe’s voice – but we, the audience, hear 22’s to remind us what’s going on. But later when they confront Joe’s stern mother, 22 speaks with Joe’s voice at last and appears to intuit what he would say. It’s all very headspinning, and there is real Yellow Submarine quality to the film’s innocent urgency and idealism which take it to the very brink of incoherence. That can sometimes be exasperating but also really captivating, especially in that final visual cadenza in which Docter and Powers are really are going above and beyond the traditional Hollywood ending. It’s a deeply sweet, happy, gentle film. Soul screened at the London film festival, and will be available on 25 December on Disney+. "
"Don Hertzfeldt is surprised to hear that viewers have been watching his last few short films – the three episodes of his miniature sci-fi epic World of Tomorrow – in one sitting. “Isn’t that just exhausting?” he laughs, speaking over the phone from his home in Austin, Texas. “Mentally and emotionally?” He’s not wrong. But it is the kind of draining experience that leaves the audience restored; a gauntlet gone through for the promise of life-affirming enlightenment at the end. In the 44-year-old animator’s body of work, little stick figures enact meditations of crushing, cosmic profundity on time, memory, technology and love. Hertzfeldt earned his initial wave of fans in 2000, when his surreal short Rejected landed an Academy Award nomination for its absurdist gags about bleeding anuses and oversized spoons. (He likes to call himself an Oscar-losing film-maker, a tidy encapsulation of his sense of humour.) That levity cosied up with a bruising sadness in the batch of early shorts that followed through the 00s, in which the melancholy doodle Bill contended with the deterioration of his brain and, with it, his relationships and grip on the true nature of existence. When joined as a 62-minute feature under the title It’s Such a Beautiful Day in 2012, “mentally and emotionally exhausting” most assuredly applied. With the next major phase of his career, the ongoing World of Tomorrow era – launched in 2015 and most recently updated this month – Hertzfeldt has upped the ante in terms of both complexity and the devastating poignancy he has made his trademark. Its three instalments condense a dizzying volume of concepts and information into the length of a sitcom. Any attempt at synopsis makes the summariser sound like a mad scientist, but let’s try nevertheless. In the first, the playful tot Emily Prime is visited by her adult clone from the future for a brief history of how the world will end; in the second, a handful of Emily’s doubles go on a sightseeing tour through such fantastical abstract locales as Triangle Land and the Bog of Reality; in the third, a tertiary character from episode one reappears to prevent his own assassination. For that latest Möbius-twisted pretzel of a story, he has done us the service of including diagrams and graphs to explain the timeline. “Part of the fun is how confusing it is!” he says. “The flowcharts help.” Through time travel, holographic projection and flashbacks, Hertzfeldt shows his creations how everything they have ever loved will eventually be obliterated. While his works operate at a heart-mangling intensity, he is the easygoing kind of guy found in college towns such as Austin. He will not get hung up on questions of death or eternity. “People watch these more than I do. They’ve got their own interpretations. But as the person who packs the movie, I try not to unpack it too much.” He would rather talk process. With World of Tomorrow, “I wanted to break some old habits,” he says. After spending the first 15 years of his career working with 35mm film and old-school multiplane cameras – “The same kind they used to use at Disney!” he excitedly crows – Hertzfeldt has gone digital. After work on the first World of Tomorrow kept crashing his hard drive, he upgraded his system and made plans for a project with a team of animators and heavy-duty industry resources. That feature, given the working title Antarctica, never got off the ground, with budgets an issue. Things are looking brighter on that front these days: he has met with investors to explore a streaming home where he can continue the World of Tomorrow series at a more prolific rate.  “I’m not getting any younger,” he says. “You just want to work faster. I’m jealous of actors, of musicians, of people able to put out multiple things in one year. To take two years to make a short film is just absurd. I don’t want to use a Marvel term, but we’re expanding the universe.”  For Hertzfeldt, that means sharing this solitary process with others. Steeped as his work may be in isolation, he is ready to welcome them in to the bizarre dimension he’s built. “I don’t relish doing this alone!” he says. “I can’t be drawing little round heads by myself for the rest of my life.” World of Tomorrow ep three is available on Vimeo"
"Sentimentalising, patronising and generally disrespecting our elders is by now enough of a movie trope that any title including the words “grandma” or “grandpa” causes an involuntary shudder. That Lucky Grandma isn’t one of those films is mostly down to its star, Tsai Chin, whose many attributes include the ability to conduct full conversations with a lit cigarette suspended from her bottom lip. One look at Grandma’s stern face tells us she did not come to play. Unless the game is blackjack, that is. Grandma is almost as fond of gambling as she is of smoking; so, after a fortuneteller advises that her luck will turn on 28 October, she joins a pensioners’ coach trip to Atlantic City. It will be a distraction from mourning her late husband and resisting the nagging interference of her son (Eddie Yu) and his family. Grandma makes for a very different type of casino patron than the one Chin cameoed as in 2006’s Casino Royale (itself a nod to her 1967 Bond girl turn in You Only Live Twice). When fate eventually leads Grandma to the promised riches, it’s via a circuitous route that draws attention from the local Chinese mafia. Ever the bargain hunter, she hires a “discount bodyguard” from a rival gang (Taiwanese basketball pro Hsiao-Yuan Ha) and there ensues a knockabout crime caper, in which an elderly woman is the protagonist, and not the punchline – for a change. The simple originality of this setup, which takes place in a Chinese language-speaking corner of New York City, is delight enough, but Lucky Grandma is also full of unexpected comic touches, such as the grandson’s YouTube dance routines. The result is a film that’s people-pleasing in inverse proportion to its grouchy heroine."
"Whatever the outcome of Monday’s verdict in his blockbuster libel case, the world has not heard the last of Johnny Depp’s tempestuous relationship with Amber Heard. Indeed, its consequences will linger long after the gossip columns have moved on, legal experts believe. The Pirates of the Caribbean star’s claim against the Sun newspaper over an article labelling him a “wife beater” is merely a prelude to a far more substantial claim that Depp is bringing in the US where he is suing Heard for $50m over a column she wrote. “This is only round one,” said Mark Stephens, an expert in media law at the law firm Howard Kennedy. “Whoever loses is going to appeal. There’s too much in this for them not to, but do I think the appeal will be successful? No. That will be round two. Then there’s the [Depp] case against the Washington Post and Amber Heard, and she has counter-sued both Johnny Depp and his lawyer for accusing her of lying over the spousal abuse.” “Win or lose, tomorrow’s judgment will be hugely significant,” said Emily Cox, a partner and media expert at Stewarts law firm. “If Johnny Depp wins, he will be vindicated and the more sordid aspects of the evidence at trial will likely be forgotten. If he loses, he is unlikely ever to be able to shake off the ‘wife beater’ label.” “I think it’s fairy uncontroversial to say that this was an ill-advised case,” Stephens says. “The only winners here are the lawyers who are going to be building extensions to their homes and putting their children through private education on the back of Johnny Depp.” Stephens believes that ‘the traditional orthodoxy’ is that Depp, 57, will win. But much will hinge on whether the judge, Mr Justice Nicol, finds the star a credible witness. “I wonder whether the judge is going to say ‘I think both parties tried to do the best they could but I could not rely on Mr Depp’s recollection because he was obviously taking drugs and alcohol in industrial quantities and his recollection, however honest, was in my judgement mistaken and as a consequence of that I find for her’,” Stephens said. The US case is not scheduled to be heard until May when Depp and Heard, 34, are both due to be filming new projects. Depp will star in the next instalment of the JK Rowling franchise Fantastic Beasts while Heard is appearing in Justice League. So whatever the verdict, the spectre of another exhausting and potentially damaging lawsuit will be hanging over both parties for months to come. Cox said that Depp’s claim in the US is riskier and higher stakes. “While an English judgment in favour of Depp would be good evidence for the court in Virginia, personal lives and reputations will be unpicked afresh, as London is perceived as notoriously claimant-friendly. Defamation laws in the US favour First Amendment free speech, with the burden of proof on Depp this time around. Throw into the mix a jury trial in the US, and it all becomes more of a game of Russian roulette.” For the UK trial, Depp spent around 20 hours in the witness box over five days, facing questioning about his Hollywood lifestyle, his use of drink and drugs, allegations of violence, and his friendships with famous faces including Keith Richards and Sir Elton John. One of Depp’s friends, Helena Bonham Carter, who has worked with him on several films, spoke out in his defence. “There’s something quite old-fashioned about Johnny, with these manners – none of it makes sense,” the actor told the Guardian. “The man’s not stupid. He wouldn’t have gone to this length if he thought he was in the wrong.” Indeed, in his closing arguments, the actor’s barrister, David Sherborne, said Depp’s case was about vindication. “What is important to Mr Depp is clearing his name of these appalling allegations, expanded on as it has been over the last four years, as a result of which he has lost nothing less than everything, he would say.” Sasha Wass QC, for News Group Newspapers, argued that there was “no doubt that Mr Depp regularly and systematically abused his wife. The characterisation that he is a wife-beater is entirely truthful.” “Win or lose, this case is going to have a serious and chilling effect on the reporting of allegations of abuse,” Stephens said. “But this is particularly true if Depp wins. Perhaps women will be more wary about coming forward and making these sort of allegations.” Depp can expect to receive between £180,000 to £200,000 in damages if he wins, a fraction of the estimated £5m he has racked up in legal costs."
"In 1960, as part of the Soviet space programme, a pair of dogs named Belka and Strelka became the first Earth-born creatures to go into orbit and return alive. This, clearly, was a story destined to be retold as a cute kids’ animation; especially if you leave out all the distressing animal abuse detailed in a documentary, also called Space Dogs, released earlier this year. So it’s no surprise that Russian animation studio Kinoatis made Space Dogs back in 2010, nor that they’re continuing the series with this, a third instalment. Now, after a successful mission to Saturn, the canine cosmonauts are homeward bound when they stumble on an alien spacecraft hovering above the Atlantic Ocean and apparently stealing all the Earth’s water. It’s up to Belka and newly promoted Captain Strelka to come to the planet’s rescue, with the help of their inventive rat pal Lenny. The English-language dubbing, combined with a script that’s been carelessly translated from the original Russian, means much of the humour necessary to hook in a parent audience doesn’t land. The generally characterless computer animation does feature some highlights – such as a band of singing pirate jellyfish, a psychedelic space garden tended by an elephant-hedgehog hybrid, and a large-bottomed rodent love interest for Lenny. In the main, though, Space Dogs’ weirdness is of the confusing, not amusing, variety. Given that there’s such a choice of quality, thoughtful and fantastical children’s cinema available, even an extended period of lockdown seems unlikely to throw up the right circumstance for this one. Maybe your kids will get around to it after they’ve worked their way through every Studio Ghibli twice, plus an extended director’s cut of Paw Patrol: The Movie?"
"The judge in the Johnny Depp libel action concluded that “the great majority of alleged assaults” on Amber Heard by the Pirates of the Caribbean star had been “proved to the civil standard”. Of the 14 alleged assaults heard in open court – all of which have been denied by Depp – he found that 12 of them were proved on the balance of probability. The first assault allegedly took place after Heard joked about a tattoo Depp had during his relationship with the actor Winona Ryder, which originally read “Winona Forever”, but was altered to “Wino Forever” after they split. Heard claimed Depp had got angry, knocked her to the floor, then cried and apologised, saying he sometimes turned into “the monster”. The judge accepted Depp used the term to “refer to that part of his personality when, affected by drink and/or drugs he would do things which he would not otherwise do.” Heard alleged Depp was enraged that she had hung a painting by her ex-partner Tasya van Ree near her bed, and tried to set fire to it and hit her “so hard that blood from her lip ended up on the wall.” . Heard described Depp as “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde – on a binge”. The judge concluded Depp had drunk whisky and taken cocaine before the assault. Depp had taken alcohol and magic mushrooms, and was said have become angry when one of Heard’s female friends hugged and touched her. He allegedly grabbed the woman’s wrists and threatened to hurt her. He is said to have then thrown glasses at Heard, ripped her dress and damaged the cabin they were staying in. The judge found Depp had been angry when the assault occurred.  Heard said Depp, after drinking heavily, had thrown objects at her, slapped her in the face and then kicked her in the back, causing her to fall over. He threw his boot at her on the floor, and passed out in the toilet. Denying the account, Depp said he had given her a “playful tap on the bottom with his foot”, and when she reacted badly, he took a pillow to the toilet and slept there. The judge said “this was more than a playful tap”.  While detoxing from painkiller dependency on his private island, Depp was said to have pushed Heard to the ground, slapped her, grabbed her by the hair and kicked a door so hard it splintered. The judge concluded it was “more likely than not he pushed Heard on at least one occasion”. Heard alleged Depp, after being violent towards her, had sent text messages calling himself a “fucking savage” and a lunatic”. The judge concluded he was not persuaded that this alleged incident “constituted a physical assault”. In a Tokyo hotel room, while attending a premiere, Depp allegedly shoved, slapped and grabbed Heard by the hair. Depp said his children had been with him, and he would not have acted this way. The judge said the children had been in another room, and he did not accept their presence would have “inhibited” Depp. Over three days in Australia filming Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp was said to have put Heard “in fear of her life”. Heard claimed he had assaulted her multiple times. He severed his fingertip and scrawled graffiti in his blood on the walls. The judge did not accept Heard had been responsible for the severed fingertip through throwing a vodka bottle at Depp. He accepted Heard had been the victim of “sustained and multiple assaults”. Heard said Depp had hit her “hard and repeatedly” before trying to push her sister down the stairs. The judge accepted Depp had assaulted Heard. Heard admitted hitting Depp, but the judge accepted it had been in defence of her sister. The judge accepted Heard’s account that while on the Eastern and Oriental train, Depp had hit her, pushed her against a wall and grasped her by the throat. Her diary said they had fallen asleep “smashed together in desperate child like anger, fear and love finally succumbing to exhaustion and ultimately unavoidable futility”. An allegation Depp had thrown Heard “around the room” and thrown a wine glass and decanter at her was found not proved as it had not been put to Depp in cross-examination. Heard claimed Depp had thrown a decanter at her in their penthouse, headbutted her and pulled “large chunks of hair” from her scalp the day before Heard’s appearance on James Corden’s Late Late Show. The judge ruled the argument was “not just verbal, it became physical”, concluding Depp had assaulted Heard. Heard claimed Depp had arrived late for her 30th birthday meal, drunk and on drugs. After her friends left, he threw a magnum champagne bottle at her, which missed, smashed glasses and grabbed her hair. The next day faeces was found on the couple’s bed. The judge concluded Depp had “assaulted Ms Heard as he had done on previous occasions when he was stressed”. Of Depp’s claim that Heard, or one of her friends, had deliberately defecated on the bed, the judge said it was “highly unlikely”.  Depp threw a phone at Heard, allegedly smashed items, and kicked a hole in a door at their apartment. After this, Heard filed a petition for the dissolution of her marriage and applied for a domestic restraining order against him. The judge said: “There is evidence which I find compelling of witnesses who saw Ms Heard with injuries to her face and who took photographs of these.”"
"Amber Heard’s stand against Johnny Depp’s assaults should not have deprived her of public sympathy for suffering the ordeal of domestic violence, a leading human rights lawyer has said. Heard was subjected to death threats and misogynistic attacks on social media during the libel trial that left her feeling “down and beleaguered”, according to Helena Kennedy QC, who met Heard while the case was before the high court. “There are still these pervasive myths about the kind of woman who deserves the protection of the law,” Lady Kennedy told the Guardian. “Battered women have to [seem] meek and subservient to have our sympathy. “I have represented women who have put up with this but when they do resist they somehow [are deemed to] lose their right to [compassion]. There’s no doubt that Amber Heard did … resist but that does not make her certifiable.” On Monday, the high court found the Sun newspaper was justified in describing Depp as a “wife beater” after the judge said 12 of 14 allegations she made of being attacked were proved on the balance of probabilities. Kennedy met Heard at a dinner party in the north London home of the novelist Kathy Lette during the trial. Others present were the TV presenter Sandi Toksvig and Heard’s lawyer, Jennifer Robinson. “[Heard] was brought by Jen in the middle of the trial when there was a small dinner taking place. Jen asked if she could bring Amber Heard along because she was feeling pretty down and beleaguered. “She had been receiving threats all the way through the hearing and that was one of the reasons she was feeling low … This is the other thing that women have to contend with, the misogyny of online attacks.” Kennedy said it would be very difficult to appeal against the judgment. Any decision to do so, she suggested, might at least mean that when Depp’s separate defamation case in Virginia starts next spring it could be said that the high court judgment was under appeal. The London ruling “won’t provide a precedent”, Kennedy added, “but you can be sure that the judge knows that this decision was made.” The Labour MP Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence, also complained at the time about the “character assassination” that Heard suffered in the media. “Abused women,” Phillips observed, “are not all one type of perfect picture of victimhood who would incite sympathy from everyone they met.” While Heard endured anonymous death threats on social media and sometimes had a police escort, Depp enjoyed the adulation of fans who gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice at the end of each day during the trial. Depp also received more high-profile support than Heard from fellow actors and celebrities. Last weekend Helena Bonham Carter said: “There’s something quite old-fashioned about Johnny, with these manners – none of it makes sense. But the man’s not stupid. He wouldn’t have gone to this length if he thought he was in the wrong.” Depp is godfather to her two children with ex-husband, the film director Tim Burton. In 2017, when allegations of abuse surfaced, the author JK Rowling issued a statement defending the casting of Johnny Depp in her film series Fantastic Beasts. Her agent, Neil Blair, was reported to have attended some of the high court case. Depp is due to reprise his role as Gellert Grindelwald in the third Fantastic Beasts film, which co-stars Eddie Redmayne. Depp has not yet filmed his scenes for the high profile fantasy adventure, which is due to be released in November 2021.  The two previous Fantastic Beasts films together grossed more than $1.4bn at the worldwide box office, making Depp’s removal from the current production a substantial commercial risk."
"Conrad Khan was filming in a fried chicken shop not far from where he actually lives. In the scene, his character’s bullying schoolmates come in and demand he hand over his chips. Then, as shooting began, Khan’s real-life schoolmates turned up, curious about a film crew in their local hangout. “They looked in,” laughs Khan, “and did a double take. They were so confused. They didn’t know I’m an actor. So I was quite proud. Yeah, quite cool.” County Lines, the film Khan stars in, portrays another kind of double life. Khan plays Tyler, a quiet, troubled 14-year-old with an absent father, a hard-up mother, and little to look forward to. He is rescued from the chicken-shop bullies by local hood Simon, played by Harris Dickinson, who has a flash car. Simon buys Tyler trainers and offers him the chance to earn some money. As the title suggests, he is soon skipping school and hopping on trains out of London, ferrying drugs to regional dealers. Before it was overshadowed by Covid, county lines was an urgent national issue, widely discussed in the news, chronicled in documentaries, but also semi-glamorised by such drill rappers as Frosty, aka Theo Beckford, whose 2019 tracks County Lines 1 & 2 proved to be borne of experience. Frosty was imprisoned for drugs offences. Nobody could accuse the movie of glamorising its subject. County Lines is visually lyrical but unflinching and often brutal, in the social-realist tradition of Ken Loach and Alan Clarke. And Khan puts in a head-turning performance: a study of boyish vulnerability, loneliness and frustration. “That’s what these drug dealers look for,” he says. “Kids with no emotional support. Kids who don’t really have anyone to talk to, who almost feel like they have something to prove and they haven’t been able to. That’s who are easiest to prey upon.” County Lines is also born of experience. Not Khan’s but that of writer-director Henry Blake, who worked in a pupil referral unit for a decade. In the past five years, Blake has seen the human toll of county lines first-hand: the deprivation, the exploitation, the violence, the missed opportunities. As such, he had some grim stories to prepare Khan for the role. “Socially I can’t say there are any parallels between Tyler and myself,” says Khan, who was actually 18 when he made the film. “But emotionally, yes. That desire to feel accomplishment, to provide for the family – that’s stuff that any teenage boy has felt. I think that’s what makes the film so relatable.” At 14 he was climbing trees, he says, and getting his first taste of serious acting. He had a small role in the 2016 fantasy epic The Huntsman: Winter’s War, as the young Chris Hemsworth. “That’s what made me fall in love with the industry.” He does not have a showbiz background. His father works in health, his mother is a lecturer in fashion. His grandfather is from Pakistan, hence the surname. It was a chance suggestion from a barber in Muswell Hill, who’d cut hair for film actors, that turned him towards the profession. He got the lead in his school play, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, spent a few years with the Arcola Youth Theatre, and won parts in commercials, short films and TV, including an episode of Black Mirror. All the while, Khan led his double life. “I used to tell my agents to get me auditions any time after 3pm so I could finish school first.” He made County Lines while in his final year of A-levels. The month-long shoot was especially tough. “It was four days on, one day off. Then the day off I was in school.” Added to which, filming often involved grim situations. Lying in a cold Essex marsh in the middle of winter, for example. “I was head to toe drenched in mud and it was seeping inside my clothes and it was freezing cold. It was December, at night, lying there, doing the scene over and over. So, a little bit method.” He’d gladly do it again, though. “The reason I love it is to explore my emotional capacity, to find roles that push me as far as I can go. I think that’s what this film did. To my absolute limits. And I loved it.” The career/education balance is still an issue, with Covid an extra complication. County Lines was scheduled for release this April. Khan then had acting jobs lined up for the rest of his gap year before starting university. “The timing worked perfectly,” he says. “Then, like everything else in the world, it all just came tumbling down.” The acting has at least restarted, albeit temporarily. He’s been shooting BBC’s Baptiste for the past two weeks. “It’s very strange being on set in Covid times,” he says. “I still don’t know what anyone I’m working with looks like. And there’s an entire new profession which didn’t exist six months ago, called Covid coordinator. Their job it is to tell everyone to keep away from each other and stop kissing and holding hands and taking masks off.” Khan also started university a few weeks ago, albeit remotely. He’s doing film studies. “It’s all online, which kind of suits me ’cos I’m still working, so it allows me to do both at the same time. I’ve had to pause a lecture on François Truffaut to talk to you.” Sooner or later, it seems likely Khan will be presented with a dilemma. Supposing a great role came up halfway through his studies? “This is what me and my agent and my parents have been talking about non-stop. So yeah, I’m glad you brought it up. I don’t know what I would do. I’m taking a risk going to uni, but I just feel like I want to be in an academic environment and around like-minded, similar-aged people again, because I do miss that.” He pauses, then adds: “But I’d probably take the role.”"
"Johnny Depp is “a wife-beater”. This is the verdict of the UK courts. Just writing that sentence feels genuinely shocking, and yet, by now perhaps, it should not. For a start, the allegation that he was physically abusive to his ex-wife Amber Heard emerged more than four years ago, after she applied for a temporary restraining order against him following their divorce, citing domestic abuse. It should also not be a shock, given how many other hugely famous men have been accused of abusing women. Sean Connery was alleged to have beaten his first wife and frequently defended hitting women. His death this weekend sparked online arguments about how much the coverage should focus on the professional achievements of a man who repeatedly insisted it was fine to hit women, “if the woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually”, as he said in 1965. But Depp is a very different figure from Connery. The latter represented alpha masculinity and aggressive sexuality. No one ever said it explicitly, but Connery’s defences for beating women fit in, on some level, with his image, and so that side of him was never going to be a problem with his audience. Depp, however, represented something else. He sued the Sun for defamation when it described him as “a wife-beater”, something Connery would never have done, and it’s why for a certain kind of fan (me), this feels like the death of yet another childhood hero. And yet, unlike the ends of Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix, perhaps you couldn’t describe this one as a shock. After the judge gave his verdict on Monday morning, Depp’s notoriously virulent online followers (a different kind of fan) made sure they got the predictable hashtags trending, all proclaiming Depp’s innocence. I often wonder about these online Depp fans, given that they are most likely in their 30s and 40s. Such online stanning from the middle-aged is unusual, and yet that it is Depp who inspires it says a lot about him: both what he represented to my generation, and how far he has fallen. Depp may appeal. “The judgment is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr Depp not to appeal this decision, ” said a solicitor at the London law firm of Schillings, which represented Depp. But by now, most of the world has seen the photos of Heard’s bruised face, and the court case presented a relationship that had become gruesomely toxic. The court heard recordings of Heard verbally abusing Depp and admitting to “clocking” him and throwing pots and pans at him. But none of that could change the fact that the judge, Mr Justice Nicol, found the majority of Heard’s allegations that Depp abused her proved to the civil standard, and that, therefore, the Sun was entitled to describe him as a “wife-beater”. It was always risky for Depp to pursue this case. Next year in the US he has a $50m (£38m) defamation case against Heard regarding an opinion piece she wrote about being the victim of domestic abuse; the verdict of this case will surely have some impact on the next one.  But it’s not just the judge’s verdict that has decimated Depp’s reputation. For a while, his life has been absurdly over the top: when he was asked in 2018 if it was true, as his managers alleged, that he spent $30,000 a month on wine, he replied that this was “insulting … because it was far more”. So testimonies about private jets, cocaine for breakfast and arguments over – in perhaps the most memorable part of the trial – whether Heard or her yorkshire terrier had defecated in Depp’s bed were titillating, but little more. More destructive to Depp’s career, and more dismaying to those who have followed him from the early days, was seeing how low he had fallen: throwing phones at his wife’s head; zonked out and covered in ice-cream; so riddled with jealousy of Heard’s male co-stars he referred to Leonardo DiCaprio as “pumpkin head” and Channing Tatum as “potato head”; sending vicious emails and texts to friends about Heard in which he referred to her as a “flappy fish market”. Aside from everything else, Depp had always been unusually eloquent for an A-lister, with a courtly, old-fashioned conversational style. That was part of his appeal; now he was lobbing insults like a six-year-old. Somewhere, amid all the drugs and the drink, Depp seemed to lose his mind. As I looked at the photos of him, turning up to court looking like a self-parody in his perma-present piratical scarf and blue-tinted sunglasses, to argue over whether it was human or terrier excrement in his bed, I felt horrified, of course, but I also felt sad. This was not how it was supposed to go. To those watching, the verdict felt inevitable, Depp’s trajectory less so. For those who came of age in the 90s, Depp represented a different way of being famous. He complicated the narrative. Along with Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, he was part of a holy trinity of grunge heart-throbs. They were the opposite of the Beverly Hills 90210 boys, or Brad Pitt and DiCaprio, because they seemed embarrassed by their looks, even resentful of them. (Depp reportedly turned down Pitt’s cheesecake role in Thelma & Louise.) This uninterest in their own prettiness made them seem edgy, even while their prettiness softened that edge. They signified not just a different kind of celebrity, but a different kind of masculinity: desirable but gentle, manly but girlish. Depp in particular was the cool pinup it was safe to like, and the safe pinup it was cool to like. We fans understood that there was more to Depp, Phoenix and Reeves than handsomeness. They were artistic – they had bands! – and they thought really big thoughts, which they would ramble on about confusingly in interviews. If we dated them, we understood that our role would be to understand their souls. He would never put it like this, but Depp cultivated this image. He decided almost from the start that he didn’t want to be just a celebrity but a cultural figure. In 1987, he was cast in Fox’s teen cops show 21 Jump Street, and at first he gave enthusiastic interviews about how much he enjoyed his “clean” and “slick” character, Tom Hanson. But he soon appeared to realise he wanted more and regularly derided the show as “borderline fascist”, mentioning his own youthful drug experiences and how he lost his virginity at 13. Nevertheless, 21 Jump Street was a huge hit, largely thanks to Depp. Sunday evenings for me, growing up in the US, quickly became about watching Depp bust some drug-dealing adolescents. But there were reports from the set that he would refuse to do scenes, leading to him getting a reputation as difficult, but to us fans this just proved that he had an artistic soul and was better than the TV show (although we also loved the TV show). They paid him $45,000 an episode to make him stay – a dream for a poor boy from Kentucky, the youngest child of a waitress, who had lived in more than 20 different places before he was seven and whose parents divorced when he was a teenager. But to Depp it was hell. “Lost, shoved down the gullets of America as a young Republican TV boy, heart-throb, teen idol, teen hunk. Plastered, postered, postured, patented, painted, plastic!! Novelty boy, franchise boy. Fucked and plucked with no escape from this nightmare,” he wrote about the show. Depp was supposed to be a teen idol, but he complicated the narrative by choosing John Waters’ Cry-Baby for his big movie lead debut, kitschily satirising his image as a heart-throb, and spiking any producers’ attempts to pigeonhole him as just another pinup. In his next role, as Edward Scissorhands, he went further, entirely obscuring his good looks – not even James Dean did that – and relying instead on subtlety and acting skills, neither of which had been in much evidence on 21 Jump Street. But he was good, or certainly good enough, and in the 90s Depp carved out one of the more interesting careers a teen pinup has ever managed. He worked with Lasse Hallström in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?, Jim Jarmusch in Dead Man, Roman Polanski in Ninth Gate and Mike Newell on Donnie Brasco (in which he probably gave his best performance). And he took his audience with him; a whole generation discovered indie films and auteurs through Depp. He was that rarest of things: a celebrity who was, genuinely, cool. He was also known as a romantic. He was married briefly at 20, then developed a proposal habit, getting engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey and Winona Ryder, whose name he had tattooed on his arm: “Winona Forever” (changed to “Wino Forever”, when the booze lasted longer than the relationship. Similarly, he had “Slim” tattooed on his hand for Heard; after their divorce, he changed it to “scum”, then to “scam”). We Depp fans loved Ryder. They made sense as a couple and, with her delicate gothic looks, she confirmed our image of him as a friend of the outsider (as though a gorgeous Hollywood actress could ever really be considered an outsider). We were less pleased when he started dating a model, which felt a bit lame, but at least it was Kate Moss, and at least she seemed absolutely bananas about him, clutching his arm on the Cannes red carpet. During their relationship, he notoriously tore up a hotel room they were staying in together, causing $8,000 worth of damage. But again, we told ourselves, this was just his artistic nature. And it was the 90s – destroying hotel rooms was what male celebrities did, right? While Phoenix tended to come across as quite surly in interviews, and Reeves was monosyllabic to the point of incomprehensibility, back in the 90s Depp seemed more fun. Onscreen, he had a tenderness the others didn’t; off-screen, journalists loved him, and he would drive them around LA talking gnomically about his love life and showing them cool tricks he could do with a cigarette. In the 90s, loving Depp was as uncontroversial as liking chocolate, and yet, unusually, the universality of appeal only added to his credibility. He had Oscar nominations and was the highest-paid star in the world. And yet, unlike any other actor who has achieved that – Jimmy Stewart, Tom Hanks – he was still cool. Back then, everyone loved Johnny. Directors loved him, too, especially Burton, of course, but also Waters and Jarmusch. When I tried to talk to people he worked with for this piece before the judgment, they all said no because they wanted to protect him. Until very recently, he had a reputation for being one of the easier actors to work with, praised by the cast and crew of his movies for his professionalism and friendliness. After he and Moss broke up, he got together with Vanessa Paradis, and they had two children, Lily-Rose and Jack. During their 14-year relationship, Depp, true to form, was positively uxorious about Paradis, praising her beauty and becoming a Francophile, giving interviews in French magazines about how much he loved the country. France, he said to the magazine VSD in 2010, “has given me everything. A marvellous family and also an equilibrium which I missed enormously.” For a while, it looked as if Depp had gamed the celebrity system: he had found a way to be entirely true to himself while still being an A-lister and living a life of peace and contentment. Depp had always approached fame with a very clear template. Among his 90s cohort, Phoenix struggled to match up his personal values with being a Hollywood actor, and Reeves didn’t appear to give the matter an enormous amount of thought beyond just doing what he wanted to do. But as early as 1990, Depp had settled on heroes he would namecheck in interviews: Iggy Pop, Marlon Brando, Keith Richards, Hunter S Thompson. Thirty years later he would still be talking about all of them; he is, really, the ultimate fanboy. His Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean is a pastiche of Richards, while Depp has made himself the keeper of Thompson’s flame, playing him in 1998’s Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas, and then posthumously bringing Thompson’s novel The Rum Diary to screen in 2011. It was on this film set that he met Heard. Richards even had a small role in Depp’s court case. In a photo taken by Heard to show the extent of Depp’s drug use, the court saw cocaine lines laid out on the table, pirate-themed box of drugs nearby with the initials JD engraved on it, and there, in the background, a solo CD by Richards. If this had been an episode of Through the Keyhole, the mystery of to whom this table belonged would have been solved in the opening credits. On the one hand, for a man to have the same heroes at 57 as he did at 21 would seem to prove the old adage that the age you become famous is the age you stop growing. (Depp also proves another old adage: never trust a man over 30 who reveres Hunter S Thompson.) On the other, it could also be seen as a testament to Depp’s consistency, even his authenticity. Whereas most actors pick up causes and side interests the way other people go through takeaway sandwiches, Depp has been enduringly faithful to his original loves.  Throughout his career, he sought out friendships with Richards, Thompson, Brando and Allen Ginsberg, which gave him a reflected retro sheen. He seemed to be from the past, his LA a grubby 50s version, as opposed to the glitzy 90s one in which he lived. In a 2011 interview with Patti Smith in Vanity Fair, she asked him about his “mentors”, and he described them, enviously, as coming from “a radically different era … I really believe that, at a certain point, if you’re born in 60-something or whatever, you got ripped off – you know what I mean? I always felt like I was meant to have been born in another era, another time.” Depp tried to bring the spirit of that era to his world, opening The Viper Room nightclub on Sunset Boulevard in 1993. That year, Phoenix collapsed and died outside it from an overdose. In 2012, Depp announced he and Paradis were separating, and he was now dating Heard. Within a year, the once most famously romantic of Hollywood stars was sending text messages to his friend, the actor Paul Bettany, about Heard in which he said: “Let’s drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.” When asked about the message in court, Depp said it was regarding a fight he had recently had with Heard: “She didn’t like me using alcohol and drugs because she had some delusional idea that they turned me into this said monster.” His reputation for professionalism started to crack. He delayed the shooting of the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film because of what he said was a hand injury – which Heard claimed in court occurred when he punched a wall during one of their fights – and there were reports from that set that Depp was drinking heavily and needed to have his lines fed to him through an earpiece. Depp did not deny needing an earpiece, saying it helped him “to act with his eyes”. There has already been much discussion about how all of this will affect Depp’s career, and the answer depends on whom you ask. But probably one of the better clues came from Jerry Bruckheimer, who produces the Pirates franchise. When asked in an interview in May if Depp would be in the next Pirates film he replied: “We’re not quite sure what Johnny’s role is going to be. So, we’re going to have to wait and see.” It has been a long time now since Depp was cool. The photos of him in London during the case, wearing a Rasta hat and matching striped T-shirt, brought a sad pang for those old enough to remember when he was the most stylish man in the world. His last genuinely good film was Sweeney Todd in 2007, and he has spent the past few years making turkeys such as Lone Ranger, The Tourist and a genuinely unbearable cologne advert. His loyal fans would say that it all went wrong when he left Paradis for Heard in 2012. And it’s true, leaving the mother of his children for a young blonde would have once, long ago, been beneath him. But it feels that the rot started before that. According to his former management company, he was spending more than $2m a month, aided in no small part by the fact he cashed out to star in the Pirates franchise and was, for a time, earning more than $50m per role. Even he called it “stupid money”, but insisted he was only demanding that price tag for the sake of his kids. His life quickly became absurd. In 2009, Vanity Fair ran what, in retrospect, looks like the tipping point piece, in which the writer described what it was like travelling on Depp’s carefully designed boat (“Orient Express by way of Parisian brothel”) to his private Caribbean island. The whole thing is grotesquely over the top and crassly predictable, with Depp wanging on (and on and on) about Thompson and Richards, and sharing the advice Brando gave him about how to buy an island. “Money doesn’t buy you happiness. But it buys you a big enough yacht to sail right up to it,” he declares. But if he was merely working to earn money for his children, that has all come to naught: in 2018 he told journalists that his fortune of $650m was gone. He insisted that his former managers had stolen millions from him; they claimed he had spent it. A $25m law suit between them was settled – the terms of the agreement were confidential – but that he had $650m to steal tells its own story. Who, really, can maintain any sense of reality when they are dealing with those sums of money? Maybe some people, but not fiftysomethings who idolise Hunter S Thompson. Depp made the classic fanboy mistake of focusing only on the glamorous, external trappings of his heroes. He views Richards et al as eternal rock’n’roll figures, and constantly retells anecdotes from their hellraiser years. But all of them wrestled with the question of how hellraisers deal with getting older in a way that Depp, apparently, has not. Richards quit hard drugs in 1977 and Iggy Pop also cleaned up long ago. Thompson killed himself at 67, ground down by poor health and depression; Brando ended up a bloated mess. Depp could easily have grown into a figure like Richards or Iggy Pop: clean, cool, critically acclaimed, a revered cultural figure. Instead, in the past few years, it has become clear he has chosen the other option. It’s sad, and it didn’t have to be this way. Of course that’s true of any celebrity downfall – any personal downfall – but with Depp, it felt like a different path was always there in front of him, in touching distance. That now feels like an alternative universe. It would be easy to dismiss this as yet another spoilt, obnoxious celebrity shown up for being spoilt and obnoxious – easy but wrong, because that would miss why Depp was so compelling for so long. Until the allegations of abuse emerged, the stories that came out about Depp were, by and large, notably nice. Kind, even. There was the time he donated £1m to Great Ormond Street hospital after his daughter had been treated there, and then afterwards visited the sick children still in there and read them stories, and, even when his life started to be excessive, his good friends stayed loyal. But over the past decade, things started to change. Where once he drove journalists around LA and France and regaled them with loquacious thoughts about life, his more recent encounters with the press have had the feeling of Kurtz barricading himself in the jungle. In 2018, he gave an interview to Rolling Stone, ostensibly about how he lost all his money, and ended up keeping the journalist, Stephen Rodrick, with him for three days. Rodrick described him as “alternately hilarious, sly and incoherent”, with a “scared, hunted look about him”. “If his current life isn’t a perfect copy of Elvis Presley’s last days, it is a decent facsimile,” Rodrick wrote.  The real connection between Depp, Phoenix and Reeves was that they were all hyperconscious of not doing the predictable thing. But with Phoenix dead at 23 from an overdose, and Depp mired in divorce, drugs and legal hell, his reputation now destroyed, only Reeves, of all unlikely people, has avoided the wearily familiar templates. Only fools expect consistency from celebrities (from anyone, really), but what feels so strange about Depp to fans is how much he seemed to change, and how quickly, when he had been so consistent for so long. Or maybe he was the consistent one, with his eternal reverence for Thompson and Brando, and we’re the fools for being surprised. In any case, the photos shown in court of Depp passed out on hotel room floors confirmed what most of us already knew, and the judge’s verdict has carved it in stone: Depp has become a spent cliche. That was the one thing we thought he would never be. But once again, he complicated the narrative."
"It is based on a Jean Cocteau play from 1930, but Pedro Almodóvar’s The Human Voice could well be the movie that best captures our bizarre modern times. Being Almodóvar, it does so with consummate elegance, controlled melodrama and enviable home decor, but this one-room, one-person, half-hour piece somehow expresses both our own feelings of domestic isolation and the unstable ground of cinema itself. The set-up speaks to our lockdown neuroses: Tilda Swinton indoors, alone and increasingly distraught. She is on a phone call with her ex, though we only hear her end of the conversation as she pads about her tasteful apartment wearing AirPods and an array of haute couture outfits. There are cultural trappings galore: her DVDs (Douglas Sirk, Kill Bill), art books, Chanel bags, paintings (De Chirico, Alberto Vargas). Even the axe she buys looks designer. But Almodóvar makes it clear that none of this is real. The apartment is just a set on an industrial-looking soundstage. We often see it from the outside, or from overhead. Swinton is kind of playing herself – “the clients love my pallor. That mixture of madness and melancholy,” she says – but she’s also a fictional, quintessentially “Almodóvarian” character: another woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Like many film-makers, Almodóvar and Swinton were operating under constrained, Covid-proofed conditions. This era will be marked in history by a preponderance of minimal, self-made or skeleton-crewed movies. Already we’ve had Netflix’s Homemade: a series of lockdown movies from the likes of Kristen Stewart, Gurinder Chadha and Paolo Sorrentino. Not to mention ITV’s Isolation Stories, and a host of short films (The Forgotten C, on living with terminal cancer during Covid, is particularly sobering). This Friday also sees the release of Nick Cave’s Idiot Prayer, a concert movie performed alone in an empty Alexandra Palace. And in December we’ve got the ingenious Zoom-shot horror Host. At the Venice film festival, Almodóvar said the pandemic has “shown us our homes are a place where we’re somehow imprisoned, because we can find the love of our life there, work there, have food delivered, and we don’t need to move from our homes to do all this. I find this very dangerous.” The antidote, he suggested, is going out to the cinema. “It is the opposite of all that.” Although many of us understandably prefer to watch movies at home right now. The Human Voice could be seen as Almodóvar embracing the ironies. The movie is set in the spaces of both the home and the cinema, and asks if there’s still a difference. Fittingly, Swinton resolves things at the climax in her own cathartic, violent, yet tastefully designed way. Hopefully cinema can do something similar. "
"The actor Jennifer Lawrence used to vote Republican, she has revealed. Speaking on Dear Media’s Absolutely Not podcast, Lawrence told host Heather McMahan she “grew up Republican. My first time voting, I voted for John McCain. I was a little Republican.” Lawrence said she remained grateful for her upbringing as it enabled her to “see the fiscal benefits of some of the Republican policies” while also noting that her and the party’s views on social issues “weren’t in line”. “When Donald Trump got elected, that just changed everything,” said Lawrence. “This is an impeached president who’s broken many laws and refused to condemn white supremacy and it feels there’s been a line drawn in the sand.” Despite not voting for him the first time around, Lawrence said she reflected fondly on the years when Barack Obama was in power, saying: “You would go days without thinking about the president.” Speaking before Trump’s election in 2016, Lawrence said she couldn’t “imagine supporting a party that doesn’t support women’s basic rights. It’s 2015 and gay people can get married and we think that we’ve come so far, so, yay! But have we? I don’t want to stay quiet about that stuff.” She also expressed the view that “if Donald Trump is president of the United States, it will be the end of the world. And he’s also the best thing to happen to the Democrats ever.” Earlier this month, Lawrence endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November’s election saying: “Voting is the foundation of our democracy and our freedom. And I would consider this upcoming election the most consequential of our lifetime. “Donald Trump has and will continue to put himself before the safety and well-being of America. He does not represent my values as an American, and most importantly as a human being.” For the past three years, Lawrence has also served on the board of RepresentUs, which she described as “an incredible non-partisan movement and anti-corruption organisation working to unrig America’s broken political system, and put power back in the hands of the American people.”"
"For months, experts have hammered home a critical point: the US’s disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemic – the testing debacle, the politicization of mask wearing, a new surge of infections sweeping across the country – was not inevitable. But to cynical observers what was perhaps inevitable was that Hollywood executives would try to wring the collective trauma of Covid-19 for entertainment purposes and big bucks. Enter: the trailer for Songbird, the first feature filmed in Los Angeles since quarantine, which has sparked criticism as a tone-deaf “horror movie” about an ongoing horror that America – and the world – is still experiencing.  Songbird, directed by Adam Mason and produced by Michael Bay – , AKA the guy known for directing bombastic blockbusters like Transformers, Pearl Harbor and Armageddon – portrays a love story between Nico (Riverdale’s KJ Apa) and Sara (Sofia Carson) during America’s 214th week of lockdown in 2024, as a late-stage version of “Covid-23” mutates to infect people’s brains. The film appears to extract the worst of the past six months, strip it of sensitivity and then paint it on doubly thick in big-budget, Hollywoodized, exaggerated style. In the trailer a Los Angeles billboard ticks up to 8.4m deaths, infected Americans are forced into quarantine camps, and sanitation “police” raid homes for suspected patients. This shoehorning of a real and ongoing tragedy which has killed 229,000 Americans and counting has not gone down well with some still in the grips of the pandemic, which is to say: the moviegoing American public outside of Hollywood. “Making a ‘dystopian horror movie’ about a horror that is real and happening RIGHT NOW is so tone deaf,” tweeted @scallywap. “And so not what people need. So many people have lost jobs, livelihoods and loved ones due to COVID, and everyone’s life has been severely effected [sic]. Bad, bad, bad move.” “Even by Michael Bay standards, SONGBIRD is a choice. Looks like true exploitation cinema the likes of which we rarely get these days,” tweeted the Ringer’s Sean Fennessey. Songbird was conceived by Mason and writing partner Simon Boyes early in the pandemic. The two developed a 12-page “call to arms” over the weekend that New York went into lockdown, Mason told Entertainment Weekly, which Mason then sent to producer Adam Goodman with the email subject line “Crazy Idea!”. Goodman and Bay were signed on the next day. The feature was the first to restart filming in Los Angeles on 8 July, with safety protocols such as frequent testing, a streamlined crew of maximum 40 people daily and separation of actors. Still, the production was slapped with a Sag-Aftra “do not work order” days before filming because producers were “not transparent about their safety protocols”. The order was rescinded on 2 July, which allowed filming to proceed. Songbird is not the only Hollywood project to use quarantine as inspiration and attempt entertainment out of collective trauma - Freeform’s Love in the Time of Corona, NBC’s Connecting …, and Netflix’s Social Distance all took the pandemic as a prerequisite, to mixed critical reviews. But whereas those shows strained to find insight out of a certain slice of quarantine – those who could afford to stay home, the early days of containment – Songbird looks toward a stylized, worse future as popcorn entertainment and also appears to play into some of the worst rightwing conspiracy theories over government using the pandemic to exert control over people. “It’s a dystopian, scary world, but it’s a romantic movie about two people who want to be together, but they can’t,” Mason told Entertainment Weekly. “It’s Romeo and Juliet, but they’re separated by her front door and by the virus.” Regardless of intent, the use of a pandemic which continues to shatter families has rankled some who remember the very different handling of another tragedy, indelible to the national psyche. “remember when 9/11 happened and films refrained from using the WTC for a while out of respect?” tweeted @LeimartCreative. “flash forward two decades and people are so irreverent now when even worse tragedy hits; there’s a michael bay thriller about it AS WE’RE GOING THRU THE EVENT.”"
"The Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has lost his high-stakes libel action in the London courts against the Sun after the newspaper described him as a “wife beater”. The high court dismissed the claim by the Pirates of the Caribbean star for compensation at the end of one of the most widely followed libel trials of the century.  His lawyers said he would most likely appeal against the “perverse and bewildering decision”. In the 129-page ruling, the judge, Mr Justice Nicol, said: “The claimant [Depp] has not succeeded in his action for libel … The defendants [the Sun and News Group Newspapers] have shown that what they published in the meaning which I have held the words to bear was substantially true. The judge added: “I have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard.” He also said he accepted Heard’s evidence that the allegations she made against Depp “have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist”. “I have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely as well as the overarching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account. In those circumstances, parliament has said that a defendant has a complete defence.” The judge said he did not accept Depp’s characterisation of his ex-wife as a gold-digger. “I recognise that there were other elements to the divorce settlement as well,” Nicol noted, “but her donation of … $7m to charity is hardly the act one would expect of a gold-digger”. In 12 out of the 14 incidents of assault reported by Heard, the judge said he found the allegations proved. “I do not regard [the Sun’s] inability to make good these allegations [in the other two incidents] as of importance in determining whether they have established the substantial truth of the words that they published.” In his conclusion, Nicol cited an email sent by Depp in August 2016 as indicative of the actor’s true feelings towards Heard. Depp’s message said: “I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of emotion or what I once thought was love for this gold digging, low level, dime a dozen, mushy, pointless dangling overused flappy fish market … I can only hope that karma kicks in and takes the gift of breath from her … Sorry man … But NOW I will stop at nothing!!!” The long-awaited decision was published online at 10am on Monday, more than three months after the high court hearing finished in late July. Depp, 57, had sued the Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers (NGN), and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article published in the Sun that originally carried the headline “Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be ‘genuinely happy’ casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?” NGN relied on a defence of truth to the claim. The burden of proof was on the Sun to demonstrate that the story was substantially accurate on the balance of probabilities. Immediately after the ruling, the publisher issued a statement saying: “The Sun has stood up and campaigned for the victims of domestic abuse for over 20 years. Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.” The US lawyer representing Heard in her forthcoming defamation case on similar grounds in the US, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, said: “For those of us present for the London high court trial, this decision and judgment are not a surprise. “Very soon, we will be presenting even more voluminous evidence in the US. We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the US court and defending Ms Heard’s right to free speech.” Jenny Afia, the solicitor at the London law firm of Schillings who represented Depp, said: “This decision is as perverse as it is bewildering. Most troubling is the judge’s reliance on the testimony of Amber Heard, and corresponding disregard of the mountain of counter-evidence from police officers, medical practitioners, her own former assistant, other unchallenged witnesses and an array of documentary evidence which completely undermined the allegations, point by point. All of this was overlooked. “The judgment is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr Depp not to appeal this decision.” Although Depp’s lawyers have indicated he is likely to appeal, it may prove difficult for them to overturn what are findings of fact by the trial judge. The judge’s rulings on those points are effectively similar to a jury’s verdict in a crown court. Appeals are more normally on points of law. Commenting on the decision, Caroline Kean, a partner at the London law firm Wiggin LLP, said: “This is a heartening and just decision which serves as a reminder that British libel laws are not there to curtail free speech and the media’s right to publish on stories of global interest. “This case was effectively a forum for two private individuals to slug it out and a clear misuse of taxpayers’ money, taking up court resources that could have been deployed for more worthy causes.” Emily Cox, a partner at the London law firm Stewarts, which specialises in libel cases, said: “Although not a criminal determination of guilt, it is difficult to see how Depp will ever be able to shake off the ‘wife beater’ label now, personally and professionally. The judge expressly endorsed the notion that Depp had a ‘monster side’ and held that he did assault Heard and put her ‘in fear of her life’.” Lisa King, the director of communications and external relations at the domestic violence charity Refuge, said: “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard. No survivor should ever have her voice silenced. “A common tactic used by perpetrators of domestic abuse is to repeatedly tell victims that no one will believe them – and to use power and control to try and silence them. What we have seen today is that power, fame and financial resources cannot be used to silence women. That is a welcome message for survivors of domestic abuse around the world. “We stand in solidarity with Amber Heard, who has shown immense bravery in speaking up and speaking out.”"
"It is one of the greatest British films of all time, directed in 1965 by David Lean with an A-list cast that included Julie Christie, Omar Sharif and Alec Guinness. But the epic adaptation of Doctor Zhivago, Boris Pasternak’s classic love story set against the Russian revolution, might never have happened if a planned US production had got there first. James Fenwick, a British film historian, has discovered that two of cinema’s most revered film-makers – Hollywood star Kirk Douglas and director Stanley Kubrick – had tried in vain to acquire the movie rights earlier, in the late 1950s. Kubrick wrote to Pasternak personally and Douglas hoped to shoot the production in the Soviet Union, previously unpublished material reveals. Audiences can only imagine what might have been. Douglas and Kubrick collaborated on two other masterpieces, Paths of Glory, one of cinema’s most powerful anti-war movies, and Spartacus, the story of a slave uprising in the Roman republic, which they made in 1957 and 1960 respectively. Fenwick said: “Zhivago is certainly an unknown fact about the careers of Douglas and Kubrick.” Pasternak completed his novel in 1955, only for it to be banned in all Soviet states for its supposed attack on the Soviet Union. The manuscript was smuggled to the west and published in 1957 by an Italian publisher, which bought the rights from Pasternak. It helped him win the Nobel prize in literature in 1958. Fenwick has been taken aback to find a letter of 8 January 1959, in which Kubrick had written to Pasternak, pointing out the quality of his previous work. “The last film we made, Paths of Glory, received the best picture of the year award in Belgium, Brazil and Finland,” he wrote. “We would now like to buy the motion picture rights to Doctor Zhivago. We have contacted the law firm in New York who represent the Italian publishers of the book. Negotiations are at a standstill as they are not yet prepared to finalise a deal.” Further documentary evidence reveals that Kubrick and his producer James B Harris had wanted to acquire the book as early as December 1958 and that they had been in discussions with Bryna Productions, Douglas’s company. Fenwick, senior lecturer in media at Sheffield Hallam University, will publish his discovery in two forthcoming books, Stanley Kubrick Produces and Shadow Cinema: The Historical and Production Contexts of Unmade Films, a collection of essays by leading scholars that he has co-edited. He found evidence relating to Zhivago in the Kubrick archive at the University of the Arts London and among the Kirk Douglas papers at the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research. His initial reaction was disbelief that Kubrick would have wanted to adapt a literary masterpiece: “At that time he was more associated with pulp crime fiction.” But, among Kubrick’s papers, Fenwick found a passage in previously unseen notebooks that probably date to the early 1950s. Kubrick wrote: “The precise moment of absolute success for a director is when he is allowed to film a great literary classic of over 600 pages, which he does not understand too well, and which is anyway impossible to film properly due to the complexity of the plot or the elusiveness of its form or content.” Fenwick said: “[This] perhaps indicates how Kubrick might have gone about adapting something like Zhivago … I imagine it would have had the grand, epic scale of Spartacus, an adaptation of the 1951 Howard Fast novel.” He also recalled his disbelief that Douglas should have wanted to produce a movie in the Soviet Union then, “considering the context in America of the Communist witch-hunt”. But, with Spartacus, Douglas played a part in bringing an end to the Hollywood anti-communist blacklist in insisting to Universal pictures that blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo be named as screenwriter. Speculating that Douglas might have cast himself as Yuri Zhivago, the physician and poet played by Sharif, Fenwick added that, in filming in the Soviet Union, the actor wanted a greater role: “It reveals more about Douglas’s diplomatic tendencies and the way he saw himself as a cultural ambassador for the USA.”"

"Alan Ball will probably always be known as the Oscar-winning screenwriter of the 1999 hit American Beauty, though he saw his original script curtailed in the edit, and its themes of identity and sexuality made more opaque than he intended. His subsequent work has tended to focus on repression, sexuality and guilt, and so it proves again with this fervently personal movie. Sophia Lillis plays Betty, a shy, smart teenage girl growing up in an old-fashioned southern household in the early 1970s. She idolises her smart uncle Frank (Paul Bettany), an unmarried, unconventional guy who left home to become a literature professor in New York, and who always inspired her love of books. When Betty comes to New York as a student, she reconnects with Uncle Frank but, innocent country mouse that she is, Betty is baffled by Uncle Frank having a “roommate”: Walid, played by Ball’s partner and one of the movie’s co-producers Peter Macdissi. Betty gradually comes to realise that her witty, urbane, kindly uncle carries an awful burden of pain because of his relations with his father – her grandfather – “Daddy Mac”, played by Stephen Root as a crocodile of reactionary hostility. As with so many movies of this kind, some of the interest lies in wondering how the writer has transformed elements of his own life and family experiences: how much of Ball is in Betty and how much in Frank? Uncle Frank doesn’t have the witty indirectness of American Beauty or Ball’s TV classic Six Feet Under, but it has a strong and very convincing performance from Bettany. The excellent Margo Martindale also has a small part as Frank’s mother, though she has little to do. It’s a shame that the only good role she’s had recently has been on the Netflix animation BoJack Horseman."
"As early as April this year, Vulture reported that at least 20 coronavirus-related documentary projects were shooting or seeking funding. Seven months later, five significant feature documentaries about the virus have been completed, with countless more due to follow. Made from various perspectives, each film has something different to say about the earliest days of the pandemic. The most high-profile of these, Alex Gibney’s slick film argues that its pace of production is a matter of urgency. Rushed out in time for the US election, the film – which takes its title from a statement made by Donald Trump two days after the first case of the virus was discovered in America – focuses on the US government’s pandemic response. Following a rigid timeline, the film fastidiously details the various failures that resulted in more than 200,000 deaths and 30,000 job losses in those early months in the US. Beyond the specifics that are detailed (poor testing programmes, failures to procure protective equipment, overwhelmed hospitals etc), what is conveyed is a systemic distrust for scientific guidance, outlined through testimony from scientists involved in the pandemic response. Mixing infographics, news footage, expert interviews and straight narration, the raw information present is enough to make the film’s argument clear, but Gibney’s most effective rhetorical device is to place his play-by-play of the US government’s response in parallel with that of South Korea, which uncovered its first patient on the same day yet saw entirely different outcomes.  Totally Under Control is on BBC iPlayer. Adam Benzine’s The Curve tackles the same topic, arriving just after Gibney’s film, and unfortunately outmuscled in terms of access, production values and promotional reach. Using a similarly linear structure and many of the same formal devices, it tells the story seen in Gibney’s film in half the runtime. Benzine’s film is commendable for its two divergences: dealing more adeptly with the racial dynamics at play by detailing the disparities faced by communities of colour; and by making the pandemic feel more personal through the inclusion of a moving montage of ordinary Americans describing their losses.  The Curve is available in the UK on Vimeo on Demand (£3.99). Directed by Weixi Chen, Hao Wu and a third anonymous film-maker, 76 Days was filmed at four hospitals during Wuhan’s lockdown, the film-makers roving the wards with a handheld camera, capturing events up close and personal. Unlike Gibney or Benzine’s films, it does not depict a mishandled, inept response, but instead an immensely efficient one. Avoiding any grand commentary, the film focuses on the doctors and nurses, who – calm, collected and shrouded in hazmat-level protective equipment – rise resiliently to face this unexpected challenge. An intimate and moving record of the height of the pandemic, the film is simple but effective, yet oddly absent of death or any real suffering. This could be a condition of access; there is little here that the Chinese government might object to being seen.  No UK release confirmed. Ai Weiwei’s clandestine vision of the same situation, CoroNation, puts a different slant on China’s militant efficiency, focusing on the bureaucratic operation behind such a strict, large-scale lockdown. Providing a citizen’s-eye view of life in Wuhan at the peak of the outbreak, the film consists of footage shot around the city by multiple camera operators, stitched together by the artist and interspersed with sweeping drone shots of deserted streets and empty highways. Unlike the well-oiled machine seen in 76 Days, China, as Ai portrays it, is a confusing, chaotic mass of restrictions, with ordinary citizens finding themselves frustrated, obstructed or skipped over entirely. Uninterested in the specifics of the virus, Ai documents the systems of control and subordination that are involved in battling it, making visible the machinations of bureaucracy that are usually unseen.  CoroNation is available in the UK on Vimeo on Demand (£5). Also filmed in China, Dan Wei’s The Ark takes a more unorthodox approach. Coronavirus isn’t the focus in this pandemic documentary, featuring only in the increasingly panicked TV news reports. Instead, it presents the a parallel story about a family caring for a mother, hospitalised with a different life-threatening disease at the same time as the outbreak in Wuhan. Wei films the woman and her family in artful, claustrophobic black-and-white as they face difficult decisions about what is best for her while pressures mount within the ward and across the country. As matters of faith, ideology and finance collide, Wei keeps things simple, showing how, while a global crisis developed, drawing crucial resources and attention away from those already in need, many families suffered their own small catastrophes. When a significant event breaks, there is often a rush to tell the story in its broadest, grandest terms, but intimate, subjective narratives are often more revealing, and The Ark is the type of film that will have lasting value. Instead of explaining why and how the pandemic happened, it shows what the experience was like for ordinary people.  No UK release confirmed. "
"The Birmingham-based film-maker Abdul Rahman remembers an event that he says sums up one of the biggest problems in the Midlands film industry. After a Q&A with a director, Rahman, who is known as AR Ugas, took a moment to survey the room. “I was standing with my friends who are black film-makers, then on the other side were the more upper-class white people who had all the connections,” he said. “It’s those invisible lines that nobody wanted to cross.” The Midlands is one of the most diverse areas in the UK but its film scene, which has grown rapidly in the last decade, does not necessarily reflect that. The disconnect came to light recently when Steve McQueen was shooting part of his BBC series Small Axe in a Wolverhampton suburb. During the production, McQueen committed to having a diverse crew. He created a trainee scheme that placed black, Asian and minority ethnic talent in all departments; in London it had been a stretch at times but in the Midlands he found only drivers and one electrician. “The stark reality is that there is no infrastructure to support and hire BAME crew,” he said. His comments followed a report into the impact of the British Film Institute (BFI) diversity standards introduced in 2014. It found that, between 2016 and 2019, no feature film made in the entire Midlands region that passed the diversity standards had any BAME representation in its workforce. To put that in context, during the same period, 28% of films made in south-west England, which has a far lower BAME population, had some diverse representation, while Wales – one of the least diverse regions in the UK – recorded 33%. The BFI points out the research covered only a handful of films, and that the Midlands does not have film production hubs like those in Bristol or Cardiff – although the Peaky Blinders creator, Steven Knight, is opening a studio in Digbeth that is being called “Brummiewood”. Even with those caveats, the question remains: why is an area that includes Birmingham, the youngest and most diverse city outside London, as well as Wolverhampton, Nottingham and Leicester, struggling to produce BAME off-screen talent? The BFI chief executive, Ben Roberts, said the problem was that “people are either trained up and they’re not able to access the productions, or the infrastructure isn’t there at all”. But he added that the issue was also about a general lack of production work in the area. “The idea that nothing is happening is not right,” he said. “The problem really is: if you’re a writer and you need to find a producer, where are the active producers in Birmingham? Because they also need to be developed.” Roger Shannon, who founded the Birmingham Film and Video Workshop in 1979 before becoming the head of production at the BFI and UK Film Council, said the lack of representation was more surprising when the region’s film history was taken into consideration. As well as the workshop, in Birmingham there was Stuart Hall’s academic work at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and Michael Abbensetts’s Empire Road, starring Norman Beaton. Shannon and others ask why the money the region has received in the past 20 years to build its film industry, which has grown by 50% since 2010, has not had a bigger impact on diversity. In 2007, the region was given a landmark £4m film production fund followed by £3m in 2014 via Creative England, and another £2.1m in 2017, part of the West Midlands Production Fund. Daniel Alexander and Ammo Talwar run the Back In programme, aimed at increasing diversity in film-making in Birmingham, but have not felt the impact of that money: Back In is self-funded. Alexander said that in four years, they had developed 18 film-makers, including Rahman, who had gone into the TV and film industries. “The people are there, the skills are there,” said Talwar. “The opportunities are not flowing through, so there’s a problem.” Alexander is a member of Create Central, an industry-led trade body that is trying to make things flow better and received £2m in funding with the aim of making the West Midlands a key creative region. For Tenisha White, a Solihull-based film-maker, more needs to be done to cross the invisible lines Rahman encountered. “Whenever I shoot my films, most of my films are shot by people of colour,” she said. “I feel the industry does not make an effort to speak to people who can connect them to diverse voices.”"
"Licking a toilet brush would supply a taste less unpleasant than watching this grim comedy, a buddy gross-out movie that’s unfunny and offensive in equal measures. Blandly rugged actor Josh Duhamel writes, directs and stars in the story of a group of middle-aged friends who compete in an annual tournament of chest-thumping machismo. Every summer, the bros do battle in contests involving giant obstacle courses, mud pits, beer bongs and competitive hotdog-eating – with a bit of male bonding in the evening, as they drunkenly dangle their scrotums in each other’s faces. Duhamel plays Bob – the “Bobfather” – who organises the games at a lakeside cabin. While the men compete, their wives and girlfriends tut indulgently from deckchairs. It’s the same every year until odious six-time champ Shelly (Dan Bakkedahl) takes a paintball bullet in the testicles, causing irreparable damage (“I’m like a Ken doll down there”). Unable to cope with the shame, Shelly vanishes. Bob finds him five years later in a rehab unit and decides to put the games on one last time in a bid to keep Shelly’s pecker up. There’s a lot to be repulsed by here: it’s hard to know where to start. The female characters? Women are either hot and gagging for it, or definitely neither. Or the homophobic stereotyping? One of the buddies is gay, and this is his only character trait. The scene where they all drink cocktails containing semen is a low. But so, too, is the unhilarious challenge in a bar that involves the guys taking laxatives and getting a snog on the dancefloor before diarrhoea hits. Again, that particular smell might be less noxious than the whiff given off by the film."
"I was recently scrolling through Christmas films at the cinema opposite the kids’ school, picturing the happy scene where I arrive unexpectedly outside the gates, on 17 December or thereabouts, wearing flashing reindeer horns, and bear them off to see It’s a Wonderful Life, which they will then remember for the rest of their lives. Naturally, I am imagining a different family, as I am not allowed near the school because even the way I hold my phone is appalling. Also, they won’t watch any film made before 2005. This is not only a source of genuine sorrow, but it was also arrived at painfully – years of bribing and guilt-tripping them into watching Heathers and Beavis and Butt-Head and There’s Something About Mary, going: “Wait, wait, the next bit’s really funny,” only to find that I have misremembered and there is one joke, 40 minutes in, and the rest, while quite explicit, might be funny to me, but isn’t humorous in the modern sense. I raised them wrong. I should have been showing them The Wizard of Oz (here, kids, try 102 minutes of people looking for something that they don’t find till minute 99) and The Sound of Music (the Nazis turn nasty partway through hour four; this film has less pace than the actual war). Instead, I showed them Toy Story, which has more jokes than my entire childhood, and Up, which gets to grips with all the wonder and minutiae of the human condition in the 40 seconds before the opening credits. Pixar has ruined this generation: they have no attention span and zero tolerance for mild amusement; if you have some crap CGI you think you can get past them, don’t even start. The 13-year-old’s counterpoint, incidentally, is that the kids are OK and it is adults who have been ruined by Game of Thrones. Now we can’t concentrate on anything unless there is a dragon in it and half the cast is naked half the time. It is too late for me to prevail. But if you have children at a malleable age – which is to say, who can’t speak – it is not too late to save yourselves."
"“You get used to sticking a six-inch cotton-wool bud up your nose and down your tonsils every morning,” says Richard Clark. He is describing his typical working day. “The masks are quite suffocating. They’re quite sweaty. You don’t drink as much water, and so people dehydrate. You get headaches. Certainly on the first week, by five o’clock, a certain kind of fugginess comes over everybody. Concentrating during those last two hours … you can feel it being a little bit harder.” It sounds like the experience of a frontline care worker, but this is film-making in the age of Covid-19. Clark is directing the second season of Fox’s apocalyptic sci-fi series War of the Worlds in south Wales, with a crew of about 70 people. Having shut down in late March because of the pandemic, the UK’s film and high-end television industry is back in business, which can only be good news. But it is by no means business as usual. As the director of one of the first productions to resume, three weeks ago, Clark has been negotiating a whole new way of working – not quite as dystopian as the programme he’s making, but strange and slightly sci-fi all the same “To be honest, you get used to the patterns and the rituals pretty quickly,” he says. “Testing is the key thing: temperature checks for everybody every morning, and 30 members of the crew and the lead actors are tested every morning.” There is a full-time Covid-19 consultant on set to keep an eye on social distancing and cross-contacts. Sets are fogged every night, as are all the costumes. Props are kept sealed in bags, then only handled by the cast member using them. Even dining is different, with no more catering truck and lunchtime socialising. Meals are individually packaged and served, and eaten in a huge marquee. Each table is two metres long, so one person can sit at either end. “The main philosophy behind how we operate is essentially: ‘You’ve got to protect the cast,’” Clark explains. In War of the Worlds’ case, that includes Gabriel Byrne, Elizabeth McGovern and Normal People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones. “Ultimately, the crew are replaceable, including – to an extent – the director. But the lead cast are not, so you’ve got to prioritise safeguarding those personnel who, if they went down ill, would cause the whole thing to collapse.” There is a complex system of coloured armbands denoting the degree of proximity to which crew members are allowed to the actors. Everyone must wear masks, even when shooting outdoors. Some, such as hair and makeup, must wear visors, too. It is a similar setup over at Pinewood studios, says Sarah-Jane Wright, the head of production at Working Title. She has just returned from the set of Last Night in Soho, Edgar Wright’s new movie, a psychological horror set in 1960s London. Shooting was just about finished when lockdown started, but a week of additional photography was still needed. With a larger crew, their system is even more complicated than Clark’s. Personnel are divided into discrete pods. Pod A is the cast (which includes Anya Taylor-Joy, Diana Rigg and Thomasin McKenzie) along with crew who have to be close to them, such as the director and camera operators. They have their own separate entrance and check-in area (again, temperature checks and Covid-19 swab tests are routine), separate bathrooms and their own dining facilities. Pod A can only interact with their “pod unit base”, which consists of hair and makeup, second assistant directors and others. Pod B contains other technicians and crew who have to be on set. They are separated from pod A by Plexiglass and barriers. Pod C is standbys, electricians, grips, riggers and props, who have their own marquee outside the set. “If a light needs changing or props need adjusting, they can only go on to the set when pod A and pod B have cleared it.” Then there’s Pod O (office and props, who are nearby but never come on set), and Pod H (people working remotely). Plus 24-hour cleaners and a team of between six and 10 Covid-19 coordinators, swabbing nurses and medics. “We have a very good Covid adviser who does actually have a metal measuring tape to make sure everyone is two metres socially distanced.” Because everyone is in masks, things are quieter than usual, says Wright. “It can feel as if you’re going to work in an operating theatre. But it has so quickly become our new normal.” Before coronavirus, film and high-end television production in the UK was booming. Inward investment, mostly from the US, was at a record-breaking £3.65bn in 2019. This year was on track to exceed that. The major film studios were fully booked, new ones were being built across the country to cope with the demand and Hollywood productions were queueing up to take advantage of the UK’s expertise and tax breaks. Then, with the imposition of lockdown in March, everything changed practically overnight. “We went from pretty much full employment to zero employment and everything stopping,” says Adrian Wootton, the CEO of the British Film Commission (BFC), which is responsible for persuading foreign companies to come and film in the UK. “We had something like a billion pounds’ worth of production mothballed or suspended in the UK.” The BFC, British Film Institute and others have been working ever since to figure out how to get film-making back up and running, talking to industry, studios, unions, government, public health bodies, right up to No 10. It was the biggest consultation they have ever done, according to Wootton. The end result was a 53-page document of guidelines for working safely during Covid-19, published in June but continually updated since. It has served to kickstart the recovery process. “Pretty much from the minute the guidance was published, people started rehiring their teams, and started going back into active preproduction,” Wootton says. That recovery is proceeding apace. At the beginning of July, Tom Cruise arrived in the UK to resume filming on Mission: Impossible 7 and 8 at Hertfordshire’s Leavesden studios (filming in Italy was halted in February). Cruise was one of a number of actors to be granted exemption after standard quarantine rules were relaxed to allow Hollywood crews to work in the UK under socially distanced conditions. Across the Pinewood lot from Last Night in Soho, Jurassic World: Dominion is back on set, having shut down in March. Other titles such as The Batman, Disney’s The Little Mermaid and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3 are preparing to start up again. Netflix expects its UK series such as The Witcher and Sex Education to be filming by the end of September. Bollywood is also returning to the UK: Akshay Kumar’s Bell Bottom is due to shoot in Scotland in August. Film-making under Covid-19 will be more expensive. Working to the guidelines is adding between 15% and 25% to gross budgets, estimates Sarah-Jane Wright, on top of money lost by shutting down. At the time of lockdown, Working Title had four films scheduled to begin shooting this summer. Universal has spent a reported £5m on safety protocols for Jurassic World at Pinewood. The US studios have deeper financial resources and resilience, but for smaller domestic TV and independent film productions the costs have been prohibitive. Insurance has been a particular barrier to restarting, although that problem was finally resolved this week with a new £500m government-backed support scheme. Film-making is also expected to be slower under the guidelines, although Wright and Clark report no major schedule delays. “At the moment, we are shooting about 18 setups a day, which is what I aim for in a high-end drama,” says Clark, “so we are not dropping anything.” Much of that is down to the military-level planning required in the preproduction phase. Another factor could be the reduced number of interruptions, now that nonessential personnel cannot casually drop by to “see what’s going on” or surreptitiously gawp at Tom Cruise. Long-term lessons could yet come out of this situation. As with many sectors, the film industry seems to have realised how much more people could be working remotely. There are also, suggests Wootton, lessons about sustainability – never one of the industry’s strong points. “Big productions such as James Bond move around the world, and you can’t see that changing, but there might be more: ‘Do we really need to go to that country? Do we really need to send hundreds people on a jet there for several weeks?’” As for the creative impact, the new working conditions make certain scenarios more difficult. Crowd scenes, for example, or street scenes requiring lots of extras, all of whom must be tested, monitored and socially distanced. But there are always workarounds. This week’s shooting on Last Night in Soho was originally supposed to have taken place in the real Soho in central London; instead they have had to recreate the streetscape on a soundstage with visual effects filling in the gaps. Clark has not had to make changes to War of the Worlds’ scripts, he says, but he, too, has had difficulties finding locations, since so many places are shut down or high-risk, which has necessitated building more indoor sets. One small but significant difference, Clark observes, is how protective equipment and social distancing affect human interaction: “It puts a slight wall between you that wasn’t there before. It’s surmountable, but you feel it. There’s a kind of intimacy in terms of directing, and particularly with the cast. We shot a very emotional scene this morning and it was quite upsetting for the actor, and it was hard maintaining a distance from them. Usually, there would probably be a touch on the arm, a physical reassurance. Actors make themselves very vulnerable, and they need the support and reassurance of directors to help them go there, and know that it’s safe. That reassurance is slightly harder to provide if you’re a metre-plus away from them with a mask on.” Nobody wants this “new normal” to last, but film crews are well accustomed to coping with adverse and unpredictable conditions, points out Sarah-Jane Wright. “If any industry was going to adapt to this, the film and TV industry is built to just take this on board and run with it. If this is our normal for the next year, I feel we can achieve it. When I visited the set, there was a real sense that everyone was really, really happy to be back at work … although it’s hard, because you can’t see people smiling through a mask.” Clark agrees: “Being in a mask 10 hours a day is not fun, but these are not exactly terrible problems. We’re all bloody grateful to be working, to be honest.”"
"A £500m scheme to jumpstart the UK’s battered film and television industries has been welcomed by producers. On Tuesday, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, announced a scheme in which the government effectively takes on the role of a commercial insurer by offering to support productions if they incur losses because of coronavirus. Film and TV production ground to a halt because of the lockdown, meaning delays to a string of movies and popular TV shows such as Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders. With the easing of restrictions, companies have been desperate to restart production but have been unable to do so because insurers will not provide Covid-19 cover. “Production insurance is a fundamental part of how you make TV programmes and films,” said John McVay, the chief executive of the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact). “ There has been no insurance written for Covid-related potential losses since the lockdown.” Shows that have gone ahead have done so in very specific circumstances, such as the BBC’s Talking Heads monologue series, while restarted series, such as Coronation Street, have had to observe social distancing. “If you want to do something with scale and ambition, which is what the UK is famous for, you can’t even think of it unless you have insurance,” said McVay He said the announcement was “amazing” and thanked the government for listening to industry concerns. “This has been a long slog. This allows us to get people back off furlough and get the industry back up and running.” The film producer Elizabeth Karlsen said the news meant her company could now go ahead with filming Mothering Sunday, an adaptation of the Graham Swift novella starring Olivia Colman, Colin Firth and Josh O’Connor. She said: “It is an understatement to say how pleased we are that a decision has finally been made to support the film and television industry at this unprecedented and crucial time. “Without the government’s backing our industry, which is held in such high regard throughout the world, was under serious threat.” The £500m film and TV production restart scheme will cover the whole of the UK. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “The UK’s film and TV industry is the envy of the world, and it’s vital that productions get the help they need to restart as part of our plan to kickstart jobs following the lockdown. “This targeted scheme, which will help fill the gap created by the lack of available insurance, will help protect tens of thousands of jobs, from actors and directors through to camera operators, costume designers, and runners. The sector is worth over £12bn to the UK’s economy, so it’s right that we do what we can to help them reopen and get back to making the films and shows that we all love.” Dowden also announced more detail on the government’s £1.57bn cultural recovery fund, including the creation of a new board to help administer the programme and advise on the largest grants. It will be chaired by Sir Damon Buffini, a founding partner of the private equity fund Permira and the chair of the National Theatre. Money will be distributed by organisations such as Arts Council England, the British Film Institute and Historic England. They will publish much anticipated guidance and criteria for applicants on Wednesday."
"Amber Heard has spoken of her trauma at reliving the breakup of her marriage, saying she is “placing her faith in British justice” as Johnny Depp’s lawyer branded her a “compulsive liar” and the “abuser” in the couple’s relationship. As the libel action brought by Depp against the publishers of the Sun newspaper ended on Tuesday, Heard was booed and heckled by Depp fans who have gathered daily outside the high court in London for the proceedings over allegations that the Pirates of the Caribbean star had been violent towards her. In a short statement, Heard said: “It has been incredibly painful to relive the breakup of my relationship, have my motives and my truth questioned, and the most traumatic and intimate details of my life with Johnny shared in court and broadcast around the entire world.” She gave “heartfelt thanks for the tremendous outpouring of support and the many messages I have received from around the world. You have given me so much strength and I send it back to you.” Depp’s lawyer, David Sherborne, told the court in his closing submissions: “From the big points to the small points, Ms Heard has proved herself to be a wholly unreliable witness and, frankly, a compulsive liar, and I don’t say that lightly.” Summing up the case, Sherborne said: “What is important to Mr Depp is clearing his name of these appalling allegations, expanded on as it has been over the last four years, as a result of which he has lost nothing less than everything, he would say. “When I say he has lost everything, to him obviously everything is his reputation. This is not about money, this is vindicating him.” He said a recording made between Depp and Heard, in which she refers to hitting her husband, demonstrated her propensity to violence. “At its very core, we say it demonstrates that she is the abuser, not Mr Depp. He is no wife beater,” he told the judge, Mr Justice Nicol. He added: “If it was a man who had said what Ms Heard said, and who had admitted to what she admitted to, if this was Mr Depp, for example, and it was the other way around, can you imagine what consternation there would be?” he said. Sherborne highlighted a text message sent by Heard, in which she wrote: “This is Amber and I get what I want”. He said Heard had chopped and changed her evidence, and accused others of lying as she maintained her allegations that Depp was violent towards her. “Doctors were lying, nurses were lying, police officers are lying, only Ms Heard – who was at pains to repeat the well-rehearsed mantra that she was not here to call anyone a liar – only Ms Heard was correct at all times no matter what,” said Sherborne. In one moment of “unscripted malevolence”, she “tossed in a total lie” about Kate Moss, and a rumour that Depp had pushed the supermodel down some stairs, which was a “gratuitous and totally invented” reference to Moss, said Sherborne. Heard’s alleged bruises were “magic bruises that only appear when she is on her own or with friends, but never appear when she is out or anyone independent films them”. They were “key” to all of this, yet she didn’t go to the police or a hospital, said Sherborne. “Mr Depp, far from being the domestic abuser, is the domestic abused,” he said.  Depp, 57, is suing the Sun’s publishers, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article that called him a “wife beater” and referred to “overwhelming evidence” that he had attacked Heard. Depp denies ever hitting Heard, 34, who has submitted details of 14 occasions during their relationship when she claims he assaulted her. Sasha Wass QC, for News Group Newspapers, has said its defence “is one of truth, namely that Mr Depp did indeed beat his wife”. Describing Heard as a “complex individual with a complex history, medical and emotional”, Sherborne said from the moment Heard left an LA courthouse, after seeking a restraining order against Depp in front of a “barrage” of media, she had become an advocate for victims of domestic violence. There were many victims of domestic violence, said Sherborne. “But this is a huge disservice to those genuine victims, and those of the #MeToo movement, for Ms Heard to count herself as one of them, as she plainly does.” Depp was cast into the “rogues’ gallery of abusers” highlighted by the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements after the publication of the Sun article, and “cited in the same breath as disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein”, the judge heard. The article had “tried, convicted and sentenced” Depp on an allegation that he has always said was “completely untrue”. That was why he had brought the case, “subjecting himself to this painful, public process”. Sherborne added: “He has never hit a woman in his entire life, period, full stop, nada.” Crucially, he had also never been accused of it, apart from by Heard, he added. The court required “compelling and cogent evidence” before finding someone was guilty of a serious criminal offence. This was particularly important “where there are two diametrically opposed accounts”, said Sherborne. “One side is obviously lying and one side is telling the truth.” The court had heard “astonishingly self-serving and fictionalised” accounts of what Heard was thinking at the time of the alleged violence, in an unsent email she wrote, and also in her “secret feelings book that reads more like a novella than anything which matches reality”, he said. Heard had taken secret footage of Depp kicking a kitchen sink. But, in all the years of violence that she alleges “when she has her phone at the ready, where is the secret recording of Mr Depp knocking seven bells out of her, grabbing her by the throat, pulling her by the hair, screaming at her?” he said. Of photographs taken by Heard’s friends allegedly showing injuries caused by Depp, he said: “They are taken of an actress, someone who is familiar with the use of makeup.” The fact Depp had a history of consuming alcohol and drugs was not “newsworthy”, and he had been “candid” about his use of certain substances. Heard, he added, had “deliberately sought to hide or play down her misuse of drink or illegal drugs”. Judgment in the case will be delivered at a later date."
"The out-of-season holiday resort, like the abandoned city or ruined temple, has something fascinating and even erotic in its emptiness. Writer-director Claire Oakley taps into this mood for her debut feature, a psychological drama-thriller set in a wintry caravan park in St Ives, Cornwall. She has taken the template of arthouse Brit realism and audaciously spiked it with some genre thrills, as if Ken Loach collaborated with Brian De Palma or Nicolas Roeg. With cinematographer Nick Cooke, Oakley finds the bracingly different aspects of the Cornish landscape: ominous in the darkness, wild in the sunshine and menacing in the cold, as distant sea spray mixes with the cloud cover. Molly Windsor (whom I last saw 10 years ago as a child actor in Samantha Morton’s The Unloved) plays Ruth, a teenager who shows up after dark at what looks like an utterly deserted caravan site: it is winter, of course, so it could be just after supper or four in the morning. There is something unwelcoming about it, but Ruth is at least expected: she is the girlfriend of Tom (Joseph Quinn) who works at the resort, and she’s hoping to get cleaning work there herself. Manager Shirley (Lisa Palfrey) takes her on, and allows Ruth and Tom to stay in one of the static caravans, with much lascivious giggling about how the last couple to occupy it ended up having a baby. Ruth is reasonably content, although Kai (Theo Barklem-Biggs), the other lad working there minding the guard dog, is a nasty piece of work. The one friendly face is Jade (Stefanie Martini), whose hobby is makeup and hairstyling and who offers to give Ruth a makeover. Ruth is disturbed to see strands of bright red hair in the bed she shares with Tom, and the faint remains of a cupid’s-bow kiss on the mirror. Is Tom having an affair? But then why can she see this same kiss-shape mysteriously appearing at night on the windows of caravans that are supposed to be empty – caravans that have been hygienically sealed in polyurethane wrapping for the winter – like a ghostly ectoplasm? Is this place haunted? Or is Ruth herself experiencing a spectral, psychosexual premonition of something in her own future? The idea of a ghost in the holiday resort is appropriate and yet a tautology. The whole place at this time of year is a ghost, an uncanny wraith of its summer self. Oakley shows how without the intoxicant of sunshine and holidays, you can see the everyday textures and surfaces more clearly, yet they are just as sensual. One of her best sequences is a bad dream that Ruth has, which is simply a static shot of some marram grass on the beach, which over five or 10 seconds turns from green to reddish brown, as if being poisoned. And yet Oakley doesn’t let us forget about the sheer beauty of the place, with golden-hour sunsets across the bay. Ruth cannot swim and is afraid of the sea (Oakley lets us absorb the symbolic possibilities of this phobia), but she listens impassively to Shirley’s gnomic advice that the water is a great healer and cured her of her own fear of dogs – a promise that is a little disconcerting, given the ugly hostility of Kai and his alsatian. It’s all leading to the moment when Ruth goes for a shower in the shared facilities and hears noises coming from an adjacent stall. Oakley shuffles the timeline so that later in the film we appear to flash back to this moment whose import was apparently suppressed at the time, or maybe we are witnessing the way Ruth has re-imagined. Either way, the narrative disorientation is stylish. It’s a clever and expertly made movie; Oakley luxuriates in its winter chill."
"Two years after the death of the Icelandic film composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, his only movie as director has become available in the UK on streaming platforms. It is a 70-minute cine-novella or essay film: a meditation on humanity’s future and what it means, or will mean, to be post-human. The score is by Jóhannsson, working with sound artist and composer Yair Elazar Glotman, and this eerie, breathy soundtrack works well with its unearthly images. Last and First Men is inspired by the 1930 novel of the same name by British SF author William Olaf Stapledon, narrated by a figure from humanity’s final evolutionary form billions of years in the future. This voice is performed with crisp lack of affect by Tilda Swinton. The visual images Jóhannsson finds to accompany this prose-poem are strange and disturbing sculptures that look like something built on Earth by aliens, a mix of Stonehenge and Angkor Wat. I wondered if Jóhannsson had had them designed and built. In fact, these are the brutalist Spomeniks, the socialist-era monuments in former Yugoslavia, mostly in remote windswept landscapes, built in the 1950s and 60s to commemorate the tragedy of the war and the resistance to fascism; they are truly strange in their fierce, concrete giganticism, and have a cult following. By detaching them from their historical context, Jóhansson finds something very unsettling in these sculptures: they really do look like creations from the future, not the past. Last and First Men is an interesting if minor work, perhaps comparable to Nikolaus Geyrhalter’s Homo Sapiens or Michael Madsen’s Into Eternity."
"As we emerge blinking into the sunlight after lockdown, many of us will be daring to dream of a more harmonious, ecological future. It’s what the subjects of Spaceship Earth were hoping to create when they locked down voluntarily for two years as part of an experiment around communal, self-sufficient living. The new documentary tells the story of Biosphere 2, an Earth system science research facility located in the Arizona desert. Back in 1991, eight people moved into the huge vivarium as a dress rehearsal in case humans had to repopulate to Mars. Matt Wolf’s film is a fascinating watch that vividly recalls classic sci-fi cinema: the “biospherians” wear designer space suits and their mission references 1972’s Silent Running, in which a botanist astronaut tries to save a biosystem orbiting in space. It begs the question: what other lessons can we learn from sci-fi movies, post lockdown? In the past, many films have depicted a post-apocalyptic world where artificial communities have been created in an attempt to save at least some of the planet. But these are rarely truly happy places. In the family animation WALL-E (2008), lazy humans live on starliners, having trashed the Earth. A seemingly harmonious world conceals hidden horrors in Logan’s Run, the 1973 film with an upcoming remake. Utopias that turn dystopian are common in cinema, as noted by the novelist and critic Kim Newman: “The first act shows you everyone having a good time, but you notice the cracks. Then you learn how terrible things really are.” Many fictional future worlds are divided between rich and poor, such as Metropolis (1927) and Soylent Green (1973). Others can be threatened by one bad egg. Comic-book adaptations are full of these, from Loki in the Thor series to Killmonger in Black Panther. Wonder Woman’s Themyscira is disrupted by the arrival of men. More recently, the young adult genre has been dominated by pure dystopias: children were forced to hunt and kill each other in the Hunger Games series (2012-2015). The 2015 Disney film Tomorrowland struck a more optimistic note, depicting a secret world built by “all the geniuses, the artists, the scientists, the smartest, most creative people … in a place free from politics and bureaucracy, distractions, greed”. Brad Bird’s film directly addressed the subject of how we respond to dystopian images: inventor David Nix (Hugh Laurie) tried to warn humanity by broadcasting images of impending doom. “They didn’t fear their demise, they repackaged it!” he laments. “It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies – the entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse, and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.” But hopeful heroine Casey (Britt Robertson) still went in search of “dreamers” to build a better future. Such optimism is reminiscent of Spaceship Earth. Far from being stereotypical hippies, the members of this commune built a huge houseboat to travel the world, forging partnerships with likeminded financiers. They formed a theatre company and performed avant-garde shows. They wanted to see if self-sufficient life was possible on Mars, so they tried it – or at least, as close as they could get. Not everything in the garden was rosy, but at least it grew. The idea of a contained, peaceful community is prevalent in onscreen utopias. Newman describes these as being, “collectivist, contemplative … with tamed natural spaces”. Biospherian Mark Nelson, however, finds few of them are believable. “I and other biospherians would laugh, because in almost all science fiction movies, there are hardly any green plants or other lifeforms around – yet no one asks: ‘How are they getting their oxygen, water regeneration, clean food?’” Silent Running does emphasise the difference between fresh, locally grown food and bland, artificial meals, while Soylent Green takes the idea to a more sinister extreme. Meanwhile veganism – on the rise in real life – features in several onscreen utopias. Simon Amstell’s pointed TV mockumentary, Carnage, painted a picture of a harmonious, sustainable future where the only pain was the memory of their elders murdering animals. A plant-based diet also features in the cult French comedy La Belle Verte (The Green Beautiful, 1996). Writer-director Coline Serreau plays Mila, an alien from a utopian community who comes to 90s Paris and is comically horrified by the pollution, smoking, meat eating and overcrowding. La Belle Verte’s farcical humour eases into a strong message about a self-sufficient community with no leaders, where the days consist of strengthening acrobatic play and exercises in telepathy. All inhabitants work the land and agree on population control (“After the harvest, we decide how many babies to make”). It turns out that their lives used to look much like ours on Earth. I asked Jennifer Wells, a professor at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, and member-at-large of the Society of Utopian Studies, what she thought of La Grande Verte. “Serreau evokes a foreign utopian planet with ecological lifestyles, spiritual harmony, zero carbon technologies and equality,” she says. “This ideal society on a far-off planet may not be realisable – unless we are getting close to switching out cell phones for telepathy, and football for group ballet.” She adds: “What is realisable is the deeper questioning that comes up when Mila visits Earth. Through Mila’s hilarious escapades, we get a fresh view on how some of the things we accept as most normal are, in fact, in need of transformation.” This “fresh view” chimes with the lockdown experience: not only have more people started growing their own vegetables, but they have had the space to take a long look at their lives and the world – much like biospherians. Nelson says: “Since we experienced the metabolic connection we had to our mini-world so bodily and viscerally, when we came out, we were eager to share that insight – every human’s very life depends on Earth’s biosphere!” He sees clear parallels with the current crisis. “This pandemic lockdown can be a shock point for people to realise how vital a healthy biosphere is for them. Help make your city greener and less polluted; connect with your neighbours, your community, the trees, birds and natural elements around you.” Spaceship Earth’s director agrees. “In light of Covid-19, we have all been living like biospherians, and we are now re-entering a different world,” says Wolf. “The question is: how will we be transformed, and how might that compel us to reimagine our world?” Perhaps film-makers can inspire us. Jude Law has been cast as an architect building a utopia in Francis Ford Coppola’s long-planned Megalopolis, while screenwriter Caitlin Moran (How to Build a Girl) recently revealed she is writing “a cheerful utopian sci fi movie”. That’s something I’d welcome: La Belle Verte is the only sci-fi movie I have watched recently that didn’t give me nightmares. In fact, I woke energised and inspired. After the darkness, maybe a positive vision is what tomorrow’s dreamers need."
"The key tenet of Rhonda Byrne’s mystical self-help blockbuster The Secret is that if one desires and then really thinks about something hard enough then it will ultimately appear. If this tracks then somewhere, deep in America, one of the book’s many superfans has been close to bursting a blood vessel visualising a $20 rental of a once theatrically aimed movie adaptation, mood-boarding a costly night in with a middle-of-the-road sub-Nicholas Sparks pile of soap bubbles. It’s a frothy, forgettable translation of the hit book that takes its central belief system and uses it as the basis for a vaguely magical romantic drama for moms. It’s mostly kind of tolerable in a low stakes, rosé-wine-swigging way, inoffensively middling rather than rotten, an easy, undemanding afternoon watch with nothing of note other than a few laughably dumb moments. It stars Katie Holmes as Miranda, a widow caring for three kids while struggling to get by financially. Her life is an assemblage of “OK, sure” issues: she eats too much salt water taffy but can’t afford the root canal that follows, her daughter wants a computer but she can’t afford one for her birthday, her house isn’t storm-ready but she can’t afford to move etc, etc. The last thing Miranda needs is another problem that she can’t afford to fix so when she crashes into a car, it pushes her to breaking point. Luckily said car is being driven by friendly yet unintentionally creepy stranger Bray (Josh Lucas) who offers to fix it up for her and when a hurricane then hits the family home, he offers to fix that too. Bray’s outlook on life mirrors that of the source material but he also has a secret, that isn’t The Secret, which, as they always do in these movies, is about to change everyone’s lives forever. Working with a script that alternates poor, perfunctory dialogue with lazy, limited stereotypes, Holmes somehow manages to charm her way through the wreckage. She’s not always been an actor who’s shown a great deal of versatility or even basic capability (she was particularly awful in her other colonic film of the year Brahms: The Boy II) but she glides through this admirably, trying medium-hard to sell the repetitive issues her character comes up against. The problem she faces is that nothing here feels even remotely real, no character interacts with another in a way that seems believable, like it were written by an agoraphobe who hadn’t met a single soul for decades and instead based their view of humanity on Lifetime movies. Maybe some Hallmark ones too. No one expects gritty realism here but in order to sell both family drama and romance, there needs to be a bit more specificity, a bit more vibrancy, a world on screen that at least somewhat resembles the one we live in. Lucas is an oddly unsettling presence here, giving an insight into what a darker version of The Secret might look like. His intense blue-eyed stare and self-possessed perma-smile could be seamlessly transplanted into a recut trailer making the film look like a psycho-thriller. So while we’re not exactly clamoring for that kiss, given that we would fear for her family’s safety from then on, we soldier on anyway, buoyed by the basic half-pleasure of half-watching what’s essentially a daytime soap with a slightly improved budget. It’s also a bit like watching one of the many faith-based dramas that have hit in the last decade but, bar one use of the G word (when Lucas, *rolls eyes*, references an Einstein quote) it’s more spiritual than religious and if anything Buddhism is referenced more than Christianity. The Field of Dreams-adjacent “if you think it, it will happen” way of living treads a fine line between encouraging positivity and suggesting a rather dangerously removed fatalism, as if working hard isn’t merely as powerful as believing in a form of magic and the film never quite figures out where it lands here (a hilariously convoluted last act development involving a day-saving energy patent pushes it into wild fantasy). Director Andy Tennant, who has made a couple of decent films (Ever After, Hitch) and some genuinely God-awful ones (The Bounty Hunter, Fool’s Gold) does the bare minimum here and it’s only in the film’s bookending journeys to the universe, that he tries to give it the same scale as Byrne’s original text. The Secret has sold an estimated 30m copies worldwide but there’s no amount of dreamy thinking that will see its adaptation reaching even a fraction of that."
"If there was ever any doubt that Donald Trump would cement a campaign heralded by calling Mexicans rapists into policy, it was dispelled on 27 January 2017, when, to cap his first week in office, the president issued an executive order barring entrance from a slew of Muslim-majority countries. The so-called “Muslim travel ban” immediately roiled the country’s airports, as travelers were detained and families indefinitely separated in the midnight hours after the ban’s announcement. At the same time, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn; as depicted in early scenes from The Fight, a new documentary on the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a crowd cheered as lawyers got to messy, long-haul business of going to judicial war. Actor Kerry Washington, most recently of Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere and a producer on The Fight, watched on TV as the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants Rights Project, Lee Gelernt, exited the courthouse to chants of “ACLU! ACLU!” and declared a temporary victory: those detained by the new administration in airports would not be deported. Gelernt’s breathless recounting of the injunction’s relief had the feel of a post-championship court-side interview, and it caught Washington’s eye. “They are going to be on the frontlines of all the most important battles that we’re going to be facing to defend our civil rights and civil liberties,” she recalled thinking to the Guardian. “Who’s going to be in the trenches with these guys capturing this war movie that’s unfolding in front of us?” In the crowd at the Brooklyn courthouse that night was Elyse Steinberg, a documentary film-maker captivated by the same determined exhilaration on Gelernt’s face. “When Lee got his victory and he emerged from the steps and I saw him with his fists raised high,” she told the Guardian, “I just felt like this is the film that we needed to make. We needed to be with the ACLU and the lawyers in this epic battle for civil liberties that was going to be raging for the next four years.” In the three and half years since Steinberg stood outside the courthouse, the ACLU has held the legal line against the civil rights assaults of the Trump administration, work that The Fight depicts as variously harried and routine for the Manhattan-based team of lawyers and deeply consequential for the clients they represent. The Fight, co-directed by Steinberg, Josh Kriegman and Eli Despres follows four pivotal court cases central to combatting the Trump administration’s racist, Maga-exclusive agenda: the separation of migrant families at the southern US border and the horrific, indefinite detention of children without their parents; a policy which allowed the Office of Refugee Resettlement to deny abortion access to an undocumented woman detained by Ice; the addition of a citizenship question to the decennial US census; and the blanket ban of transgender people from serving in the US military. In each case, The Fight reveals the work of an ACLU attorney, particularly under an administration whose policies are often enacted without regard for bureaucratic chaos, to be mostly a scramble: hustling through briefs, cramming in a hotel room the night before argument, hungrily reading just-downloaded PDFs. The moments of mundane work dilemmas – Gelernt finding a single workable outlet at Starbucks to charge his dying phone, the LGBT & HIV project attorney Joshua Block fussing with uncooperative Microsoft Word dictation, the voting rights lawyer Dale Ho accidentally misreading a consequential decision or saying goodnight to his kids during another long day on the road – paint a fuller picture of the work. They take the ACLU staff “from being these larger than life Avengers legal superheroes, which is what they are, to also being husbands and wives and moms and dads, regular folks who have figured out how to use their talent for good in the world”, said Washington. The unglamorousness of the hustle, or of the reproductive rights lawyer Brigitte Amiri’s celebratory “train wine” on the Amtrak back to New York after a favorable hearing, contrast sharply with the stakes of the court cases at hand. “If I’m not going to be a civil rights lawyer right now, in this moment, then…when?” says Ho as he worked on a census decision which, had it been in favor of the administration, would have inaccurately skewed fair representation in Congress and federal funding for a decade to come. Amiri’s case – in which the federal government unlawfully barred an unidentified, undocumented asylum claimant for obtaining an abortion was “a harbinger of things to come”, she told the Guardian, as it preceded several states passing abortion restrictions or outright bans in 2019. The Trump era has rebranded the ACLU, founded in 1920 as a non-partisan defender of civil liberties, from the nation’s premier public-interest law firm into an explicitly progressive organization, a primary beneficiary of grassroots donations for the #resistance; the organization raised $79m from over a million donors between Trump’s election and February 2017. But the pivot has raised renewed questions about the organization’s ideological commitments; The Fight touches briefly on the group’s contentious history as ardent defenders of the first amendment, such as its famous defense of neo-Nazis’ right to march through downtown Skokie, Illinois, in the 1970s – a decision which set a half-century of precedent for free speech protections of protests, cost it thousands of members and raised questions about the lengths to which a blanket commitment to free speech withstood on-the-ground scrutiny. As the crew filmed, a state branch of the organization sued the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 to allow the white supremacist Unite the Right to be held downtown. The subsequent violence, in which a car plowed into a crowd of counter-demonstrators and killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, launched a reckoning for the ACLU. The filmmakers captured, in part, internal discussion to revise its free speech for all policy for those carrying weapons. The traumatic shadow of Charlottesville looms large, as does the grueling slog of the administration’s fourth year, but all three directors said the process of filming was ultimately hopeful. The film, said Washington, is a reminder that even given Covid-19 circumstances, which has rendered some of the scarring conflicts of just two years ago unfathomably distant, “the fight is possible, it’s happening” and viewers can “get in the fight by filling out your census”. “Fill out your census and vote and show up – donate your time, donate your money, be part of the solution at a time when it’s truly needed,” she added. The work on the ground continues: if the census question felt like incredibly high stakes in 2019, then opposing the suppressive chaos of elections in a pandemic (such as the massively curtailed polling locations, especially in majority-black areas, in the Georgia and Wisconsin primary elections) feels like “an everything-is-on-the-line moment”, Ho told the Guardian, “because if people don’t feel safe voting in November, we’re not going to have a free and fair election”. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure people can vote safely and no one feels like they have to make a choice between protecting their health and exercising their right to vote,” Ho said, a pandemic update on the mantra of relentlessness offered by Amiri in the film: “All I’ve ever known how to do was fight and so we just keep fighting,” she says, knee deep in the scramble to maintain reproductive rights access for the most marginalized in America. “And even though we’re tired and even though it’s exhausting and it’s maddening, it’s what we do.”"
"‘This place is a lunatic asylum!” says the square-jawed, peroxide-blond hero of Mike Hodges’ bizarre LSD pantomime Flash Gordon, adapted by Lorenzo Semple Jr and Michael Allin from the 1930s comic-strip serial – now rereleased on streaming platforms for its 40th anniversary. It now looks even madder and more expressionist than ever, with an operatic theme from Queen, bizarre 2D studio sets for alien planets and the kind of eyeball-frazzling colour scheme that generally only existed on old TVs of the era before you had to thump them. Sam J Jones plays the Earthling American football star Flash Gordon (“Flash” appears to be his actual name, rather than nickname) who finds himself caught up in an intergalactic war when the evil Ming the Merciless (a dapper, derisive and weirdly ageless performance from Max von Sydow) launches an attack on Planet Earth. Swept along for this titanic battle is comely Dale Arden (Melody Anderson), who soon melts prettily into Flash’s arms, and a bumptious scientist called Hans Zarkov, played by Topol, who has a funny scene when his entire life flashes before his eyes. They must somehow incite the various outer-space princelings under Ming’s tyranny to unite and rebel – truly exotic turns by Brian Blessed, wearing a very brief pair of leather pants to play the Wagnerian Prince Vultan, and Timothy Dalton, sporting an outrageously soigné moustache as Prince Barin, one of a strange forest people whose manhood initiation ceremony sounds from afar like sex, and whose high priest is played, surreally, by the playwright John Osborne. (A personal friend of the director, and who famously played the villain in Hodges’ great debut, Get Carter.) Hodges’ Flash Gordon, like Star Wars, was inspired by the old Saturday-morning movie shows and bears an obvious resemblance to the George Lucas flms, as well as, oddly, to The Wizard of Oz, and maybe even more oddly, to John Boorman films such as Zardoz. The film has a fondness for harems of attractive young women wafting about in a negligéed-state of semi-undress that is not dissimilar to Carry On films, though the robust Flash himself looks occasionally like someone drawn by the great homoerotic artist Tom of Finland. With the dizzying high-speed montage of Flash Gordon comic strip frames that starts the film, Hodges can claim to have inspired the signature images that begin every 21st-century Marvel movie. Perhaps, like many a superhero film, this one flags just a little in the final battle sequences, but Von Sydow is always there to keep things bizarre, playing it absolutely straight."
"Proxima is the name of an international space mission of the future. That’s evidently ironic, given that the astronauts are getting alienated from each other and their families. Yet irony is not exactly the point of this well-acted but disconcertingly anticlimactic movie from director and co-writer Alice Winocour. With its eerie, sterile world, in which men and women in their physical prime prepare for takeoff and share unisex changing facilities at the training centre, the film seems to promise high anxiety along with white-knuckle sexual tension and shocks. But it ends up as a dull, even trite tribute to the professionalism of real-life astronauts who must endure heartaching separation from their kids. Eva Green plays Sarah, a French astronaut fluent in English, German and Russian, thrilled to get picked for the spaceshot to Mars alongside the friendly Russian cosmonaut Anton (Alexsey Fateev) and macho American Mike (Matt Dillon), a most boorish sexist, dead set on undermining her. She is furthermore upset to be apart from her little daughter, Stella (Zélie Boulant), and she has a complicated relationship with her ex-partner, Thomas (Lars Eidinger). At first, it seems as if something scary and startling is just around the corner, with Sarah apparently buckling under the psychological strain of the tough training programme. She is nursing a strange, infected skin wound and being abused and bullied by the noxious Mike. What is all this leading to? These days, Dillon is very good at conveying bland menace (it’s how he was cast in Lars von Trier’s gruesome The House That Jack Built), and Eidinger is associated with challenging dark performances. So it is disappointing that the story leads to nothing more than a rather sentimental and implausible set piece concerning security, quarantine and the mother-daughter bond. "
"The first big Indian release of 2020 to divert towards streaming is an offbeam, strangely mismanaged parable about property management that renders its stars all but unrecognisable. The established Amitabh Bachchan is buried beneath old-age latex and thick-lensed glasses; emergent pin-up Ayushmann Khurrana is weighed down by a (presumably prosthetic) middle-aged spread. However director Shoojit Sircar’s gaze keeps drifting beyond them, to a location you couldn’t make-under: a mildewing Lucknow mansion house, lorded over by Bachchan’s shuffling miser Mirza, ever looking for ways to kick Khurrana’s collected waifs-and-strays to the kerb. The curious, altogether tentative drama that ensues may be as close as any film-maker has come to signing off on a Hindi redo of TV’s Rising Damp. Alas, it’s also one of those cases where forced idiosyncrasy tries the patience from an early stage. With 2015’s sharp, breezy Piku and 2018’s delicate but involving October, Sircar had nudged Indian commercial cinema in a rewarding, naturalistic direction; but this just feels like a strain. A laboured first half scopes out the characters’ dingy surrounds without threatening to go anywhere, and feet are apparently being dragged because Sircar and generally reliable screenwriter Juhi Chaturvedi aren’t themselves sure which direction to move in. Brakes are soon applied to the mounting narrative of landlord-tenant class war – “Parasite!”, yells Mirza, reminding us of a more decisive film on a similar subject – in favour of a softer landing as both antagonists fall prey to creeping gentrification. While the supporting cast successfully suggest a bustling, mutually sustaining community, the stars come to seem like liabilities, which wasn’t the case with Sircar’s previous films. Bachchan works hard at his swaddled meanie character, but make-up and props are doing most of the work, work that ultimately serves to distance actor from audience. A tired-seeming Khurrana, meanwhile, presents as blandly anonymous, reducing a final push for pathos to a limp shrug. Everyone appears at the mercy of shaky narrative foundations; even a cursory survey would suggest that whatever happened on this story’s journey to the screen, vital elements just didn’t take. You watch puzzled as – like the ageing pile at the story’s centre – the film flakes, moulders and crumbles before you."
"As UK Black Lives Matter protests roar, and the foulness of the Windrush scandal festers, it is a crucial time to dive into black British history. “Historic” certainly describes the first ever black British feature film: Horace Ové’s Pressure, an absorbing 1976 drama about the everyday struggles of a London-born son (Herbert Norville) of Trinidadian parents. Amazon Prime Video/BFI Player (£) This riveting and uncompromising documentary from 1978 features a host of black British civil rights activists describing and crisply critiquing institutional and everyday racism across the country in the 1970s. Made by American film-makers, it was severely re-edited for US television, and proved too hot to handle for the UK, where it wasn’t broadcast at all. BFI Player (£)/ YouTube Featuring one of the all-time great soundtracks, the amazingly atmospheric Babylon (1980) follows young London soundsystem MC Blue (Brinsley Forde, singer with landmark British reggae group Aswad) as he pursues his musical ambitions while battling against the racism and xenophobia of police, employers, neighbours and the National Front. Amazon (£) UK Jamaican dancehall culture got its big-screen moment in Julian Henriques’s vibrant 1998 musical drama. Anjela Lauren Smith plays aspiring singer Anita, raising two kids on a north-west London estate with the help of her mother Edith (Corinne Skinner-Carter, who starred in another great female-centric black British film, 1981’s Burning an Illusion). BFI Player/DVD A host of brilliant, experimental, black film-making collectives emerged in the 1980s, including Ceddo, Sankofa and Black Audio Film Collective, whose 1986 breakthrough Handsworth Songs was a dynamic document of the civil unrest that swept across the country in 1985. Although it has sometimes been frustratingly tricky to track down over the years, it’s an essential, ever-relevant work. Streaming on Lisson Gallery website to 21 June Campbell X’s 2012 feature debut is a fresh, sexy and funny comedy-drama about LGBTQ+ life in east London, boasting a great turn from T’Nia Miller as JJ, a butch photographer who is popular with the ladies. X is in a lineage of black British queer-themed cinema that includes film-makers Topher Campbell and Isaac Julien. Amazon/BFI Player (£) Morgan Quaintance’s brilliant, unclassifiable 2018 short is a playful yet serious visual mixtape of black 90s culture and beyond. Quaintance is one of a number of exciting new artists (see also: Jay Bernard, Onyeka Igwe, Rabz Lansiquot) who make innovative use of archival footage to question traditional, established national histories. Vimeo (£) The 2013 second feature by Amma Asante is a compelling and necessary riposte to the overwhelmingly white period drama genre. In a star-making turn, Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays the real-life 18th-century figure Dido Elizabeth Belle, the mixed-race daughter of a British naval officer and an enslaved African woman. Amazon/YouTube (£) The only foray into feature film-making by playwright Debbie Tucker Green is a haunting 2014 portrait of a London couple, Jax (Nadine Marshall) and Mark (Idris Elba), whose lives are turned upside down when she inexplicably falls pregnant. British films about black family life are dismayingly rare, and this is one of the very best.

"Like many, I began lockdown by bingeing on Tiger King, which remains one of the most extraordinary pieces of TV I’ve ever seen – although I’ve become disenchanted with the, ahem, lionisation of it since, particularly the reflexive mass-hatred of the only significant woman in it. Nonetheless, it’s a hilariously disturbing portrait of just how wrong a self-enclosed world can go. I haven’t watched many films. I saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which felt from another era. By which I mean, not the 1960s but from when it was made, pre-coronavirus – Tarantino’s retro worldview may now itself be retro. I also watched the extraordinary 2015 documentary about North Korea, Under the Sun, by the Russian film-maker Vitaly Mansky [now on Amazon Prime Video]. The film’s power comes from simply letting the camera run between scenes, thus showing the way the state handlers cack-handedly try and manufacture those scenes. It is intensely slow, but hilarious and heartbreaking. I liked the BBC Two series Devs. God’s Dice, a play I wrote that was on in London last autumn, was born out of a sense of the miraculousness of quantum physics and its strange relationship to religion, and Devs touches on much of the same material. As someone obsessed in an extremely lay way with quantum physics, I was impressed by how much science Alex Garland managed to fit around the drama. I’m a sucker for a corporate tech thriller that can throw in – and not just in a “just make it sound impressive” way – many-worlds interpretation and the double-slit experiment. But the big winner in our house has been Bojack Horseman. We’ve always been animation fans – Morwenna [Banks, Baddiel’s wife] is, of course, the voice of Mummy Pig in Peppa Pig – and one of the reasons I write kids’ books is that kids have much better senses of humour than they used to: a generation of children raised on The Simpsons and The Amazing World of Gumball can now appreciate proper funny at a much earlier age than those who were reared on The Magic Roundabout. But Bojack isn’t for kids (although I was introduced to it by my teenage son). It’s a meticulously written, at once cynical and heartfelt, long-form comic saga about the emptiness of fame and the impossibility of connection in a world of surfaces, all channelled through a horse who was a big sitcom star in the 90s. It confirms something I’ve thought for a very long time, which is that the greatest expression of TV and film as an art form is now happening in animation. Which, given that live-action actors are going to find it hard interacting on camera in the foreseeable future, may be no bad thing."
"The Argentinian thriller Intuition begins where most thrillers end. Renegade detective Francisco Juanez (Joaquín Furriel) is dragging his skeptical colleagues deep into a dark forest where he believes a serial kidnapper of young girls will be. He’s following his, ahem, intuition, despite the recommendations of those around him. Juanez is an almost parody-level embodiment of the type that has propped up the crime genre, the type who burns the rule book, before chucking the ashes out of the window of a fast-moving car while smoldering directly at the camera. But as his fellow cops roll their eyes at his latest antics, he proves them wrong yet again by leading them directly to the bad guy while saving the only surviving captive in a dramatic shootout. But credits don’t roll and instead the film, from writer-director Alejandro Montiel, splinters off into two new cases. The schlocky nature of Montiel’s opening sequence (a solid 30% of the budget was clearly spent on a fog machine) tips us off as viewers what territory we’re in for the next two hours. Intuition is like a dog-eared 90s potboiler you read on the beach, half-vaguely invested but also half-waiting for something better to do with your day. It’s adding nothing new to a genre that’s already overstuffed, thanks in large part to serial overstuffers Netflix, the platform it’s premiering on, and rather than feeling like a shiny new original movie, it’s more reminiscent of a few stitched-together episodes of a small-screen procedural series. This week on Intuition, maverick Juanez leaves one investigation and heads straight into another – this time it’s the murder of a spoilt society girl. He’s working with rookie Manuela “Pipa” Pelari (Luisana Lopilato) who has also been asked by her superior to investigate Juanez over any involvement he might have had in the death of a local youth who killed Juanez’s wife. What’s most surprising about Intuition is that the three cases don’t really have much connective tissue, other than the characters investigating them, making it feel like you’ve just started watching a show mid-season. The film is in fact a prequel to 2018 thriller Perdida, also directed by Montiel. It’s a plodding watch, not uninteresting, exactly, but missing a jolt of energy or something original enough to justify its existence. The character of Juanez is such an unintentionally comic creation that what Montiel might think is mysterious ultimately comes off as silly. He’s styled like a male model mid-shoot, and he breaks just so many rules that he swiftly transforms from handsome rebel to smug bore, doing everyone’s job way better than they could ever manage. The dynamic between him and his younger colleague is both cat and mouse as well as teacher and student, but the sparks don’t really fly despite a committed performance from Lopilato, whose story continues in Perdida. What propels us past the cliches of Intuition is a desire to see just how it all ties together, an assumption that a story as busily plotted as this must have an ace up its sleeve. But the last act is all fizzle, played out predictably with a mundanity that no amount of sweeping aerial shots can disguise. There’s no remarkable reveal to make the previous two hours feel like time well spent, just a shrug of an ending instead. Hardcore crime fans are the prime audience, but they’re already heavily catered to elsewhere by writers with far more ingenuity. This is everything they’ve seen before."
"Director Andrew Patterson works low-budget wonders in his audacious feature debut, a 50s-set oddity that won the audience prize at last year’s Slamdance festival and was recently programmed for some socially distanced drive-in screenings in the US, doubtless adding a fittingly retro feel. Paying homage to a bygone era of television serials and sci-fi B-movies, the eerie night-time action– which plays out in close to real time – is lent a cutting-edge modernity by carefully choreographed kinetic camerawork that takes the breath away. Yet for all its sinewy visual panache, this theatrically wordy drama (from a screenplay by James Montague and Craig W Sanger) is at heart a radio play with pictures, pitched somewhere between Orson Welles’s infamous The War of the Worlds broadcast of the 30s, and the Wolfman Jack backdrop to George Lucas’s nostalgic 60s throwback masterpiece American Graffiti. It’s basketball night in the small New Mexico town of Cayuga, which like the rest of the US is gripped with tales of Soviet infiltration and extraterrestrial visitation. Fast-talking, savvy teen Everett (Jake Horowitz) is helping to set up the game’s recording equipment before heading over to local station WOTW (note the HG Wellsian initials) to present his radio show. Alongside him is Fay (Sierra McCormick), a bespectacled science enthusiast who works at the telephone exchange and is eager to experiment with her newly acquired reel-to-reel recorder. At their respective places of work, both hear a strange thrumming noise that seems to break through the ether into the airwaves. Meanwhile, reports of “something in the skies” coincide with mysterious calls offering bizarre explanations for the disturbances. Is Cayuga the subject of a foreign invasion? What have the US government been hiding all these years? And are our young heroes on the brink of a close encounter? Framed as an episode of a TV show called Paradox Theater, a Rod Serling-style black-and-white series that invites viewers to enter “a realm between clandestine and forgotten”, The Vast of Night is filled with alienating devices that seem designed to keep the audience at a distance. Indeed the breathless opening sequence, in which the cinematographer Miguel I Littin-Menz’s camera chases our protagonists through halls, car parks and streets, occasionally threatens to lose us altogether – leaving us running to catch up with Everett and Fay, struggling to comprehend their rapid-fire conversation. Later, an audacious extended shot (the creation of which recalls the DIY inventiveness of Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead) takes us all the way across town, brilliantly establishing the geography of this drama while simultaneously dazzling us with the sheer head-spinning logistics of its trajectory. Yet it’s in the moments that the camera comes to a halt, or the film appears to close its eyes (Patterson isn’t afraid of blackouts), that The Vast of Night casts its most mesmerising spell. Whether it’s Fay holding multiple conversations while operating the patch-board of the telephone exchange, or the enigmatic Mabel Blanche (Gale Cronauer – terrific) recounting her own story-within-the-story, Patterson and his talented crew know when to run, and when to just sit still. Citing Yann Demange’s underrated Belfast thriller ’71 as an immersive inspiration (alongside Gaspar Noé’s Irréversible), Patterson litters this increasingly dizzying mystery with playful nods to classic sci-fi chillers like Don Siegel’s 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Yet as with so many of its genre predecessors, beneath the surface lurks a socioeconomic subtext. It’s significant that the only people who seem to know what’s really going on in Cayuga are exactly the type that no one in this small-town world takes seriously: belittled women, African American men, callers to a late-night radio talkshow. And while ultra-confident Everett may be the man of the moment, achieving the velocity needed to escape his roots, it’s Fay who is clearly the smartest character on screen, although she dismisses the suggestion that she too could break free, clearly aware that opportunities are not equal. At times, as key characters attempt to tune in to baffling recorded noises, I was reminded of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, a masterful exercise in overheard anxiety and projected paranoia. Like that film, The Vast of Night (which boasts inventive music and sound design) wants its audience to lean forward in their seats; to look that little bit deeper, listen just a little more closely. That a film with such an apparently familiar narrative can keep us this intrigued is a credit to the film-makers – particularly Patterson, from whom we should expect to hear much more in the future."
"The internet tells us that Sonic the Hedgehog can run at 362mph. In the film Sonic the Hedgehog, the eponymous hero has to travel from Montana to San Francisco, a distance of 1,200 miles. By rights, the film should be a maximum of three and a half hours in length. But no. Thanks to a tranquilliser-based misunderstanding in which he is mistaken for a racoon, Sonic the Hedgehog is temporarily immobilised and has to be driven the distance in a Toyota pickup truck. During this time, drunk hoodlums attempt to beat him to death and the truck is blown up by exploding drones. Sometimes it’s safer on foot. Kurt Russell plays a stuntman who likes to murder groups of young women by driving at them full speed in his reinforced car. Three young women drive home from a bar, too busy dancing to a middle-aged man’s idea of what music young women like to notice that a car is barrelling towards them with its headlights off. They all die in horrible ways. A leg flies off. A skull is graphically crushed by a wheel. It is thoroughly unpleasant, and a stark warning that you should never give the come-on to psychopathic stuntmen you meet in pubs. Admittedly, cars only make up a portion of this film – but they are arguably the most entertaining parts. First, John Candy drives the wrong way down a freeway, then he accidentally sets the car on fire, and, finally, the vehicle is impounded and the pair must travel the rest of the distance in a refrigerated truck. It’s no trip to Barnard Castle, but it’s still pretty bad. In which Michael Caine’s band of ragtag robbers pull off one of the most audacious high-speed getaways in all of cinema history, only to underestimate the turning capabilities of a heavy coach and bugger it up on the Nivolet Pass. The finale – in which the coach teeters on the edge of the mountainside road, loot just out of reach – is an important lesson. After an ill-advised and illegal car trip that risks provoking the anger of a nation, should you choose survival or greed? It is becoming evidently clear that you cannot have both. Stephen King’s only directorial credit – largely because, in his own words, “I was coked out of my mind all through its production, and I really didn’t know what I was doing” – is a horror movie about inanimate objects that come to life, maybe because of aliens or something. We meet a newlywed couple – one of whom is played by Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson – as they embark on a honeymoon road trip. However, they are soon set upon by a bunch of unmanned lorries that only stop when Pat Hingle, from Splendor in the Grass, blows them up with a rocket launcher. Did I mention that cocaine was a factor in the production of this film? Now, the entire Fast & Furious oeuvre is filled with poor automotive decisions – examples include the time when they were all flipped into the air by a surfacing submarine; the time they raced a military drone through a tunnel; and the time they drove out of the middle of a skyscraper, flew through the air and went into the middle of another skyscraper. But nothing beats the trip on the runway at the end of the sixth instalment. The crew has to chase a speeding plane before it takes off, and there is a fistfight and everything explodes. The scene lasts for 10 minutes; science has determined that the runway was 20 miles long. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi play two blood brothers who embark on a mission from God to save the orphanage in which they were raised. The police are in hot pursuit, there are Nazis on their trail and a mysterious woman keeps trying to murder them. As Elwood (Aykroyd) memorably says in the film: “There’s 266 miles to Durham, we’ve got a full tank of gas, a four-year-old in the back, the country’s under lockdown and I can’t bloody see anything.” No, wait, that’s not right. All Tom Hardy wants to do is drive from Birmingham to London. However, this trip of a lifetime is put in jeopardy by a number of phonecalls from friends and associates. Some wonder why he has abandoned the largest concrete pour ever to be seen in all of Europe. Others wonder why he has abandoned his entire family. It’s a wonderful, self-contained film that remains a career highlight for both Hardy and writer/director Steven Knight, but the reason for the trip is slightly underwhelming. Perhaps if Hardy had just wanted to go and look at some bluebells in a wood with his family, it would have had a bit more dramatic heft. Katrina Bowden from 30 Rock plays a pop star who is given a sentient car as a gift. But during an off-road trip through the middle of nowhere, the car suddenly goes wrong. By “goes wrong”, I mean that she locks herself out for so long that she is eventually attacked by coyotes. That’s right, this is an entire film about all the things that happen when a woman loses her car keys. An entire film. Imagine.  An almost perfect road trip comedy, National Lampoon’s Vacation manages to fold no end of horrors in to its plot. During a cross-country holiday, the Griswold family crash, get ripped off, are vandalised, murder a dog, drive a human corpse around strapped to their roof and hold an entire amusement park as their armed hostages. And still, after all this, Clark Griswold refused to resign from his job as the prime minister’s special adviser. A cult classic and a favourite of Steven Spielberg, the film sees an enigmatic car delivery driver named Kowalski embark on a Benzedrine-fuelled race to drive a Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco. The police chase him. He runs another driver off the road, fights off some armed hitchhikers, and then fatally injures himself by driving into a bulldozer at top speed. The reason for any of this is never made clear. Perhaps he wanted to visit his parents’ house before the press found out. This might be the definitive road trip film, where mishap after mishap is piled up until all is lost. There is an attempted rape. A murder. Theft. Kidnapping. Wilful destruction. And, in the end, suicide. All in all, it’s arguably one of the most catastrophic road trips to ever happen – until, that is, about six weeks ago. As such, it isn’t very interesting or timely at all and Dominic Cummings definitely shouldn’t watch it. Steven Spielberg’s feature debut is essentially a prototypical Jaws; a harried driver just wants to peacefully travel from A to B, but his efforts are thwarted by a truck intent on terrorising him. The scariest thing about Duel is that we never know the truck driver’s motives, let alone actually see him. Is this a personal vendetta, planned long in advance? Did he choose this car at random? Could this be the first time he has ever attempted this, or is he a habitual antagonist? Might it be that he just wanted to check his eyesight on a road trip and didn’t even see the car? We may never know."
"Twenty years ago, director Dominik Moll made a splash at Cannes with his black-comic psychological shocker Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien, starring the incomparably disturbing Sergi López – a film with the kind of delicious cruelty and sophistication that somehow only the French can produce. Its title over here was inelegantly rendered as Harry, He’s Here to Help, although I made a doomed attempt to popularise my own version: Harry Wants to Be Your Friend. After that, Moll had a number of credits, but nothing to live up to that picture, which promised us a film-maker with the style of Claude Chabrol. But now Moll has given us this audacious, witty and absorbing mystery thriller, a tale of adultery and amour fou with a gamey touch of the macabre – adapted by Moll and his longtime collaborator Gilles Marchand from the novel Seules Les Bêtes by Colin Niel. It is about five people and their relationship with a sixth person who is to meet a terrifying, arbitrary fate. The movie introduces us in turn to these six overlapping lives, with ingenious point-of-view shifts that will explain an apparent oddity or anomaly in the previous scene and set us up for a rug-pull in the next, letting us in on a secret, then coolly pushing us away. The unhappy woman at the centre of this spider’s web is the wealthy and married Evelyne Ducat, whose business takes her to Sète in the south of France but whose lifestyle leaves her emotionally unsatisfied. She is played by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, and she has a great moment that requires her to give a feline smile of panicky, thin-lipped irritation at a lover, before unleashing the vengeful, petulant slap that is to seal her fate. Near where Evelyne lives is a farm run by the morose Michel, terrifically played by veteran French character actor Denis Ménochet, a man radiating unhappiness, made grizzled and careworn by hard work, and the strain of keeping secrets. His wife, Alice, played with poignant emotional hurt by Laure Calamy (known for the Netflix TV comedy Call My Agent), is acquainted with nearby farmer Joseph (Damien Bonnard), a reclusive, difficult man, going through an emotional breakdown following the death of his adored mother. Then there is the beautiful, willowy Marion, played by Nadia Tereszkiewicz, who waits tables in Sète. Most mysteriously of all there is Armand, a young guy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, whom we see at the very beginning, cycling somewhere with a goat on his back – a sacrificial goat, perhaps? He is on his way to a local gang boss, Papa Sanou (Christian Ezan), who exerts a voodoo-ish influence and sums up the film’s philosophy by telling Armand: “Chance is stronger than you, idiot!” Poor Armand yearns to be rich and is still in love with a young woman who is the mother of his child but is now with a wealthy European. Armand talks about a “colonial debt”. These people provide the film’s constituent parts, which interlock like the workings of an intricate and malign musical box, creating dashes of melodrama, erotic obsession and even soap opera, and all superbly performed. In a way, each of these people occupies a short story, an individual mini-film, but they all find themselves in the Venn-diagram overlap of fate, and their lives are made to dovetail like the films of Kieslowski’s Three Colours sequence of 1993-94, or Lucas Belvaux’s Trilogie of 2002. The words … Are Happy could go on the end of this film’s title. It is about human beings who are yearning desperately for something they don’t or can’t have – and are bashing at the prison bars of their own loneliness. The gnomic Papa Sanou says something else to the point: “Love is giving what you don’t have.” For many of these people love is about making demands, about trying to get the best of the bargain, or about trying to escape from a terrible bargain about their life’s direction that they don’t remember taking. They want to take love and have nothing to give in return."
"Another year, another vibrant Sydney film festival program, full of exciting titles procured from around the world, which will screen at various cinemas across the ci- … no, wait, let’s start again. For reasons that are now obvious to all and sundry – starts with “C”, ends with “19”, involves avoiding crowds – the Sydney film festival will, for the first time in its 67-year history, not screen any films at physical venues and instead run a slimmed-down program exhibited entirely online, from 10 to 21 June. There’s also a “Sydney film festival selects” partnership with SBS on Demand, running from 10 June to 10 July, screening various titles that have appeared on previous programs – not dissimilar to one of those “best of” TV compilation episodes. The first thing one notices about this year’s program is just how slim it is. No big names; no marquee titles; no famous international actors; no rabbits pulled out of a hat. Putting together a vibrant program is difficult at the best of times, requiring all sorts of behind-the-scenes wrangling and manoeuvring the public is never privy to, and there’s no doubt that challenge increases ten or a hundred fold during these, as is often repeated, difficult times. The scant program is a reminder that organising physical screenings at a world-renowned festival is one thing, and organising online events for the same organisation is quite another. Perhaps it’s a minor miracle the SFF team came up with anything at all. The four core strands in 2020’s SFF-lite edition are: Australian documentaries (comprising 10 feature docos), Europe: Voices of Women in Film (seven feature films and three feature docos), Screenability (three short films) and Australian short films (10 shorts). Here are five films I’m looking forward to. Scholar and film-maker Tom Murray’s documentary includes the final film appearance of the late Balang T Lewis (otherwise known as Tom E Lewis), who died in 2018. It is an exploration of the life of Douglas Grant, an Indigenous Australian activist and veteran whose jam-packed life includes fighting in the first world war on the frontline in France, where he was captured by Germans. The Germans were “very curious about Douglas” due to “his dark complexion, history as an Aboriginal man educated in a white society, and even his ability to put on a Scottish accent,” according to a biography published on the Australian War Memorial website. The Skin of Others is a feature-length extension of an ABC audio production and a 2018 short film available to watch on the Guardian. The difficult and confronting question of what the world will look like for the children of today, in a climate-devastated future, has been explored before and remains perhaps the most pertinent question of current times. Director Kathy Drayton takes an interesting approach to the subject in The Weather Diaries, which was filmed over six years and follows her daughter Imogen as she progresses from childhood to adulthood, while studying the effects the climate crisis has had on her life. Nominated for the Grand Jury prize at this year’s Sundance film festival, Swedish filmmaker Amanda Kernell’s sophomore feature poses an intriguing question: what if a mother abducted her own children? Losing hope that she will win a custody battle, Alice (Ane Dahl Torp) runs off with her two children and takes them to Spain. This character-oriented drama pivots around the relationship between Alice and her children, reportedly offering a multifaceted exploration of motherhood. Danish actor-turned-director Malou Reymann loosely based her drama A Perfectly Normal Family on her own experiences, having grown up with a father who embarked upon gender transition when she was 11. A Perfectly Normal Family is based in the 1990s and told from the point of view of a daughter, Emma (Kaya Toft Loholt). Emma’s mother Helle (Neel Rønholt) announces that she and her husband Thomas (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard) are getting a divorce “because Dad wants to be a woman”. Playing the transwoman in question, Følsgaard, according to a review published on Variety, “avoids the usual pitfalls … rejecting an artificial performance of femininity”. And now for something completely different: a sci-fi horror/thriller about a giant jellyfish that wreaks havoc on a fishing trawler! Mining a deep vein of genre influences, which inevitably can be traced back to the mother of them all, Jaws, the feature film debut of writer/director Neasa Hardiman evokes some ye olde terror on the seas. A marine biologist doctorate candidate, Siobhan (Hermione Corfield), joins the trawler crew to get first-hand knowledge for her thesis – although by the sounds of things she will come to regret not hunkering down in a lab somewhere, examining test tubes. Fun frivolity on board the fishing vessel ensue. And by “fun and frivolity” I of course mean chaos, infections, death and terrible terrible pain."
"It’s bold of Lily Collins, daughter of Phil Collins, to star in a psychological thriller called Inheritance. She stars as Lauren Monroe, dynasty scion and – despite looking all of 12 years old – the district attorney for Manhattan. Gossip Girl’s Chace Crawford plays her congressional candidate brother, giving the early scenes a Boss Baby feel, as these two stomp around town dishing out orders with zero personal authority. Adorable. When their tycoon father dies (Patrick Warburton, AKA Puddy from Seinfeld – also glaringly miscast), Lauren is shafted out of her fair share of his millions and instead bequeathed a secret bunker on the family grounds. This might have been valuable New York real estate, were it not for the mysterious man (Simon Pegg in a comically dishevelled wig) who has been kept prisoner there for decades. The characters are paper-thin and, even on paper, their motivations don’t make much sense. Thus liberated from the constraints of plausible human behaviour, you’d hope for Inheritance to have fun with preposterous plotting. There are shots of a chess board with scattered pieces (movie shorthand for brilliant-but-disordered minds) and some frantic cross-cutting, but otherwise it’s well into the film’s final third before anything resembling action occurs. And that long-telegraphed twist, when it comes, is hardly worth the wait. In the meantime, we, too, are left to moulder in the bunker, as Lauren, apparently lacking even basic investigative skills – sorry, how did she get to be DA again? – tries and fails to discover the identity of her inherited prisoner. Hopefully Pegg’s wig negotiated a percentage of the backend. It’s doing the most work here to keep us entertained.  Inheritance is available on digital platforms from 6 July and on DVD on 13 July. "
"The UK cinema industry is on track for its worst year since 1996, with box office and advertising revenue set to be down almost £900m due to the impact of Covid-19. The government has given the green light for cinemas in England to reopen from 4 July – with safety measures including two-seat spacing and a ban on self-serve pick ’n’ mix – and operators are desperate to salvage something from this annus horribilis. Cinema owners had been banking on Hollywood blockbusters in the form of Disney’s Mulan and Christopher Nolan’s latest sc-fi Tenet later this month to reignite their year. However, they were dealt a blow at the end of last week when the premieres of both films were pushed back yet again, to 12 and 21 August respectively, further delaying what is already expected to be a slow recovery. With a schedule devoid of new Hollywood blockbusters, cinema operators are initially having to fall back on low-grossing launch schedules filled mostly with classics and old hits such as Casablanca, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, the Empire Strikes Back and franchises including Harry Potter, Twilight and Fast and Furious. The smattering of newer fare includes such pre-Covid shutdown hits as 1917 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The UK box office is forecast to fall by 58% this year, from £1.25bn in 2019 to £525m. This would be the lowest sum since 1996, when Independence Day finished first in a top 10 that included Mission: Impossible, Twister and Trainspotting. That year the UK box office totalled £450m. Cinema owners have also been deprived of months of advertising revenues. UK cinema revenues had been forecast to grow by a healthy 9% this year, to £249m. Group M, the media division of WPP, now says cinema advertising will more than halve from 2019’s level to £114m."
"Unusually in this year of shuttered cinemas, Sam Neill is the star of a No 1 box-office smash. The film in question, Jurassic Park, was first released in 1993, and has played exclusively at drive-in cinemas this year, but a chart-topper is a chart-topper. “Isn’t that funny?” says the 72-year-old, stroking his impressive white beard and speaking via Zoom from Sydney, where he has been holed up throughout lockdown with his girlfriend, the political TV journalist Laura Tingle, far from his own home in New Zealand. “And here’s the other thing I discovered,” he continues. “Which Australian film of mine do you think is the most successful in terms of box office?” Perhaps it was My Brilliant Career, the 1979 period drama that inspired James Mason to pay Neill’s way to the UK to boost his prospects. It worked, by the way: Neill, who was born in Northern Ireland but had been living in New Zealand since he was seven, won the lead in the third Omen movie, The Final Conflict, where he played the son of Satan as if he were the loneliest man in the world. Or maybe his biggest Australian money-spinner was A Cry in the Dark, in which he and Meryl Streep did some of their fiercest work as the real-life couple falsely accused of killing their own baby and blaming it on dingoes. There was Aussie money, too, in Jane Campion’s Oscar-winning The Piano, featuring Neill as a cuckolded colonialist. But no: each of these, he reveals, was roundly trounced at the box office by Peter Rabbit, a US-Australian co-production, in which Neill wore a fat-suit to play a curmudgeonly farmer. “I wouldn’t have guessed myself,” he says, eyes twinkling with mischief. We are speaking a few days after the streaming release of his latest film, Ride Like a Girl, in which he plays the New Zealand horse-trainer Paddy Payne, whose daughter, the jockey Michelle Payne, became the first – and, to date, only – woman to win the Melbourne Cup. “Michelle is an extraordinarily courageous young woman,” Neill says. “She broke nearly every bone in her body at some point or other, and nearly died after one accident.” He spent a day with her father, a wry, taciturn fellow, before filming began. “We circled round each other. He was deeply suspicious of me, and I was slightly in awe of him. He said: ‘I’ve never seen any of your movies, Sam, but they tell me you’re going pretty good.’ I’m not sure if that was an endorsement.” There is another film on Neill’s mind right now: tomorrow he will fly to the UK to belatedly begin shooting Jurassic World: Dominion alongside Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, his co-stars from the original movie. What on earth could have tempted his character, the palaeontologist Dr Alan Grant, to return after almost ending up as an hors d’oeuvre in two previous Jurassic outings? “That’s a good question,” he chuckles. “I can’t give anything away, but a real-life dinosaur is a compelling thing to someone who has devoted his life to them. There will be screaming. We know this.” Quarantine rules are being waived for some productions shooting in the UK, but Neill is adhering to them anyway. “I feel it’s incumbent upon me to do so,” he says. “It’s only fair.” Besides, he believes we’re in the most difficult stretch of the pandemic to date. “The full-blown crisis was strangely energising. I’ve spoken to people who are missing lockdown; they liked being at home, and now we’re in this no man’s land where no one knows, and we’re getting mixed messages from people in charge. There’s the human impulse to think: ‘Well, that’s done and dusted.’ And, of course, it isn’t.” At least in the country he calls home, he has a leader who instils confidence. “Jacinda Ardern has done an extraordinary job. She’s been a great exemplar for the world, and I’m a great admirer of her. We are, of course, expecting an election in September and there are people at work undermining her. But she has my vote unreservedly.” Although Neill has never wanted for admiration from audiences, lockdown has added a new layer to his appeal. Of all the celebrities who posted videos during those months of confinement and dread, none committed to the project with quite the degree of fun and fervour shown by him. Nor has any other figure in the entertainment industry emerged from that period with their place in the public’s affections so enhanced. Over the past few months, he has become social media’s designated cheerer-upper, a kind of international treasure. “If I do cheer up two or three distressed souls, that’s a good thing,” he smiles. “I’ve been on Twitter for a few years, but it has become so toxic. I have firm views on all the things that people shout at each other about, but we really don’t need someone else shouting. It’s quite good for someone to say: ‘Listen, we’ll get through this, it’ll be all right.’ And I’ve been astonished at the response. People saying, ‘Thanks for making me laugh today, it’s been bloody grim at my place.’ I’m happy to make a fool of myself if it helps.” It does. For many who follow him on social media, there is no face they would rather see as a distraction from the end of the world, whether he’s reading poetry and bedtime stories, strumming Radiohead’s Creep on his ukulele or lending a voice to Sir Gerald, a garden gnome who recently dipped a ceramic toe into the dating scene. Neill has also enlisted a star-studded supporting cast, each filming their contributions from their own kitchens, for his Cinema Quarantino series of quirky two-minute films. In one, Helena Bonham Carter plays Neill’s new phone, jealous of all the earlier models; another features unorthodox dieting tips from Stephen Fry. There’s something faintly touching about the latest episode, which has Neill for once sharing the same physical space as his co-stars – in this case, his old friends Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward. But when I ask if he has missed tactility, especially the hugs and air-kisses common to his profession, he squirms in his chair and grimaces magnificently. “Look, I went to boarding school for God’s sake,” he laughs. “At the end of the holidays, I’d catch the train back to school and my father and I would shake hands at the station. That was me, at nine years of age. ‘Goodbye, Dad.’ ‘Goodbye, old boy.’ Wouldn’t see him again for three months. So, no. I do not hug easily or comfortably. I’m not a man-hugger, let’s put it that way.” Animals are a different matter. Neill is very much missing the livestock back on his farm in Central Otago, on New Zealand’s South Island, where under ordinary circumstances he would spend half the year. Those animals not intended for the dinner table are named after friends of his: Taika Waititi, who directed Neill in the whimsical comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople, has a porcine counterpart waddling around the farm; Bonham Carter has lent her name to a cow. This system results in bulletins that can be disturbing at first glance. Last year, for instance, Neill revealed that Hugo Weaving had died in the act of mounting a sheep, while Meryl Streep was killed by a ferret. There has been a bereavement this week, as it happens. “My bull Jimmy Nesbitt had to be put down. He had arthritis – you don’t think of arthritic bulls, do you? – and he could barely walk. He was an enormous old boy; his grave is absolutely immense.” The bad news doesn’t stop there. “I’m afraid old age also appears to be taking its toll on Helena Bonham Carter. I suspect she won’t make it through the winter.” Are his famous friends kept abreast of the fortunes of their animal namesakes? “Helena is always very keen to know. I’m loth to break the news to her.” His mood has become momentarily downcast, but he rallies suddenly. “We’ve got young ones coming up. Three new muscovy ducks named after Australian comedians. They’re all becoming friends.” He smiles. “So there’s always life on the farm.” His land incorporates four modest-sized organic vineyards from which he has been producing his own wine for 27 years under the Two Paddocks label – so called because his friend the film-maker Roger Donaldson had planted on the land next door. Donaldson named his wine Sleeping Dogs after his 1977 thriller, in which Neill, wide-eyed and bushy-haired in his first lead role, played a wanderer thrust into the chaos of a violent revolution in New Zealand. The picture was a baptism of fire for Neill, who had only ever acted in shorts before. “I had no idea what I was doing and that’s self-evident.” He gives a shrug. “I could’ve been worse, I suppose.” There he was, facing off for his first film against the great, grizzled Warren Oates, veteran of Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch. “There are certain scenes where, if you look closely, Warren has his hands out of shot,” he says. “What he’d do was take a big drag on his doobie – he smoked the whole way through shooting – and then it was, ‘Action!’ and he’d put his hands behind his back and deliver his lines. Then, ‘Cut!’ and the smoke would appear again. I think he took the job in exchange for a big bag of marijuana.” Oates died five years later. “I never saw him again,” Neill says. “His last words to me, as he got in the car with a joint in his hand, were: ‘I’ll see you in the movies, Sam.’ I thought: ‘Unlikely. But thanks for saying it.’” The approval of first Oates and then Mason went some way towards countering his own insecurities. Mason was also there at the beginning of Neill’s life as a wine connoisseur as well as a performer. It was in the senior actor’s presence, at the age of 29, that he first realised wine could be “akin to poetry”. Vintners often talk about “the bottle that changed their life”, he says. “That glass with James, that bottle, changed mine.” He wishes he’d made a note of what it was. No matter. “Wine is so much more than what’s in here,” he says, reaching for a glass of his own Two Paddocks from off-camera and holding it up for me to inspect. “It’s a great enhancer. It’s central to civilised life. Wine is about conviviality, good company, stories. A life well-lived.” It’s getting into evening in Sydney now, and he has pushed his cup of coffee aside to admire that rich-looking red. Even though it’s breakfast time in London, I raise my glass of tap water anyway: to a life well-lived."
"A nation divided and thrown into chaos, the old regime under threat, new dreams of freedom, equality and justice checked by violent oppression masquerading as righteousness. No, not today; I’m talking about 17th-century England, one of the most febrile times in British history, and one of the most cinematic, too.  Thomas Clay’s new movie, Fanny Lye Deliver’d, reminds us of that. Set in 1657, during Oliver Cromwell’s reign, this artful little siege horror brings a runaway couple (Freddie Fox and Tanya Reynolds) into the Puritan household of Charles Dance’s John Lye and his servile wife, Fanny (Maxine Peake). The fusion of earthy rural splendour, monochrome garb, blade-assisted violence and exuberantly oversized hats brings to mind 70s folk horrors such as Witchfinder General and The Blood on Satan’s Claw, but Fanny Lye wants to talk about the ideas, too.  This is the English revolution in microcosm. As the opening crawl puts it, “it was during this brief and violent time that our modern notions of personal, political and sexual freedoms were formed”. The interlopers bring with them dangerous ideas of a “new Jerusalem”: a Christian society minus the sin, the guilt and the patriarchy, with added partying and hallucinogens. Weighed against her husband’s joyless, patriarchal model of society, you can see why Fanny is tempted.  Those radical ideas have percolated into many a political movement since, from anarchy to communism to the rave movement and Occupy; not least the ideas of groups such as the Levellers and the Diggers (you’d probably classify Fanny Lye’s free spirits as Ranters). The Diggers were commemorated in Kevin Brownlow’s 1975 docudrama Winstanley, which cast them as proto-socialists and proto-hippies, who took the law and the land into their own hands and attempted to create an egalitarian, rural utopia. You can guess how that panned out.  Set against these dreamers – at least in the movies – there’s invariably a Puritan regime driven by zealotry, superstition and sadism, yet purporting to represent God’s word. This was a time of literal witch-hunts. Vincent Price’s witchfinder general, who foams against “the foul ungodliness that is womankind”, is not the hero of the piece. Nor were his counterparts in the New World, where Puritanism found space to thrive. No wonder film-makers were drawn to this period in the 1970s, and why it’s being revisited now. It’s got it all: horror, violence, sex and drama, but also a seismic clash of political philosophies. Alongside Fanny Lye Deliver’d you could put Ben Wheatley’s shroom-fuelled civil war freakout A Field in England, 2008 miniseries The Devil’s Whore and Robert Eggers’s The Witch. This was the original culture war. Three centuries later, it’s still playing out. "
"John Boyega, the actor who followed up last week’s blistering attack on social media racism with a powerful speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in London, has won widespread praise for his actions. Jordan Peele, Mark Hamill, Olivia Wilde and Charlie Brooker were among those applauding the star’s rousing address in Hyde Park. “Black lives have always mattered,” Boyega told his fellow demonstrators. “We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless. And now is the time. I ain’t waiting. “We are a physical representation of our support for George Floyd. We are a physical representation of our support for Sandra Bland. We are a physical representation of our support for Trayvon Martin. We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.” Boyega, who came in for some criticism for his explicit language in an Instagram Live video on the same subject last week, said: “Look, I don’t know if I’m going to have a career after this, but fuck that.” Fighting back tears, he continued: “Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process. We don’t know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don’t know what Sandra Bland could have achieved, but today we’re going to make sure that won’t be an alien thought to our young ones. “I need you to understand how painful this shit is. I need you to understand how painful it is to be reminded every day that your race means nothing and that isn’t the case any more, that was never the case any more.” Boyega’s Star Wars co-star Mark Hamill tweeted that he’d “never been more proud” of the actor, while the official account for the franchise called him a “hero”. “Lucasfilm stands with John Boyega and his message that now is the time. Black lives have always mattered,” it read. “Black lives have always been important. Black lives have always meant something. The evil that is racism must stop. We will commit to being part of the change that is long overdue in the world. John Boyega, you are our hero.” Boyega and other actors from the latest trilogy in the series – most notably Kelly Marie Tran – have been subjected to relentless racist attack from people purporting to be fans of the sci-fi franchise. Other film industry names supporting Boyega included Jordan Peele, director of Get Out, who wrote: “We got you, John.” JJ Abrams, Edgar Wright, Olivia Wilde and Charlie Brooker were among those affirming their continued desire to work with Boyega."
"Freddie Fox – son of Edward, nephew of James, brother of Emilia and cousin to the Question Time racism refusenik Laurence – is under no illusions about how he is regarded. “‘Oh, let’s get Freddie in to play the nasty posh guy,’” he says. Rare is the script that doesn’t require him to play gay, decadent or beastly, preferably in spiffy period dress. He’s been a Bullingdon bullyboy (The Riot Club), Louis XIII (The Three Musketeers) and a perky Cambridge graduate in Victorian sitcom Year of the Rabbit, though he first caught the eye when he starred in Worried About the Boy as the singer Marilyn, all lippy and leopard print. “If I need to play a few posh boys to pay the bills then fine,” he tells me via Zoom from his London living room. “But I want to be Iago, Hamlet, David Bowie. I want to explore all the costumes in the cupboard.” He plays strikingly against type as a violent fugitive in his new film. Or rather, his old film: the 17th-century Shropshire western Fanny Lye Deliver’d wrapped in May 2016, then underwent a protracted post-production period. He was 26 when shooting started; he’s now 31. How’s his memory? “They sent me the trailer. That brought a lot of it back.” He remembers, for instance, the seven-week shoot becoming 10. The rain fell, the set flooded, the midges had a field day. At least the punishing conditions suited the material. “The Holiday wouldn’t have worked there,” he agrees. As we talk, he ties up his hair. Now and then, he will dart off to fetch something he wants to show me, such as the signed photograph he got from Burt Reynolds in a meeting that inspired his own short film Hero. He looks nothing whatsoever like his rugged character in Fanny Lye Deliver’d. “I’m quite a downy little chick,” he grins. As the thuggish Thomas, he and his lover (played by Tanya Reynolds) inveigle their way into the home of Fanny (Maxine Peake) and her tyrannical husband (Charles Dance). Their campaign of mounting violence becomes the catalyst for her eventual emancipation. “There’s something quite exciting about Thomas,” he says. “You can understand how the fresh blood that comes into Fanny’s life in the form of this devil figure shows her who she can be beyond the confines of her marriage. On the other hand, he’s an emancipator of people for his own sexual pleasure, so you get that whole gamut of what we would now call ‘toxic masculinity’.” When the intruders coerce Fanny into bed, Thomas brandishes an angry-looking erection. Was the actor consulted about his prosthetic penis? “Sort of,” he laughs. “There’s a section in the contract outlining the rights of approval that my agents would have over it: ‘It shall not prejudice the reputation of that artist,’ that sort of thing.” There’s always the danger it could set the bar unreasonably high. “Exactly. You don’t want to big yourself up too much. When I saw it, I was like: ‘Fucking hell! That’s almost an offensive weapon.’” No, he didn’t keep it as a souvenir. “Where would I put it? On the mantelpiece?” Fox is not averse to a candid sex scene: he was naked on stage in the 2012 revival of David Hare’s The Judas Kiss, and he spent much of his time in Russell T Davies’s series Cucumber either receiving or dishing out a jolly good seeing-to. This was back in the days before intimacy coordinators. “I’m all for those. Sets are frightening enough places without taking your clothes off in front of 50 people. Cucumber made me comfortable about it, but this was Tanya’s first film, so for her to do all that was very intense.” I interpret his protective tone as a colleague’s concern, though it was reported recently that he and Reynolds, one of the stars of Sex Education, are in a relationship. This isn’t the first time he has used his charisma to disturb as well as disarm. He was persuasively chilling in the ITV drama White House Farm, in which he played Jeremy Bamber, who is serving a full life sentence for the murder in 1985 of his adoptive parents, sister and two young nephews. “It’s your duty as an actor to find the vulnerabilities, insecurities and pain of any character,” he says. That bodes well for his forthcoming turn as Mark Thatcher, opposite Gillian Anderson as his mother, in the next series of The Crown. “You have to make sure that your portrayal of someone who has been painted two-dimensionally in the media is as three-dimensional as possible. It can’t just be: ‘Oh, he said that because he’s an arrogant twat.’ Someone may do or say arrogant, twattish things, but that’s not who they are.” And there I was wondering exactly how to broach the subject of his Maga-cap-wearing cousin. I thank him for supplying the perfect segue and he shakes his head with a rueful smirk before composing his features into a poker face. It was during an episode of Question Time in January that Laurence Fox doubted whether Meghan Markle had been the victim of racist media coverage, rolled his eyes at the claim that he was a beneficiary of white male privilege and accused a mixed-race audience member of displaying racism toward him. I ask Fox if he watched the episode. “I’ve seen it, yes. But I’ll preface anything you’re going to ask me by saying I won’t talk much about this because I’m in a slightly compromised position. One of my fellow cast members, as you’re aware, has had an open debate with him about things he said.” That’s one way to put it. In fact, Maxine Peake – Fanny Lye herself – deliver’d a blistering attack shortly after the Question Time debacle. “Black and w/c [working-class] actors can only speak the truth once they’re established,” she tweeted. “Their voices aren’t heard before. Posh actors, on the other hand, only complain when they want attention. Anything shit to sell @LozzaFox or is it just a coincidence you’ve gone right wing?” When the actors’ union Equity later apologised for a tweet calling Laurence Fox “a disgrace to our industry”, Peake was among those to express anger at the climbdown. “I neither want to take sides nor reopen a debate that’s already happened,” Fox tells me now. “That’s really all I’ve got to say about Laurence.” Are they close? “Yeah. He’s my cousin, I love him.” He also rates him highly as a performer. “There’s a dangerous quality to his acting that I think all actors strive for, and that can inevitably seep into one’s off-set life a little bit, too.” Is it true he was spat at in the street because of his cousin’s views? “Listen,” he sighs, wearying of the subject. “An incident happened and I have no idea whether it was related to Laurence. The person could’ve been drunk, on drugs, anything.” Of course, Fox is not his cousin’s keeper. And he is as quick to assert that racism should be challenged as he is slow to single out Laurence for reprimand. “In the wake of the horrific murder of George Floyd, I do think we are all duty-bound as global citizens to stand up to systemic racism within institutions like the police force. We need to stand together shoulder to shoulder, calling it out and taking it down.” He doesn’t share his cousin’s apparent difficulty with acknowledging the circumstances that have made his success possible. “As a white man with a public school education, I am a product of white male privilege. I have a duty to listen to people who come from different worlds and to see how I can support them. The George Floyd incident is one example. It’s about how I can help and listen and learn to serve the whole a bit better. It’s just no good saying: ‘My lot’s fine and I don’t understand yours so it doesn’t matter.’”"
"Our morning routines have changed. More energetic types may have been bouncing out of bed for a virtual PE lesson, and domestic deities are shuffling into the kitchen to inspect their sourdough starters. Me, I’ve been waking up each morning to check yesterday’s weather in Los Angeles. In mid-May David Lynch activated a YouTube channel (David Lynch Theater) for the express purpose, it seems, of keeping Angelenos up to date with the local weather forecast. It’s the revival of an old habit: he used his website for the same purpose back in the early 2000s. In clips just a few seconds long, the director, artist, musician and now YouTuber can be seen seated at his desk, with curls of steam rising from his coffee cup, delivering a weather forecast (in fahrenheit and celsius), pausing only to turn his head and gaze out of the window, as he assesses the stage of the morning cloud formation. True to form, his forecasts are generally optimistic. The clouds will burn away, the mercury will rise and there will be “sunshine all the way”. He concludes with a salute, and the instruction to “have a great day”. The weather forecasts may be perfunctory, but their daily appearance is soothing. I don’t get tingles from ASMR, but I do get a frisson from my low-key Lynchdates; the director’s dark shirts, his impressive snow-white quiff, and his office, soaked in hazy morning sunlight have become comfortingly familiar. Nevertheless, Lynch is not averse to shaking up the format. On 6 June, he marked the anniversary of D-day by recounting a dream he had of being a young German soldier in the second world war, dying on a beach in Normandy. And 12 June became a day of celebration as the director excitedly unveiled his new microphone, a gift from his admirers at the Santa Monica College station KCRW radio. Which probably makes Lynch an influencer. On 2 June, designated #blackouttuesday by the music industry, Lynch was absent from the frame, leaving us with 28 seconds of silence and an empty chair. Even the coffee appeared to be cold. In case his point had been missed, the following day, he gave the forecast in front of a handmade sign painted with the words: “BLACK LIVES MATTER/PEACE JUSTICE/NO FEAR”. Did 74-year-old Lynch join the BLM demonstrations in Los Angeles? Maybe so. Lynch has more than meteorology on his mind. He has uploaded two short films to the channel, exploiting the element of surprise as he did when he released 2017’s What Did Jack Do? on Netflix in January. First he sprang the abstract animation Fire (Pozar) on us and more recently, episodes of his 2002 leporine hellmouth “sitcom” Rabbits, starring Scott Coffey, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring: “In a nameless city deluged by a continuous rain … three rabbits live with a fearful mystery.” He has even debuted a David Lynch Theater original: The Story of a Small Bug, in which Lynch’s narration and fearful sound design elevate the encounter between a hungry lizard and an unsuspecting creepy-crawly to an Attenborough-esque horror. My favourites are the videos labelled What Is David Working on Today?, snapshots of Lynch pottering in his workshop. He might be fixing a sink (complete with “swing-out urinal”!) or debuting his new invention “the incredible checking stick”, a device to help him channel his creative intuition while painting. As he murmurs appreciatively: “Wood is such a blessing for humanity.” I had a trip to California booked this spring, which I cancelled, naturally. So it should be bittersweet to check in with the weather on America’s west coast every day, but somehow it’s not. Like the checking stick, each video is “a tasty little piece”. I hope Lynch stays on YouTube for the summer. Life in lockdown London may be filled with uncertainty, but on my computer screen at least, the coffee is always steaming hot, the sunshine is golden, and the director of Eraserhead wants me to have a great day."
"Hollywood’s depiction of infertility over the years has been, well, let’s say sporadic. When it does make it on to the screen, it’s usually played for laughs. Whether it’s adoption in Juno, surrogacy in Baby Mama or infertility in Raising Arizona, when it comes to women’s wombs, film execs have decided they need to throw in a good chuckle to make the subject more palatable. Just in case the grim reality of it all drives viewers away screaming in horror. Private Life is a comedy about infertility but rather than using it as a plot device, it delves into the nitty gritty of IVF, egg donation and adoption, showing what a long, hard and lonely slog it really is. Its story of a middle-aged couple in New York struggling to conceive – inspired by writer and director Tamara Jenkins’ own experiences – feels genuinely authentic. It’s an intimate and unflinching look at the pain and heartache of infertility that is deeply compassionate and, at times, very funny. Released at the end of 2018 on Netflix, it was given a warm pat on the back by critics before being forgotten fairly swiftly in the deluge of other offerings on the streaming platform. Which is a crying shame as it’s up there with the likes of Marriage Story and Roma as one of the platform’s finest originals. A large part of this is down to Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti as Rachel and Richard, a successful artistic couple in their 40s who are not just emotionally spent but also financially bust after countless failed IVF cycles. They’re still determined to cast the fertility net far and wide by making one last-ditch attempt at IVF as they also explore adoption. But their rocky road to parenthood has left its mark. She is anxious, overwrought and on the edge. He is snappy, frustrated and plain exhausted. Their relationship is on the verge of imploding and they’re barely holding it together for their medical appointments. Their disapproving sister-in-law Cynthia (the always brilliant Molly Shannon) snipes that they’re “fertility junkies”. While Richard insists to his wife as they’re forced to spend another $10,000 on surgery: “We’re not insane, we’re normal.” Separately, it’s always a joy to spend time in Hahn and Giamatti’s company but together they are a formidable duo. Their performances are wonderfully naturalistic; they breathe life into their roles by filling the jagged corners of their characters with poignancy. Hahn is outstanding as she teeters between barely contained rage and raw vulnerability while Giamatti skillfully conveys how dejected Richard has become, beaten down by his own sadness. Both are equally compelling as they demonstrate in their different ways how this primal need to have a child does not listen to reason or to a beloved spouse or to anyone really but their own spluttering biological clock. Even if it threatens to tip into something toxic and unhealthy. Things take a turn when they decide to ask their stepniece Sadie (Kayli Carter), a 25-year-old college dropout who is trying to figure out what to do with her life, to be their egg donor. She’s game but perhaps still too emotionally immature to grasp the full implications of what she’s signing on for. Jenkins reveals how a deeply private matter like infertility soon becomes public property; your body grabbed by strangers’ hands (in one scene a doctor asks Rachel if she likes prog rock midway through a medical procedure) and your grief casually laid bare for friends and families. She’s also adept in finding the wry humour that lurks within darker moments with plenty of bittersweet laughs along the way. Her script exposes some of the conflicting messages that we’re fed as a society about fertility especially how women are told to go forth and forge a career and then chided for waiting too long to try to have a baby. It also touches on the other ways women’s bodies betray them as they age when the hell of menopause kicks in, as Cynthia, plucking out a chin hair one night, discovers. The film doesn’t gloss over the repetitive nature of the fertility hamster wheel. Not just with the constant injections, the mind-numbing paperwork, the faceless waiting rooms and how tooth-pullingly awkward each step is. But also the seemingly endless cycle of burgeoning hope that is wiped out by crushing disappointment and heartbreak. Private Life shows us that despite the tears, the anguish and the emotional scars that linger on, it’s this hope which refuses to be extinguished. And that is what makes us human."
"Wes Anderson, Kate Winslet and Steve McQueen are among the big names whose films have received the stamp of approval from the prestigious Cannes film festival, despite the shelving of its traditional red-carpet-dominated event in mid-May. Saying “cancellation has never been an option”, Cannes general delegate Thierry Frémaux instead announced a list of 56 films that, he said, would have comprised the festival’s selection for 2020 – films that would have competed for the Palme d’Or, as well as playing sidebars such as Midnight Screenings, Out of Competition, and Un Certain Regard. Anderson’s new film, The French Dispatch, is described as “a love letter to journalists” set in the French office of a fictional New Yorker style publication, and was heavily trailed by Frémaux in recent weeks. It rounds up Anderson’s customary big-name ensemble cast, including Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton and Benicio del Toro. McQueen’s contribution is two feature-length films – entitled Lovers Rock and Mangrove – from his forthcoming longform BBC anthology Small Axe, which examines the history of the West Indian immigrant community in London from the 1960s to the 1980s. Mangrove is a dramatisation of the celebrated real-life case of the Mangrove 9 in 1970, which laid bare the depth of police racism in the UK, and stars Black Panther’s Letitia Wright. Lovers Rock features Blue Story’s Micheal Ward in a 1980s-set romance. While Cannes has in the past been reluctant to select made-for-television work, it has recently shown David Lynch’s Twin Peaks and Nicolas Winding Refn’s Too Old to Die Young. McQueen said in a statement: “I dedicate these films to George Floyd and all the other black people that have been murdered, seen or unseen, because of who they are, in the US, UK and elsewhere. ‘If you are the big tree, we are the small axe.’ Black Lives Matter.” Although the selection appears noticeably short of major Hollywood names – with studios clearly preferring to hedge their bets and keep product back till the post-pandemic situation is clearer - Cannes does have the Kate Winslet/Saoirse Ronan starrer Ammonite, directed by British film-maker Francis Lee. Ammonite centres on real-life fossil hunter Mary Anning (played by Winslet) who lived in Lyme Regis in the early 19th century; Ronan plays a wealthy married woman with whom she develops a relationship. Cannes has also selected Soul, the new animated film from Pixar, directed by Pete Docter which features Jamie Foxx as a jazz musician whose soul separates from his body, while Falling, the directorial debut of Lord of the Rings’ Viggo Mortensen, has been added to the line-up after its successful premiere at Sundance earlier this year. Other highlights are Aya and the Witch, a new Studio Ghibli animation from Japan, directed by animation legend Hayao Miyazaki’s son Goro and adapted from British kids book Earwig and the Witch by Diana Wynne Jones, and Limbo, a Scottish-set film about refugees directed by Ben Sharrock and produced by FilmFour. After it had to call off its gala event Cannes has, unlike other festivals, resisted calls to construct a “virtual” festival online. It intends to present its selection at prominent festivals later in the calendar year, including the Toronto, San Sebastian, Telluride and Venice film festivals. Having faced criticism in recent years for the paucity of female directors in Cannes’ main competition, with only three selected in each of the last three years in a row, Frémaux defended Cannes’ record by saying the 16 female directors in total selected this year (compared to 14 last year, and 11 in 2018) represented an “an evolution observed for several years”. He added: “It testifies, in number and in value, to the artistic and human contribution of women in contemporary cinema.”  Among the crop of female directors for 2020 are Maïwenn, Charlène Favier and Naomi Kawase but as the new selection does not break down films into the traditional categories, direct comparison to previous years is not possible.  The 73rd festival was due to take place between 12-23 May, but after restrictions by French government effectively banned mass gatherings until mid-July at the earliest it was forced to call it off, before subsequently abandoning tentative plans to reschedule it for later in the year. The Cannes Film Market, the film industry trade fair which normally operates alongside the film festival, has been reconfigured as an online event and is due to run on 22-26 June.

"Which film has the most extras? As a child, Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi was just the answer to a trivia question. Growing up in India in the 90s and 00s, we knew the great man’s story inside out. At school, history textbooks waxed poetic about his legend; our parents counselled us to emulate him by practising celibacy and turning the other cheek. Watching the movie, telecast every year punctually on his birthday, was never a priority. It would have been like volunteering to do more homework.  How things have changed – even before the pandemic. What does Gandhi represent in our post-truth world? His image still stares out at us from Indian rupee bills, but all talk of non-violence is bunkum in an age where the threat of nuclear annihilation is the only deterrent to endless wars. Back home, in Narendra Modi’s India, Hindu supremacists steal his ashes from memorials and shamelessly praise his assassin as a patriot. Those of us who once took his legacy for granted will now do anything to undo our sins. Even if that means watching Sir Ben Kingsley – born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, courtesy of his Kenyan-Indian father – pass himself off as Gujarati. Attenborough, of course, couldn’t care less about Gandhi’s early years in Gujarat. When the film begins, Gandhi is already old and bald and walking with a stoop – walking, in fact, to the prayer meeting where he will be shot dead. Is the sound of flies hovering in the background meant to suggest we are in India? Soon enough brown men and women are peering out from the sides of the frame, dutifully exchanging salaams and namaskars.  The story swiftly falls into a pattern: mumbling natives, a few good white men. Ben Kingsley never quite disappears into the role. He sticks out in a group of Indian actors with his elaborate pauses, in a way I doubt Gandhi ever did. The film itself is a litany of speeches: the young Gandhi, as a lawyer in South Africa, exhorting his fellow Indian immigrants to burn their passes; then, an hour later, dressed in a loincloth in India, brainstorming about the best way to gain independence. The country’s turbulent struggle for freedom is portrayed as a school elocution contest, with breaks in plush drawing rooms where a select few glumly deliberate on “people out there”. It will be some time before I recover from the scenes of Kingsley addressing Indian villagers in English, his uppity outbursts of “My dear!” and “O Lord!” and “For God’s sake, stop it!” The list of liberties Attenborough takes with history is long and not always amusing. The Indian Congress party contemplating “terrorism” to achieve home rule? Gandhi organising his famous salt march to provide a visiting New York Times journalist with good copy? Attenborough would have us believe that the British empire became a liability due to a few errant officials: a psychotic General Dyer ordering the brutal Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, an overzealous police inspector quick to arrest Gandhi. What is suppressed, as any schoolboy in India will tell you, is the wilfulness with which the British fomented religious antagonisms in the subcontinent, through their deceitful strategy of divide and rule. The ending of the film makes for unbearable watching, since the imperial culpability in partition is never explored. The violence of those years comes across as an endorsement of the colonial logic that deemed Indians unfit to rule themselves. Jallianwala Bagh, on the other hand, is carefully presented as a wayward brigadier’s lapse, in no way reflective of the Raj. What was Gandhi like in his private moments, when he was not reciting his fortune-cookie quotes? What was he like as a father, a husband? Over three hours, we don’t get to find out. A revolutionary like Gandhi is incapable of being the bland saviour Attenborough makes him out to be. The second half moves forward smoothly, but that is because the story is now seen through the eyes of a British woman: Mirabehn, born Madeleine Slade, a disciple of Gandhi. In contrast, the confusion of the first half can be attributed to the absence of a credible outsider (read: white person) who can bear witness to the narrative. To be fair, there is CF Andrews, a priest and close friend of Gandhi’s, and of course Vince Walker, the intrepid New York Times correspondent played by Martin Sheen – and inspired by the real-life journalist Webb Miller – but they both lack the confidence of the disciple who will always assure her guru: “I know that you are right.”  For an epic movie, Gandhi is redeemed by its cameo performances. Daniel Day-Lewis as a racist teenager! Om Puri as a repenting rioter! But there too, a sense of being cast as extras in one’s own play persists, as we see iconic Indian names – Saeed Jaffrey, Alyque Padamsee, Neena Gupta – relegated to bit-parts when no Indian actor was apparently ever in the running to play Gandhi. And it isn’t just a question of the movie not having aged well. Halfway through one of Gandhi’s speeches in South Africa, a guest whispers to another on stage: “He has become quite good at this.” Except that Kingsley hasn’t. He still looks as awkward as before, mouthing his lines like someone who has practised them one too many times. The glibness is true to type for a film that claims to be something it isn’t."
"John Boyega has been praised for a series of uncompromising social media posts speaking out about racism in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. Boyega’s initial Tweet, “I really fucking hate racists”, currently has 1.3m likes, but came in for criticism for his hard-hitting tone and use of an expletive. The actor, whose engagement with political and social issues has increased since the conclusion of the Star Wars trilogy in which he starred, then clarified that he meant, specifically, “WHITE on BLACK racism … the kind that has ruined the world”. He then added: “This is my own personal account. I am not here for the kids.” Boyega, who lives in London, expanded on his thoughts in an Instagram Live video, saying: “A black man was just murdered in cold blood in the street Stateside again, while saying he can’t breathe. That’s a continuous cycle going on. “Although I don’t live in the States, I’m black … So I’ll say it again: fuck you racist white people. I said what I said. And if you don’t fucking like it, go suck a dick.” Boyega, 28, who says he has encountered racist abuse since childhood, added he would block all those who replied in an offensive way to his posts, and continued: “You lot can’t rattle me. I’m not the guy to be rattled. I wasn’t raised by no weak people.” Boyega later noted on Twitter that his mother had called him a “Good Boy” for his actions. Celebrities including Amber Riley, Yvette Nicole Brown and Dylan O’Brien were swift to back Boyega on social media. Others to use the forum to express their shock and anger at Floyd’s death include Beyoncé, Ariana Grande, Cardi B and Justin Bieber, who posted: “This makes me absolutely sick. This makes me angry this man DIED. This makes me sad. Racism is evil We need to use our voice! Please people.”"
"Showgirls is one of those movies that doesn’t so much divide opinion as defy it. Critical vocabulary breaks down in the face of its transcendent vulgarity. Is it deliberately bad? Unintentionally bad? So bad it’s good? Or just actually … good? Whatever the case, where other movies of a similar vintage have slid into obscurity, we’re still talking about it 25 years later. You can’t engineer cult status, but Showgirls accidentally hit upon the perfect formula: big budget yet inherently trashy premise; quotably absurd dialogue (“It must be weird not having anybody cum on you”); ridiculous characters; lavish musical numbers; salacious yet utterly unsexy nudity; and showbiz melodrama played dead straight. Everything about it is over the top, even the toplessness, but especially memorable is Elizabeth Berkley’s wildly overcommitted performance as striving stripper/dancer Nomi, who gyrates and schemes her way up (or is it down?) the greasy pole of Vegas stardom, licking it along the way for good measure. Another key factor in Showgirls’ cult status was the way it bombed so spectacularly, commercially and critically. Nothing breeds cult success like failure. Showgirls became a hit on home video. It was embraced by trash aficionados. Ironic fan screenings were held. Film-makers, including Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino, praised it. The rehabilitation really got going in 2003, when Film Quarterly published a roundtable discussion of the movie, assessing its artistic merits, its handling of gender, class and sexual issues, the way it “takes mass culture seriously, as a site of both fascination and struggle”. Now we have two new docs: Goddess: The Fall and Rise of Showgirls, from the makers of I Am Divine, and the entertaining You Don’t Nomi (released on streaming this Friday), which charts the movie’s chequered history and puts it in the context of Verhoeven’s recurring “themes”, including sex, violence, and, more problematically, sexual violence; he’s barely made a movie that doesn’t feature a rape scene. Showgirls’ is one of the worst, but at least it has meaningful consequences, and is avenged in its own twisted way. People loved Verhoeven’s movies when they took aim at hardline law enforcement (RoboCop) or US militarism (Starship Troopers), or even male fragility (Basic Instinct), but with Showgirls, the target was the American dream itself – and the dishonest “star is born” narratives churned out to sustain it. If Showgirls has a message, it’s that the game is rigged for women like Nomi. She thinks she’s climbing the pole but really she’s just spinning round it. The real power lies with the men running the racket. Nobody wanted to hear that at the time; maybe they’re ready to now. In its own messy way, Showgirls is a #MeToo story with a male gaze. "
"Producers of Hollywood blockbusters including The Batman and the next Fantastic Beasts film have been given the go-ahead to restart filming after the UK government and health bodies signed off on new coronavirus safety rules. The approval of the new guidelines paves the way for the UK’s film and high-end television production industry, which includes series that cost £1m-plus per episode, to get cameras rolling again – potentially as soon as July. The resumption of production, which ground to a halt in the face of the spread of the coronavirus, will be warmly welcomed by broadcasters, streaming services and cinema owners facing a possible future content drought. It will also be welcome news to tens of thousands of self-employed freelance film and TV workers, from directors and camera operators to prop makers and makeup artists, who have been ineligible for government financial support and struggling to make ends meet. The guidelines, drawn up by the British Film Commission and the British Film Institute, include rules on physical distancing, safety training and temperature tests. The document has been signed off by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Public Health England and the Health and Safety Executive. However, it will still be up to each individual production to decide how, and when, to restart filming.  The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said: “We’ve worked hard to support the industry through these difficult times and I’m delighted we’ve been able to agree this step forward towards getting the cameras rolling safely again.”  Warner Bros, which is filming The Batman – starring Robert Pattinson in the title role – and the third instalment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise in the UK, is understood to be keen to resume production as soon as is safely possible. Other major productions in the UK include the live-action movie Little Mermaid, which Disney halted filming at Pinewood Studios, and Netflix’s big-budget series The Witcher. “This is a green light that signals that the UK is open for business again for film and high-end TV production,” said an industry source. “Many productions have to get up and running again in the next two months or they won’t get made this year as they rely on summer weather and conditions.” The production of major films and TV shows has been shut down since mid-March, when Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders, two of the most popular shows on British television, were the first UK productions to suspend filming. Last month, the UK’s biggest broadcasters, including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky, agreed guidelines endorsed by the DCMS to resume filming popular programmes such as Coronation Street, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Top Gear. Stocks of episodes of the nation’s favourite soaps were rapidly running out, despite broadcasters rationing them since the lockdown began in March. The UK is one of the most important film and TV locations in the world with a record £3.6bn spent on making more than 300 movies and high-end TV productions last year. The amount spent on film production in the UK hit £1.95bn, the second highest on record, on 188 productions. The lion’s share of this, £1.4bn, was spent by major Hollywood studios on making just 21 blockbusters, such as James Bond: No Time To Die and Sam Mendes’ 1917. The streaming wars, led by Netflix, are proving to be the main driver of a new production boom. High-end TV production – shows costing more than £1m an episode to make – surged by 29% last year to £1.66bn. Last week, Cineworld, the world’s second-largest cinema chain with 128 venues in the UK and Ireland, said it plans to reopen in July as the government eases coronavirus lockdown measures. Cineworld, which has 787 venues globally, is hoping to reopen in time for Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, scheduled for release on 17 July, followed by the Disney blockbuster Mulan. The theatre chain has acknowledged that the cinema-going experience will change dramatically with physical distancing and hygiene rules. “Cineworld has put in place procedures to ensure a safe and enjoyable cinema experience for its employees and customers,” the company said. Vue, one of Europe’s largest cinema operators, has also said it intends to reopen in July with measures including physically isolating family groups and staggering film times to reduce crowding. Vue has previously said other measures would include controlling entrances and exits and reducing the overall capacity of each film screening. In Berlin, one theatre ripped out seats to ensure safe distancing between members of the audience. Some cinema operators have installed plastic screens between seats. A small-scale reopening of cinemas in China in mid-March was abruptly halted by the government amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections."
"Quentin Tarantino has named David Fincher’s drama about the creation of Facebook, The Social Network, as the best film of the past decade. Speaking to Premiere, the director said the film, which stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, was “hands down” his top choice. “It is No 1 because it’s the best, that’s all! It crushes all the competition,” said Tarantino. Fincher’s film, released in 2010, was nominated for eight Oscars and won three, losing out on best picture to The King’s Speech. Tarantino, 57, singled out Aaron Sorkin’s script for particular praise, calling him “the greatest active dialogist”. The director is a noted fan of Sorkin’s, having previously said he’d watch each new episode of HBO drama The Newsroom three times in a week. He is also an aficionado of Fincher, naming Fight Club on a comparable list of the best films made between 1992 and 2009. Tarantino had already named Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan’s 2017 war drama, his second best film of the decade. His top pick from the films of 2019 was Crawl, a little seen horror film about ravenous alligators. The Social Network was named the 54th best film of the decade by the Guardian."
"One of the oddest aspects of this year’s awards season – which happened approximately four thousand years ago – was that Parasite swept the board in all major categories except one. At the Oscars, for instance, Parasite won best original screenplay, best director, best film in a foreign language and best picture. And yet for some reason its cast didn’t get a look in. This is a crying shame because, in Song Kang-ho, Parasite has one of the all-time greats of Korean cinema. You don’t need to be a paid-up Koreaphile to have noticed Song in other films, because he has appeared in breakout hits like Snowpiercer, The Host, Thirst Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and The Good, The Bad, The Weird as well as domestic blockbusters like Shiri and Joint Security Area. But perhaps one of my favourite roles is his lead in 2004’s The President’s Barber, which is possibly the closest thing Korea has ever produced to Forrest Gump. As you’d expect, Song plays the man tasked with cutting the president’s hair. He’s a big, placid figure brought up to respect authority in all its forms, who finds himself as a close-quarters witness to some of the darkest moments in 20th-century South Korean history. The president whose hair he cuts is Park Chung-hee, whose dictatorship ruled the country for almost 20 years. A little historical knowledge of Park will help your understanding of the film. The shortest possible explanation is that after rising to power in the early 1960s, Park made his name by lifting South Korea out of postwar poverty and imposing a terrible reign of human rights abuses on his population. He changed the constitution to allow himself more than two terms in power. He ran elections unopposed. Enemies were kidnapped and criticism of the regime was outlawed. The homeless were collected and sent to work camps. Park’s time in power ended in 1979, when he was shot in the head by his own security chief. In some ways, there is a parallel between Song’s barber here and the character he plays in Parasite. Both are men of simple means who find themselves seduced by what others have. In The President’s Barber, however, the disillusionment takes longer to set in. For a while he’s happy to live in the limelight; travelling to America with Park (where, in the Gumpiest moments of the film, he’s digitally inserted into old Richard Nixon footage). But the good times end, in a slightly weird tonal shift, with a bout of diarrhoea. Park declares that North Korean spies have been in the vicinity of Seoul, and they all have infectious gastrointestinal issues. Therefore, a system of contact tracing is put into effect; anyone who displays signs of diarrhoea must have been in contact with them, and is probably a collaborator. So when the barber’s young son complains about an upset stomach within earshot of a high-ranking government official, he is tortured until he is paralysed. These lurches in tone are what define The President’s Barber. By rights it should be a full-blown melodrama, and in places it is, but it’s also offset by a goofiness that sometimes borders on the inappropriate. There are long scenes where Song undercuts the solemnity of a funeral by straining for a poo. The son is tortured with electricity, and quickly hooked up to fairy lights so the torturer can dance around like Elvis Presley. There are dream sequences of grisly murder. In that respect, it’s a hard film to pin down. But at the centre of it all is the slow wearing down of Song. He starts the film as an amiable idiot but, as Park’s regime grinds on, he gradually becomes gloomier and gloomier. He’s tied up with a regime that has ripped his family apart, and the knowledge of this threatens to destroy his entire sense of self. It’s only at the very end, after Park’s death, that he regains a semblance of his old persona. His son starts to recover. He’s banned from the presidential home after making a wisecrack about the baldness of Park’s successor. The “happy ending” of this weird-ass film is a kidnapping and beating. The President’s Barber won’t be for everyone. Come for comedy and you’ll leave bummed out; come for drama and you’ll just be confused. But as a way of making an unpalatable moment in history slightly more digestible, and as further proof of Song’s genius as a performer, I can’t recommend it highly enough."
"Ken Nightingall, the veteran boom operator who was immortalised to a generation of Star Wars fans as “pink shorts boom guy”, has died aged 92. The Association of Motion Picture Sound confirmed the news on social media, saying he had died on Tuesday. Nightingall, who was part of the largely British crew who worked on the first Star Wars film (later titled subtitled A New Hope), became a cult figure after a photograph of him on set in Tunisia, dressed in pink shorts and work boots, surfaced on Reddit in 2015. Fans dressed in the costume subsequently turned up at Star Wars conventions. In 2019 Nightingall told ABC that it “was very, very hot” in Tunisia, where the scenes set on the planet Tatooine were filmed. Star Wars won the Academy Award for best sound in 1978, though Nightingall was not named on the citation. Nightingall’s son Terence, however, told ABC that the crew were not overly impressed during production. “Most of them working on the movie thought it was the biggest load of crap they’d ever worked on.” However, Nightingall expressed his approval of the Star Wars cosplayers. “I think it’s very nice. They seem to like it. Good for them.” Prior to Star Wars, Nightingall worked as a boom operator on the Michael Caine films Alfie and Funeral in Berlin, and afterwards four Bond films including For Your Eyes Only and The Living Daylights."
"Those seeking explanations as to how Woody Allen’s A Rainy Day in New York topped the global box office a few weeks ago, despite two years of delays, disavowals and reputation-shredding allegations of sexual assault against the film-maker (Allen denies all charges), might want to take a look at the posters for A Rainy Day’s release in South Korea. They are essentially a Timothée Chalamet fashion shoot. Here he is looking dapper in a tweed blazer, holding an umbrella, sitting alone in a bar, closing the door of a yellow taxi – wisps of wet hair streaking artfully across his forehead. It’s not Allen’s name that is drawing people in, it’s Chalamet’s. It is now safe to say Chalamet is the movie star of his generation. He’s Generation Z’s answer to Leonardo DiCaprio, or Robert Pattinson, or James Dean. More than just talent, commercial appeal or dreamy good looks, he possesses that teen heartthrob quality born of boyishness: intensity, vulnerability, androgyny and a certain amount of stubble-free cheekbone action. Chalamet seems to appeal to all genders and sexualities, and today that appeal is measured less by posters on bedroom walls than adoring posts online. It is Chalamet who is inserted by fans into classic works of art on Instagram, who is the subject of memes, whose every style choice is met with gushing approval, and who can send the internet into a frenzy with a mere photo of his larder. That said, Chalamet has little competition in the acting stakes, either. He is the only actor still under 30 with a best actor Oscar nomination, and after Call Me By Your Name, Lady Bird and Little Women, he has established a neat line in louche, sophisticated teens, world-weary beyond their years, yet captivatingly sensitive. The question is whether Chalamet can graduate beyond dreamy teens and score a bona fide hit, like DiCaprio did with Titanic, or Pattinson with Twilight. His Henry V in last year’s The King was the perfect boy-to-man transitional role but Chalamet didn’t quite pull it off (the bowl haircut may have been a factor). But he still has the sci-fi epic Dune to come, not to mention Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, a Call Me By Your Name sequel and a rumoured Bob Dylan biopic. In that respect, A Rainy Day in New York represents a step backwards. It was filmed three years ago, when Chalamet was still in dreamy teen mode. The story rehashes so many old Allen themes – age-inappropriate relationships, ditzy young women, anachronistic witticisms – it might as well have been written by an algorithm, but Chalamet emerges unscathed. He has since distanced himself from the film in light of Allen’s growing toxicity, and donated his salary to Time’s Up and other charities. Ironically, the film he is least proud of could be the one that cements his movie star status. "
"The American comedy actor Fred Willard, who has died aged 86, never took top billing on screen, but he found his niche as a scene-stealer in the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest, among others, usually playing characters invested with authority who prove to be inept, clueless or simply unintentionally funny. In his first, This is Spinal Tap (1984), a satire of reverential rock documentaries, directed by Rob Reiner and starring Guest, Willard is an upbeat lieutenant organising a gig for a fictional British heavy-metal band in a US airforce base hangar – after they have to cancel dates at bigger venues because of low ticket sales. In his squirming welcome to the band for the base’s “monthly at-ease weekend”, he announces a 7pm start and jokes about their long hair. “These haircuts wouldn’t pass military muster, believe me,” he says, jovially, “although I shouldn’t talk – my hair’s getting a little shaggy, too. Better not get too close to you. They’ll think I’m part of the band!” As the gig gets under way, with the audience sitting at tables and holding their hands over their ears while they try to chat, it becomes clear that the venue is totally unsuitable. One of the band smashes his guitar and storms off the stage. Willard’s talent for improvised dialogue made him perfect for his role and he was able to draw on two years’ experience in the army. “I knew the military sensibility,” he recalled. “The guy’s trying to fit in. He was the entertainment director – he wanted to seem like a regular guy.” After his debut, Willard became an informal member of the repertory company of actors that Guest directed in a string of subsequent films. In Waiting for Guffman (1996), Willard played a travel agent who stars with his wife (Catherine O’Hara) alongside other Missouri residents in an amateur stage production. While doing for small-town acting troupes what This is Spinal Tap did for rock bands, the film retains an affection for those it satirises. Best in Show (2000) was more blunt, homing in on bizarre dog owners and their neurotic pets taking part in a kennel club competition, with Willard as the TV commentator. “To think that in some countries these dogs are eaten,” he remarks, deadpan. His inappropriate comments also include musing about whether bribes would sway the judges and pointing out a dog trying to hump the leg of its owner. Music was back in the spotlight for A Mighty Wind (2003), about three acts from the 1960s folk revival staging a memorial concert decades later for their much-loved promoter. In his best buffoon mode, Willard plays the failed comedian-turned-road manager of the New Main Street Singers who laughs at his own jokes as he tries to get himself into the spotlight with a stream of lame punchlines and the catchphrase “Wha’ Happened?”. For Your Consideration (2006) had Hollywood itself in Guest’s sights and was less mockumentary in its straight parody of unknown actors experiencing the Oscar buzz after making a low-budget period drama. Willard steals the show once more as the TV entertainment news show host visiting the set and providing laughs with his vacuous questions and “fauxhawk” hairstyle. Mascots (2016), Willard’s last film with Guest, premiered on Netflix, with humans – not dogs this time – fighting to win a contest. The director’s inspiration proved to be flagging, but Willard gave the picture one of its funniest scenes as a mascot coach interrogating Brad Williams, a dwarf actor, with dubious questions about how he manages to fit into his worm outfit. Other directors utilised Willard’s comedy skills, most effectively Adam McKay in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), with Willard cast as the director of a San Diego television news channel alongside Will Ferrell. In one scene, he tells a journalist that his schoolboy son “was on something called acid and was firing a bow and arrow into a crowd”, adding: “You know how kids are!” Willard also made cameo appearances in endless television sitcoms, had a run of eight episodes in Roseanne (1995-97) as Scott, the star’s houseguest rekindling an old relationship, and was nominated for Emmy awards for his performances as fathers in Everybody Loves Raymond (Hank MacDougall, 2003-05) and Modern Family (Frank Dunphy, 2009-20).  Born in Shaker Heights, Ohio, to Ruth (nee Weinman) and Frederick Willard, a bank employee, Fred attended the Kentucky Military Institute and the Virginia Military Institute before army service in Germany. After his two-year draft, he headed to New York. On a drama course there he teamed up with Gus Mocerino, who changed his name to Vic Grecco, and together they wrote sketches and formed the comedy duo Willard & Grecco, appearing in clubs and on TV entertainment shows until they split up in 1968. While continuing with stand-up comedy, Willard started to get small acting roles on screen. His breakthrough came with Fernwood Tonight (1977), a satire on talk shows, when he played Jerry Hubbard, sidekick to Martin Mull’s smarmy host, Barth Gimble, giving a taste of what was to come. However, he had to wait another seven years before his role in Spinal Tap and the subsequent Guest comedies made him one of the most loved American comedy actors and a regular on late-night chat shows. He was reunited with Guest when he played Mike Morton, Ed Begley Jr’s crude neighbour, in the 2013 sitcom Family Tree.  In 1968, Willard married Mary Lovell, a playwright; she died in 2018. He is survived by their daughter, Hope."
"If there has ever been a movie with greater pre-release fanboy goodwill than Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith enjoyed, it is hard to remember it. George Lucas’s epic finale to his misguided prequel trilogy about Anakin Skywalker’s transformation into Darth Vader was released in cinemas 15 years ago this week, and it is still possible to recall the palpable sense from acolytes of the space saga that this time ... surely, this time ... they would get it right. We really should have known better. Episodes I and II had already come and gone over the previous six years with the highs of pre-release buzz followed by the lows of crushing disappointment. Why should Revenge of the Sith be any different? Still, the whole point of Star Wars is blind faith in the cosmic divine, so you can forgive us for holding on to a little bit of hope. Part of the reason Revenge of the Sith summoned up fresh reserves of positive thinking was the subject matter. At some point, we were going to see Hayden Christensen’s Anakin actually becoming Darth Vader, with all the attendant, juicy horrors of this final, grisly metamorphosis. It was hard to imagine the kid-friendly veneer of The Phantom Menace being transferred to a sequel with such a dark and torrid story – a once bright-eyed young Jedi devolving into a hideous, black-carapaced death cyborg. There also ought to have been a bit more actually going on than in the glacially paced Attack of the Clones, a placeholder of a movie if there ever was one. I can’t remember if we already knew, prior to release, that Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the one to maim his former young apprentice and leave him burning in agony on the lava-strewn shores of Mustafar, but everyone had a pretty good idea there would be a climactic Jedi battle between former allies at some point. Finally some genuine action and an escape from the previous episode’s obsession with the galactic senate, which made watching Clones a soporific experience – like tuning into Star Wars’ equivalent of the BBC Parliament channel. In the end, it’s this acceleration of the stakes that makes Revenge of the Sith the best of the prequel episodes, even if this is far from a recommendation and there are still far too many scenes in the senate. The Mustafar scene is brilliantly memorable, and Anakin’s grooming by Ian McDiarmid’s Palpatine/Darth Sidious is satisfying enough, thanks to the Scottish actor’s ability to flip from elegant Jekyll to furniture-chewing Hyde in the flash of a lightsaber. There is a reason McGregor is coming back as Kenobi for a TV show set before the events of the original 1977 Star Wars: throughout Revenge of the Sith and earlier prequels he is a rock of quiet charisma. To retain enough Star Wars gravitas that fans can’t wait to see you return as the Jedi master, despite having appeared as the same character in three deeply flawed movies, is quite something. Unfortunately, there is also a reason why Christensen’s career has nosedived since 2005. He was the weak link that sank the whole trilogy. The tale of Anakin’s transformation into Vader, on paper, has the scale of Shakespearean tragedy, yet watching the prequels is a bit like travelling to Stratford-on-Avon in anticipation of world-class theatre to find a daytime TV star playing the lead. Instead of eliciting horror and awe, the final scene in which we see what remains of Anakin’s ravaged torso encased in the infamous “mini-Darth armour” evokes only scorn. It is impossible to believe that this callow whinger has any relation to the iconic villain of the original trilogy. There are dozens of other reasons why Revenge of the Sith doesn’t pass muster, of course – Natalie Portman’s inability to find any sort of chemistry with Christensen, Lucas’s obsession with sterile CGI, the dreary staleness of the Jedi Council – but he is the nail in the coffin. That a film-maker who managed to discover Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford chose this guy to lead the final two episodes in his prequel triptych tells you everything you need to know about what’s become of Star Wars’ creator."
"KiKi Layne, 28, made her film debut as the female lead, Tish, in Barry Jenkins’s acclaimed 2018 drama If Beale Street Could Talk, a story of young love and institutional racism in 1970s New York. The actor’s new film, The Old Guard, is adapted from a comic-book series, and sees her star alongside Charlize Theron as part of an elite squad of mercenaries. Layne lives in Los Angeles. The Old Guard is a very different film from If Beale Street Could Talk. Was that part of the appeal?Oh, absolutely. I’ve always wanted to do a big, kick-ass action film, and I was excited for the opportunity to do something obviously so different from Beale Street. A sense of: “Whoa, I didn’t know Tish could do all that!” And I definitely never trained like this before. We seriously would spend hours a day training, learning all types of new stuff. Getting my ass whupped! But I’m like: “I’ll come back for more!” Did you enjoy the training or was it a slog?OK, so the weapons training and stunts and choreography, that all was dope. The gym training, not so much. I’m like: “Uhhhh, my goodness…” On social media, you’ve used the hashtag strongblacklead to describe your character, Nile. She’s been developed from the original comics, built up for the film version – was that important for you?Definitely. For me, when trying to pick projects, my biggest goal is to be a part of stories and roles where historically Hollywood has left actresses that look like me out of the conversation, whether it’s just black actresses, period, or dark-skinned black actresses. Finding roles that satisfy the little black girl in me, things that I just didn’t see myself being represented as, growing up. So my aim is just to break that wide open. A lot of The Old Guard was shot in the UK. Were there any high or low points from the shoot?The strangest thing for me was people driving on the other side of the road. Because even if I told my brain, “Girl, look both ways”, my brain just could not calculate that thought. And I did not drink that much tea before I got to London and now I will fill up a cabinet in my kitchen with, like, so many teas. So yeah, I have a tea problem. The Old Guard has a female director, two female stars and a lot of female department heads, behind the scenes. Do you think this has an impact on the finished product?If you’re good at your job, you’re good at your job regardless of being male, female, whatever. Either you’re a good director or you’re not, and there are plenty of bad male directors. But it was really beautiful that on both sides of the film, we’re showing we can do things. It’s marketable when we do it. It’s successful when we do it. So what is your excuse for not giving us the job? Many of the themes of If Beale Street Could Talk resonate with George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests. What have you felt watching that situation unfold?All the emotions. Just everything. Especially after it first happened, it just seemed like every day there was something new. Every day, there’s a new name, a new video. It’s just hard because we are experiencing some form of grief and then it just keeps being added to. But some of the light that I’ve seen in all of this darkness is that this movement is expanding beyond just calling out police brutality. Now we’re calling out instances of racism, prejudice, discrimination in all these different areas of life and all these different organisations and industries. So that’s been a source of light for me. You’ve talked about holding the door open for others to follow you. How can you do that?I definitely want to get into producing. I want to be on the side of the table where I can give people jobs. Because the thing with being an actor [laughs] is there’s really not that much power. You’re just waiting around, staring at your phone, like, “Er, will somebody think I’m good at my job today?” And I can’t live the rest of my life like that. Later this year, you’re in Coming 2 America, the sequel to the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy. What can you say about your character Meeka?Oh my goodness, Meeka, she is a powerful woman! So, I’m Prince Akeem’s and Lisa’s eldest daughter and let’s just say I am therefore the rightful heir to the throne of Zamunda. Honestly, it still hasn’t hit me yet. I’m gonna have to actually see the film and then I think it’s going to hit me like: “Girl, you are Eddie Murphy’s daughter!” What films, TV or books have you enjoyed in lockdown?This docuseries on Netflix called Rotten about the food industry, it’s super-interesting. And then I rewatched [Nickelodeon animated series] Avatar: The Last Airbender. I binged it all over again. And I’ve just started watching [Japanese anime series] Naruto. So I’m all over the place: deep docuseries, cartoons… that’s where I’m at. But honestly, I haven’t sat still this long since 2018, since before Beale Street came out. It seriously took this pandemic just to sit my butt down.  The Old Guard is on Netflix now"
"Normally, newspaper articles have a very short shelf life – quickly read on the day of publication and subsequently either entirely forgotten or left to linger vaguely in the readers’ subconscious. It is rare for news reports to inspire an artistic response, and almost certainly unprecedented for a piece to result in 50 actors reading out 50 paragraphs from a Guardian article. The anger about the treatment of Britain’s Windrush generation remains so intense, however, that a group of actors collaborated during lockdown to organise the recording of 50 mini-biographies of people whose lives were shattered by the Home Office scandal. The resulting half-hour film – Windrush Betrayal – offers a powerful insight into the intensity of mistreatment by government officials, amplifying the voices of those affected with a much more potent emotional punch than the pared-back article I wrote in March could ever have done. A few days before Britain went into lockdown on 23 March, a forensic 275-page official review into the Windrush scandal was published. The Lessons Learned report by Wendy Williams set out the scale of what went wrong and all the steps the government needed to take to ensure that the Home Office’s mistakes could never be repeated and that justice was secured for thousands of UK residents who were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants, with catastrophic consequences. Unfortunately, concern about the worsening pandemic meant that the report received scant attention. Lanna Joffrey, a London-based Iranian-born actor, was so dismayed at seeing the issue comprehensively buried that she embarked on an ambitious project. She worked with the actor Martina Laird, who was born in Trinidad and is familiar from numerous television roles, to persuade 49 other black British actors to record a very tight summary explaining how each individual had seen their life upended by the Home Office, with some facing deportation and others homelessness and destitution. It took the words verbatim from an article published in the Guardian to preview the report, headlined “Lambs to the slaughter”: 50 lives ruined by the Windrush scandal. Joffrey took on the role of Margaret O’Brien (one of the few white people misclassified as an illegal alien), alongside actors such as Paapa Essiedu (currently starring in the TV drama I May Destroy You; he also played Hamlet with the Royal Shakespeare Company), Paterson Joseph (who had a leading role in the TV dramatisation of Malorie Blackman’s Noughts + Crosses) and the Harry Potter star Alfred Enoch. It is an unusual project, probably only made possible by lockdown, during which actors saw months’ worth of projects cancelled. Joffrey, Laird and the actor Lewis Hart, who edited the film, were happy to immerse themselves in the exercise to replace the disappearance of their professional lives. The restrictions of lockdown somehow add to the power of the project, with each actor memorising their lines and recording straight to camera in their homes, traces of their bathrooms and kitchens in the background. Laird describes it as “lockdown aesthetic”, characterised by the limitations of recording a clip from your home. “It’s an extension of how social media empowers individual voices, so that you are able to put out material that has been home-recorded. There’s a certain look that people respond to, without it being about great lighting or sound. There is a sincerity because it is so immediate and unfiltered,” Laird says. The fury and incredulity felt by the actors at the absurd and cruel treatment meted out by the Home Office pours from the screen in each short clip, delivering one blow after another to viewers. I found it painful to watch. Joffrey was driven to launch the project because the experiences of those affected chimed with the difficulties her family went through after fleeing Iran – first to England and later to the US – and never feeling fully accepted. “These people were betrayed by the country they settled in,” she says. “My family experienced racism in the UK and in the States during their complicated immigration history. These experiences are repeated all over the world.” It was easy to persuade people to participate. Although most actors were aware of the scandal, they had missed the publication of the Lessons Learned review. Laird emailed people she had worked with or admired, telling them: “The Windrush report was released just as lockdown was called, which distracted from the indictment of government that it contained. It means that these stories have been largely overshadowed and the destruction to people’s lives is still unaddressed.” Almost everyone agreed immediately. “So many people had not seen the review and that’s what hurt. So many people did not know what their own community was going through; that’s partly down to pride and shame, which is a very powerful tool. Parents don’t want to go on about the negative experiences that they went through,” she says. Many of those involved were very moved by the apparently simple act of reading out a few sentences. The uncle of Jessye Romeo (who appeared in Idris Elba’s semi-autobiographical comedy In the Long Run) was one of those affected, and you can hear her anger as she reads a summary of his experiences of being told he faced arrest and removal to Antigua, a country he had left 59 years earlier. Another actor revealed that his brother was in the process of trying to gather documentation that he was here legally, after decades in the UK. “It was taxing for them emotionally and it is arduous to sit and watch from the beginning to the end,” Laird says, but she stresses that there is a clear purpose to the disturbing nature of the content. “I’m sometimes troubled by the exploitation of black pain and how it is used in entertainment, when we see racism on stage and television without regard. We hope the pain here is not just exploited for some kind of diversion, but that it is directed by the appeal for something to be done. It is absolutely meant to engage people with these stories and people’s lives and make the viewer feel that something must change.”"
"The long-anticipated showdown between the Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard opens in a British courtroom on Tuesday in a libel trial that will subject his international reputation to forensic legal scrutiny. Highly embarrassing allegations about the former couple’s private lives have already spilled out during bitter pre-trial hearings in which the Pirates of the Caribbean actor tried to stop Heard from attending court until she is due to give evidence. The legal drama, scheduled to run for three weeks, is being spaced out across five courts in the Royal Courts of Justice due to the need to respect social distancing. The cost in lawyers’ fees and court facilities will run into millions, though any damages eventually awarded are likely to be far lower. Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) and the Sun’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article published in 2018 that referred to the film star as a “wife beater”. The article related to allegations made against Depp by Heard, 34, that he was violent towards her during their marriage. He strenuously denies the claims and is also pursuing her in a separate libel battle over the issue in the US. Both Heard and Depp are expected to attend the London trial, having, it is believed, already travelled to the UK from their homes in California and France respectively. Depp’s lawyers will seek to prove the Sun’s allegations are not true and amount to “serious harm” as defined in the Defamation Act 2013. They are likely to argue that the accusations of abuse have lost him lucrative film roles. Originally due to begin in March, the case was delayed due to Covid-19. Witnesses expected to give evidence include Depp‘s former partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder. NGN, which will call Heard to defend its story, attempted to have the case struck out last week on the grounds that Depp had not disclosed key text messages. That appeal was dismissed. The newspaper says it is relying on 14 separate allegations of domestic violence, between early 2013 and May 2016, in its defence. Courtroom accusations have already featured claims that Heard had “two extra-marital affairs” or “extra-relationship affairs” with Elon Musk and the actor James Franco while she was with Depp. Depp has been accused of trying to obtain drugs during a visit to Australia when he allegedly texted an assistant seeking “happy pills” and “whitey stuff”, which was said to refer MDMA and cocaine. The couple met in 2011 on the set of the comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in 2015. The following year, Heard obtained a restraining order against Depp after accusing him of abuse, which he denied. The couple settled their divorce out of court in 2017. Heard donated her $7m (£5.5m) settlement to charity. The high court case will be heard by Mr Justice Nicol, with NGN represented by Adam Wolanski QC and Depp by the barrister David Sherborne. Emily Cox, a partner at Stewarts law firm and an expert in defamation cases, said: “This is a critical case for Depp as his entire career is at risk, as well as his personal reputation and standing among his adoring fans across the globe. “It’s unlikely he is pursuing the claim for financial reasons alone as damages for libel in England rarely surpass £100,000, although that is not beyond the realms of possibility in a case of this nature. Sometimes the libel courts may be the only route for someone to clear their name, and London is an attractive place for celebrities to bring claims as English defamation laws are known to be claimant-friendly. “The stakes for Depp are high: Hollywood has ignored and sanctioned some despicable behaviour by celebrities in the past, but a new wind is blowing through Tinseltown as well as society as a whole. It is likely to be crucial for Depp that he clears his name.”"
"Clark Duke was best known as a peripheral member of that Superbad crew of gauchely charming leading men, along with the likes of Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. As might be expected, he does a better job of utilising his own talents in his directorial debut, a meandering crime yarn, set in and named after Duke’s home state. Adapted from a 2008 novel by John Brandon, Arkansas is about two unambitious but conscientious crooks, Swin (Duke) and Kyle (Liam Hemsworth), who sometimes idly wonder about the meaning of it all, but mostly get on with the business of trafficking drugs across state lines. When surprise events force them to pursue a face-to-face meet with their organisation’s mysterious kingpin, Frog, they set about climbing the corporate ladder with old-fashioned American chutzpah.  Not much about this film is original, but the buddy-pairing of two equally competent criminals is something we haven’t seen too often. For cool-headed Kyle, turning up two dead bodies on the property is “just a busy day”. If the year were 1999, Arkansas would have a good shot at nabbing a special jury prize at Sundance and perhaps the cover of Neon magazine. It’s 2020, though, so the red-on-black screen titles that introduce each “chapter” feel like a tired gimmick and the influence of Quentin Tarantino, the Coen brothers, Kevin Smith, et al, is palpable throughout. That’s no bad thing in terms of the dialogue, especially as delivered by such consummate genre veterans as Vivica A Fox and Michael K Williams. In the end, though, as a collection of smart-mouthed southern ne’er-do-wells, Arkansas amuses, but as a showcase for colourful 70s menswear, it excels. Vince Vaughn hasn’t looked this sharp since Swingers.  Arkansas is available on digital platforms from 13 July. "
"The film industry has its elite squad of composers who can produce a complete orchestral score at the request of a director – and if necessary conduct it too – intuiting almost by magic what is needed and doing this with miraculous fluency and speed. These are composers who are sometimes trusted simply to compose the music without sight of any screenplay draft, composers whose work really is the screenplay, and around whose music the film is partly shaped in the edit suite. There are great names like Hans Zimmer, Alexandre Desplat, John Williams, Mica Levi and Lesley Barber. But the great ancestor of the modern film music is the Italian master Ennio Morricone, who created a staggering 500 scores over a passionate and inexhaustibly creative career spanning 50 years – working with directors such as Gillo Pontecorvo, Terrence Malick, Roland Joffé, Brian De Palma, Giuseppe Tornatore, Barry Levinson, Quentin Tarantino and of course, Sergio Leone, with whose epic, mythic westerns he will be forever associated – although he would often sharply remind interviewers that these constituted just a fraction of his output. It was a surprise that his first Oscar for best original score only came in 2016 when he was 88 (11 years after he was presented with his honorary Oscar, the point at which film grandees are assumed to have gone into retirement). This was for Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight. It was a glorious achievement, as his score for that movie was so striking and catchy. The great film composers arguably work on three levels: at bottom, their music provides a kind of deep texture to a film, something felt, not consciously heard by the audience; at a higher level, their composition works in counterpoint to a scene, sometimes working with and sometimes against the ostensible mood; and at the level above that there are the hummable tunes that break the surface of the score. Morricone could naturally do all of them. His most famous work foregrounded unconventional instruments like harmonicas, whistles and cowbells, he created inspirational melodic voices and so he was often closer to what might be called a songwriter. Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars in 1964, featuring Clint Eastwood’s legendary gunfighter, gave us one of Morricone’s most haunting scores, with its plaintive and slightly nasal mariachi trumpets that declaimed a robust Aranjuez pastiche. The main theme had its ghostly and desolate whip-poor-will whistling cries, whipcracks, bells, eerie percussive shouts. Morricone brilliantly created the mood, the style, the rhetoric of the film, just with the music. Two years later, Morricone worked on Gillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers, and established his own authority, but also his creative diplomacy. He rejected Pontecorvo’s own musical ideas, and in the course of their subsequent rather strained discussion about the score, Morricone found himself listening to a weird little tune Pontecorvo was humming. He turned that into the “Theme of Ali”, the arrestingly subtle, delicate four-note motif performed on a flute that is heard when the insurgent Ali is arrested. Pontecorvo loved the theme, and Morricone didn’t tell him where it came from, but tactfully consented to a musical co-credit for the director. A very different musical score was his work on Joffé’s The Mission in 1986, and one of his biggest popular smashes: the main theme, Gabriel’s Oboe, denoting Jeremy Irons’s 18th-century Jesuit priest Father Gabriel attempting to use his oboe to beguile the indigenous tribes and convert them to Christianity. The theme itself – for oboe, of course – is very much not inspired by 18th-century music (maybe closer to Tchaikovsky?) but certainly an overwhelmingly seductive and rich melody, with that shrewdly measured spoonful of sugar that Morricone knew how to add. His music for Cinema Paradiso in 1988, composed with his son Andrea, gives full rein to a swirlingly emotional Italianate extravagance. The main themes are for piano, strings and saxophone and they are there to carry the wistful ideas of melancholy and nostalgia. For me personally, this sweet trolley is a little bit overburdened, but it was a devastatingly effective musical accompaniment and this sad, unashamedly sentimental picture wouldn’t have half the impact without the inspirational supercharge of poignancy in the score. Morricone’s colossal output was redoubled by the fact that it was always being re-used in movies and TV, a vivid open resource of musical emotion. Tarantino (a devoted fan) reused many of his potent 70s themes in his Inglourious Basterds and got from him a fantastic original song for his Django Unchained – Ancora Qui – sung by its lyricist Elisa Toffoli, hauntingly desolate over a strumming guitar. For me, Morricone’s song here is a great example of his wonderful gift for melodrama in music, a thrilling musical ability to go straight for the emotional jugular. And then, of course, Morricone actually composed a score for Tarantino, and gave us his late masterpiece, L’Ultima Diligenza Per Red Rock (or Last Stage to Red Rock) , the opening theme from Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, a seven-minute suite with crashing brass and confrontationally piercing and aggressive string themes that absorbed theme-variations from his previous scores from John Carpenter’s The Thing. It is disturbing, harsh and jagged with the nightmarish “human shout” motif that fans remembered from his spaghetti western work, and yet weirdly hummable. Morricone was an extraordinary creative force in cinema."
"The long career of the actor Earl Cameron, who has died aged 102, mirrored changes in both British cinema and society. His debut, playing a West Indian merchant seaman, was in the ostensibly modest film noir Pool of London (1951). In retrospect it can be seen as a milestone in its depiction of a relationship between a black worker and a young white woman – the first time the subject had been sensitively handled in a British film. Cameron went on “against the odds”, he once remarked, to act in some 40 features, plus many TV series, including Danger Man and The Prisoner, dramas including Waking the Dead and TV movies, notably Edward Albee’s The Death of Bessie Smith (1965) and The Great Kandinsky (1995). His big screen roles ranged from James Bond’s secret service minder Pinder in Thunderball (1965) to the dictatorial president in Sydney Pollack’s thriller The Interpreter (2005). Cameron was born in Pembroke, Bermuda, the youngest of six children of Arthur and Edith, and began acting in his late teens, subsequently joining the merchant navy and becoming a member of the forces’ entertainment organisation Ensa – as a song-and-dance man – during the second world war. He settled in Britain and worked in repertory before his auspicious debut, produced and directed by the pioneering team of Michael Relph and Basil Dearden, at Ealing Studios, in London. The blend of a thriller about smuggling and an inter-racial romance was in direct line with the documentary movement of the 1930s and the more realistic feature films of the war years. He moved quickly into the role of a fairground boxer in an even grittier and more atmospheric thriller, There Is Another Sun (also known as Wall of Death, 1951), and was again a boxer in the B-movie Emergency Call (AKA The Hundred Hour Hunt, 1952), as a man reluctant to help a sick white child, despite the fact that he is one of only three people found with a matching blood group. Inevitably, there were not enough home-grown roles to keep him busy and he was often on location, in reality or via studio mock-ups. After The Heart of the Matter (1953), he was again in Africa for larger parts in two films about the Mau Mau, Simba (1955), starring Dirk Bogarde, and a year later in the energetic Safari, shot on location. In the family adventure Odongo (1956), he and the rest of the cast were secondary to the wildlife and scenery. He took the pivotal role in the thriller The Heart Within (1957), set in London playing a West Indian fugitive dependent on the kindness of strangers, including a perky teenager played by David Hemmings. He was a lawyer in the over earnest The Mark of the Hawk (1957), with Sidney Poitier, and a doctor whose sister is murdered on Hampstead Heath in Sapphire (1959). The plot of the latter hinges on the fact that the sister has been passing as a white person and the killing is racially motivated. Made by Relph and Dearden and written by Janet Green, it was another important – if timid by today’s standards – examination of British society. In Flame in the Streets (1961), Cameron played a shop steward victimised at work and defended by a trade union leader (John Mills) who turns out to be less liberal when his daughter wants to marry a Jamaican teacher. After this modest work and the controversial Term of Trial (1962), starring Laurence Olivier, Cameron was back on location in two Tarzan films, but his “journey” was more worthwhile for Guns at Batasi (1964), set in a newly independent African state, where an insurrection is less than well handled by resident British forces. Cameron made the most of a strong role as Captain Abraham, who is called upon to take charge of the chaotic situation. He moved to Nassau for Thunderball, playing a local agent called in to assist an especially crusty Bond (Sean Connery). Such parts in big-budget productions were rare and he was on the buses as a conductor in the music hall-inspired The Sandwich Man (1966) and then a verger in the Cliff Richard vehicle Two a Penny (1967). There was more fun to be had as an army sergeant in Battle Beneath the Earth (1967) and as the father in Two Gentlemen Sharing (1969), about an aristocratic Brit and a Jamaican lawyer sharing a flat to general bemusement. Cameron was in the US for the Jon Voight film The Revolutionary (1970) and seemingly in Havana for the undervalued Cuba (1979), set at the time of Castro’s revolution. His role as an army colonel reunited him with Connery. Between these movies he worked on a film about the prophet Muhammad, The Message (1976). He was again a doctor in Déjà Vu (1997) and elevated to the role of cardinal in Revelation (2001), before regularly appearing in the TV series Babyfather. Cameron was a redeeming aspect of the implausible The Interpreter, as President Zuwanie – seemingly to be assassinated at the UN building in New York. His authoritative presence lent dignity to a fragile storyline and showed that none of the magnetism apparent in his debut 54 years previously had diminished. He had a small but juicy role in The Queen (2006), as the official portrait painter; and another small role in the high profile Inception (2010).  He was appointed CBE in 2009. Cameron’s first wife, Audrey (nee Godowski), whom he married in 1954, died in 1994. He is survived by his second wife, Barbara (nee Bower), the five children, Simon, Jane, Serena, Helen and Phillipa, of his first marriage, and Quinton, his eldest son, from an earlier relationship, with Marjorie Astwood; and eight grandchildren, Louisa, Kalan, Siria, Sophie, Isabella, Fiorella, Karmeta and Kelly, and two great-grandchildren, Kasra and Zander."
"Lockout – a schlocky, daft and quite exceptionally loud 2012 sci-fi action flick from the trashier end of Luc Besson’s mind palace – is the kind of film that went out of fashion around the time Bruce Willis hung up, and then hopefully burned, the filthy white vest that made him a household name. The year is 2079. Guy Pearce plays Snow, a moody, wise-quipping, hard-smoking CIA tough guy who’s sent to infiltrate an in-orbit penal colony after the hitherto on-ice prisoners – wouldn’t you know it? – escape, overrun the facility and take the president’s daughter hostage. Why was she there, you ask? Oh, because of reasons. Important ones. As is generally also the way with such films, Snow has been framed for a crime he didn’t commit, and the key to clearing his name lies in the addled mind of one of these emancipated inmates. Also: because of reasons. None of them matter. Quiet now. If all this sounds slightly familiar, it’s because Lockout does, admittedly, contain as many artistic innovations as a Michael Ball Christmas album. Basically Demolition Man mulched with huge dollops of John Carpenter’s Escape from New York. The premise certainly sounded familiar to Carpenter: he sued Lockout’s production company for plagiarism in 2015. Tellingly, he won. So Lockout isn’t remotely, even legally, original. It’s also bookended by action sequences containing some of the most inexplicably dismal CGI since The Rock became a giant, clammy scorpion. Why then, given all of this opprobrium, am I recommending it? Well, because with the right sort of hat on – ideally one of those plastic Thirst Aid ones with a can of beer wedged on each side – Lockout is a silly, unabashed hoot from start to finish. Just don’t think about it too much. Central to the whole thing is Pearce’s Snow, pitched just short enough of repellently pugnacious to be endearingly wise-cracking company. He punches, he shoots, he quips, he smokes. That’s his entire personality, there, written almost literally on the back of a fag packet. He’s a puddle-deep hero of a bygone cinematic age. Pearce, and the production as a whole, appear fully aware of the preposterously atavistic nature both of Snow’s character, and the film they’re making – “No one smokes any more!” an exasperated Lennie James shouts at one point. Lockout never descends into tiresome irony in the same way the sequels to its most blatant tonal influences – Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Beverly Hills Cop – did, but there is a pleasing undercurrent that, if there is a joke here, both the movie and the audience are in on the same one. Your standard lone-hero actioner is only ever as good as its villain, of course, and this is where Lockout unleashes its piece-de-resistance. Most of the prisoners are cookie-cutter punch-sponges, there to expire in ways of varying levels of explosive dismemberment. The ostensible Big Bad is Vincent Regan’s Glaswegian hardcase Alex. But it’s his little brother, Hydell, played by the always sensational Joe Gilgun, who not only steals any scene he’s in, but also walks away with the entire film, its jewellery, and anything else that isn’t nailed down. Gilgun plays the tattooed, silver-toothed, mohawked psychopath with a splenetic mixture of menace and childish mischief that’s never anything less than a joy. To say he makes the most of the material isn’t quite doing it justice – Gilgun manages to make a ballgown out of a snotty hanky, and seems to have enormous fun doing it. The two-star reviews levelled upon the film aren’t entirely unwarranted. Maggie Grace, as the first daughter, Emilie, is woefully underserved by the no-frills script, existing merely as foil for Snow’s pithy jibes. There’s a general whiff of old-school misogyny, too – perhaps understandable given the movie’s prison setting, but one the film would have been just as enjoyable without. The whole thing ends with an almighty squelch rather than a bang. And there isn’t really a single surprise in it. It’s action by the numbers, and Lockout counts those numbers on its fingers. And yet, somehow, it works. It’s shameless, dribble-chinned retro fun. In not so much overcoming its shortcomings as simply ignoring them, Lockout succeeds in being all it ever wants to be: an action film that will whisk you away for a lean 94 minutes of Guy Pearce punching people in the middle of the face and Joe Gilgun gnawing on the doorframes. If a worthy, black-and-white drama with subtitles is a nutritious superfood salad, Lockout is a giant sloppy burger served alongside a turquoise alcopop with a sparkler in it. You wouldn’t want it every day, because you’d die, but not before you became very stupid. But as a treat, every now and then, as part of a balanced diet? Dig in. Every now and then it’s good to do something fun that does you absolutely no good whatsoever. Like a big, thick dog with its foot in its mouth, Lockout just wants to entertain you. Isn’t that enough sometimes?"
"Name: Elmer Fudd. Age: 83. Appearance: Hunting gear, brown and red hat, double-barrelled shotgun. Permanently frustrated, frequently injured. Name rings a bell, remind me. “Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I’m hunting wabbits. Huh-huh-huh-huh.” Got it! The hunter in Bugs Bunny, right? Right.  What was the name of BB’s other gun-totin’ adversary, with the big droopy orange moustache? Yosemite Sam. This is about him, too.  What is? What’s up, doc? Sam and Elmer are no longer packing. Not going on holiday? Because of Covid-19? No, they are no long totin’ guns. They have been disarmed? Who by? Warner Bros, which has just relaunched Looney Tunes, the cartoon series in which they appeared, with a new collection of shorts streaming on HBO Max. And have Elmer and Sam been stripped of their weapons in response to out-of-control US gun violence? Exactly. “We’re not doing guns,” the executive producer of the new series, Peter Browngardt, told the New York Times. If they are not doing guns, what are they doing? There is still plenty of “cartoon violence”, Browngardt says reassuringly, acknowledging that the whole thing is based on conflict. So there’s dynamite and explosions, while Elmer’s shotgun has been replaced with a scythe. That’s pretty violent! Also arguably scarier, with its Grim Reaper associations, than the gun. Not really the point. Scythe culture isn’t a thing in America, nor has scythe crime ravaged the country.  Not yet! But if that happens Looney Tunes will have a lot to answer for. Also, if they are making it more acceptable for a 21st-century audience, could they have maybe changed the name? Or at least corrected the spelling? They couldn’t spell its sister series Merrie Melodies either, remember? What has the reaction been like? Like all reactions these days – polarised. Some praise for Warner Bros for taking a stance. Plenty of accusations of snowflakery. Dr Jacqeuline Antonovich tweeted: “I can’t believe this needs to be said, but Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd were never responsible gun owners anyway.”  Any other examples of franchises making adjustments? Either as recognition that times have changed or political correctness gone mad, depending on which pole you happen to be standing on? As it happens yes. Last year, Disney put warnings on some of its older films, that they “may contain outdated cultural depictions”. Do say (as Bugs Bunny did): “Don’t take life too seriously. You’ll never get out alive!” Don’t say: “My wight to bear arms has be viowated. I been tol’ I can’ shoot wittle gway wabbits no more, but I wike this scythe. Be vewy vewy afwaid, say ya pwayers, huh-huh-huh-huh …”"
"In 2000, after a decade of caring for his ailing mother in her large flat in Rome, Gianni Di Gregorio wrote a comedy about a bloke called Gianni who looks after his 93-year-old mother in a large flat in Rome. No one was interested in the story, in which the unemployed bachelor ends up running around after a cohort of old ladies whose spirit and vigour remain undimmed despite various ailments. Everyone thought he was crazy: who would be interested in a funny film about four old women and a middle-aged bloke? Then, after a life working in the theatre and as an assistant director, Di Gregorio co-wrote the celebrated mafia drama, Gomorrah, with Matteo Garrone, and his fortune changed. Garrone encouraged him to resurrect his earlier film idea and offered to produce while Di Gregorio starred and directed. Mid-August Lunch – a gorgeous, unsentimental comedy in which the collective naughtiness of the old ladies entertains more with each viewing – went on to win the debut director prize at the Venice film festival in 2008 and became an Italian arthouse hit.  Two more films starring “Gianni” followed: The Salt of Life, the celebrated sequel to Mid-August Lunch, in which Gianni’s 96-year-old on-screen mother plays poker with her friends while her son laments his increasing invisibility to women (without, thank God, ever being lascivious) and the lesser known Good for Nothing, in which Gianni is a put-upon civil servant who has to learn to say no. And now there is Citizens of the World, a tender comedy in which yet another version of Gianni – this time a retired Latin professor – plots with two other pensioners to move to a country where their state pensions will go further. Until, that is, a young African migrant makes them rethink their plans.  When I first met Di Gregorio in 2011, he took me on a tour of Rome in his 40-year-old Fiat 500, rolling cigarettes as the car bumped over the cobbles around the Colosseum and laughing about the fact that Mid-August Lunch could never have been made with old men because “they would have spent the entire film crying and being hypochondriacs! The men you see sitting in the bar in The Salt of Life won’t even go to the cinema to see the film they’re in, whereas the women in Mid-August Lunch were planning trips to Venice.” And yet, during the decade that followed The Salt of Life, he changed his mind and made Citizens of the World. Why? Di Gregorio, now 71, is talking on the phone from the large flat in Rome in which he has lived with his wife and two daughters since his mother’s death; I am immediately reminded of his warmth, humility and throaty laugh. “I will tell you why! Matteo Garrone called me and said, ‘You are the specialist when it comes to making films about old guys. You have to make a film about a group of male pensioners with very small pensions.’ It was such a simple but brilliant idea. There aren’t enough portrayals of adventurous pensioners on screen, nor explorations of friendship between men.”  The various versions of Gianni that Di Gregorio plays in his films allow the director to explore different stages of his life and, as he ages, he is finding himself more like the women planning trips to Venice than the lazy men in the bar. “The older I get, the fewer fears I have. Nowadays 70 is young! There is still so much to do, so much to explore.” In 2011, Di Gregorio told me that he searches for the comedy in life because he is melancholic by nature; he is also very good at using irony to explore ageing, in a similar way to Larry David. Might he even be the Italian Larry David? He laughs. “Grazie! Grazie! I am truly flattered by that comparison. Seeing yourself with irony is particularly important when you’re in your 70s.” Like David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Di Gregorio’s work is about nothing and everything. There is always the portrayal of the everyday in Italy – a glass of white on the pavement outside a bar, a thin slice of pizza a taglio – but, in Citizens of the World, there is also open criticism of the Italian government’s shameful handling of migrants. “While I was writing about the escapades of three pensioners, there were stories on the news every day of migrants arriving in Italy on dinghies or of boats overturning and migrants drowning. I got the idea of a young African guy, Abu, hanging around with the three pensioners because I wanted to explore the notions of acceptance, of tolerance, of welcoming people to our country.” He sighs. “The Italian government has imposed some very harsh laws against migrants and no one seems to know what to do. It also becomes clear in the film that Abu is the one who needs to travel the most, not the three old Romans. Something incredible happened after we finished the film: Salih Saadin Khalid, who plays Abu, is a real migrant and he used the money we paid him to leave Italy and join his family in Canada! It gave us so much joy.” Italy is slowly easing out of lockdown and, after an initial period of “blackout” during which he couldn’t read, write or even watch a movie, Di Gregorio is now desperate to start shooting his next film and to enjoy a glass of wine at his local bar. “Food and wine are in our DNA. Italians always manage to eat well during a crisis, even if they don’t have much money. It’s a consolation.” And, once the pandemic is over, might Di Gregorio consider escaping from Italy like his on-screen alter ego? He laughs, both thrilled and appalled at the idea. “I haven’t managed to yet! I still live in the apartment that my mother once lived in. I don’t have to travel far to make my films. I am completely rooted here in Rome, like an ancient tree.” "
"Star Wars actor John Boyega has expressed his thanks for the “love and support” he received after his high-profile intervention in the Black Lives Matter protests. In a post on social media, Boyega wrote: “This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long-term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next.” Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. “Black lives have always mattered,” Boyega said in his speech. “We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless. And now is the time. I ain’t waiting.” In his social media post Boyega added: “I know you’re all thinking, what’s next? Where do we go from here? Because I’m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible.” Boyega also posted a series of pictures from pre-lockdown visits to schools in the London borough of Southwark, showing him interacting with awestruck pupils. He wrote: “Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let’s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly.”"
"1980: Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk dodges gunfire in bombed-to-rubble streets on the frontline of the Iran-Iraq war. Cut to 2018, and Fisk, nearly 40 years older, hair a little thinner, glasses a little less clunky, is walking through almost identical ruined streets, this time in Homs, Syria. After a lifetime reporting on conflict, Fisk reflects on the capacity of human beings to cause chaos on such a scale. Is there something deep in our souls that permits it because it feels natural? His painful, deeply serious question about the inevitability of war sets the tone of this documentary about his career, directed by Yung Chang. Fisk is defiant against his critics, yet a kind of Graham Greene-like weariness seems to creep in at times. Later he admits: “Mostly I fear that what we write doesn’t make the slightest difference.” As a boy, he dreamed of becoming a foreign correspondent; his parents were dead against it, though his dad softened when Fisk landed a job at the Times as its Northern Ireland correspondent during the Troubles – good training for the Middle East. He transferred to Beirut aged 29 and never left. Witnessing the aftermath of the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982 forged him as a writer: “I’ve never seen so much death.” He parted company with the Times in 1988 to join the Independent after a fallout with Rupert Murdoch over editorial meddling.  Dressed in Marks & Spencer-style pullovers, he looks as if he would be more at home in a Kent garden centre than a war zone – but the sun-worn skin gives him away. Alongside that thoughtful interview and some skilfully edited archive material, the film follows Fisk as he sniffs out stories – following the paper trail of weapons found in Syria to Bosnia, reporting from Idlib and Palestine, and defending himself against criticism of his reporting of the chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Douma in 2018. He has never considered moving on. The Middle East is like a great novel, he says. You sit up reading till midnight, telling yourself, just one more chapter. “It’s a human tragedy. I can’t draw myself from seeing what happens next.”"
"When actor Bryce Dallas Howard started making the documentary Dads, her family was clear: this was not going to be about them. Her father Ron, the Oscar-winning director of A Beautiful Mind, was adamant that he wouldn’t appear on screen, despite having signed on as producer, while her husband, the actor Seth Gabel, told her: “Don’t make this ‘The Howard Show.’” Then, during production, her brother Reed found out he was going to become a parent. “I needed an expectant father in the film,” she tells me. “So I was, like, ‘All bets are off!’” Now her brother, father and late grandfather all feature in the end product, which is as frothy and sweet-smelling as anyone would expect from something made in partnership with Dove Men+Care. With her pale skin, copper hair and faintly febrile manner, the 39-year-old Howard is far more interesting than the film. There’s been an eclectic element to many of her career choices: she took over from Nicole Kidman as Grace, the well-meaning reformer whose good intentions go awry, in Lars von Trier’s harrowing Dogville sequel Manderlay, a disquisition on slavery that was shot, like its predecessor, on a bare sound stage with minimal props. (A final instalment, with Howard and Kidman playing sisters, was proposed by Von Trier but never materialised.) She was haunting in two M Night Shyamalan mysteries, one eerie (The Village), the other disastrous (Lady in the Water), and brought some pep to a run of tired franchises (Spider-Man, Twilight, Terminator, Jurassic World) as well as the odd prestige project. She was central to the only memorable scene in The Help, as the segregationist housewife chowing down on poo pie, and appeared last year as Elton John’s brittle, acidic mother in Rocketman. Her recent career move has occurred without much fanfare. First, she directed the Baby Yoda-heavy fourth episode of the Star Wars spin-off series The Mandalorian – “As a mom, I loved working with Baby,” she coos – and now comes Dads. The documentary begins with Howard announcing that she wants to know more about what it takes to be a father. But when I ask what it was that she learned, her eventual answer (that men don’t get to have baby showers) is less remarkable than the chorus of whoops and exclamations which precedes it: “Right. Um. Ooh. Yeah. Ha! Hoo. What-did-I-learn, what-did-I-learn?” I had hoped to get a glimpse of her bookshelves, which seems the least one might expect now that interviews are conducted remotely, but she is coming to me live from what appears to be a broom cupboard, so I can’t tell if she owns a copy of First Dads, John Kendall’s book about the parenting habits of US presidents. Did she know that Obama is apparently the only president ever to change his children’s nappies? “Woahhh!” she cries, lunging forward so that her face fills the laptop screen. “Normalising dads changing diapers is still somehow revolutionary. The ripple effect is that the father establishes competency, the relationship deepens, and the child learns to rely on father for caregiving tenderness. And the mother gets a break!” What does it mean for her to hear Donald Trump claim that a man who changes diapers is “acting like the wife”? “That indicates a limited imagination,” she says firmly. “The more we can crowd out belief systems that go against the evolution of society, the more we will be left with people acting in a manner that benefits the growth of our children.” Dads is at its strongest during the sections on four domestic setups: two black families and an Asian one, with white fatherhood represented by a gay couple who have taken under their wing an adopted African American brood. Still, it’s hard not to be struck by the ubiquity of filming in some of these households. One father, who hosts a popular video blog about parenting, keeps the camera running even during his children’s tantrums. Another records his teenage daughter sulking and crying, telling her: “My subscribers are gonna love this!” Howard gave arguably her best performance to date in the Nosedive episode of Black Mirror, in which she played a woman cast out by a society where status is determined by social media approval, so she is well-placed to consider what the effect of all this filming might be. “It’s definitely something I thought about. I think it’s most important to be present and connecting and there. What I observed with Glenn, who does the daddy blog, is that he is so incredibly creative as a storyteller, and he has found a way to include his kids in that process. None of us knows what is going to unfold from our relationship with technology. It’s all about how you do things. If you serve someone pasta with love or pasta with an agenda, that pasta’s going to taste different.” She laughs helplessly at herself, building to an infectious screech: “Who’d want pasta with an agenda, right? No one! Hahaha! ‘Hey, what’s with the agenda?’”  All this talk of fathers with cameras brings Howard back to her own childhood. “It makes me think about growing up on my dad’s sets and loving it. Loving it!” She wore the mermaid’s tail on the set of Splash and one of the alien masks during the making of Cocoon. At the age of five, she accompanied her father on a business trip to Japan, where she had dinner with him, George Lucas and Akira Kurosawa; she can still remember falling asleep during the meal, her head resting on her father’s chest as the conversation ebbed and flowed around her. Later, she had walk-on parts in her dad’s films Parenthood, Apollo 13, The Grinch and A Beautiful Mind. “It was the best thing ever because my dad was sharing his passions with us.” Ron Howard is generally considered the industry’s safest pair of hands – he was brought in to finish Solo: A Star Wars Story when the original directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, were sacked – and his daughter suspects he may not have received his due. “I’ve seen folks underestimate his creativity and artistry because of what a great collaborator he is. He really knows how to be in service to the story and he loves actors so much. I’ve been on a lot of movie sets that are not my dad’s and I can tell you he understands film-making.” Her own acting choices have changed radically since she became a mother. Would she turn down something like Manderlay if it were offered to her now? “Possibly. After having kids, the stakes in my life got a lot higher. I can see the ways in which the stories I’m working on have an impact on me emotionally and how that all plays out with my family. I gravitate more toward entertainment that my kids can also be a part of and that I can talk to them about.” Her recent work bears this out: as well as the Jurassic World films (including the third one, currently on hold until social distancing restrictions are lifted), she starred in a remake of the Disney fantasy Pete’s Dragon and did voice work on A Dog’s Way Home. But she’s willing to make the occasional exception. “Black Mirror is psychological horror in a way and yet that was great. Loved it! Practically therapeutic. No problem, not disturbing. It changes in life, the places we’re able to navigate emotionally.” Working on Manderlay, she explains, had a quantifiable physical effect on her. “This may be boring or gross or whatever but I turned 23 while I was making that movie and suddenly I had cystic acne. I’m, like: ‘What?’ Then after the film, it cleared up. And it wasn’t because I’d been wearing a bunch of makeup. It was because of these feelings and what I was needing to sort out within myself. I was having a lovely time with everyone – genuinely loved it. Cross-country skiing with Lars von Trier: highly recommend it. But despite all that, I had internalised the issues of the film.” What doctors might now term Manderlay Syndrome or Von Trier’s Affliction even spilled over into less obviously traumatising material. “When I was doing The Help it was so much fun to be with that group of women and in those friendships; we really felt like family. And I loved getting to do that movie, mostly because my character got what she deserved. But there were a handful of scenes where she was more on top, being quite evil, and I was sick over it. I had this feeling of churning, churning. I thought, ‘What is happening to me? There’s a disruption in my soul right now.’ It was after that movie that I was like, ‘OK. If it seems like the character has all these crazy things to play, it’s going to affect you.’ So now I’m just cautious about the bodies and spirits I inhabit.”"
"Existing in the kind of corporate shark tank that has its own bravado slang for pulling a 48-hour shift takes a particular kind of ruthlessness. Excelling in that world, as Lola (Valerie Pachner) does, takes the kind of control and drive that leaves no margin for error, no leeway for any hint of weakness or failure. Which is why Lola guards the fact that her sister, Conny, has been institutionalised yet again for paranoid schizophrenia, suspecting correctly that Conny’s frailty will taint her own reputation in the eyes of her bosses. But while the chalk and cheese sisters initially seem worlds apart, this tightly focused psychological drama suggests, as Lola starts to lose faith in her own mental strength, that Conny’s hospital and Lola’s sterile conference rooms are not so very different after all. This oppressive, atmospheric Austrian drama takes the kind of alpha female high achiever familiar from Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann, but undermines her with splinters of Hitchcockian paranoia."
"The career of Judd Apatow is a machine that processes the raw material of traumatic life crises – accidental pregnancy, terminal disease, marital breakdown – and retools it into his particular brand of mortifying, unforgiving comic candour, in films such as Knocked Up, Funny People and This Is 40. His latest picture – about childhood bereavement and its lingering aftermath – fits right alongside his preferred themes, but though spiked with dry humour its tone is more pensive and heartfelt, the glib gags traded for harder truths. This more soulful approach stems from the involvement of Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson, who stars in the film and co-wrote it, inking in details from his own life: like the central character, Davidson lost his firefighter father to an accident on the job when he was a child. Davidson plays Scott, a twentysomething screw-up who medicates his grief with weed, and maps out his dead-end life in crummy home-made tattoos. All loose limbs and exposed emotional scar tissue, Davidson is persuasively raw in a performance that becomes increasingly textured and interesting as Scott finds a father figure in his mother’s ex-boyfriend. It’s his bruised charisma that compensates for a certain spaced-out lethargy in the storytelling and an overlong running time."
"Spike Lee has shown up with an insurgent filmic uproar to match the uproar in the world. Da 5 Bloods is a paintball gun loaded with real bullets: a blast of satire and emotional agony about race and the American empire, the evergreen wound of Vietnam, African-American sacrifices on the field of battle, and the fact that black deaths matter. It’s an outrageous action painting of a film, splattering moods, genres, ideas and archive clips all over the screen – with many a Brechtian-vaudeville alienation. It feels sometimes like an old-style war movie such as The Dirty Dozen but maybe Godard’s Le Petit Soldat, with playful riffs on Hollywood Vietnam standards and even John Huston’s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The movie tricks you into thinking that it’s going to be a gentle, bittersweet picture about middle-aged guys with giant guts and prostates sadly coming to terms with their past, and the importance of letting go … and then it detonates a shock of fear and greed, which itself is always verging on action-movie melodrama and farce. It’s all so inventively bizarre that you could treat it simply as a black comedy, but in the final 15 minutes there is an amazing crescendo of emotion. The bloods of the title are Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr) and Eddie (Norm Lewis), four ageing Vietnam veterans who have returned to south-east Asia on what appears to be a luxury vacation trip down memory lane. All four are haunted by the memory of their squad leader Norman (Chadwick Boseman), who died in action before their eyes and whose memory they have romanticised. Lee creates flashback combat sequences for the five men, but without Irishman-type youthification for the four survivors. They appear in the past the way they are now, as sweaty, out-of-condition and very scared old guys in the jungle, surreally led by the impossibly handsome young Boseman who has grown not old as those that are left grew old. He was and is their leader; Lee shows us that he now looks like their son. And this is especially powerful when they hear about Martin Luther King’s assassination from the communist Radio Hanoi announcer (Van Veronica Ngo), and Norman angrily tells his men to ignore her recommendation to mutiny because they owe their racist commanders nothing. Yet the four guys’ reappearance in Vietnam now is even more complicated: they are convinced they can recover a secret cache of US gold bullion intended to pay South Vietnamese troops, which they found in a burnt-out plane and had to abandon. And Paul, a recent Trump convert in a Maga cap, finds nothing therapeutic in their journey into the past. He gets more and more disturbed. Lee has taken the battle-scarred old movie trope of Vietnam and found something relevant and intersectionally complex: black people, because they largely didn’t have the contacts or resources to avoid the draft, or to finesse the avoidance of dangerous frontline duty, found themselves engaging the enemy and being a major though under-reported part of the Vietnam story. Paradoxically, it meant taking on oppressed people with whom they had no quarrel – that is, those people that Mohammed Ali famously said had never tainted him with the N-word – but also feeling ambiguous and conflicted about warfare, patriotism and America itself. They had fought, sacrificed and felt proud. All of these ideas and feelings swirl around in Da 5 Bloods, knockabout rhetoric mixed in with grandstanding sentimentality and action, right up to the old-school “curtain-call” credits, like something from The Great Escape. There are some uproarious war-movie-type flourishes, including a graphic shot of what happens to a snake when you shoot at it hysterically with your M-16 assault rifle. Lee mixes up the tone and mood, and, with the knowing cinematic references and consciously contrived scenarios, it’s possible to feel detached or amused or bemused. But all that paves the way for the final 10 minutes, in which Lee brings in an outpouring of sadness and grief and determination that is almost overwhelming. For all its craziness, Da 5 Bloods finds an operatic anguish and yearning. "
"Streaming services such as Netflix, Stan, Apple and Amazon could soon be required to pay into a fund for Australian productions or to make shows in Australia as part of the federal government’s plans to assist the struggling entertainment industry. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, flagged last week that the government was developing an assistance package for the sprawling entertainment and arts sector, which has been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance – the union covering actors, production workers and journalists – many industry workers were ineligible for jobkeeper because they were employed on short contracts for different productions or were freelancers. A union survey of 1,000 members found that one in five were ineligible for either jobkeeper or jobseeker, which has assets and spouse income tests. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the government was turning its attention to more targeted measures for heavily affected sectors, including arts, entertainment and film. The aim was to get the arts sector back to work once the shutdown ended, he said. Among the immediate measures being sought by industry is government support for insurance for the film and television industry so they can get productions off the ground. Many are facing extra costs and longer shoot times due to social distancing rules and the possibility of disruption if a crew member contracts the coronavirus. While series like Home and Away have multiple plots which can accommodate absences of some characters, feature films with high-profile actors would struggle if they were forced to halt due to Covid-19. This is making it difficult to get the insurance necessary to restart local productions. Australia’s film promotion arm, Ausfilm, has also made a pitch for more funding for the location incentive fund, a $140m fund that assists in luring foreign productions to Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald reported it was seeking a top-up and a more generous incentives to lure more foreign productions, such as the two Marvel movies being shot in Fox Studios. But the biggest issue will be how to encourage Australian production. Screen Producers Australia’s CEO, Mathew Deaner, said bringing international players to Australia was important, but making that the focus of assistance risked turning Australia into a service hub, rather than encouraging local creativity and productions. “Our ambition should be to pivot this into local IP and local exports,” he said. “We need to think about opportunities to take the lead in local production.” The government temporarily suspended the Australian drama quota and the children’s television quota for the commercial television industry during the pandemic. This is one of the cornerstones that drives local television production. But just before Covid-19 struck, two government agencies – the Australian Communications and Media Authority and Screen Australia – released an options paper on alternatives to quotas. These ranged from the status quo to deregulation of the industry. But the option that appears to have captured most attention is the third option, which involves all platforms being subject to local content rules, including the streaming services, such as Apple, Netflix and Stan, which currently have no Australian content obligations. Stan has invested in local production. The move by the government to expand the obligations to streaming services comes as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has recommended that Google and Facebook be required to compensate media companies for content they publish. Other countries have either mandated or encouraged companies such as Netflix and Apple TV to make programs in their territories and in their languages. The move to include the streaming services is broadly supported by the commercial television networks, which are likely to face huge financial pressures on their advertising revenues in the post Covid-19 economy. Some participants in the roundtables with the minister said he seemed interested in the Canadian approach, which has set up a public-private partnership to fund Canadian programs that foster Canadian cultural values. The proposal contains a number of variations, including an option that all providers of video services could be permitted to negotiate a bespoke agreement with the ACMA on their Australian content, rather than facing a one-size-fits-all requirement. The alternative would be to contribute to a fund. Submissions to the review close this week and Fletcher has said he considers the current problems of the sector make it more important to reform the Australian content rules.  A spokesman for the minister told the Guardian: “There was a very impressive group of participants and it was refreshing to hear people from many different parts of the sector speak frankly about the options, and elements of the current model which are out of date.” "
"The UK’s largest chain of cinemas has pushed back its scheduled reopening date by three weeks, in response to further delays to the opening of key titles such as Mulan and Tenet. Cineworld, which runs multiplexes and the Picturehouse chain in the UK, as well as Regal cinemas in the US, will now open the doors to its venues on 31 July. In a statement, the company attributed the move to shifts for release date to Christopher Nolan’s Tenet (now due 12 August) and Disney’s Mulan (now due 21 August). The company said: “We hope that we will be able to reopen the doors of all Cineworld cinemas across the UK and Ireland at that time, subject to UK government restrictions. With the ongoing pandemic, this new date remains subject to final confirmation.” Cinemas in England are, in theory, allowed to reopen this weekend, on 4 July, with Odeon currently planning to stick to this date. At the time of writing, the Vue chain is sticking with a 10 July reopening date. The world’s largest chain of cinemas, AMC, announced overnight that it, too, would delay reopening in the US from 15 July until the end of month. About 450 of AMC’s sites in the US are now expected to reopen on 30 July, and the company has said it hopes most of its 600 cinemas will be operational by early August. However, some key US territories, such New York City and Los Angeles, are yet to pass legislation permitting such a reopening, and other states have again shuttered businesses over the past few days following fears accelerated reopenings have led to an increase in infections. Both AMC and Cineworld have outlined plans for new safety, hygiene and cleaning protocols on their premises. A backlash to the news that patrons would not be required nor encouraged to wear face coverings prompted U-turns from both companies, with all AMC venues and Regal cinemas now making masks mandatory. However, no such requirement is currently in place at any UK cinema. The Cineworld Action Group, which represents staff at the chain, recently launched a petition in which they called for such a measure to be introduced."
"The performances are a couple of drawers down from the top in this Nouveau Bonnie and Clyde romp; it features Bella Thorne – from the recent teen-abstinence weepie Midnight Sun – in glassy-eyed Insta princess mode. She’s playing Arielle, a bored pouty badass in Florida, longing to get away from all the local losers and find fame and fortune. Arielle hooks up with smouldering hottie Dean (Jake Manley) who’s out on parole for armed robbery and together they take off across country on a crime spree, holding up gas stations – escapades that Arielle videos and posts online: she is electrified to see how she and Dean are blowing up on social media. But wait. Surely that makes them traceable? Well, no, the script perfunctorily says that Arielle has put in place an “IP blocker”. Erm … would this kind of expertise be available to the non-nerd community? I’m not sure. Finally, our two desperadoes come across a young African-American woman, Elle (Amber Riley), who appears to be part of the online fanbase. It is her job to assure us, the audience, that we should be rooting for Arielle and Dean because they have radical outlaw glamour, giving a voice to the downtrodden and dispossessed. There are one or two gonzo shootouts that, admittedly, go with a swing, but this isn’t great. It’s never easy to represent online existence in a feature film and this is another movie that has fallen short. Some serviceable action sequences, though."
"Fyzal Boulifa is a young British director of Moroccan heritage who was Bafta-nominated for his short film The Curse and now makes his fiercely impressive feature debut with Lynn + Lucy, a gruelling social-realist tragedy with a batsqueak of horror, set on a tough Essex estate that Boulifa says is not so very different from where he was brought up in Leicester. It’s a film about class, community, self-esteem and female friendship and how desperate unhappiness can be incubated in secret, like bacilli in an unseen petri dish. Lynn + Lucy is Loachian in its way (Ken Loach’s company Sixteen Films is a co-producer) and is also indebted to a later generation of film-makers; it feels like Clio Barnard’s The Arbor, her verbatim cinema experiment set on Bradford’s Buttershaw estate, and there is also the almost dream-like passion of early Lynne Ramsay pictures like Morvern Callar or Ratcatcher. Boulifa has cast the non-professional newcomer Roxanne Scrimshaw as Lynn, and she is excellent as a young working-class woman who married her first boyfriend, had a baby at 16 and was entirely content with the decisions she made early in life – virtually in childhood – and never seriously considered since. But now she has great pressures with a tricky teenage daughter and a morose husband invalided out of the army who spends his days loafing around watching TV and listlessly brooding over “open marriage” dating sites. Yet the key reason that Lynn is basically happy – even blissful – is that she lives opposite her best mate from school: the more mercurial Lucy, played by Nichola Burley. In every sense that matters, Lucy is the love of Lynn’s life and Lynn was almost unreasonably thrilled when Lucy recently settled down with a (younger) man and had a baby. Now Lynn and Lucy are united for ever in wifehood and motherhood and Lynn has even pressured Lucy into getting her child christened, purely so she can be the godmother. For Lynn, the new parallel in their lives means joy; for Lucy, it means growing panic. Boulifa, Scrimshaw and Burley show how this new baby has caused an ominous change in Lucy and an equally ominous change in the delicate dynamic of her friendship with Lynn. Lucy used to be the glamorous one, the wild-child. Now she has to stay at home with the beginnings of post-natal depression and a baby that everyone except her seems to adore. Meanwhile, Lynn has to seek work and, humiliatingly, this means taking a school-leaver’s sweeper-up job at a hairdresser run by the glamorous and aspirational Janelle (Jennifer Lee Moon), a frenemy from school, who remembers – or thinks she does – being bullied by Lynn and Lucy in those days. Despite calling Lynn “babes”, she relishes the feeling of lording it over her, and the film begins to signal something chillingly Goldingesque. They are all still at school, ready to carry on grudges, but with adult force. Work, marriage, motherhood and friendship: the film shows how these four things, which Lynn and Lucy have been encouraged to believe are the four pillars of happiness, or at any rate the necessities of life, are the terrible, tragically poisonous ingredients of a nightmare. Lucy becomes more discontented with her existence as it now appears to resemble that of her friend, and as she realises that she does not fit the mould of wife and mother in the way that Lynn does – and that she is not plausible as what society considers an adult. Worse, she is facing an increasingly toxic and abusive situation at home. A spasm of pure horror approaches: partially witnessed and partially understood by Lynn, who wants to reach out to her friend, wants to give her some empathy, especially given the misogyny Lucy faces from many on the estate. But Lynn, along with her daughter, suspects that her gestures of support are futile and that there are grim new life-choices to be made. This film left me with that residue or shimmer of anxiety usually generated by really effective horror movies. It’s a potent tale of dread, reinforced by great performances from Scrimshaw and Burley."
"“It’s funny how a single day can drag while entire years go by in a flash,” sighs Cozy (Lisa Bowman), the narrator of Kelly Reichardt’s debut film River of Grass. Ain’t that the truth. It was made in 1994 but you might say Cozy is already in her own private lockdown. An unhappily married mother of two, she fills her baby’s bottle with Coca-Cola and spends long afternoons yearning for the day when some nice couple in a station wagon will arrive to take the children off her hands. One night, she absconds to a bar where she meets Lee (Larry Fessenden), a loner with a high forehead and wild tendrils of hair. They flee into the night together, climb a fence and splash around in a stranger’s swimming pool. When the homeowner finds them, Lee lets his gun do the talking, turning himself and Cozy into the Bonnie and Clyde of the Florida Everglades. Among those on their tail is Cozy’s father, Jimmy (Dick Russell), a detective and part-time jazz drummer. (He named his daughter after “Cozy” Cole, the African American sticksman who played with the likes of Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie.) Jimmy has his own woes. Like Toshiro Mifune in Kurosawa’s Stray Dog, he’s lost his gun. In fact, it’s his pistol that has found its way into Lee’s possession, which means he’s lost his weapon and his daughter to the same man. Still, he shouldn’t fret: after all, it would be hard to think of a couple less committed to being on the lam. They hide out in a $20-a-night motel where they take naps and use their feet to pass joints to one another. The height of drama comes when Lee uses a Bible to squash a cockroach. “Did you kill it?” Cozy asks. He’s not sure. “Give me another Bible!” he demands. The days drift by. At one point, Lee even returns to the scene of the crime, which is when he discovers what we already know: that there was no murder. The “victim” is right as rain. Cozy is crestfallen. “If we weren’t killers, we weren’t anything,” she says in a flat, affectless voiceover inherited from Sissy Spacek in Badlands. Murder isn’t the only crime that Lee and Cozy have failed at. Lee’s attempt to steal from a convenience store is interrupted by a more decisive and committed bandit. He also tries to drive through a tollgate only to slam on the brakes at the last minute. Soon, Cozy is wondering whether he even killed that cockroach. River of Grass takes its title from the Native American description of the Everglades and tellingly keeps any characters of colour largely on the sidelines, looking on suspiciously or in bafflement at these white wastrels floundering around. The movie belongs to that wry category of films about crimes that never were – file it alongside Best Laid Plans, a thriller, starring Reese Witherspoon, in which nobody dies, or the Mexican gem I’m Gonna Explode, about a teenage tearaway who goes on the run but gets no further than the roof of his own apartment block. Reichardt, who didn’t make another feature after this for 12 years, hadn’t yet found her voice when she directed River of Grass; it feels like a film made under the influence of Jim Jarmusch (who later cast Fessenden in Broken Flowers and The Dead Don’t Die) or the Godardian Hal Hartley. But it’s fascinating nevertheless to see an early version of the lyrical mood that would lend her later movies, such as Meek’s Cutoff and Certain Women, their particular plangent glow. What it does share with her mature work is dry humour and a vivid sense of place. She brings to Florida the same aural and visual detail with which she would later capture Oregonian life. The streets are dilapidated, paint peeling from every surface, colourless skies looming over featureless landscapes. Even when a shot borders on the beautiful, in the image of a pink-smudged sunset, Reichardt and her cinematographer Jim Denault make sure to include a parking lot in the bottom of the frame to undercut any picture-postcard effect. This is a film that misleads us right from its opening minutes, beginning in documentary mode before proving to be nothing of the sort. Cozy mentions early on that she spends much of her time daydreaming, so is the whole adventure something she concocted to pass another uneventful day? The scene in which these non-criminals finally part ways suggests as much. There’s talk of boundaries both physical and moral in River of Grass, and the picture itself straddles the line between cataclysmic, life-changing events and same-old, same-old. It’s an ideal streaming treat while we wait for Reichardt’s Berlin film festival hit First Cow to emerge from lockdown limbo and into our woozy new world."
"When the major national cinemas are rounded up, Canada rarely gets much of a look-in: sometimes blurred with American cinema, sometimes with French, too rarely appreciated on its own. If younger auteurs such as Xavier Dolan – whose work was spotlit in this column earlier this year – are taking it to a brasher place, Canadian cinema retains a reputation for being, certainly relative to its noisy southern neighbour, rather Canadian: quiet, thoughtful, progressive in subtle, unassuming ways. That’s reflected in a season of new Canadian cinema on Curzon Home Cinema: the six-film Canada Now selection spans multiple generations and subcultures of Canuck film-making, forming a national snapshot more interestingly diverse than what tends to filter through to British cinemas. The selections are being staggered on the Curzon platform through the rest of July, but the best of them – indeed, one of the best films of the year, full stop – is available to stream now. Kazik Radwanski’s punchy, exhilarating Anne at 13,000 Feet is, essentially, a psychological thriller for Generation Anxious, finding tension in the unpredictable rhythms of a young woman’s fragile mental health, without exploiting it for drama. It boasts a singularly astonishing performance by Deragh Campbell as Anne, a 27-year-old daycare worker in Toronto, whose persistent anxiety disorder disrupts her professional life, her dating attempts and even her relationships with loving friends and family – though it seems to desert her when she goes skydiving for a friend’s hen party. Radwanski previously made Tower, a nervy, perceptive portrait of a maladjusted manchild that is available to stream (and decidedly worth doing so) on YouTube. In his latest, he again demonstrates a knack for abrasive but empathetic character studies of social outsiders, which retain a loose, improvisational air despite sophisticated film-making. Incisively clipped to just 75 minutes, Anne at 13,000 Feet reflects its protagonist’s frayed, restless synapses in its aggressive, avant-garde editing style. Despite a strong showing on the festival circuit last year, it hasn’t been picked up for UK distribution in cinemas. This limited Curzon showcase might be your best chance to catch it. Also streaming now is One Day in the Life of Noah Piugattuk, from director Zacharias Kunuk, whose enthralling 2001 Arctic epic Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner effectively put Inuit cinema on the map. (Never seen it? Remedy that via iTunes.) Kunuk’s latest doesn’t have quite the same mesmerising sweep, but it’s a droll, elegiac period drama, drawn from the true story of a nomadic Inuit family forced into settlement housing in the 1960s. Yung Chang’s documentary This Is Not a Movie, meanwhile, offers a lucid, thorough investigation of the career of the British political correspondent Robert Fisk. It’s illuminating stuff, even if it really could have come from anywhere. Still to come in the Canada Now season: And the Birds Rained Down, from Quebecois director Louise Archambault (from 17 July). A story of three retirees who choose to live off-grid in the peaceful wilderness, it initially seems to be back-to-nature fare before an early, unexpected tragedy pulls it gently into darker territory. And coming on 31 July is White Lie, a more spikily youthful psychodrama from directing duo Calvin Thomas and Yonah Lewis, following a young student who embarks on an online fundraising plan for her cancer treatment. The problem? She doesn’t actually have cancer. As her scheme collapses, the film’s knots tighten and twist to gripping effect. Rounding out the programme is Atom Egoyan’s Guest of Honour, which I was hoping to say is a return to form for a director who has gone bizarrely off-course since his elegant 90s heyday. Alas, this thoroughly eccentric, multi-stranded melodrama built on a dysfunctional father-daughter bond is a bewildering affair, with an untethered lead performance by David Thewlis as a restaurant inspector gone wildly rogue. If nothing else, it’ll make you hanker for another look at an enduring Canadian classic, The Sweet Hereafter (1997). Egoyan’s still-haunting meditation on grief and guilt is also streaming on Curzon, and in the wake of Ian Holm’s recent death, one hopes many are revisiting his career-best performance in it. Canada Now is good; Canada then wasn’t too shabby either. Dark Waters (Universal, 12) Todd Haynes’s environmental thriller was unjustly sidelined in cinemas last year, and in awards season, but it’s exceptional: an atypical genre for the director that he makes his own with stormy visual beauty and a seething, weighty moral conscience. True History of the Kelly Gang (Picturehouse, 18) Another darkly atmospheric stunner that got less than its due on release. Aussie auteur Justin Kurzel bounces back from the disaster of Assassin’s Creed with a thrillingly ripe, rowdy adaptation of Peter Carey’s Booker-winning novel. Who You Think I Am (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) Juliette Binoche as a divorcee catfishing her ex’s twentysomething roommate: Safy Nebbou’s unusual blend of stalker thriller and romantic comedy risks being terminally silly, but winds up surprising, sexy and warmly perceptive. The Hunt (Universal, 15) Craig Zobel’s daft allegorical horror film about American “deplorables” being literally hunted by elites should go right into any 2020 time capsule. It’s not good, exactly, but it is luridly compelling, and superb star Betty Gilpin rises heroically above it. Burden (Signature, 15) You can see why Andrew Heckler’s well-acted, well-intended film never made it to cinemas, despite winning a Sundance audience award two years ago. It treads carefully, but its story of a dim Ku Klux Klan member trying to reform himself is a risky one to tell."
"I am 10 minutes into my Zoom interview with Pierce Brosnan when his son Dylan arrives off-screen with his father’s coffee. “Did you put sugar in this?” he says to the 23-year-old. “Some more milk, please, I don’t take mine black.” Dylan is sent back to correct it. “He’s a wonderful musician and a great academic,” Brosnan says. “He just graduated from USC film school.” The graduation, like so many others, was cancelled. “We got him a cap and gown and sat here watching it [the online ceremony] on the sofa”.  Naturally, the pandemic has disrupted Brosnan’s schedule, too; he was shooting Cinderella in London until Covid-19 halted production. He returned to the northern shore of Hawaii, where he has remained since with his wife, the journalist and author Keely Shaye Smith, and their two sons, Dylan and Paris, 19. (Brosnan also has three children from his first marriage.) “We are a close family and this time of covid has nourished and nurtured a bond between us all that probably would not have existed without the lockdown,” he says. Brosnan is sitting at his kitchen table, in front of a bright Indigenous Australian painting, which he bought in Sydney during a “tour of duty” as James Bond. He is here to talk about his supporting role in the Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. The film, which was originally scheduled to coincide with this year’s contest, follows two would-be pop stars (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) in their quest to represent Iceland in a fictionalised version of the competition. There was hopeful expectation in some quarters that Brosnan might lend his singing voice, given his infamous performances in the Mamma Mia! films (his singing in the first film was so comical that it landed him the Razzie for worst supporting actor at the 2009 awards). Was he shocked not to be given the chance to sing on screen again? “I was surprised, I was disappointed, I was crestfallen,” he responds, good-naturedly. Brosnan plays Ferrell’s disparaging father (“Which I thought was a bit of a long shot”), who resents his son’s wild ambitions and wants him to aspire to a more conventional future. It is not a parenting style familiar to Brosnan. “My boys are academic and have a creative instinct and intuition towards the arts. So I don’t try to direct them.” His younger sons’ careers in film-making, acting (Dylan) and modelling (Paris) have seen them amass their own fame; they have social media followings in the tens of thousands. They stole the show at this year’s Golden Globes in their roles as ambassadors, shepherding celebrities on and off stage in black tie. Does their social media fame worry him? “Yes, it does concern my wife, Keely, and I,” he says. “The footprint that they’re leaving will stay with them for many years to come. It’s treacherous waters. I went on Instagram to follow Paris, to make sure that he was acquitting himself well and not entering into any kind of liaisons with folk of ill repute. It’s a strange animal and you have to be careful with it. It can be narcissistic and you have to balance it out with human lightness.” Born in 1953, Brosnan was raised in Navan, 30 miles north-west of Dublin. An only child, he has described his childhood as a solitary, Roman Catholic upbringing. “My father took off for the hills and, for my mother, it was a very difficult time in the 50s to be a single parent. So, in many respects, I created my own self,” he says. After his father left, his mother moved to London when Brosnan was four. She wanted a better life for them. He waited for her in Ireland and lived in a succession of houses – with his maternal grandparents’, with his aunt and uncle, at a boarding house. “I’m very grateful that I didn’t have the shackles of parenting, so to speak, and really cleaved my own path in life. When, as a young teenager, I told my mother that I wanted to be an actor, she was extremely supportive of that. She wholeheartedly said: ‘Follow your dreams.’” Brosnan moved to Putney in west London when he was 12. At school, he was nicknamed Irish. “Being an Irish immigrant in London in ’64, they don’t let you forget that.” He later worked briefly as a commercial artist, but, having been raised on “cowboys and Indians, Old Mother Riley, Norman Wisdom”, he still dreamed of acting. Brosnan stumbled upon the Ovalhouse theatre in south London and found himself “in the company of poets and musicians and outcasts and mangled souls”. His breakthrough came when he landed a small part in a Tennessee Williams play, The Red Devil Battery Sign, as the understudy. “It didn’t work out for this other fellow,” says Brosnan. “I got the call: ‘Tennessee wants to see you now.’ I tore out of the flat and hopped on a bus. The bus was going too slow, so I got off and ran. My heart was pounding – Tennessee Williams wants to see me. I got to Tennessee’s apartment, and we read through two very emotional scenes and just let it fly. And I got the job.” They opened at the Roundhouse theatre in north London in 1977, with Brosnan’s performance receiving critical acclaim. Williams sent him a telegram stating only: “Thank God for you, my dear boy.” “It was an affirmation that I was on the right path, that I had the talent – a tiny bit of gold in my back pocket,” says Brosnan. “That made me hungry to be an actor. Once I found the world of acting, I clung to it with all my heart. It was liberating.” It was a hugely successful start to a stage career, but Brosnan’s ambitions lay elsewhere. “I always dreamed of the movies,” he says. “The stage, as exhilarating as it was, always terrified me. I wanted to be up on the silver screen.” In 1982, he landed the role of the charming TV detective Remington Steele. He moved to California with his first wife, the Australian actor Cassandra Harris, and their son, Sean, and her two children, Charlotte and Christopher, whom Brosnan later adopted. In 1987, Harris fell ill while filming in India and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died four years later. Charlotte would die of the same disease in 2013. Brosnan turned to the therapeutic qualities of painting while Harris was ill and he has continued ever since. “I started painting in 1987 when my late wife had cancer. I had been painting out of pain, and now the pain sometimes comes through in colour,” he said at the charity auction of his painting of Bob Dylan in 2018. It sold for €1.2m (£1.1m). He found the fortitude to keep acting, too. In 1993, he made it on to the silver screen in Mrs Doubtfire. “At day’s end, you want to look around and hopefully you have a handful of films that you can be proud of participating in. That is definitely one of those movies for me.” He speaks just as fondly of the film’s late star, Robin Williams. “I went into the makeup trailer and there was Robin, sitting in the makeup chair. He had a Hawaiian shirt on and cargo pants, and his hairy arms and hairy legs hanging out. He had the head of Mrs Doubtfire and greeted me: ‘Oh, Pierce! Oh, you look so handsome, oh, give us a kiss.’” (Brosnan’s Mrs Doubtfire impression is impeccable.) At this point, Brosnan had already been offered the role of Bond, but had been obliged to refuse it due to his Remington Steele contract. When he made his Bond debut, in 1995’s Goldeneye, he made it count. His iteration of Bond – sensitive, suave, serious – proved to be a huge success, critically and commercially. Hindsight has bolstered Daniel Craig’s gritty, brutish incarnation of 007 as the best since Connery’s, but Brosnan played the role with a twinkle in the eye and the humour that such a cartoonish character deserves. After his final outing as Bond, Die Another Day in 2002, the producers felt the franchise needed a reboot to stay relevant in a post-9/11, post-Bourne world. Although Brosnan was keen to do a fifth film, the producers had settled on recasting the role and told him so over the phone in 2004; he would later say he felt he had been “kicked to the kerb”. “There’s no regret,” he says now. “I do not let regret come into my world … It just leads to more misery and more regrets.” “Bond is the gift that keeps giving and has allowed me to have a wonderful career. Once you’re branded as a Bond, it’s with you for ever, so you better make peace with it and you’d better understand that when you walk through those doors and pick up the mantle of playing James Bond.” Since relinquishing the role, Brosnan has generally been reticent about later instalments (“Not my monkey, not my circus,” he said in an interview with Esquire last year). He has, however, said enthusiastically that it is time for a woman to take over the role (“Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there!”). Why does he think there is so much resistance to recasting the role of Bond (and other iconic British figures, such as the Doctor in Doctor Who) as a woman or a person of colour? He pauses and slowly taps his kitchen table. “I’m gonna leave that right there,” he says, with a knowing smile and a single, slow shake of the head. Brosnan has had a successful career since leaving the franchise – his performances in The Matador, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination, and Mamma Mia! stand out – and he was not hampered by the weight of the role he left behind. In 2010, Brosnan starred as a fictional British former prime minister accused of war crimes (yes, he based his performance on Tony Blair, he says) in Roman Polanski’s thriller The Ghost Writer. What does he make of the criticism of those who work with Polanski, given his rape conviction? Brosnan is silent for a full 10 seconds. “Well,” he says, steadily, “I took to the role and to the part in The Ghost Writer because of the work that Roman has done as an artist, as a director. I didn’t let the rest of his life influence my choice. I had to be honest with myself and know that justice had been done, half undone, and went forth as an actor.” Would he make the same decision again today? “I don’t know if, in this climate, I would have made the same decision, the same choice. These are dangerous times and it’s a very toxic world. I don’t know.” When he talks of the “climate”, it is clear he is referring to the world after #MeToo. “It was shocking,” he says of the scale of abuse powerful figures such as Harvey Weinstein got away with for so long. He punctuates every few words with a short pause. “It was absolutely appalling and really has changed the landscape and the workplace for women in Hollywood. It was a mighty fall from grace and one that was really ugly and sad for all parties concerned … that this man should have acquitted himself in such a fashion in the company of young women who were trying to make a career for themselves – it was upsetting to see that behaviour unfold on a daily, weekly basis.” Brosnan has been prolific in recent years. He has four films in production and a fifth awaiting release. “I have no desire to retire,” he says. “I am a man of 67 years now and the parts that will come to me will be the parts of the elder, the parts of the comedic turn. At this point in life, I don’t know what else to do but act and paint.” In the immediate future, there is a pandemic to navigate and a US presidential election on the horizon (Brosnan is a dual citizen of Ireland and the US). More than once in our conversation, Brosnan laments “the disease of racism” and urges people to vote.  “Joe [Biden] has my vote,” he says. “We have to find leaders whom we can trust, leaders who have intelligence and empathy and compassion and get away from the toxicity that we have now in this country. “I would like to think that the vaccine will come soon for the disease of corona. And I would like to think, also, a vaccine will come for the disease of racism and that we can really come together as communities to respect each other’s religions and beliefs and not to be so judgmental.” He continues: “With change comes struggle. But I have hope in our young people, I have hope in my sons’ generation that they will see the awful, shameful neglect that we’ve paid to each other’s religions, race, the nature of our lives, the environment that we live in. I have the strongest belief that the youth of today will make a big change, will have the courage to get out and vote for the rights of people – not racism and not ignorance and malignant narcissism.” If this sounds like wishful thinking, it is in keeping with Brosnan’s nature. “My eldest son said: ‘Dad is just a dreamer.’ But my dreaming has gotten me this far in life. So I shall continue dreaming and continue being the man I am and doing the best I can, with the tiny bit of gold talent that I’ve got.” Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is out now on Netflix"
"Jon Stewart made his reputation as a smart political comedian and commentator on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show on TV, before quitting in 2015 to develop movie projects, of which the first was his excellent Rosewater. But this – heartsinkingly – is the follow-up. It’s a flaccid, toothless, supercilious political non-satire for liberals too fastidious to take sides or take action. The film perches on a fence of wry disdain and makes droll gestures of disapproval at the wasteful big-money awfulness of everyone’s political campaign. And it’s leading to a big tortuous plot twist which frankly isn’t convincing, despite the talking-head expert interviewee who is wheeled on over the closing credits to assure us that it is. What we’re left with is a bland cop-out, which incidentally won’t worry anyone yearning for Donald Trump’s second term. Steve Carell finds some of his dullest form playing Gary Zimmer, a Washington DC political strategist for the Democratic party, desperately searching for the next big thing after the debacle of 2016. (Stewart may have been inspired by Stanley Tucci’s media-manipulator in the small-town political satire Swing Vote.) To Zimmer’s astonished delight, one of his minions finds a viral YouTube video of a retired Marine Corps veteran called Colonel Jack Hastings, played by Chris Cooper, giving a passionate speech about caring community values at a town-hall meeting somewhere in Wisconsin, where folks have been financially stricken by the recent army-base closure. The holy grail: a tough guy who’s also a progressive. Cunning Zimmer duly shows up in hicksville (wrinkling his nose at all the niceness thereabouts) to persuade the grumpily authentic Hastings to run as a Dem for mayor and maybe something more if it all works out. Soon the top brass in Washington are excited; the cash rolls in for his campaign and the Republicans get fired up too – bringing in their ice-queen spin-doctor Faith Brewster, played by Rose Byrne, who seems to have some history and toxic sexual chemistry with Zimmer. There are, arguably, one or two reasonable touches, such as the observation about punctuation on billboard ads, inspired by the notorious “Jeb!” campaign for the hapless Jeb Bush. But really, any single TV episode of Veep or Parks and Recreation has far more wit, fun and political zap than this great big laugh-free feast of self-congratulatory dullness. Zimmer himself never has any funny lines and the rules about making the leading man relatable – and making the Democratic guy basically nice – mean that he is never allowed to have any of that Satanic political glamour of pure wickedness that might have made his character interesting. The movie never permits itself the forbidden fossil-fuel of cynicism that might have given it some movement. The talents of Topher Grace and Natasha Lyonne are thrown away in the tiny roles of pollsters and online number-crunchers that Zimmer has brought in. It could be that much of their characters were lost in the edit, but certainly the film is not especially interested in the hot-button issues of Facebook and data-harvesting. The eerie absence of race as an issue in the film is also naive. The story runs on predictable lines, with the underdog Hastings making exciting gains on the Republican incumbent; then his momentum stalls and there’s a dilemma – how nasty are his team prepared to be to clinch their win? And there’s that very exasperating ending, to which I can only say that in the real world, Zimmer, having raised serious amounts of cash from hedge-funders and the like, would take a pretty close interest in the bottom line. The real finale, however, comes in the typography: the word “RESIST” is eye-catchingly picked out in the middle of the title, in fine Michael-Moore-lite style. Resist? Really? How? The movie has signed off with a pert little flourish to the effect that the whole system is broken, so maybe we should wish a plague on both their houses or neither. Either way, the supposed satirical attitude of Irresistible can’t conceal the fact that it’s contrived, unfunny and redundant."
"Actually, this film may make you scream – or at the very least roll your eyes at the self-seriousness of it all. Frank Beauvais’s cine-memoir is a 75-minute collage of the 400 or so films he binge-watched while living alone for six months in an isolated Alsace village 30 miles from the nearest station. Each clip – lasting three to four seconds – gives visual expression to Beauvais’s tortured voiceover. He explains how after a break-up, drinking too much and not sleeping, he filled his 18-hour days watching movies – “film bulimia” he calls it. Catnip to those who like to poke fun at intellectual pretentiousness. Beauvais writes very well, perhaps distractingly so. His narration has more impact than the images he gleans from across the movie spectrum (everything from Elf to Éric Rohmer, though skewing to arthouse). He grew up in Alsace and moved back from Paris with his boyfriend for the cheap rent. After they split, he stayed alone, and became depressed. Losing interest in the script he was meant to be writing, he began mainlining films, an unstoppable five-a-day habit. The script is self-laceratingly honest. Beauvais describes himself as an “unstable unfinished adult” (spoken as a noose swings across screen). He’s got something of Karl Ove Knausgård’s skill for unflinchingly intimate accounts of everyday encounters (if not the same humour). But the misanthropy here can feel off-putting; he is particularly nasty about the locals in Alsace. Beauvais’s film is perhaps inspired by Christian Marclay’s 24-hour long installation The Clock, a montage of thousands of images from films and TV showing the actual time. But I was reminded of Snuff, Irvine Welsh’s grimly funny short story about a depressed man who watches every film in Halliwell’s Film Guide and then records his own suicide on a camcorder. Beauvais lived to tell the tale – often in engrossing detail."
"Richard Eyre Ian Holm was, as it was so often said, the actor’s actor. Not because he was virtuosic, meticulous, droll and charismatic, all of which he was, but because he always drew the audience in, he always withheld something mysterious – something under the skin, something of the soul – and the audience always came to seek it. It’s no surprise that he was Harold Pinter’s favourite actor. I saw Ian first in 1964 playing Henry V and Richard III and was entirely capsized by his energy, his bravura skills and his wit. Seeing these performances – along with Paul Scofield’s Lear two years earlier – was what made me begin to think that I wanted to pursue a life in the theatre. Ian wasn’t hard to love. He was funny and modest and a constant enthusiast for whatever he was working on, or a piece of music he’d heard: “Claudio Abbado, what a conductor!” – or something he’d seen: “You must see the National Theatre of Brent,” he’d say, “Jim Broadbent is a genius!” He was very open with his feelings but, paradoxically, very reserved with them even though entirely frank about that reserve. Falling in love, remaking his life and falling in love again was the pattern of his life. “I always forget the pain and the past,” he said. Perhaps that sense of emotional ruthlessness was what made him such a brilliant Lear. Paradoxes are the oxygen of good actors and the most important one is to look spontaneous and at the same time keep a corner of the brain actively deployed as a monitor, cold, detached, critical and unengaged. Ian had that characteristic in spades. When we were rehearsing the “mad scene” – the exchange between Lear who has lost his mind and Gloucester who has lost his eyes – Ian was being achingly brilliant. “Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary / To sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee,” says Lear. “O, let me kiss that hand,” says Gloucester. “Let me wipe it first; it smells of…” Ian stopped. Minutes seemed to pass. This wasn’t acting; this was being, this was possession. Then he turned to me and, with an impish grin, said: “What’s the word? Oh, mortality, of course.” Which, given that he had a photographic memory, was another paradox. And after this moment, like a violinist picking up his bow, he returned to the same point in the scene, first beat of the bar, pitch, tempo and intensity perfect, no shuffling, no prevarication. That’s the true actor: the true professional – experiencing the state of possession, enduring passion and yet, like a firewalker, remaining untouched by the experience. When I asked him to play Lear in 1996 he had hardly been on stage for 15 years and had not played Shakespeare for 35 years. We talked about love of family, of children, of parental tyranny – different only in scale from the political variety, of failing to express love. And we talked of madness. “That’s the easy bit,” said Ian. Perhaps he was referring to his familiarity with insanity – his father was a psychiatrist in a mental hospital – or perhaps he was hinting at his experience of stage fright, when he lost his nerve, a neuron away from losing his mind. Rehearsing Lear, Ian was like a fit dog gnawing at a bone. He became obsessed, always thinking constructively, never perverse or nit-picking. “When Lear talks of being ‘unaccommodated man’ he must be naked,” he said, “anything less would be dishonest.” Before the first preview he stopped me: “I think I know how to do the ‘Howl’ speech. See what you think.” And he did know how to do the ‘Howl’ speech: he carried Cordelia’s body on and instead of putting her down before he spoke, he stood with her corpse in his arms and howled at Kent, Albany and Edgar. The four ‘howls’ emerged as an order, a command, the indictment of a father - don’t be indifferent to my suffering. After the show on the opening night I went to see Ian in his dressing room, where he was lying contentedly in his bath. “This is the best moment of my life,” he said. When he died I had a message from his Cordelia, Anne-Marie Duff, with this photograph attached.“What an honour that was,” she said. I felt the same. Anne-Marie Duff There’s always quite a strong bond between the actor who plays Lear and the young actor who plays Cordelia. It’s such a powerful relationship on stage, it’s bound to bleed into one offstage. That was the case with me and Ian. We hit it off immediately: from the get-go he was so warm and authentic and made me feel important and that what I had to say was valuable. That doesn’t always happen when you’re starting out, with people who have been around the block. But Ian was really interested and engaged. A director once said to me that the two hardest-working people in the room will always be the youngest actor in the cast and the lead. One is so hungry and the other is so dedicated. If I ever came up with an idea he’d go: yeah, tell me more, tell me more. He was sort of like a little dog: really hungry to play. He’d be really helpful and a great teacher but at the same time playful and brave and up for doing things differently. He kept curious, and that was key. Once you stop being bothered you’re screwed. Great artists seem to doggedly hold on to curiosity and he was a great artist, in all mediums. He shone on stage, on TV, on film - there wasn’t an arena in which he couldn’t perform. That’s another sign of someone who’s just good at his job. Ian was also very mischievous, which made him feel super-young. He was cheeky, but there was nothing lascivious about him. He was funny – which I think is insanely attractive. He’d tease me if I was getting too self-righteous; would be first to raise an eyebrow from across the room which would just make me laugh. That’s an act of generosity in itself. It’s a lesson: don’t take yourself too seriously. I did have a sense at the time that the production was a career highlight. When he first came in, he knew every single word of the whole play. It was part of his youthful energy – he still had hopes and dreams to be fulfilled. It wasn’t: “Well, I suppose it’s my time to play Lear”, but “Oh mother of God! I’m playing King Lear at the National Theatre!” He worked so hard every single night, there was never one show he was in a lower gear. Always and ever full force. The people who’d come to see him were off the scale: Paul Newman! Gene Hackman! It was phenomenal – that’s how well-regarded he was. But of course people like that wanted to breathe in what he did. You can’t fight or hide a real gift, just as you can’t fail to recognise and respect it. It has nothing to do with whether you have five Oscars under your belt; it transcends any of the nonsense. I’ll always remember one night early on. I was super-nervous; I was just starting out and it was such a big deal for me. The two of us made our entrance together and he took both my hands and looked me in the eye and said: “Let’s just go out there tonight and pray.” That was the coolest thing. It was also poetic – and that’s who he was. I loved him very much.As told to Catherine Shoard Ken Stott I was barely a month out of drama school in 1973 when I saw Ian Holm at the Royal Court as Hatch in Edward Bond’s The Sea. The truth, the power, the intensity, shocked me – and inspired me.Three years later, I was carrying a spear on behalf of the RSC on a world tour when the news came in like a chill wind through my soul. Ian Holm had suffered “stage fright”. Not the kind that makes you a wee bit more nervous than you normally are in front of an audience and a “scrotum of critics”, but the kind of hellish incident that can end your fucking career. Details were scant; we, the young actors who didn’t know him but unanimously adored him were “shielded from” the information. Apparently it had happened during the final preview of The Iceman Cometh, at the Aldwych. Someone said they knew someone who’d seen it and “it was going to be the best work he’d ever done so why should he be afraid?” Yes, so why be afraid we asked, but we all of us knew, and we were all afraid.A year or so later, I got my first substantial role, in Kennedy’s Children directed by the great David Scase at the Library Theatre Manchester. One evening as I was preparing for our final preview, my colleague Maggie Ollerenshaw announced brightly, indeed almost matter-of-factly, that Ian Holm would be in the audience, and would I like to meet him afterwards? I was a wreck. We met in the bar afterwards where Ian spoke encouragingly about the production and during a slight lull in the conversation I committed what in the theatre is considered a cardinal sin, blurting out: “You are my favourite actor in the world.”  There followed a terrible silence during which David smiled into the middle distance and Maggie gave me a withering look. Ian stared at me … then suddenly threw his arms around me and said: “Thank you.” It was 20 years before we met again, and I was enjoying a run of Art at Wyndham’s theatre. As I walked into the Ivy one evening after the show I saw Ian in the lobby. I approached him and tentatively offered my hand, he grasped it, pulled me to him, threw his arm around me and said: “You are my favourite actor.” Latterly, despite the onset of illness, he came to see my work and he was very supportive. Despite the astonishing variety and brilliance of his work in film, if I were to re-evaluate his work I’d need look no farther than the Royal Court to see that his truth stands against the demonstration of acting and his power and intensity against attitude. Hugh Hudson I first met Ian when I was preparing Chariots of Fire and he fitted the part of the running coach perfectly. I put him in my second film, Greystoke, too, and would have loved to put him in every film I made but it never quite worked out, and then he died. We had a plan quite recently for a film in which he’d play someone with Parkinson’s. A great shame, as he was up for it. He wanted to work. He loved to be performing. Ian was the consummate supporting actor. He never wanted to lead, but he was so good he’d somehow end up becoming the lead anyway. His humanity and depth spilt over into the whole story. Both Ian’s roles for me were as mentors, and he was a man you’d very readily learn from. I remember being in tears watching him shoot the scene in which he shows Tarzan how to use a razor – he turned the words into something comic and magical and extremely moving. He taught me so much, particularly about working with other actors, which is with enormous discretion and patience. Ian’s great innate wisdom and honesty gave him immediate access to the truth of any character. That gentle understanding was behind his magnetism, I think. Someone told me that Laurence Olivier once came up to him and said: “How do you do it?” Ian had these amazing little inflections, incidental bits of performance genius. It’s striking an actor like Olivier, the opposite of Ian in style, was so impressed. They were both such powerful actors in their own ways – not that Ian, too, couldn’t be steely and terrifying when he wished. I thought the RSC’s current artistic director, Gregory Doran, described him perfectly when he said Ian “was entirely original. Entirely a one-off. He had a simmering cool, a compressed volcanic sense of ferocity, of danger, a pressure-cooker actor, a rare and magnificent talent.” I think Ian and I were drawn to one another because neither of us liked to speak much. I was completely at ease with him; we never had a problem with one another. He was such a modest and unshowy man. His sense of character was always impeccable and we simply understood one another and trusted each other entirely. We’d communicate on set with our hands and eyes, but he immediately knew what I wanted, which I haven’t known before or since with an actor. We saw each other socially a lot, and had a particularly memorable time at a film festival in Nimes in 2007 where our two films together were shown. In London, we’d go to restaurants and drink champagne, which he loved, and called “shampoo”. He was an adorable, adorable man and could be terribly funny. He and his wife and son came for Christmas one year – we both had weddings around the same time. Sophie and he were married for 20 years and she nursed him for 12 of those and gave him a good and happy life. They always had fun together. It was always such a laugh being with them, even if, later on, you could only see that in his sparkling eyes. It’s so sad such a beautiful spirit has gone.As told to Catherine Shoard  "
"I was prepared to like Con Air and, happily, I was not disappointed. The overall impression of watching the 1997 action classic is a lot like riding the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney World: a sandblasting assault on your senses to a thrashing rock-music soundtrack. Con Air is bombastic and overblown, but always entertaining. I enjoyed it tremendously. Con Air follows the travails of army ranger Cameron Poe [Nicolas Cage on freewheeling form] as he is sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter after defending his wife’s honour in a drunken brawl. After eight years, Poe becomes eligible for parole; a brief plane journey home with some violent criminals is all that lies between Poe and his reunion with wife Tricia (an underused Monica Potter) and daughter Casey. The plane is hijacked by the violent criminals, with bravura turns from John Malkovich as criminal mastermind Cyrus “The Virus” Grissom, a sparky Dave Chappelle as armed robber Joe “Pinball” Parker, and Steve Buscemi as serial killer Garland “The Marietta Mangler” Greene, who has virtually no dialogue yet steals the entire film. Can Poe wrestle back control of the plane, prevent further loss of life and make it back to his family in one piece? What I most enjoyed about Con Air is how straightforward it is. Director Simon West sensibly realises that, in the best action films, the plot is simply the connective tissue between the fight scenes, and he doesn’t overcook things. The film’s entire premise is set up before the opening credits roll, and exposition is kept light throughout. And what fight scenes they are. A jet takes off with a convertible tied to its rear! It crash-lands into the Las Vegas strip! Cage and Malkovich duke it out on top of a moving fire truck! Just when you think the film can’t throw anything else at you, someone says “Call in the attack helicopters!” and a fleet of aircraft hover into shot. The one-liners zing faster than the bullets punching the hold of the plane. “Looks like you missed your connection,” announces Malkovich, before immolating a traitorous fellow con. “Make a move and the bunny gets it,” Malkovich says, holding Casey’s stuffed toy at gunpoint. (Malkovich has all the best lines.) Modern action films are often overly serious – I’m looking at you, Tom Cruise – but Con Air is enjoyable precisely because it is ridiculous. I can’t think of another action film as campily self-aware or entertainingly silly. The film isn’t perfect: there are racial and transphobic slurs, and the female characters are basically just plot points. But the casting of Cage is an inspired touch: he brings levity to a character who might in other hands be a flat-footed demonstration of masculinity’s worst excesses. I can’t think of another action lead who’d play the role with the vulnerability on show when he breaks down in tears during Poe’s reconciliation with his wife. (I welled up.) Cage’s famously flamboyant acting style also works well in a movie that is, for want of a better word, hammy (how else can you describe a film that features John Malkovich holding a bunny rabbit at gunpoint?) At its heart, Con Air is a quixotic fantasy about the responsible expression of masculinity, in which rapists have the misogyny knocked out of them by bare-chested hunks with free-flowing hair, and law and order can be restored by the efforts of one heroic man acting alone. Poe always identifies on the side of the authorities despite the fact the system imprisoned him unjustly. (In his jail cell, an American flag hangs from the bunk bed.) When Poe is trapped on the plane with a gang of marauding criminals, he instinctively works to thwart their efforts, becoming in effect a proxy for law and order itself. I don’t agree with Con Air’s masculinist world view, but I certainly enjoyed the stunts."
"Many film-makers dream of their name becoming its own adjective. Hitchcockian, Tarantinoesque, Lynchian: all terms (some of them even validated by the Oxford English Dictionary) that brand the signature aesthetic, tone and/or thematic fixations of one director and his various imitators. Not every great film-maker is suitable for this treatment, however: it would be difficult to adjectivise the French director Olivier Assayas, and not just because “Assayasesque” is rather a mouthful. Forty years into his career, Assayas’s work can loosely be characterised by his cool, elegant formal style, but you’d be stretching to find many throughlines in an oeuvre that runs the gamut from muscular genre workouts to brittle comedies of manners, from tender naturalism to whirling avant-garde experimentation. He’s no workaday journeyman, but it’s clear he’d rather carve out an identity through contrast. Assayas’s latest film finds him on the straight and narrow. Having done the festival rounds last year, Wasp Network was released directly to Netflix yesterday – slightly ironic, since it’s about as glossy, multiplex-ready an entertainment as he’s ever made. A true-life thriller based on the story of a Cuban spy ring infiltrating anti-Castro terror networks in 1990s Florida, it’s got beefy, suspenseful action, slick, panoramic cinematography and an almost absurdly attractive star cast including Penélope Cruz, Gael García Bernal, Édgar Ramírez and Ana de Armas, all in fine fettle. And unlike Carlos (2010), Assayas’s superbly obsessive Carlos the Jackal biopic which marked his last foray into this realm of genre storytelling, it’s not five hours long: as a weekend Netflix watch over takeaway pizza and beer, it does a bang-up job. Which is not to say it’s top-form Assayas. He handles the mechanics of a spy story with sleek elan, but the film’s political and character interests lie on the surface: you can practically feel him straining to burrow into assorted intriguing subplots and sidebars, held back by the leash of a two-hour running time. Perhaps, like Carlos – which you can find in all its glory on iTunes, albeit in three separately charged parts – Wasp Network had dreams of being a miniseries. It’s gripping enough as is, but I could wallow in it for longer. It left me hungry to revisit Assayas’s best films across the rangy spectrum of his career, not all of which is well-served by streaming services in the UK. If you’re hoping to catch up with his work from the 80s and early 90s, you’re out of luck. (Though for physical media loyalists, the recent Criterion reissue of his lovely, raw teen study Cold Water and Arrow’s The Early Films of Olivier Assayas – only two features included, but both excellent – provide a good starting point.) I was pleased, however, to find Irma Vep (1996), his wild, sexy mashup of cinematic references and registers, available on the BFI Player. Casting Hong Kong action goddess Maggie Cheung as a version of herself in a sharp, increasingly deranged satire of France’s patriarchal film industry, it’s Assayas at his wittiest and most freewheeling. Follow it up with Demonlover (available on Amazon), perhaps his least categorisable provocation, which blends neo-noir stylings with technolust of various types. The film’s labyrinthine navigation of the early-00s digital pornography industry might seem something of a cultural snapshot these days, though its fierce anti-capitalist outlook and anarchic, screens-upon-screens film-making still feel cutting-edge. If you want a lighter, less confrontational companion piece to Irma Vep, Mubi’s new Library offers you unlimited access to Clouds of Sils Maria (2014), a breezy meditation on actorly image and insecurity, and a veritable paean to Assayas’s recent muse Juliette Binoche – even if it’s Kristen Stewart, as the long-suffering assistant to Binoche’s anxious arthouse diva, who walks off with the film. In my recent column on the Mubi Library, I already pledged my devotion to Assayas and Binoche’s first collaboration, 2008’s perfectly in-season Summer Hours; last year’s Non-Fiction (on Curzon Home Cinema) also pairs them to chatty, easygoing effect. But it’s Stewart’s mystique that seems to bring out Assayas’s most daring side. My favourite recent film of his remains Personal Shopper (2016), his frosty but unexpectedly moving millennial-generation ghost story, built perfectly around the star’s aloof, haunted screen presence – and free to stream on Amazon Prime. It barely exists in the same universe as Wasp Network, either spiritually or stylistically, but that’s exactly what makes Assayas’s film-making so rewarding to follow. More titles new to streaming this week Emma (Universal, U) Autumn de Wilde’s exquisitely clothed Jane Austen adaptation is exhaustingly twee, cupcakey to begin with, before the spry chemistry between stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn comes to the fore and it charms without trying too hard. A Foreign Affair (Eureka, U) A handsome Masters of Cinema package for an undervalued Billy Wilder film from 1948, which undercuts its airy American-abroad romantic comedy with cynical, vinegary anti-Nazi satire. Marlene Dietrich is on queenly form as a shady torch singer in postwar Berlin. Resistance (Vertigo, 15) Before he became the world’s most famous mime, Marcel Marceau was a dedicated member of the French Resistance: a compelling story given somewhat stiff film treatment, though Jesse Eisenberg is surprisingly effective as Marceau."
"You’ll need to stomach some Hollywood smuggery before getting to the good bits in this Apple TV documentary. It’s directed by the actor, Bryce Dallas Howard, who grills her celebrity-dad pals about fatherhood. Jimmy Kimmel jokingly re-enacts the moment his baby daughter projectile vomited into his mouth; Will Smith – his eyes shining with the kind of sincerity only an actor at the top of his game can muster – delivers a metaphor about fatherhood being like gardening. These snippets may make you feel a bit sick – but beyond them are six genuinely moving stories. First up is stay-at-home-dad vlogger Glen Henry, whose children are hilarious and ridiculously happy. The littlest toddles over to the camera: “Wipe. My. Butt.” Gay dads Rob and Reece Scheer explain their decision to adopt a sibling group of four neglected children, one with a diagnosis of foetal alcohol syndrome. The profile that made me cry features young father Robert Selby whose son was born with a congenital heart defect. The moment Robert saw his newborn baby hooked up to machines in hospital, something changed. He now works nights, goes to college during the day, grabs three hours’ sleep, then spends evenings with his son. Howard weaves in viral funnies throughout the movie. In one a man walks into his teenage son’s bedroom with a mallet the size of Thor’s battle hammer and proceeds to smash the kid’s game console to smithereens. As the daughter of director Ron Howard, widely regarded as one of nicest men in Hollywood, Howard is herself blessed in the dad department; he is very likable here. His only parenting crime seems to have been to film the birth of all four of his kids. But the rest of the Hollywood contributions are irritatingly platitudinous."
"Shirley Jackson, the mid-century master of American Gothic, was not one to adhere to the mundane or the real. Though in real life a housewife in Vermont, mother of four children and a contributor to magazines such as Good Housekeeping and Woman’s Home Companion, Jackson’s fiction was dark and supernaturally twisted. Her short story The Lottery, which earned her notoriety when published in the New Yorker in 1948 (she was 32), devolves into a stoning ritual in a pious New England town. Her most famous novel, The Haunting of Hill House, is a masterclass ghost story in which it’s unclear if the haunting is the house or the powerful potential of one’s own insanity. Jackson’s most insightful and terrifying domain was the gruesome, spectral possibilities of the unhinged female mind, especially one locked inside by fear, or the men outside it. Shirley, a new film from director Josephine Decker which stars Elisabeth Moss as the reclusive author in her later years (she died of heart failure, age 48, in 1965), plunges into a cruelly imaginative world with a Jacksonian disregard for the chronological details. The film, based on the book Shirley: A Novel by Susan Scarf Merrell, retains some of the facts of Jackson’s adult life – her use of amphetamines and alcohol, her flare-ups of agoraphobia, her unabashedly philandering husband Stanley (Michael Stuhlbarg), her eclectic, imprisoning house in Bennington, Vermont, where Stanley taught at the local college – but dispenses with the tropes of a straight biopic. Instead, the film leans into the psychodrama, induced by debilitating writer’s block and circumscribing sexism, “so that the experience of meeting her would feel like you were actually in one of her novels or her short stories”, Decker told the Guardian. This Shirley is a witchy, prickly storm, both master and pawn of her house, one who reacts poorly to the arrival, sometime in the late 50s, of assistant professor Fred (Logan Lerman) and his pregnant wife Rosie (Odessa Young). The young couple, invited to stay indefinitely by the narcissistic bon vivant that is Stanley, mirror the older couple in their mutual dependency and resentments, the devaluing of the woman’s intellectualism into a self-serving marvel (Rosie, a student, is ordered to stay home to care for the ailing Shirley) and the women’s erotic response to fanged talent – on the way to Vermont, Rosie finishes The Lottery, smiles, and initiates sex in a train car with Fred.  The charge is particularly palpable between Shirley – struggling to write again and obsessed with the unsolved disappearance of a young, attractive co-ed – and Rosie, whose veneer as a winning housewife begins to crack under Jackson’s attention. Decker’s claustrophobic, dreamlike style, honed in her experimental theater-generated breakout Madeline’s Madeline, translates well to Jackson’s trademark slipping of the mental grip – “this kind of descent from a place that is fixed to a place that is a bit more liquid [which] she does so seamlessly in her work”, Decker said. Shunted off from careers, boxed in by terrors of the outdoors, Shirley and Rosie’s relationship deepens and twists in splintered nightmares, shards of dream sequences, glimpses as the house yawns and groans. “She puts you into a dream without you realizing that you’ve gone there,” said Decker of Jackson’s writing, only for the delusion to unravel. Without spoiling, Shirley and Rosie’s devious connection culminates with a gut-punch reveal and an emotional precipice.  As in The Haunting of Hill House, the seemingly benign house in Bennington begins to lure Rosie away from the world outside and into a wild, creative fugue, even as the author recognizes the emotionally abusive dynamic of her marriage replicating in the younger couple. Though “I never think of putting lessons in my art,” said Decker, and the film is set in the 1950s, “I don’t know that Shirley’s travails feel all that different from the things that women now live through … even though I think we’re much further along than we were in Shirley’s time, there’s still a lot of confusion around gender roles, households, how do you prioritize your art and the people around you?” Young Rosie, ambitious and desperate to be taken seriously, soon conflates in Shirley’s mind with the missing co-ed, and the writing at hand. “The thing I related to the most in the film is what is your artistic process?” said Decker. “How do you fuel that artistic process without destroying other people or being destroyed yourself? And I think that’s an eternally interesting question. What is your muse? How are you using your muse, or abusing your muse, or possibly liberating your muse?” Especially from the trap of male validation – in Decker’s film, Shirley is her own monster, surly and beguiling, unpredictable and bullying especially about her achilles heel: the opinion of Stanley, a self-serving critic whose opinion of himself is clearly bound in the notoriety of Shirley’s genius. The film’s standout final scene reveals just how deep the well of need for male esteem can go. The ability to work outside that desire has, said Decker, preoccupied since the film – what would a world fully unbound from male validation look like? “I would like to live in that world,” said Decker. “Maybe in 50 years.” Still, Shirley was a predominantly female-driven film, from Decker to screenwriter Sarah Gubbins to Sue Chan on production design and costume designer Amela Baksic. “I think that when you have a lot of powerful women running a film set, there’s a little bit more space for the women on the film set to go where they need to go,” said Decker. “What I hope is that having that many women on set, in that many departments and that many roles, allowed [Moss] and [Young] to really feel supported, that they could voice any concerns that they had, and they could go as far as they needed to go because I think performance, for me, is always the center of the movie.” Moss is not a stranger to grazing the emotional cliff in her work, as demonstrated by roles in Her Smell, as the harrowed anchor of The Handmaid’s Tale and earlier this year in the bruising horror The Invisible Man. Her work in Shirley feels like pressing into a mosquito bite – gripping, stinging, sweet. Her Shirley is singular not in talent here but in the total unpredictability of her reactions – whether pushing out or drawing in – nevertheless grounded in guarded, hackled emotional need. Moss “understands the medium so well, and so I felt like a lot of my role was inviting her to really trust her instincts and to let Shirley get close to her, to not feel like we had to invent a big character or anything like that”, said Decker. “With Shirley, I think it’s a kind of wicked magic that [Moss] channeled, that’s really liberating but also terrifying at times.” The primarily female set allowed Moss to “be close to her instincts and to not feel that the character was something separate from her”, she added.  Ultimately, Shirley doesn’t part with any pat conclusions or neat wrap-ups for its muse – “The film is very open to interpretation, and I hope it strikes up conversations when people see it, and then I hope that those conversations lead people to be interested in how Shirley wrote and what she wrote,” said Decker. “She’s a stunning artist who deserves to be one of the most famous artists that we talk about.”"
"I live with my wife in Los Angeles overlooking the San Fernando Valley. I can see the sunrise one way, sunset the other. My wife is talented in many ways, and she’s also a great and healthy cook. I’m not eating bread and I’ve lost weight. I’m able to get out to my horses. I’m working on a discipline called reining and rehearsing for when the horse shows open up again. I’m working with my two show dogs. I’m in better shape than I’ve been in years. I’m in a ferment of creativity. I’m making music and dreaming up new shows – I’m trying to sell two or three series to the networks right now. I’m finishing up a blues album that I started before coronavirus hit. At the same time, I’ve been working with a poet and a musician in New York. I perform the words on an iPhone and once I email it he writes the accompaniment, so I’ve got another album all ready. Patrick Stewart is a great friend of mine, but I haven’t seen Star Trek: Picard. I haven’t watched any Star Trek. I just don’t like watching myself on television.  I don’t know why, but I just don’t binge TV. Last night, I looked at an old black-and-white June Allyson movie because I was thinking, “Why was June Allyson so popular?” I looked at a documentary on bears because I was curious about how bears hibernate and what they do in the summer. I take on a polyglot of subjects. I listen to lectures on my phone. I just heard one on Alexander the Great, who I talk about in my one-man shows. Not only was I pronouncing “Bucephalus” [Alexander’s horse] incorrectly, they have also somehow solved the mystery of his death."
"The appearance of an enjoyably naff sex education video delivered by a nun suggests early on that this coming-of-age film set in rural Kildare in 1995 might be more Derry Girls than Normal People. Eddie (Fionn O’Shea, who also stars in Normal People) is training for the army, but harbours a secret crush on one of his male teachers. Amber (Lola Petticrew) likes girls and dreams of opening “an anarchist bookshop with franchise potential”. The closeted teenagers reluctantly agree to be each other’s beards. A romcom-like montage celebrates their platonic friendship as it blossoms. The odd couple ride bikes, read zines and take a bus to Dublin, where a drag queen dressed as Dolly Parton appears as a glowing apparition. As Amber becomes more comfortable with her queerness, the taciturn Eddie retreats inwards. Their parallel journeys dispense with a one-size-fits-all coming-out narrative and are handled with a lightness of touch by Irish writer and director David Freyne (who made the zombie movie The Cured, starring Ellen Page)."
"To this day, the notoriety that precedes Heaven’s Gate is as outsized as the film’s 216-minute runtime: as the largest critical and commercial flop of its era, its disastrous reception was a major factor in the shuttering of its studio, United Artists, as well as a convenient scapegoat for the death of the New Hollywood revolution that preceded it.  Yet, 40 years after its initial release, Michael Cimino’s magnum opus has undergone a remarkable critical reappraisal. Once the posterchild for auteurist hubris, it slowly built a cult following before eventually being welcomed into the arthouse canon proper. While some continue to hold it up as one of the worst movies ever made (a preposterous claim even when accounting for all its collateral damage), it is now generally regarded an unjustly maligned – if flawed – classic. This heady mix of infamy and acclaim, of which I’ve been cognisant since my teens thanks to the film’s prominence in the cinema docs A Decade Under the Influence, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls and Z-Channel: A Magnificent Obsession, combined with the aforementioned lengthy runtime, always made the prospect of actually watching the film rather intimidating. For years, I’ve put it off by using the convenient excuse that I was waiting for a theatrical screening in order to “see it the way it was meant to be seen”. Since that’s not on the cards at the moment, I figured it was finally time. Intimidated though I was, I was also excited, since I have a deep and abiding love of all things New Hollywood, as well as westerns and Lean/Leone-sized epics. I might have popped my Cimino cherry with The Deer Hunter and still scratched two out of three of those itches, but I believe the best entrance to a formidable artist’s body of work is through their most challenging efforts: my first Fellini was 8½, my first Tarkovsky was Stalker, my first Lynch was Lost Highway. Therefore, I reasoned, my first Cimino should be Heaven’s Gate. My theory proved correct. Heaven’s Gate opens with a long graduation ceremony at Harvard University in the year 1869. We’re introduced to Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson), a rakish young upstart who clearly comes from wealth (his spirited optimism and lust for life make it very obvious that, despite being of fighting age, he managed to avoid the recently concluded civil war). There’s also his loquacious boozehound buddy, Billy Irvine (John Hurt), and angelic girlfriend and soon-to-be wife, a silent and nameless cipher whose haunting presence bookends the film while bringing its grand theme – that we’re each of us victims of the our class – into sharp and troubling relief.  Following this prologue, we are shuttled 20 years into the future and deposited in Wyoming. There we find a much-changed Averill serving as sheriff of Johnson County, a fertile farmland where a bloody range war is being waged between poor and starving immigrant farmers – most of them newly arrived from Europe – and the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, a cooperative made up of the state’s richest cattle barons (including a reluctant, but concessive Billy). On his return to Johnson County, Averill learns that the association has drawn up a death list of 125 names (almost every immigrant in the county) and arranged to bring in an army of mercenaries to carry out executions.  Despite his own privileged background, Averill – who has found himself entangled in a tense love triangle with the beautiful French-Canadian madam Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert) and his former friend Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), a local farm boy turned conscience stricken gun-thug – vows to protect his adopted community against the association’s murderous machinations. Given that this is a typically cynical and despairing 70s movie (one based on a real-life atrocity), it’s not much of a spoiler to reveal his efforts are all for naught, the ratcheting violence of this war of attrition eventually leading to a full-scale massacre – one of many on which this nation was built. Suffice to say, Heaven’s Gate made for appropriate, if untraditional, Memorial Day viewing. For all that I expected Heaven’s Gate to be a sprawling epic in the vein of One-Eyed Jack and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, it proved remarkably straightforward in its plot and focus. While the most memorable scenes are drawn-out set pieces – the opening graduation ceremony, a rollicking wheel-skate dance derby, the climactic battle – its sense of sprawl comes mostly through prolonged moments of quiet intimacy between a handful of characters. These scenes go a long way towards imbuing the film with its funereal feel, although they also come at the expense of some dearly needed character backstory and narrative connective tissue.  Say what you will about Cimino’s storied megalomaniacal obsessiveness and authoritarian tendencies (his on-set nickname was The Ayatollah), he truly left it all up there on screen. Aesthetically speaking, Heaven’s Gate is unimpeachable, from the lived-in period detail of the costumes and set design, to the stunning cinematography – by turns ethereal and earthen – courtesy of the legendary Vilmos Zsigmond, to the soulful work of its leads (particularly Kristofferson, who never gets the credit he deserves as one of his era’s greatest movie stars). There is also a ridiculously stacked supporting cast (including Jeff Bridges, Sam Waterston, Brad Dourif, Mickey Rourke, Terry O’Quinn, Geoffrey Lewis, Tom Noonan, Robin Bartlett, Joseph Cotten and an uncredited, blink-and-you’ll-miss-him Willem Dafoe). The film maintains a clear moral vision without seeming reductive – a charge that was levelled at Cimino’s Vietnam epic, The Deer Hunter. Particularly effective is the way in which Heaven’s Gate unequivocally sides with its immigrant underclass without reducing them to paragons of noble victimhood. All that said, the film lacks the full cathartic power and thematic complexity of successive works that it seemingly inspired, such as John Sayles’ sterling coal war drama Matewan and HBO’s radical revisionist western Deadwood.  That my biggest criticism of the film is that it’s not quite as good as those two utter masterpieces should make it clear that I am now a full-on pro-Heaven’s Gate partisan.  As such, I was tempted to argue that Heaven’s Gate should now be considered purely on its merits as a film, rather than its cultural baggage. But the more I think about it, the more I realise said baggage adds to its overall power. It’s entirely fitting – poetic even – that the cinematic revolution of the 1970s should kick off with a handful of small films about scrappy rebels traversing a rugged landscape in search of the American dream, only for it to buckle and collapse under the weight of this towering ode to defeat and the destructive folly of manifest destiny and westward expansion."
"Oscar-winning director Taika Waititi has been honoured on New Zealand’s Queen’s birthday list for services to film. The 44-year-old Māori man who hails from the east coast of the North Island has been made an officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit. Some of his most famous work – most notably the film Boy – was based in part on his own experiences, and over decades he has shown a passion for telling the stories of Indigenous people, as well as others often overlooked by the mainstream film community. Waititi told Radio New Zealand that an award from New Zealand meant more than any other, and Boy, set on the East Cape, remained the work he was most proud of. “Personally I make my stuff for New Zealanders first and foremost. They are my first audience. My peers and colleagues, to be recognised by them, people who are closer to my home, is more significant.” A total of 178 New Zealanders were on the list, including former All Blacks captain Kieran Read, novelist Elizabeth Knox, and Māori linguist Āni Pātene Gazala Wainu. Waititi’s Nazi-era satire Jojo Rabbit won the Oscar for best-adapted screenplay at the 2020 Academy Awards. In his acceptance speech Waititi thanked his mother for giving him the book on which the film was based and dedicated the award to “all the indigenous kids in the world who want to do art and write and dance and who are the original storytellers.” “We can make it here” he said. Last month, Waititi was announced as the director of the new Star Wars film, after impressing Hollywood with his big-action blockbuster, Thor: Ragnarok. After winning the Oscar prime minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand was “incredibly proud of him”, while Christine Leunens, the author of the novel that Waititi adapted to win his Oscar, said she watched all of Waititi’s work before agreeing to let him adapt it. “There was something very distinctive, tragedy and humour [about his work],” she said. “Living in New Zealand, I find that the Māori have such a wonderful sense of humour, and such warmth and such inclusivity.” Ella Henry, a commentator on the Māori screen industry based at Auckland University of Technology, said although Jojo Rabbit was not on its face an Indigenous tale, Waititi had told it in a way that was in keeping with Māori storytelling traditions. “If you look at the way Taika’s films have evolved to use humour and pathos to express trauma, he elevates survival by bringing that pathos and humour and resilience to those stories,” she said. “So I would say it’s a very Māori story.” In New Zealand, Waititi is beloved, and his earlier films, namely Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, are the highest-grossing New Zealand films of all time. In 2017 he was named New Zealander of the year, and used the opportunity to front a series of anti-racism campaigns."
"Here’s a film that has been dug out from near the back of the freezer cabinet – something from 2018. It’s a teen female-friendship, coming-of-ager from 27-year-old actor and co-screenwriter Hannah Marks who stars here, channelling a young Sandra Bullock. She plays Californian high-school student April, dating the egregiously hot Nick (Dylan Sprouse) who breaks up with her at the end of the senior year. So begins April’s summer of misery, which seems complete when she learns, from Insta-stalking Nick, that he is now dating gorgeous Clara (Liana Liberato). A drunken confrontation between the two women has a weird cathartic outcome: they secretly become best friends, and it’s almost as if both of them are cheating on Nick – with each other. The fundamental premise of this never really looks anything other than muddled and implausible, and certainly doesn’t free up the relationship between Marks and Liberato in any satisfyingly comic direction. There is no law that says a movie like this has to be funny exactly, and it needn’t be something in the style of Booksmart – but there is something rather solemn about it. It is weird to see the cameo from Jacob Batalon, who was very funny recently as Peter Parker’s best friend, Ned Leeds, in the Spider-Man MCU movies, here playing a cinema manager with a hopeless crush on April who has an embarrassing summer job there. Something about the script removes the comedy oxygen from his performance."
"Many a friend and family member has told me they’re watching more classic cinema than usual in lockdown, and not just because they’ve binged every bit of new content Netflix has to offer. Nostalgia, however rosy and selective, is all the more inviting when present-day reality has so little comfort to offer. In spite of this drawcard, the selection of films made before, say, 1970 on most streaming outlets remains spotty at best. Which is why the BBC iPlayer’s recent acquisition of 23 films from the vault of RKO Pictures – one of Hollywood’s “Big Five” studios in the golden age, bankrupted by the 1960s – has been received with palpable excitement. Suddenly I find enthusiastic responses to the likes of The Magnificent Ambersons and King Kong popping up all over my Twitter feed: it certainly makes a nice change from the Tiger King discourse of the spring. All the films are available to stream for over a year, and range from classics – hey, have you heard that Citizen Kane is supposed to be pretty good? – to lesser-known treasures, or ones that have just gradually lost their following over the years. None are duds: you can safely pick any one at random and sink pleasurably into its combination of plush studio artifice, tidy traditional storytelling and blazing star quality: this is, after all, the terrain of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The latter two are particularly well represented: in the age of Strictly Come Dancing, after all, a bit of ballroom spectacle never goes out of style. Top Hat is the most famous of the genre, and with good reason. I couldn’t remember its trifle of a romantic plot if my life depended on it, but the duo’s dancing was never better or more dreamily clothed and staged: the number that gave the world Cheek to Cheek, complete with Rogers’s famous ostrich-feather gown, is Hollywood dessert of the highest order. Still, the others all have equivalent delights: The Gay Divorcee – she’s happy, of course, not homosexual – loses some points for stripping most of the Cole Porter songs from the stage show it’s based on, but you can’t resist its sheer swirliness. For the sake of comparison, a few of Astaire and Rogers’s respective solo vehicles are also on offer. She fares better on her own than he does: she won an Oscar for ditching the dancing shoes as a class-climbing shop worker in Kitty Foyle, a role rejected by Hepburn, and it’s surprising how elegantly she takes to full-bore melodrama. Dramatically, Astaire feels less at home in the wartime romance The Sky’s the Limit, but it does give him his best screen singing moment with the future Sinatra standard One for My Baby. Those with more macho genre inclinations are covered too: a couple of John Ford westerns are included, the best of them being the rousing, subtly melancholic US Cavalry saga She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, anchored by John Wayne and shot in radiant, justly Oscar-winning Technicolor. Film noir fans can wallow in the chic menace of Angel Face, in which a standard potboiler plot is elevated by the atmospheric psychosexual implications of Otto Preminger’s direction and the bristling chemistry of Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons: they work so well together they were subsequently paired, to enjoyable if less memorable effect, in the romantic comedy Beautiful But Dangerous, also in the iPlayer lineup. Romcoms, continuing our thematic kick from some weeks ago, are perhaps where the RKO selection delivers most joyously. If you haven’t seen Bringing Up Baby, now’s the time to relish its perfectly choreographed slapstick and lickety-split Grant-Hepburn banter. Grant gets a couple of other outings: My Favourite Wife is less celebrated, but its screwball mechanics are supremely well oiled, and his interplay with Irene Dunne has its own tangy flavour. Director Leo McCarey and Dunne previously teamed up on Love Affair, a delicious blend of champagne-fizzy cruise-ship comedy and romantic angst. Its remake, An Affair to Remember, became better known, but the original is drier, funnier and tinged with sadness: optimum comfort viewing, then, for the strange mood swings of the present. The Lighthouse (Universal, 15) If you fear you’ve gone a bit loopy in lockdown, you’ve got nothing on Robert Pattinson’s lighthouse keeper in Robert Eggers’s astonishing metaphysical horror film: tracking his splintering psyche as he isolates with a splendidly salty Willem Dafoe, it’s a work of unhinged beauty. Echo in the Canyon (Universal, 12) The Laurel Canyon music scene of the 1960s — encompassing such groups as the Byrds and the Beach Boys — gets a loving overview in former record label boss Andrew Slater’s informed, entertaining documentary, packed with excellent music and insights from artists old and new. Vivarium (Vertigo, 15) Clearly it’s the week for extreme social-isolation nightmares in home entertainment. Lorcan Finnegan’s witty, chilly study of two young househunters losing all sense of space, time and sanity in an infinite new-build housing estate makes you grateful for your own home comforts. The Vanishing (StudioCanal, 15) Has there ever been a more purely, efficiently unnerving horror film than this? Probing into all one’s basest fears regarding existence, disappearance and death, George Sluizer’s original 1988 psychodrama gets a handsome Blu-ray reissue."
"A sex addict re-enacts every one of her 169 conquests on a road trip across America with a man she’s only just met – he’s got testicular cancer – in this shallow, dismally unfunny comedy from Nico Raineau. Brittany Snow does her best to make the character convincing but not only is the movie (clearly inspired by Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck) a comedy dead zone, it is virtually devoid of recognisably real human beings. In a nicely tuned performance, Snow plays Darla, a cynical sex columnist sacked from her job on a magazine after being caught shagging an intern in the editor’s office. (The firing is nicely spiky: “You’re not the only nympho who can form a sentence.”) An earlier sexual harassment complaint means that Darla is forced to attend a sex addicts’ group where she meets adorable Bailey (Sam Richardson), a sweet guy who’s walked into the wrong meeting: he’s meant to be next door with the cancer survivors. The script completely fudges Darla’s sex addiction – one minute she’s a liberated woman doing her thing, the next she’s facing up to her behaviours and recovery. She never has to deal with any kind of social shunning or slut shaming. Inexplicably, five minutes after meeting, Darla and Bailey embark on their road trip; they’re not a couple, this is a kind of therapy for both of them. Actually, she’s secretly blogging about the experience to try to get her job back. You can guess what happens. There’s nothing in their chemistry to suggest the two should get together never mind stay together – but during one of their encounters, they kiss, and Darla’s face, hardened by years of empty anonymous hook ups, softens like a flower, just in time for a fantasy fairytale ending. Weirdly prudish about the intimacy scenes, the sex addiction storyline is a cheap attempt to spice up the romcom formula, but this movie is as vanilla as they come."
"Two years ago, in a neat suburban house on a cul-de-sac in Bromley, where all furniture was floral, and every wall painted magnolia, I watched Monica Dolan poke her head out of a loft hatch. She was filming Days of the Bagnold Summer, the adaptation of the much loved graphic novel by Joff Winterhart. Her character, Sue Bagnold, was having an argument with her sulky teenage son, Daniel (Earl Cave). “Was that a bit much?” she asked her director, Simon Bird, at one point. “Try it softer,” he said, later adding, “Gosh. That’s lovely stuff.” Later, in the back garden, Dolan sat and explained what had been going through her mind. “I thought, ‘What if I fall through?’” At 51, the actor had a new challenge. “I think that’s my first ever loft scene, actually.” In the middle of May this year, I called Dolan at home in London, in a very different world to the lively film set where we’d met. “A friend said that, after this, anything filmed before the coronavirus is going to seem like a period piece,” she said. Not that Bagnold Summer is a period piece: it’s deliberately timeless. But its story of a mother and son, unexpectedly thrown together for a few weeks, has taken on a particular timeliness, too. “How many people must that be happening to, that they didn’t necessarily end up where they wanted to be, or were planning to be, when all of this happened?” she says. “I’ve seen a lot of Monica’s work, and I love her,” said Bird, on a break from filming. “She’s so brilliant at doing comedy and drama, and that’s where I want the film to exist, somewhere between the two. She can play Rose West amazingly but she’s also hilarious in W1A. So she was a no-brainer, really.” Dolan has become one of the most recognisable faces on British television, a tremendous character actor seemingly at home in any genre. She won a Bafta for her portrayal of West in Appropriate Adult in 2011, and was nominated again for her role as Marion Thorpe, wife of Jeremy, in A Very English Scandal. She was Welsh PR Tracey in W1A, a part she reprised for the recent surprise Zoom special. Her lockdown has been a prolific time and she sounds as if she’s been incredibly busy. “It’s been nothing like I imagined it would be,” she says. At first, she thought she would have some time on her hands, but that wasn’t the case at all. There was the BBC Radio 4 series set on the phone, Personal Shopper, and Headlong and Century Film’s series of shorts, Unprecedented, for BBC Four. “And then before we’d filmed that, I was asked to do Talking Heads. It got incredibly busy very quickly, and that was good, I suppose,” she says. “And then right in the middle of that, just before we filmed Unprecedented, my brother died.”  Her brother, Paul, was 56 and he died on Good Friday. “It was Covid and pneumonia,” she says. She has been in lockdown at her own home, separated from the rest of her family. “My sister is near my mum, so she’s taking care of her at the moment.” There were four Dolan siblings; another sister died of cancer, in 2008. “So I really, really feel for my mum, because she’s outlived two of her children. She’s 86, and she’s absolutely incredible. She’s just so strong. I can’t imagine many people coping with it. So, if anyone asks me about the lockdown, I can’t really talk about it without talking about that, because it’s just been absolutely enormous, and continues to be.” Everyone is experiencing the pandemic, but, she says, we are not all experiencing it in the same way. “There’s a real disconnect. Some people are in hospital, some people are grieving, some people are irritated that they can’t get what they want from Waitrose, everyone’s worried about whether the schools should go back or not, lots of people are in financial difficulty and want to get back to work, and obviously people are scared of that, too. “I think that what I find quite difficult is that it’s my brother, and it’s intensely personal, and I love him so much, and at the same time his death suddenly becomes part of a wider global narrative, and I don’t know how I feel about that, really. I’m sure a lot of people are feeling like that.” Having so much work on has helped. “Especially at the very beginning. I was doing Unprecedented and that was due to be rehearsed and possibly filmed on the Tuesday after Easter, and then I think I found out I got the Talking Heads on the Thursday before Easter. It was all happening at once, and it did get hairy at that time. But I think when you’re in shock, your body just creates a great surge of energy, so it’s great to have somewhere to put it all.”  As well as revisiting the classics, Talking Heads will feature two new monologues written by Alan Bennett. Dolan is performing one of those, called The Shrine. “I play Lorna, and I don’t think I’m ruining if I say that she’s had a bereavement, because we find that out pretty much instantly,” she says. She started learning her lines on the day she found out that her brother had died. I ask her if it was difficult to do a piece about grief while she was grieving. “Well, it’s an odd thing. I’m really very, very passionate and stringent about [the fact that] the character’s not you. Any crossover and I get quite irritated. The thing is that any feelings of grief that the character has, they’ll be experiencing them in a different way, and at a different time.” Obviously, she says, you use yourself to play a character. “But if you get too engaged with it, from a personal point of view, then it’s not really acting, is it?” In Days of the Bagnold Summer, Dolan plays an introverted librarian with a large collection of pastel twinsets who starts to reassess her life. Though its contains all the ingredients that could be cooked up into a coming-of-age film about her teenage son, Daniel, it is very much Sue’s story, too; the way in which it splits our sympathies between them is quite beautiful, and certainly unusual. When the film did the festival rounds, pre-lockdown, Dolan found that when the cast did Q&As, it was mostly older women who asked questions. “And you usually don’t get one woman asking. For some reason, unfortunately, we talk about these films like, ‘Oh it’s about a boy who ...’ Even the way that we talk about that shows how unbalanced it is. I think I read somewhere that the least likely person to appear on television is a 52-year-old woman from the north of England,” she says. “And they’re the most likely person to watch television.”  In 2019, Dolan won an Olivier award for best supporting actress, for All About Eve in the West End. Awards make a difference, she says, if only because they open more doors. “Certainly after the Bafta, I think people are more interested to meet you. If I had to put it in a nutshell, when you’ve won an award, people thank you for coming on the way in, and if you haven’t won an award, people thank you for coming on the way out,” she laughs. She is also a playwright – she took her one-woman show The B*easts to the Edinburgh festival fringe in 2017. Is she worried about the future of theatre, given that every day there seems to be a new story about the potential for financial ruin? “Of course it concerns me. But the thing that makes theatre theatre is that you’re all breathing in the same space. So we have to be safe to do that, as well. I think that possibly after this, people will need theatre more than ever, because that human connection will be what we’ve been craving. But my dearest hope is that we can keep going before that.” Now that the early lockdown flurry of work has slowed, she is taking the time to write. “I have to say that, psychologically, I don’t feel like I’m in an enormous hurry to leave the house any quicker than anybody else,” she says, understandably. “I thought there’d be not a lot happening at this time. But it turns out pretty much everything has happened.”"
"Eight years ago, the Rodney Ascher documentary Room 237 reignited discussion over Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining by surveying a range of different fan theories on what the film is about, and the evidence that exists to support those theories. Some of the ideas are legitimately compelling, like one that posits the film as an excoriation of American imperialism, jumping off from the fact that its haunted hotel, The Overlook, was built on a Native American burial ground, and continuing with other references and bric-a-brac to back it up (Can those cans of Calumet Baking Powder be a coincidence?!). Others are mostly cockamamie, like the theory that Kubrick had made the film as an apologia for his role in faking the moon landing. (Why else would Danny be wearing an Apollo 11 sweater?!) Kubrick’s longtime aide Leon Vitali – who the 2017 doc Filmworker painted as Igor to the director’s Dr Frankenstein – scoffed at the interpretations floated by Room 237, but it was never the point of the documentary to convince the audience to buy into any one take on The Shining. Its deeper purpose was to celebrate The Shining as a glorious enigma, a film that invites Grand Unifying Theories without ever quite affirming any of them. We’re no closer to figuring it out now than we were 40 years ago, but like The Overlook itself, there’s some indefinable allure that keeps beckoning us back for a visit. Like Jack Torrance, the murderous caretaker played by Jack Nicholson, it’s starting to feel like we’ve always been here. Like a lot of Kubrick’s work, especially the films toward the back half of his career, The Shining was greeted first with bafflement and hostility before people started to come around on it. The hostility has faded as the film has gotten more widely recognized as a horror staple; the author Stephen King still famously dislikes what Kubrick did with his book, but the recent adaptation of King’s sequel, Doctor Sleep, leans heavily into the film’s iconography. But the bafflement is baked into the pie – it’s what makes the film so primally terrifying and unsettling to experience, and what teases the brain into trying to solve it. The astonishing opening shots of Jack wending his way up the Colorado mountains are a sign of things to come: Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind’s eerie Moog interpretation of Hector Berlioz’s Symphonie fantastique, the mirroring of the landscape against a placid lake, and most crucially, the breathless whoosh of the camera. With Steadicam mounts finally available to combine movement with stability, Kubrick experiments as much as any film since in what a constantly roving camera could do to unmoor an audience. Even in the relatively benign early scenes of Jack heading to the interview or the whole Torrance clan, including his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd), getting a tour of the hotel, it feels like a game of chicken, as if the camera were zooming headlong into danger and we can’t be assured it will ever swerve away. As the Torrances settle into The Overlook for the winter and a snowstorm severs their connection to the outside world, the madness that quickly seizes Jack – too quickly, many critics at the time griped – starts to ramp up a whole strategy of disorientation. Kubrick makes a joke out of titles announcing different days of the week, as if time has any meaning in isolation, and the geography of The Overlook is impossible to map, despite (or because of) the many shots of Danny rolling through the hallways on his Big Wheel. The kitchen, the living quarters, the Gold Room, the upper floors where the previous caretaker axed his own family, the dreaded Room 237 — all distinct spaces, but there’s no guessing how they all connect. Kubrick’s sense of humor is one of his less appreciated qualities, even in non-comedies like Barry Lyndon or Eyes Wide Shut, and The Shining relishes the opportunity to goof on the horror genre, whether through the flourishes of Nicholson’s performance (“Heeeeeere’s Johnny!”) or the odyssey of the Overlook’s head chef (Scatman Crouthers), who answers Danny’s psychic SOS, only to get an axe in the chest. However viewers might expect a horror film to behave, Kubrick seems hellbent on defying it, whether that means creating dreamlike cascades of blood around an elevator bank, flashing on scenes of past carnage, or just having a laugh over the expectation that the chef’s long rescue mission will amount to anything. Every rewatch of The Shining seems to trigger a new obsession, often depending on who’s doing the watching or when. Kubrick’s treatment of Duvall, for example, has gotten renewed scrutiny in light of abuses against women in the film industry, and so witnessing her raw vulnerability as Wendy, the one non-possessed member of the Torrance family, feels like a grim twist on Method performance. Watching The Shining under Covid-19 quarantine, too, makes it seems like an uncanny echo of the anxious state of isolation, where the days are blurry and borderless, and a cavernous hotel can feel as confined as a studio apartment. Even those in their right mind are now a little better acquainted with madness. Of the theories swirling around The Shining, the one that seems the most plausible 40 years later is The Overlook as a metaphor for the horrors wrought by the American elite, which ties into the cloistered world of Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut and his career-long skepticism of the powerful. In touring the place, Jack is told that the Overlook was “one of the stopping places for the jet set,” where all sorts of important people had stayed, including four presidents, and surely made consequential decisions as they were perched on high. Hearing about the hotel being built on a Native American burial ground may add the threat of retribution from beyond the grave, but Kubrick suggests this desecration is the original sin, like an evil embedded in the hotel’s foundation. “All the best people” stayed at The Overlook, Jack is told, and where have you heard that phrase before? The hotel has a presence – a shining – that’s frightening to those who are sensitive to it, like the chef and Danny, but it’s scariest of all for being both irredeemable and indestructible. Jack having been there before, and Jack attempting more or less the same murder as a previous caretaker, is a sign that history will keep on repeating itself. And for the powerful people who vacation there, these are the rooms where it happens. The sad truth about The Overlook is that what happened to the Torrances will probably get cleaned up for the next season and turn into a cautionary anecdote for the next half-cracked caretaker who wants the job. The carnage never ends."
"This postapocalyptic survivalist thriller, set in rural Britain, is both violent and depressing, with some iffy line-readings, weird script moments and untied plot strands. It isn’t badly shot by any means, with one or two effective action scenes and interesting use of remote locations, but it takes two ploddingly long hours to tell a cumbersomely inflated and often dull story, which even at the finish line has to be wound up pretty arbitrarily. We are in a lawless, chaotic land where food, water and shelter are grimly scarce. A lone individual (Luke Hobson), haunted by his tragic past, makes common cause with a young woman (Georgie Smibert) and a desperate, angry man (Chris Kaye) to win out against a terrifying band of marauding cannibals and rapists, led by a brutal figure known as The Beast (Bryn Hodgen). They also get help from a couple, played by Nicholas Chambers and Susan Lee Burton, who have their own reasons for fearing and hating these evil monsters. The strangest moment comes when when Smibert’s character is briefly imprisoned as a sex slave by the Beast, and she briefly befriends another young woman chained up for the same purpose. Later, the couple reveal their daughter was taken and could still be in the Beast’s compound. Did these two plot points have a relationship in earlier script drafts? The way they played out here is disconcerting and inconclusive. The story is, of course, headed for a monumentally horrible, medieval-style bloodbath, and the film delivers on that score, but the dialogue scenes are leaden and it is impossible to feel any sympathy or interest in any of its characters."
"The Final Wish could be the last straw. It’s another example of dumb horror: derivative, factory-product, unscary movie-making that jumbles up a bunch of secondhand tropes without any real storytelling discipline, although there is a decent, professional performance here from Lin Shaye as an ageing woman haunted by her past. Aaron (Michael Welch), a young guy whose life is going nowhere and who thinks of himself as a failure, has to return to his home town on hearing that his dad has died. There is an uneasy reunion with his troubled mother, Kate (Shaye), local girl Lisa (Melissa Bolona) with whom he is still poignantly in love, and a number of school friends and school enemies. But his late father, an antiques dealer, had in his possession a mysterious urn that can grant wishes – which leads to horrible Mephistophelean choices for Aaron. I’m a sucker for a Monkey’s Paw-type story, something like the brash Wishmaster films of the 90s. But here, fatally, there is no clarity or internal consistency about how these wishes are to be expressed and granted. Does Aaron literally have to say, or think, some phrase such as “I wish” or “I want”? By the end of the drama, when the number of wishes requested becomes very important, the answer would appear to be yes. But earlier, he could apparently (and accidentally) wish for the death of a dog merely by disliking the animal. Then there is the time-honoured question of wishing for a dead person to be back with us, and all the spine-chilling implications. Are these reanimated corpses the actual people, or just an evil genie impersonating them? Again, there is something very feeble in the answer to this. A low-budget scarer like this could have worked. The script lets it down."
"The title, at once aimless and coyly, almost whimsically seductive, gives a partial sense of this film’s mood. It’s an elegantly made road movie in a style I can only call Euro-arthouse quirk. The director is Ena Sendijarević, making her feature debut with deadpan borrowings from Suleiman and Jarmusch. It is a dry, dark comedy that is clearly riffing on elements from her own background: like her lead character, Sendijarević was raised in the Netherlands, but born in Bosnia, which her parents fled during the 90s war. You are left wondering about the less quirky reality that must lie some way behind the story. Alma (Sara Luna Zorić) is a teenager who lives in the Netherlands with her mum, but hears that her dad – who ran out on them when she was a kid – is now very sick back in Bosnia. Alma conceives a desire to see him for the first and last time. Her mum fixes her up with a place to stay out there with her moody, slightly gangster-y cousin, Emir (Ernad Prnjavorac), and, on her arrival, Emir’s friend Denis (Lazar Dragojević) is rather enamoured of Alma, who does a lot of sunbathing in a bikini or her underwear and who flavours the movie with a tang of artless sexiness. Sendijarević displays some arch film-making mannerisms: characters tend to speak only after a tiny contrived pause while impassively holding the gaze of the person with them; they will often be photographed in odd, rectilinear compositions, their heads and faces occupying the lower half of the screen with a lot of dead space overhead. And most of the time there is a hard, sunlit sheen that hints at something menacing or even violent just out of shot. It’s an amusing and diverting film that, with a series of ellipses and jumps, finally takes us to an unexpected world of fear and grief – and then back again, to stylised unseriousness. An engaging debut, which Sendijarević will follow up with more substance to go with the style."
"Michel Piccoli, the veteran French actor renowned for a string of celebrated performances for directors such as Luis Bunuel, Jean-Luc Godard and Louis Malle, has died aged 94. It was reported by AFP, who said his family had announced the news, but no cause of death was given. Piccoli’s acting career stretched back to the 1940s, but he began his association with major directors in Jean Renoir’s French Cancan in 1955. He was first cast by Bunuel a year later in Death in the Garden, where he played a priest; he would go on to act in a further six Bunuel films, including Diary of a Chambermaid, Belle de Jour and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. However, the high point of his 1960s work was arguably Godard’s Contempt, in which he played opposite Brigitte Bardot as the scriptwriter hired to work on an adaptation of The Odyssey. In subsequent decades, Piccoli became a stalwart of French art films, appearing in Death in a French Garden (1985), Leos Carax’s Mauvais Sang (1986) and Jacques Rivette’s La Belle Noiseuse (1991). In 2011 he played the reluctant pope in Nanni Moretti’s We Have a Pope, and one of his final appearances was in another Carax film, Holy Motors in 2012. Piccoli was married three times: first to Eléonore Hirt, then to singer Juliette Gréco (until 1977), and to Ludivine Clerc, who survives him."
"The Guardian’s immensely popular article about a real-life Lord of the Flies-style shipwreck has sparked a scramble for screen adaptation rights among film and TV producers. The article’s writer, Rutger Bregman – who is also the author of Humankind: A Hopeful History, from which it is an excerpt – tweeted that he was “getting bombar[d]ed with emails from producers and directors”, while Deadline reported that sales agent The Agency is fielding “significant film and limited series interest from players in US, UK and beyond” and that “producers are looking into rights to the story but some are also exploring life rights of characters involved”. Bregman told the Guardian that no decision has been made yet. “I can only say that Sione, Mano, Tevita, Luke, (the four survivors of ‘Ata), Peter [Warner] (the captain who rescued them) and me are collaborating and will make a decision together.” Bregman’s article recounted the experiences of six Tongan teenagers who survived for 15 months on the remote, uninhabited island of ‘Ata in 1965, after stealing a fishing boat and attempting to sail to Fiji, about 500 miles away. Bregman stressed the co-operation and ingenuity of the boys, as a corrective to the feral vision of William Golding’s bestselling novel Lord of the Flies, which was published in 1951. The interest in the story is not dissimilar to that which followed other recent seemingly miraculous escapes, such as the rescue of 33 miners from Chile’s Copiapó mine in 2010, and the Thai cave rescue in 2018. Similar questions over who is best placed to take the subject on have already sparked debate, with New Zealand director Taika Waititi tweeting that a Polynesian film-maker should be given the job “to avoid cultural appropriation, misrepresentation, and to keep the Pasifika voice authentic” – while adding: “I’m probably not available lol.” Sione Filipe Totau (AKA Mano), one of the original stranded teenagers, told the Guardian that he was not yet prepared to tell the whole story. “I don’t want anybody to tell my full story until I publish a book from it, maybe make some living for my grandchildren.” Bregman’s article revealed that the boys were jailed on their return to Tonga (for the theft of the boat) and were released only after their rescuer, Australian sailor Peter Warner, funded a replacement boat by selling rights to their story to Australian TV. Responding to disquiet that Warner stood to profit from the story rights, Totau said: “If no Mr Warner, we never survive, if no Mr Warner we won’t be here to tell our story. If Mr Warner makes some money from it, good luck for him, that’s my opinion. I would tell everybody please shut up.”"
"In last October’s well-intentioned yet hackneyed action drama Black and Blue, Naomie Harris played a cop caught between allegiance to the force and to the community as she uncovered wrongdoing via her body cam. Cut to seven months later and we’re in eerily similar territory with the unceremoniously dumped Body Cam, a buzzy Paramount project that’s been given a hushed digital launch instead, a response to the ongoing closure of cinemas but also perhaps the underwhelming box office of the aforementioned. While it’s far from the firestarter it could have been, there’s more to this than its release would suggest, an angry, slickly directed thriller that still manages to generate enough of a spark. While there are clear commonalities between the two (black female lead, ripped-from-the-headlines subject matter, impoverished setting, uncomfortable racial tension), Body Cam takes the elements of a cop drama and implants them into a horror film, a brave gambit that halfway works, nobly trying something fresh by mashing together two genres that can feel rather stale. At times the film’s two sides loudly clash, leaping from hokey to hard-boiled with unease, but in its finer moments, when director Malik Vitthal really finds his groove, there’s a sense of dread that binds both genres, reminding us that a shadowy supernatural villain can be just as frightening as a reckless cop with a gun. LAPD officer Renee (Mary J Blige) is headed back on the streets after losing her temper with a civilian who questioned the legitimacy of her blackness, a fuzzily explained altercation that took place not long after her young son died in a drowning accident. While we as viewers wait for Hollywood to come up with a tragic backstory for female characters that doesn’t involve the death of a child, Renee finds herself embroiled in a confounding puzzle involving the grisly murders of cops she works with, each recorded in part via cameras. While other reviews, and bizarrely even the film’s Wikipedia logline, have revealed the specificities of the mystery at the centre of Body Cam, I’m inclined to be less obvious because while not exactly a twist, it’s partly the not knowing that propels the plot, Richmond Riedel and Nicholas McCarthy’s script prioritising the details of Renee’s investigation over a parade of endless jump shocks. Where we’re led roots Body Cam in reality, with a devastatingly familiar crime that starkly offsets what starts out as a film in danger of veering into #BlueLivesMatter territory. Like Black and Blue, Body Cam exists in a broken America we know all too well, and there’s a pulsing rage felt throughout, established in an opening scene that has locals watch in dismay as another police officer evades conviction after killing an unarmed man of colour. The ghoulish force that haunts the community is a tangible manifestation of this anger and there’s catharsis in how it strikes back. There are some effective scare sequences, the best of which comes near the start as Renee and her rookie partner (played by Death Note’s Nat Wolff) look for clues in a creepy rundown house, with Vitthal maintaining a confident control over his pacing, achieving at least one deviously well-orchestrated jolt, but focusing more on a sustained atmosphere. Vitthal’s accomplished direction is the film’s inarguable ace while, sadly, his lead Blige is merely competent in comparison. She underplays, which at times works given her steely profession, but at other moments, it’s a misjudged tactic, especially as she witnesses supernatural happenings on tape, a subdued expression barely registering the otherworldly horror in front of her. It’s not exactly a bad performance but one wonders what a more skilled actor could have brought to the role, one more adept at balancing the extremities of the film, juggling an emotional backstory as well as dealing with the wilder, more fantastical elements. There’s an ambitious attempt here to create the sort of mythology that could kickstart a franchise, an unlikely proposition given Body Cam’s muted release. It’s also sadly not the sharp, scary and socially aware genre mash-up it could have been given the ingredients, but watching Vitthal aim high and not quite make it is still preferable to watching so many other horror film-makers remain satisfied with lazy regurgitation. It’s a failed gamble, but a gamble nonetheless."
"The Invitation starts and ends with death. Will and Kira, a couple played by Logan Marshall-Green and Emayatzy Corinealdi, are driving to a dinner party, high up in the Hollywood Hills, distractedly discussing the predicted strangeness of the evening ahead. An ostentatious invite (“It’s so thick!” Kira remarks) from Will’s ex-wife Eden, who has been absent from his life for two years, has also been sent to the friends they once shared, all of whom have grown estranged from her as well. Will’s anxiety is palpable, as is Kira’s desire to calm him but moments from arriving at Eden’s extravagant house, one that she once shared with him, their car hits a coyote. Will is left with no option but to kill it with a tire iron, a gruesome act of mercy that serves as a horrible mood-setter for what’s to come. Given the release strategy one might expect for a schlocky midnight movie (a SXSW premiere with an on-demand bow a year later), The Invitation makes clear within its first act that there’s more on its mind than gory theatrics. It’s an uneasily slow burn, a devious dripfeed that places us in a loosely familiar scenario – dinner with friends – but underscores it with a clammy, unshakeable sense that something terrible is going to happen. Director Karyn Kusama, who broke out with Girlfight in 2000 but has mostly struggled to find her place ever since, referred to her film as being “a metaphor for what the nightmare of anxiety really is” with Will being confronted with the horrifying dilemma that many who struggle with anxiety face: is my fear irrational or is someone or something going to hurt me or those I love? For Will, something already has. In flashbacks we learn that the son he shared with his ex-wife was killed in a devastating accident and his ghost haunts the house or at least Will’s memory of it, cruel bursts of another life, a happier one, flooding back with every painful minute he spends there. Grief has wrecked him and what he can’t quite understand is why Eden isn’t quite as wounded as he remains. How can the woman who slit her wrists over their sink in a howl of despair now be dreamily talking of a newfound happiness? What elixir has she found to make it all go away? And why can’t he feel the same? For those new to the film, I’ll leave the specifics to a minimum but it’s revealed early on that Eden has subscribed to a new system of beliefs, referred to as a cult by one of her more suspicious old friends, introduced into her life by her handsome yet disconcertingly self-possessed new partner who’s invited two of his fellow disciples to the dinner. The discovery of this is the first in a string of eyebrow-raising discussions that forces us to imagine ourselves as part of the gathering. As events turn from strange to unsettling, we start to ask at what point we would leave and what unspoken social constraints would be stopping us from trusting our gut instincts. But there’s a vital caveat. The fluffy new-age rhetoric that Eden and her new friends have espoused is very much in line with their location. “Yeah they’re a little weird but this is LA, they’re harmless,” a friend tells Will early on. There’s eye-rolling for sure but in a sort of resigned, familiar way, the kind of gentler reaction that wouldn’t fly in many other cities. It keeps them there for longer than what might seem believable, along with an awkward sense of pity, hoping that Eden’s new life is all she’s claiming it to be but deep down, knowing that not to be the case. Writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi keep their cards close to their chest but what’s ultimately the biggest surprise is not the gruesome violence that comes but the piercing sadness that follows. As with the similarly under-seen Couple in a Hole (a gut-punch of a drama about a couple who go feral in the French countryside after their son dies), The Invitation is about the impossibility of grieving simultaneously with someone you love, of believing that if the pain is the same at the start then it will also go away in the same way at the end and of the horrible things you might be driven to do just to make that pain subside even a little. It’s an unnerving puzzle to see pieced together, both frightening and poignant, and Kusama has no interest in pulling us back from the edge she’s pushed us to. The final note is audaciously bleak, a stinging reminder that grief and trauma are all around us, a reminder that many of us might not need right now."
"When you’re 12 the main thing you want to be is 13. You’re desperate to be older. Desperate to grow up. This feeling is particularly acute when you have older siblings. (I’m the youngest of three.) You see them doing exciting teenage stuff like going to the pub and watching inappropriate films and you think: “I want a piece of that.” Since any attempt to join them in the pub was rightly met with an invitation to “sod off”, watching inappropriate films it was. In those days (the late 90s), inappropriate films were harder to come by. Among the many tapes we had in the house, one in particular was just the right amount of unsuitable for a small boy – the incomparable Ghost, which was thrillingly rated 15. A strange mix of horror, comedy, romance and thriller, Ghost doesn’t fit easily into any genre. At various moments during its two-hour runtime, it is terrifying, ridiculous, sexy, hilarious, cheesy and poignant – an alluring mix for a boy reaching puberty. For the first 20 minutes it could be a Richard Curtis romcom (although it came out in 1990 before any Richard Curtis romcoms). An attractive young couple – Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) – move into a new apartment, say “Ditto” instead of “I love you” and do unspeakable things with pottery. (Imagine The Great Pottery Throw Down, except Keith Brymer Jones has a semi.) Looking back on the film now, however, there are signs from the beginning that Sam and Molly’s world isn’t as charmed as it appears. Footage of a plane crash plays ominously on the TV and there’s a scene in which Sam, full of youth and promise, leaps out of a precarious top-floor window to retrieve the statue of an angel that’s being hoisted into their apartment. It’s a moment that neatly exemplifies the arrogant exuberance of youth: when you’re young, death is seemingly so remote that it isn’t scary, it’s thrilling. Laughing at death makes you feel alive, which is usually fine – unless you happen to be the main protagonist in a film called Ghost. Sam, and all his hopes, dreams and potential, are gone in an instant when he’s killed in an apparent mugging while walking back from the theatre with Molly. The ensuing scene in which Sam comes to terms with being dead was so scary I had to fast forward through it every time. Then there’s the bit where he wakes up in bed and you think everything’s fine, but, instead of Molly next to him, it’s the crumbling face of the angel statue. We’re not in Richard Curtis territory any more. The rest of the film is ghost Sam’s quest – with the help of a film-stealing Whoopi Goldberg, who plays reluctant medium Oda Mae Brown – to find out who killed him and why. Spoiler alert! It turns out Sam’s best friend, Carl, organised the whole thing in a money-laundering ploy gone wrong. If you’re worried whether Carl gets his comeuppance, fear not because not only does he get killed by a shard of glass, his soul is then dragged to hell by screaming shadows. That’ll learn him. This is the captivating thing about Ghost. It goes from moments of slapstick comedy – such as when Oda Mae and an invisible Sam visit a bank – to bloodcurdling demonic abduction. From romcom to The Exorcist without a breath. The final scene is as saccharine as anything in cinema and yet, to late-90s me (and even now), it’s utterly irresistible. As an orchestral version of Unchained Melody begins, heaven opens up, shining the light of God on Sam as he becomes visible to Molly. Just before he joins the angels, there’s time for a quick interdimensional smooch and the immortal line: “It’s amazing, Molly – the love inside, you take it with you.”  The truth is I cry a lot more at that final scene now than I ever did when I was younger. At 12, I loved Ghost for the thrill of watching something I wasn’t really supposed to: I enjoyed the feeling of being older, watching grownups deal with grownup things such as sex and death. Most of all I loved it because my brother also loved it and that meant I got to spend time with him. Two uninterrupted hours together before I resumed my rightful place as an annoying little shit. "
"My friend Elisar Cabrera, who has died aged 49 of cancer, was a film producer, director, web series pioneer, video journalist and wrestling producer. I first met Elisar in 1994 at the New Producers Alliance, an eclectic mix of young film-makers. Despite his young age, Elisar had an immediately striking assurance and gentleness that marked him out from his peers. Born in London, Elisar was the son of the author Caroline Kennedy and the artist Ben Cabrera. He went to St Paul’s school, and would travel to LA during school holidays to help out on film productions, including Cool Blue (1990), which was produced by his cousin, Cassian Elwes. Although his family came from a film-making tradition (his uncle Elliot Kastner had produced Where Eagles Dare), Elisar found his own way into the business. He lived in LA in his early 20s and worked on the The Man With Three Arms (1991, released in the US as The Dark Backward) – his duties included helping James Caan rehearse his lines – and The Chase (1994). Although he had further opportunities in the US, he wanted to help young British independent film-makers and became heavily involved with the New Producers Alliance in the UK. He directed his own low-budget films, Demonsoul (1995) and Witchcraft X: Mistress of the Craft (1998), and he and I collaborated on Virtual Terror (1996). But Elisar’s interests went far beyond horror films and he worked as a film sales agent, while reviewing movies for the Sci-fi channel and creating the web series Those Video Guys. Elisar had a passion for pro wrestling and helped revive the British wrestling scene in the late 90s. As co-owner of the Frontier Wrestling Alliance, he brought a new wave of independent US wrestlers to British fans, staging and promoting live shows all over the UK. His mother recalls “stumbling over their immense bodies that slept on my living room floor and on my sofas” and carrying back the championship belts from the US in her luggage. He also reintroduced wrestling to TV, writing and producing Revival: The Search for the King of England for Bravo (2002). This is where he met the writer Lisa Gifford. They married in 2006 and collaborated on many projects including the award-winning web series 3some (2013). Later, working at Raindance, Elisar was a huge advocate of online filmmaking, founding the Raindance Web Fest, the UK’s first festival for independent digital and web series and co-founding Digital Creators UK. He will be remembered by many young film-makers for his encouragement and advice on all aspects of film-making. His many feature film producing credits include Deadly Virtues: Love.Honour.Obey. (2014), Ibiza Undead (2016) and The Bromley Boys (2018). Elisar was a passionate believer in the EU and many political causes. One of his final projects was Postcards from the 48% (2018), made by and featuring those who voted Remain. Elisar is survived by Lisa, his parents and his sisters, Mayumi and Jasmine."
"When it comes to films and shows made during the global pandemic, there’s a fine line between ingenuity and desperation. We’re all still trapped in some way and while for many of us, that trap might have increased in scale in recent weeks, it remains a trap nonetheless. For directors, at least in some parts of the world, it’s starting to expand considerably but many are still stuck with making the best of very little, armed with just the most basic technology. The limitations they face recall those of the found-footage era, particularly the sub-subgenre of films that took place entirely within laptop screens, such as Unfriended and Searching. But those restrictions were self-inflicted, not forced. In the frantic rush to keep busy and keep profitable, we’re seeing a flood of lazy made-at-home productions that will be forgotten whenever things go back to some sort of normal. Earning a solid B for effort is the British director Rob Savage, who has taken the least appealing of concepts – a Zoom-based horror – and turned it into a genuinely effective little chiller called Host. Inspired by a medium telling him that Covid-19 business was booming, he assembled a remote group of seven actors to play friends making the ill-advised decision to conduct a seance over video chat. As absurd as the premise might be, the film plays out with at least one foot on the ground, surprisingly, as characters mostly react in ways that seem rooted in reality. In the world of the film, the virus does exist but, believably at this stage, it’s rarely commented on – a mask here, a joke about coughing there – and while there might be a few too many “lemme go investigate that noise” moments, the interplay between the actors feels real, as if we were actually watching a group of friends facing supernatural dangers. It’s this concerted effort to really sell what’s happening that allows us to forgive a few of the sillier moments. The actors are also forced to act as camera operators and, as the story progresses, special effects technicians too. Savage didn’t set foot in any of the locations and instead gave directions remotely, which, in the last chaotic act, turns the film into a “how the hell did they manage that” technical feat. There’s a smattering of devilishly well-timed jump-scares that work best when our confusion leads us to examine the screen closer, unsure where within the frame a demonic presence might lie. While there might be an equal number of them that really don’t work, Savage wisely wraps things up within an hour, keeping his film tight enough for the bum notes to fade fast – and he ends it with a vicious bang, followed by some ingenious end credits. Host is a lean, nasty little exercise that might not linger for very long but it shows what can be done during this difficult time. Once regular shooting resumes, we should look forward to whatever Savage comes up with next."
"It’s a fearful thought for fans of jagged-edged futurism, but Netflix’s Black Mirror might be just one of those things that never quite becomes part of the post-Covid “new normal”. Creator Charlie Brooker has been quite clear that the last thing on his mind in the current climate is “stories about societies falling apart”, which pretty much rules out 50% of the finest sci-fi anthology show since The Outer Limits. Fortunately all is not lost, for James Ward Byrkit’s Coherence is here to tide you over. The film-maker’s 2013 debut centres on eight friends who gather for a dinner party in a California home on the night that a comet is due to pass by. There are tensions from the start: Em (Emily Baldoni) has turned down her boyfriend Kevin’s request to join him on a work trip to Vietnam, and is nervous that his vampy ex Laurie has also been invited along to the gathering. It is clear that Mike (Nicholas Brendon) has a drinking problem, while another guest, Beth, has a bizarre habit of offering ketamine-laced tincture to anyone who fancies it, which may or may not be adding to the general sense of dysphoria and dislocation.The evening begins amicably enough, but then a power cut puts the wind up the party guests, shutting down wifi and, apparently, mobile phone connectivity. Two of the partygoers begin investigating nearby homes to try to establish if anyone in the neighbourhood has a working telephone. So far, so stereotypical cabin in the woods scenario, and yet standard horror tropes are soon swapped out for far more cerebral sci-fi stylings. The pair who departed soon return with a strange box containing Polaroid-style photographs of each of the party guests, and a set of numbers written on the back, along with an apparently innocuous table tennis paddle. Inside one of the other homes, they have glimpsed a group of people who look remarkably like themselves. Em meets Kevin at their car, but there is something about him she doesn’t quite recognise, while nobody seems to be able to escape from this dark and discombobulating purgatory. The spectre of Schrödinger’s cat looms sphinx-like over the entire proceedings – did everyone accidentally dab too much of the aforementioned dubious keta-tincture? Byrkit shoots and edits the whole thing as if we are witnessing a particularly phantasmagorical reality TV show, complete with shaky cameras, the odd blurry shot, and characters talking over each other, along with sudden cuts to black. The result is reminiscent of the “found footage” subgenre that was once so popular in Hollywood, but without the ridiculous contrivance of that style that requires the viewer to believe that obsessive amateur videographers are lurking around every corner to document the moment.There are also shades here of Melancholia, which came out two years previously and featured a mysterious new planet that exerts strange influences on the people of Earth. And yet Byrkit’s mis-en-scène is far more contained and claustrophobic than Lars von Trier’s whimsical fantasy. This is a science fiction story that could easily be performed on stage, so limited are the locations.The intrigue stems from an increasing realisation that some of the company are trying to game their new reality. Guests keep coming up with new excuses to leave the house and head out into the night, like a cheesy 80s horror flick in which everyone is determined to split up and get immediately murdered by something bestial. And yet the discovery of new boxes with differently numbered photographs and random objects suggests almost all the partygoers have their own reason to be slipping out the door at the optimum moment.Squint a little, and perhaps viewed through one’s fingers and from a strange angle behind the nearest sofa, and Coherence could easily be a one-off feature-length episode plucked from Black Mirror. It’s no San Junipero or USS Callister, but it doesn’t lag far behind. Like an Agatha Christie whodunnit that exists wholly in the connective tissue between alternate dimensions, this is a twisted quantum chamber piece of meta-doppelgangers and sliding doors moments – if those sliding doors had the potential to cause major injury – that will more than likely inspire repeat viewings. If only to work out exactly what the hell is going on."
"When looking back at the most infamous films of the 1990s – Batman & Robin, Judge Dredd and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace spring to mind – it’s easy to pinpoint why each failed so miserably. Joel Schumacher’s superhero sequel had Batnipples, wooden acting and a pantomime-level script; Judge Dredd had a miscast Sylvester Stallone and rubbish “comedy sidekick” Rob Schneider; The Phantom Menace had Jar Jar Binks, plastic CGI and abundant racist stereotyping. And yet it’s harder to recall exactly why Kevin Reynolds’ Waterworld, which hit cinemas 25 years ago this week, ended up being one of the worst Hollywood turkeys of all time. Perhaps it’s because it was released slap bang in the middle of a Hollywood decade otherwise known for the return of sharp-edged indie film-making, and really feels like a brash and bombastic 80s action flick. Maybe it’s because Kevin Costner’s taciturn acting style was unsuited to such an over-the-top adventure. Perhaps only James Cameron can make expensive movies about the sea that connect with audiences. But there isn’t really anything notable about Waterworld to suggest it truly deserves such a low reputation, other than the fact it was the most expensive film of all time and an appalling box-office bomb. The film’s production problems are well documented. Steven Spielberg had warned Reynolds not to shoot on open water after his own struggles filming Jaws, but nobody listened. Costner, at the peak of his fame and power, fought so hard to get his ideas included that Reynolds walked away before production had wrapped. Joss Whedon was flown in for a bout of last-minute rewrites that he has since described as “seven weeks of hell”, largely because he was required to edit in Costner’s ideas with zero filter. The movie’s star almost died in a squall, and a multimillion dollar set was ripped apart when a hurricane hit the shoot location just off the coast of Hawaii. And yet watching the movie in 2020, you would never guess any of this happened. Waterworld was originally concocted as a Mad Max rip-off by screenwriter Peter Rader, with Reynolds even hiring that series’ director of photography, Dean Semler. One suspects if Reynold’s movie had been made for $10m, as Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome was, instead of $175m, it would be remembered as a decent little film for a rainy day when one’s mind turns to the end of human civilisation as we know it. But Reynolds and Costner did not have Miller’s modest budget. Even 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, which experienced its own production setbacks and was shot 20 years later (by which time budgets had ballooned), barely passed Waterworld’s mammoth production costs. Reynolds’ film has silliness in abundance. Costner’s unnamed Mariner is a fish-man whose species has evolved to develop gills that allow him to spend copious amounts of time underwater. This is despite dolphins and whales having yet to develop the same mutation despite the tens of millions of years that have passed since their ancestors last set foot on land. It cannot have been long since the waters rose and covered the Earth, or the sea planes, boats and guns, scavenged in abundance by human survivors, would have rusted into nothing. And yet this matters not one jot: the scene in which the survivors of humankind, lingering on a grimy atoll, discover that Costner is a mutant retains a trashy comic-book cool, as well as going a long way to explaining his solitary existence. Ultimately, it’s all good B-movie fun. Dennis Hopper makes a fine villain as the one-eyed, ferociously acquisitive Deacon, a man who wants to eat the world and its remaining resources, a feverish Gordon Gekko of the dystopian high seas. Along with Speed, Waterworld marks the finest moment of Hopper’s enjoyable late-career devolution into furniture-chewing bad guy. The action set-pieces, from the Mariner’s battles with sea pirates to his underwater wrestling match with a giant mutant fish, are preposterously ambitious yet pulled off with aplomb. His transforming trimaran makes the Batmobile look like something from a secondhand toy shop. The humans are superbly decked out in post-apocalyptic future-wear. If you are not looking to give your cerebrum an overly taxing workout, Waterworld is a thoroughly rousing, pleasingly throwaway 135 minutes. It should certainly not be considered the nadir of Costner’s career when he also starred in movies like Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and The Postman. Perhaps it’s time to let those critical water-levels fall back to reveal the existence of a perfectly watchable sci-fi cult classic."
"The Italian hills have never looked less bucolic than in this strange, melancholy film. The terrain is harsh and unyielding; the sun unrelenting; the bone-dry ground dissolves into clouds of dust. A wolf stalks the land as darkness falls, and the local farmers scramble for the few available comforts to get them through the night: a functioning lightbulb, some anchovies, the final sips of wine left in the house. In among this inhospitable landscape is Lazzaro, curly-haired, mule-strong and happy to help with the endless laborious tasks the others throw at him from morning till night. “Lazzaro,” they cry, and he appears, a smile on his face. He is either unaware or preternaturally forgiving of their uncharitable comments, of the small cruelties they commit just because they can. “Yes,” he replies, “I’m here. How can I help?” And off he goes, carrying a bale of hay, or to make someone a complicated-looking cup of coffee. In theory, a film about dour Italian farmers is perhaps not the most obvious thing to turn to at a time of unprecedented global crisis and widespread personal suffering. But – and it’s difficult to discuss without giving too much away – it’s not the film you might expect it to be. Little by little, the fabric of reality starts to give way: a phrase here, an object there, that makes you second-guess your own assumptions and expectations. Time shifts and expands in mysterious ways. Unexpected visitors arrive, upsetting the delicate balance of the community. The film takes a more dynamic turn with the appearance of a villain of sorts. Gentle, naive Lazzaro (first-time actor Adriano Tardiolo) is befriended by new arrival Tancredi (Luca Chikovani), a spoilt princeling with a tiny dog and preposterous dress sense, as charismatic as he is obnoxious. Tancredi decides to fake his own kidnapping in order to extort money from his wealthy mother, the tobacco magnate Marchioness Alfonsina de Luna. Lazzaro is – of course – happy to help. Inevitably, things do not go as planned. What ensues is a quietly profound tale about pain and redemption, taking in everything from the exploitation of workers to meditations on human dignity. There are fables about good men and royalty and supernatural touches. At one point, a scene revolving around pastries is so moving as to be almost unbearable. Moving through it all is Lazzaro, serenely looking on as injustices pile up around him, his eyes full of wonder and occasionally, heartbreakingly, the realisation that he has been wronged by someone he trusted. This is the third film from the Italian director and screenwriter Alice Rohrwacher, who grew up in rural Umbria, where her family ran a beekeeping business (fictionalised in her previous film The Wonders). Inspired by a real-life story she read in a newspaper, Rohrwacher created the film’s imaginary village of Inviolata (“unspoiled”) near her home with the help of locals, who were also cast in the film. It premiered in Cannes in 2018, where it won best screenplay, and has since gained wide critical acclaim if not exactly mainstream success. There are echoes of Pasolini and Fellini in its subject matter – it has been described as “magic neorealism” – as well as in the stark, beautiful photography of French cinematographer Hélène Louvart (Beach Rats, Rocks). It is not a film that provides easy answers, allowing viewers instead to draw their own conclusions. As the title suggests, it encompasses religious themes, something Rohrwacher has been exploring since her 2011 feature debut Heavenly Body. Different people will take different things from the film. Some will rave about its lyrical tone, the muted sepia tones of its palette; others may find its pace too leisurely. Non-believers might feel that some of the more overt religious imagery in the film’s second half is a little heavy-handed; to others the same scenes may have a more exalted significance. But there is something about Lazzaro’s face, so open, so expressive, that keeps you entranced all the way through. The archetype of the holy fool is not a new one, but, as with Peter Sellers’ simple-minded gardener in Being There, it is a figure through which we can reassess our priorities, and what we value most as a society and as individuals. Considering the situation we find ourselves in, there is something especially meaningful in Lazzaro’s ability to transcend the suffering that surrounds him and remain untarnished – and, above all, kind."
"“I’m not going in there. It’s full of sick people; I’ll catch something,” says an injured boxer admitted to hospital at the start of Carry On Nurse (1959). It’s a gag that takes on an ominous topicality at a time when hospitals are perceived as such perilous places that even sick people have been trying to avoid them, and where inadequately protected hospital staff are as much at risk from the Covid-19 pandemic as their patients. It’s not supposed to be like this, according to decades of films and TV soaps in which doctors and nurses are more at risk of broken hearts than broken healthcare systems, and even these can be fixed. George C Scott as Dr Bock in The Hospital (1971) is impotent, alcoholic, suicidal and given to portentous monologues: “We have established the most enormous medical entity ever conceived, and people are sicker than ever. We cure nothing! We heal nothing!” Luckily, a one-night stand with a patient’s daughter (Diana Rigg) leaves Bock’s morale, libido and idealism instantly restored. There are few institutions as dramatically versatile as the hospital, with its ensemble casts and many subplots. Hospital-set TV series are legion; the longest running American daytime soap is General Hospital (1963-present), and one of the most influential was ER (1994-2009), conceived by onetime medical student Michael Crichton to reproduce the chaotic pace of a real emergency room via a pell-mell of overlapping storylines, jerky camerawork and medics shouting “clear!” as they apply paddles to patients’ chests. The hospital is mined for comedy in sitcoms (Scrubs, Green Wing) or films such as Young Doctors in Love (1982), which tried – and failed – to do for hospitals what Airplane! had done for passenger jets. In Doctor in the House (1954), Dirk Bogarde and Kenneth More play medical students who pursue women and play pranks; six sequels and a TV spin-off would continue in a similar vein. With its bedpans, sponge baths and visitors’ bodily fluids, hospitals are petri dishes for sexual and scatological humour. Even esteemed documentarian Frederick Wiseman, in his Emmy-winning Hospital (1970), is unable to resist an explosion of sustained hilarity when an ailing junkie responds to emetic treatment with Mr Creosote levels of vomiting amid the grim reality of an east Harlem hospital awash with child neglect and social deprivation. Hospital settings are reworked as whodunits in TV’s House or Sidney Gilliat’s magnificent Green for Danger (1946), starring Alastair Sim as a cocky detective investigating a murder in a rural hospital during the second world war. It provides backdrop for historical drama (The Knick) or ghosts (Lars von Trier’s The Kingdom). The building itself, already steeped in sickness and death, is a virtual haunted house of labyrinthine corridors, basements and morgues, making it the perfect setting for horror movies or psychological thrillers (Visiting Hours, Halloween II, Desperate Measures et al) in which serial killers fell staff and patients like unstoppable viruses. Even Paddy Chayefsky’s Oscar-winning screenplay for the aforementioned The Hospital is structured around the serial murders of hospital staff. Nefarious malpractice abounds in thrillers such as Coma (black-market organ trading), Extreme Measures (Gene Hackman’s neurosurgeon experimenting on the homeless) and Anatomy (a secret society of neo-Nazi vivisectionists). John Collee’s razor-sharp screenplay for Paper Mask (1990), while ill-served by drab directing, shines a critical light on hospital hierarchy – and the tendency to close ranks when something goes horribly wrong – through its story of a porter (Paul McGann) who steals the identity of a dead doctor and escapes exposure only thanks to the medical know-how of a sympathetic nurse (Amanda Donohoe). Yes, the hospital is a microcosm of society. “Obviously I meant that to be the health of the nation as well,” Peter Nichols confirmed with regard to The National Health (1973), adapted by the playwright from his Old Vic hit. The film contrasts everyday life in a London hospital ward (a young Bob Hoskins plays one of the patients) with a hospital TV soap showing on the ward television – though the soap is filmed in such a ridiculously exaggerated way that one wonders if Nichols or his director, Jack Gold, had ever actually seen one. The workplace smoking and paedophiliac innuendo have dated; the overworked intern nodding off over her stethoscope (“I’ve been on duty for 19 hours”) has not. But for definitive state-of-the-nation statements, look no further than Lindsay Anderson’s Britannia Hospital (1982), concluding part of his Mick Travis triptych after If… and O Lucky Man! Leonard Rossiter plays a harassed administrator preparing his hospital for a visit from the Queen Mother while kitchen staff work to rule, rioters storm the gates in protest at an African dictator being treated in the private wing, and Travis himself (Malcolm McDowell) investigates the mad doctor (Graham Crowden) conducting secret Frankenstein-type experiments with Grand Guignol results. Anderson’s film opened in UK cinemas in the middle of the Falklands war, which had triggered a wave of jingoism that boosted support for a government struggling with recession, unemployment and civil unrest. It just wasn’t done to talk Britain down. “I could see that the image of the headless torso waving a union jack was not a good idea,” Anderson wrote of a prospective poster design. With some notable exceptions (including David Robinson in the Times and Alexander Walker in the Evening Standard), the British press gave Britannia Hospital what Anderson described as “a frightful pasting”. The Daily Mail huffed: “Would any other country stand for a film that portrays us all as mad?” and even the Guardian, NME and Time Out, which one might have expected to be more receptive to Anderson’s social satire, frowned on his take-no-prisoners swipes, not just at privatisation and police brutality but leftwing mobs and unions, the latter led by an obstreperous official (played by the peerless Robin Askwith, alumnus not just of Confessions of a Window Cleaner but the lunatic low-budget carnage of Antony Balch’s Horror Hospital) only too willing to suck up to royalty at the hint of an OBE. Britannia Hospital did for Anderson’s career what Peeping Tom had done for Michael Powell; it would be the last theatrical feature he would make in Britain. But the film pinpointed national deficiencies that would only become more pronounced in years to come, including stealth privatisation and the systematic undervaluing of key workers (Britannia Hospital’s shiny new Kipling Ward is unoccupied because there aren’t enough cleaners). Meanwhile, one waits in vain for the British Film Industry to come up with anything half as sad or incisive as The Death of Mr Lazarescu (2005), Cristi Puiu’s social-realist tragicomedy of a terminally ill widower’s epic journey through the Romanian health service. It’s impossible to watch the old man’s condition deteriorating without reflecting on the way our own society sees its senior citizens as expendable; Puiu’s film may be set in Bucharest 15 years ago, but add face masks and it could be Britain now. For social realism in British hospitals, we must look to TV. When Paul Unwin and Jeremy Brock first pitched Casualty to the BBC, their proposal read like a manifesto. “In 1948, a dream was born – a National Health Service. In 1985, the dream is in tatters.” Unwin told the Radio Times: “We were passionate, leftwing and both of us had recently been in hospital so we knew what stories there were to tell and how we wanted to tell them.” Needless to say, Margaret Thatcher’s government didn’t take kindly to plots highlighting NHS underfunding and poor hospital conditions, and after only a handful of episodes the BBC was persuaded to tone it down. Nevertheless, Casualty continues to skirt controversy. Only last month, much to the outrage of regular viewers, an episode was yanked from the schedules with the announcement: “The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of Covid-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment.” All that was left was a recap containing a glimpse of hazmat suits. One might have thought that now was precisely the best time to show the episode; Casualty couldn’t do worse than the UK government in disseminating public health messages. To judge by the way Steven Soderbergh’s Contagion (2011) shot up the streaming charts earlier this year, a sizeable portion of the public learned more about pandemics from that film than from official sources. Indeed, if only the Sage committee had paid attention to Contagion when it first came out, they might have taken those early reports from Wuhan more seriously."
"I’m a wimp when it comes to horror films, as anyone who has ever sat next to me in a cinema while I’ve been yelping my head off will tell you. I’ve forced myself to watch some of the classics, and I’ve loved some of the new ones such as Get Out and A Quiet Place. But I’ve succeeded in avoiding Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and the other slasher movies of the 1970s and 80s. And, until last week, I’d never seen the one which gets all the acclaim, Halloween. I knew it was important, of course. I’d spotted the references in everything from Scream to Baby Driver, and I’d heard of Rob Zombie’s remake, as well as David Gordon Green’s sequel. But whenever I thought about braving the 1978 original, which was directed by John Carpenter, I’d always leave my DVD in its shrink-wrapped box and pick up a romcom instead. So here’s what surprised me about my long-overdue viewing: Halloween isn’t scary at all. It’s too clunky for that. It may terrify teenagers at a sleepover, but watching it in broad daylight in middle-age brings a sort of patronising respect for the plucky low-budget film-makers who managed to get 90 minutes out of a handful of actors, two clapboard houses and a wisp of plot. You might admire Carpenter’s insistent 5/4 piano theme, the early twist that a homicidal maniac is actually a six-year-old boy, and the grownup Michael Myers’ gymnastic escape from an asylum on a dark and stormy night. You might appreciate the way the Steadicam prowls through a grid of all-American suburban streets, as if searching for victims. As for the victims, the only bearable one is Jamie Lee Curtis’s studious Laurie, a spiritual cousin of Sandy from Grease, which came out the same year. On that note, why do the main characters include Laurie, Loomis, Lynda, Lyndsey, Lonnie and Lester? What the L is going on? What surprised me most about Halloween was how little it has to do with the 31 October Halloween. Carpenter scatters around a few references to pumpkins and trick-or-treaters, just as the set decorator scatters around a few brown leaves. (The film was shot in May, which explains why the neighbourhood’s trees are so lush and green.) But no one gets drowned while bobbing for apples, and the masked serial killer doesn’t hide among crowds of revellers in fancy dress. It could have been set on any night of the year. (An early draft of the script, I’ve since learned, had a more appropriate but less iconic title: The Babysitter Murders.) The other big surprise was how ineffectual Myers is. His doctor (Donald Pleasence) keeps saying that he is evil incarnate. Dr Loomis made his diagnosis while the boy sat silently in a cell for 15 years, so he must be quite some psychiatrist. But the so-called figure of The Shape totters along so slowly that he would lose a race with any of George A Romero’s zombies in Night of the Living Dead. And he should have cut wider eyeholes in his mask, because he repeatedly fails to stab Laurie at point-blank range. She, on the other hand, stabs him with a knitting needle, a coat hanger and a kitchen knife, so Carpenter and Hill missed a trick – or a treat – by not making her the villain in Halloween II. Her stabbings don’t draw blood, though. The film is remarkably short of gore by today’s standards. And it’s light on sex and swearing. Perhaps it’s because we are living in a horror movie at the moment, but Halloween now seems sweetly innocent: a glimpse of a peaceful, naive America where a slowcoach in a boilersuit was the most frightening thing around."
"We’re in lockdown with my 20-year-old daughter and one of our 27-year-old twin sons. On good days, life in lockdown is idyllic. All of the sunshine and blossom makes it feel as if the planet is celebrating us humans retreating behind closed doors. On bad days, it can feel as if we’re slipping down some dystopian plughole. So I’m careful what I watch. There’s only so much angst I can take if I want to sleep at night. I’ve been happily immersed in Normal People. It’s an elegiac reverie on first love, and I greatly prefer the BBC’s adaptation to the book. It brings to life a complex romantic dynamic that somehow eluded me on the page. I also highly recommend Unorthodox and its remarkable companion documentary, One of Us, both on Netflix. Each offers a remarkable window on the Satmar Hasidic community of Jews living in Brooklyn. I was both touched by the poignancy of Holocaust trauma that lead the sect to its extremism and horrified at the decimating psychological effects on anyone who attempts to leave the group. My eco-activist son has been screening an array of hope-filled environmental documentaries that remind us that one silver lining in this global pandemic is the possibility of rebuilding green. We were all inspired by Jane Goodall: The Hope on National Geographic, which is a fascinating documentary. I had no idea how far this remarkable woman’s environmental work has extended beyond her famous studies of chimpanzees. We loved Inhabit: A Permaculture Perspective, which is free on Vimeo and aims to empower people by showing them how to be better custodians of the Earth. I also loved Fantastic Fungi, which is a visual and mind-boggling documentary about how mushrooms have been key to our very evolution. I was also very inspired by Tomorrow, a documentary by two brilliant French film-makers, Mélanie Laurent and Cyril Dion. It offers such a wonderfully positive, intelligent, hopeful and solution-based approach to living. It will lift your sprits as an ideology of an achievable utopian world. It’s the perfect antidote to lockdown nihilism.  Misbehaviour is available to download now."
"After the film version of Cats, the world agreed that Judi Dench could never, should never do anything as bizarre as her performance as Old Deuteronomy, the bafflingly attired matriarch of the Jellicle cat tribe, wearing a fur coat in addition to her normal fur. But now Dench might actually have topped her feline folly, in this family fantasy adventure, adapted by Conor McPherson and Hamish McColl from Eoin Colfer’s bestselling novels about the teen Irish hero in touch with magical forces and directed by Kenneth Branagh. She plays someone called Commander Root, who is the security chief of the fairy peoples who live deep underground. (It was a man in the book, but no male actor could be gruffer than Dench is here.)  Dench is styling a very notable military-style outfit in emerald green, which makes her look like some forgotten intergalactic villain from Star Wars. Root has a growly, twangy, slightly Cornish voice; yet it was only when she appeared in full uniform, including a sinister peaked cap, and said “top o’ the morning,” that I said out loud: “Judi Dench is supposed to be Irish!” The last time I heard that phrase used to denote Irishness, however ironically, was when Colin Farrell played Bullseye, the Irish supervillain in the little-loved Marvel movie Daredevil (2003) and Farrell turns out to be in this as well, phoning in his performance for the fantastically dull role of Artemis Fowl Sr, the wealthy and reclusive connoisseur of Irish myth and legend who understands what most do not – that the fairies and little folk are real. When Fowl Sr is kidnapped by a fairy gone rogue, it is his troubled but brilliant 12-year-old son Artemis Fowl Jr (Ferdia Shaw) who has to save him, and deal with this evil abductor’s ransom demand for the fairy-folk’s most precious artefact: the Aculos, the key that governs the fairies’ control of their own domain and their entrance to the human world. But this Aculos is missing. How on earth is young Artemis supposed to get it? Fortunately, his destiny is to coincide with that of an audacious young fairy under Root’s command: Holly Short (Lara McDonnell) and also a roguish and somewhat Hagridian “giant dwarf” called Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad). Nonso Anozie plays Artemis’s bodyguard and martial-arts trainer, Butler. Together, Artemis and Butler wear some men-in-black-type suits and ties. Dench has one or two moderately funny lines (“Get the fffff … four-leaf clover out of here,” she stutters at one stage) and there is an amusing setpiece when the fairies impose a kind of mass-hypnotic time-freeze situation on an Italian wedding where a giant, grisly troll is about to run amok, so that Holly can neutralise the horrible beast without any of the humans there remembering afterwards what has happened. (Again, a bit of a men-in-black idea.) Images and characters bounce around like shapes on a screensaver and only McDonnell and Gad’s performances have any fizz. This is a YA-franchise by numbers."
"The US civil war epic Gone With the Wind has been dropped from HBO Max, the streaming service recently launched by Warner Bros as a rival to Netflix and Disney+, after protests over its depiction of slavery. The move followed an article in the LA Times by John Ridley, Oscar-winning scriptwriter of 12 Years a Slave, in which he described it as “a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color”. Ridley added: “At a moment when we are all considering what more we can do to fight bigotry and intolerance, I would ask that all content providers look at their libraries and make a good-faith effort to separate programming that might be lacking in its representation from that which is blatant in its demonisation.” HBO responded with a statement, which said: “These racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today, and we felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible.” The streaming service added that the film would return to the platform accompanied by “a discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions”, but would remain unaltered “because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed”. Released in 1939, Gone With the Wind won eight Oscars (and two honorary awards) and was a commercial hit in the US and elsewhere. However, African American writers and activists immediately objected to its depiction of passive, compliant slaves, and sentimentalised depiction of the south before the civil war. A contemporary review in the Chicago Defender called it a “weapon of terror against black America”, while dramatist and film-maker Carlton Moss wrote in 1940 that it was “a nostalgic plea for sympathy for a still living cause of southern reaction”. Hattie McDaniel became the first African American to win an Oscar, for best supporting actress for her role as house servant Mammy, but was not allowed to sit with the rest of the cast at the Academy Awards dinner at the Ambassador Hotel, in Los Angeles, which enforced racial segregation until 1959."
"Cinema is a mass medium. And since we film-makers want to get as many people as possible to see our films, we try to find a common denominator. But we also want each person in the audience to feel the film is whispering things only they know about. We want to achieve a paradoxical mass-intimacy. There are four key ways in which film attempts this – and manages it better than any other art form. Three of them occur irrespective of whether we are watching a film on an iPad or in an Imax. But the fourth – and possibly most crucial – is singular to seeing a film in a cinema. It’s important to appreciate them all in order to know what we have lost while cinemas are shut. And also what the medium must rely on if its future lies off the big screen. When a film connects, it speaks to the head, the heart and the gut. Each of these ways of thinking – intellectual, emotional and instinctual – is directly addressed, then woven together and rendered mutually coherent. We are served something we all long for but rarely experience: our lives seeming to be in miraculous balance. Cinema is especially powerful because it can communicate directly with those pre-linguistic intelligences that lie within us. The question and the responsibility for film-makers is how to harness that power for the good, because it can easily be misused. For at its best, film could supply the braided coherence ordinary life does not. Such films would fulfil a unique social, almost spiritual, function, helping people to resolve contradictions within themselves, and then to align with each other in a healthy society.  Audiences are often surprised by a film’s apparent intimacy with their own inner secrets. This is the result of a film-maker judiciously deciding what to put in and what to leave out. If a film shows too much, the audience just has to sit there and take it, but they won’t feel a personal, emotional bond with the story or the characters. But if certain things are left incomplete, to just the right degree, everyone will use their own particular imagination to turn the partial into the complete. That is why people often differ in their sense of what a film has shown them. They may think they have seen the whole, but they are unaware some of the crucial elements have come from within. So in a sense they are seeing themselves in the story. As John Huston said: “The real projectors are the eyes and ears of the audience.” As we watch a film, we are allowed to gaze deeply into the eyes of beautiful, ugly, powerful, scary, interesting people. We invade their space. In daily life, such close access is not often available. The people on screen, however, seem not to know that we are watching them, which makes it even more intoxicating. All it would take would be for them to shift their eyes a few degrees, look into the lens, and we would be found out. But until then, we can watch with fascination as thoughts and emotions pass like shadows, storms, and beams of sunlight across their faces. This proximity to beauty and power, mediated through eye contact, goes far back into our primate past. Cinema is the one art form that has found a way, through creative use of the close-up, to tap deeply into the wellsprings of this primitive and almost irresistible force of nature. For the past two months, we have watched films only at home. But a film’s agency also depends on it being seen in a cinema at an appointed time, in the dark, in the presence of strangers also drawn to this moment. Under the right circumstances, a theatrical screening deeply enhances the experience of cinema. A lot of what can be said about this veers into the mysticism of collective consciousness – hard to quantify but certainly intangibly present. If we could somehow render visible the emotions and thoughts of an audience in the sway of a good film, it would probably resemble the beautiful arching loops we see with large flocks of birds or schools of fish. There is also the fact that when we leave our houses, at some expense (babysitters, popcorn), a little discomfort (parking, public transport), and risk (strangers! Infection!) and we gather in a cinema at a specific time, we are – by those very actions of expense, displacement, constraint, and risk – primed to see the film in a more expanded way than when we summon it on a streaming service. Technically, the quality of a film at home can now equal, or exceed, the quality at a multiplex. But what at-home viewing can never do is provide a communal experience to which we happily submit. In the best circumstances, that experience can paradoxically expand our consciousness and awareness of our commonality, sharpening our senses in the mass intimacy of the darkened theatre. And when we are in the dark, with many other people, we are especially alert to tiny signals from the audience that will trigger group laughter, screams, or tears. At home, alone, or with a few others, these signals are reduced proportionally. The larger the audience, the more likely it is that someone will get the joke early, and that first laugh will trigger everyone else. At the end of a live performance, there is a moment when the audience is ready to applaud, but uncertain of exactly the right moment. But as soon as someone claps, everyone will follow along. Humans have been assembling in the dark, listening to stories, since the invention of language. It is indelibly part of who we are and how we bond with each other. The theatrical experience is a recreation of this primeval gathering, the flames of the campfire replaced by shifting images that are telling the story itself. After the current hurricane has blown through the world, and we begin to pick up the scattered pieces, will cinema exhibition return to the way it was? Probably not in every detail – the universal lockdown has been an unprecedented shock. But I believe the deep human need to leave the isolation of home and gather in the fire-lit dark with like-minded others will provide an irresistible channel to guide the reopening of cinemas – and even, perhaps, their reinvention. Walter Murch’s films include The Godfather trilogy, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, American Graffiti and The English Patient."
"The setting is Kabul, 1989, and in the opening shot of this lean Afghan drama, a boy wakes up, cracks his knuckles and pulls on a well-scuffed pair of trainers, ready to face the new day. But what could have been a cliched opener is subtly subverted: his alarm call is the distant bark of dogs, the colour palette is the kind of arid, dusty ochre that makes your throat itch, and rather than a bed, the boy is waking on the back seat of an abandoned car on a stretch of fenced-off wasteland. The boy is 15-year-old street kid Qodra (Qodratollah Qadiri, who also appeared in Sadat’s previous film, Wolf and Sheep, to which this picture is a loose sequel). An abrupt edit transports us from the makeshift car park to the inside of a cinema. On the screen is the hokey Bollywood vigilante movie Shahenshah, starring a dashing Amitabh Bachchan. Crammed into the cheap seats, surrounded by animated men and boys, Qodra is transfixed by a fight sequence, eyes and teeth lit by the flicker reflected from Bachchan’s leather jacket and glistening, immaculate hair. It’s telling that the movie theatre is the first place that the film takes us after Qodra wakes. For this teenager and many of his peers, films, specifically crowd-pleasing Indian blockbusters, take priority over most of the essentials of life. They provide a much-needed escape from a hardscrabble existence, a means to make money (he peddles tickets on black market), and the language he uses to process the world. In its understated way, this film is as heartfelt a love letter to the power of the movies as Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso. It’s the ticket touting that lands Qodra in trouble with the authorities. Pulled from the street along with a ragtag band of other teenage boys, he is taken to a state-run orphanage. There, his survival instincts kick in: Qodra quickly realises that, to negotiate the hierarchies and power structures within the institution, he is best off making himself invisible. Others are not so shrewd. Sixteen-year-old Fayaz (Ahmad Fayaz Osmani), who was brought to the orphanage along with his 14-year-old uncle Masihullah (Masihullah Feraji), is assigned a bunk in the room in which Eshan (Eshanullah Kharoti), the main bully, lords it with his crowing henchman. His red hair and emotional fragility mark Fayaz out as a target, and intimidation soon takes its toll. But Qodra’s reticence brings with it a specific challenge for the film-makers. Non-professional actor Qadiri has magnetism in the role, but his performance is inscrutable to the point of being unreadable. Sadat’s inventive solution to the problem elevates The Orphanage from a standard social-realist grind to something more original and endearing: Qodra’s interior life is vividly envisaged through the language of Bollywood musicals. Thus the first stirrings of a crush are reimagined as a coy duet, complete with his-and-hers matching knitwear, a seemingly random assortment of picturesque backdrops and a chaste campfire flirtation. Plaudits are due to cinematographer Virginie Surdej, who infuses the sequences with a layer of suitably synthetic kitsch, a striking contrast to the unvarnished immediacy of the rest of the film, which put me in mind of the work of Kurdish-Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi. It works rather well. The Bollywood segments provide sparky punctuation in a film that can feel slightly episodic and lacking in context and background texture. There’s a goofiness and naivety to Qodra’s flights of musical fancy, reminding us that, for all his well-honed survival instincts, he is a child with a narrow spectrum of experiences and a limited emotional vocabulary with which to process them. Tenderness, grief, vulnerability are all easier to understand when filtered through the lush lens of Bollywood. Other boys choose other means of escape. Qodra’s friend Masihullah is a chess whiz. In two separate, intensely concentrated scenes, he triumphs at the game. The first results in an explosion of joy, the second of violence. Some things, however, are beyond the comprehension of the children: they are perplexed by an announcement heralding a change in the government – the pro-Soviet regime of Najibullah has been toppled and the boys must gather together for burning any documents that link the institution to the government. At this point, the focus shifts slightly to Anwar, the tough but fair orphanage supervisor, played by Anwar Hashimi (on whose unpublished diaries both this film and Wolf and Sheep are based). Anwar’s anxiety, carved in hard angles on his face, hints at danger to come. But it’s another Bollywood fantasy, a glorious battle between the orphanage kids and a rabble of mujahideen, that foretells a darker chapter about to open for the boys, who will soon find themselves on the frontline of a devastating civil war."
"It’s been a quiet few months for Apple TV+ since the glossy hype of its launch last November, but we got a taste of their promised hipper side this week. On Friday, the streaming platform premiered Beastie Boys Story, a new documentary by Spike Jonze on the tongue-in-cheek white rappers whose early-90s prominence he facilitated with some memorably anarchic music videos. Mostly narrated to camera by surviving Beastie Boys Adam Horovitz and Mike Diamond in a stripped-down “live documentary” format, it’s a Generation X nostalgia trip that can be described with adjectives you’d never have applied to the group in their prime: mellow, reflective, affectionate, and a bit melancholic, as it tracks their career path from brash satirists to hard-partying sellouts to legacy artists. It’s a treat for Beastie Boys fans and Spike Jonze completists alike: I suspect there’s substantial overlap in that Venn diagram. Jonze is a film-maker unusually well suited to a home-curated streaming retrospective, even if his career started well before video-sharing platforms were a glint in the internet’s eye. Many directors progress from making ads to music videos to films without looking back, but Jonze’s mixed-media oeuvre has remained dependent on all these formats for its cachet. You can’t ignore any size of screen in appreciating his inventiveness and influence. His four feature films are the obvious place to start. Being John Malkovich (1999) remains a breathtakingly strange and conceptually elastic debut, blending philosophy and flip absurdism with almost obnoxious ease. Jonze doubled down with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman on Adaptation (2002), a hilarious unpicking of the artist’s imagination. Never quite given the credit it deserved, Jonze’s exquisite 2009 adaptation of Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are trickily honoured existing iconography while adding fresh nuances of meaning and feeling. Her, which justly won him a screenplay Oscar in 2014, was a forward-thinking man-machine romance that looks all the more prescient in times of self-isolation. All are readily available on iTunes and Amazon, and generously reward repeat visits, but they only tell half the story of their director’s career. The rest is to be found by digging through YouTube, Vimeo and other free platforms, where his dizzy array of shorts, commercials and music videos are to be found, albeit often in variable quality. Of the videos, some are iconic, imprinted on their era: the swirling, makeshift mini-musical he choreographed for Björk’s It’s Oh So Quiet; the snappy surprise factor of Christopher Walken’s dance moves in Fatboy Slim’s Weapon of Choice; the surreal dog-human odyssey of Daft Punk’s Da Funk; and of course the chaotic crime-procedural parody he constructed for the Beastie Boys’ Sabotage. My favourite is slightly less ubiquitous: his propulsively cinematic but oddly mournful clip for the Chemical Brothers’ Elektrobank, starring his then-wife Sofia Coppola as a star gymnast. It’s remarkable how brightly and wittily they hold up today. Jonze’s ads offer similarly concentrated rewards, and commercial production company MJZ has a dedicated page showcasing some of his best. They include The New Perfume, an infectious four-minute dance freakout for Kenzo that rather nicely complements the aforementioned Walken video; his fluorescent, FKA twigs-starring Welcome Home ad for Apple; and Lamp, a short, deadpan Ikea ad that brusquely and brilliantly sends up the manipulative mechanics of the medium. Over at the reliably slick, user-friendly Short of the Week site, meanwhile, a few Jonze curiosities are freely available to stream. I’m Here is a wistful half-hour robot romance sweetly inspired by Shel Silverstein’s children’s classic The Giving Tree; Mourir auprès de toi, a beguiling, rustically animated bookshop fantasy; two music-related spinoffs are the Arcade Fire-attached, adolescent’s-eye short Scenes from the Suburbs and the morbid, woozy waking nightmare of Kanye West in We Were Once a Fairytale. And that’s before you get to Jonze’s recent direction of Aziz Ansari’s Right Now comedy special on Netflix, or indeed his involvement as writer and producer of the four Jackass films thus far, all available to stream on Now TV. With such a restless, oddball career to work from, your own Jonze marathon can be as classy or crude as you like. Bacurau (Mubi, 18) If you missed it in cinemas or on its limited Mubi streaming run, catch up with Brazilian auteur Kleber Mendonca Filho’s exhilaratingly eccentric, bloody blend of exploitation thriller, sci-fi and fierce anti-colonial allegory on DVD or VOD. The Gentlemen (Entertainment, 18) Guy Ritchie’s all-star return to British gangland territory will please whatever die-hard fans he has left, but there are icky strains of casual racism and capitalist defensiveness amid the familiar banter. Great suits, though. Calm With Horses (Altitude, 15) Nick Rowland’s impressive debut feature strikes arresting notes of brute poetry in stormily downbeat surroundings. Cosmo Jarvis’s performance as an ex-boxer snared in rural Ireland’s criminal underbelly adds an extra jolt of electricity. Sátántangó (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) If you’ve always meant to watch Béla Tarr’s demanding but darkly immersive 450-minute plunge into post-communist Hungary – now reissued on Bluray in all its granite handsomeness – when better than in quarantine?"
"At the centre of The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola’s dreamy yet devastating adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides’s acclaimed 1993 novel, is an unsolved mystery of the most troubling kind, a puzzle that will never be completed. The questions asked by those in the film, and by us the viewers, will never be fully answered. An attempt to figure out the hows and whys will only ever be that, an attempt. It’s what’s left behind when someone kills themselves, a fog of painful unsureness, a feeling that I filed away as other when I was 16, watching it for the first of many times. As is the case for many teens, the idea had briefly entered my mind at certain low points, but it still felt distant, like looking at something through a camera that isn’t in focus. Twenty years later, my experience of suicide, and, in turn, the film itself, has changed. Last year, a family member and a close friend both killed themselves, in the space of about six months, forcing an otherworldly concept into grim reality, a difficult confrontation most of us don’t expect to ever have. As I watched the film again, I found a new, deeper understanding of what Coppola herself described as “the extraordinary power of the unfathomable”, of how not knowing the answer to a question of such staggering gravity can haunt you, a grip that may loosen over time but will remain nonetheless. In an industry overrun with nepotism, there was every reason to wince at the film’s arrival at Cannes in 1999 (a year before its release): the first film from Francis Ford Coppola’s daughter, co-produced by him and starring actors he had worked with. The last we had seen of Sofia was in The Godfather Part III, disastrously miscast in what turned out to be a miserable experience for all of us, especially for her. It pushed her away from acting, something she was never that interested in anyway, and years later, with great help, she moved behind the camera, where she has remained ever since. Shuddering memories of Boxing Helena (David Lynch’s 19-year-old daughter Jennifer’s laughable debut), Paris Can Wait (Francis Ford Coppola’s wife Eleanor’s indulgent and uninteresting attempt at directing) and pretty much anything written by John Landis’s son Max have shown us the dangers of Hollywood over-assistance, a heavy-handed ushering of vanity projects that make it to the screen for all the wrong reasons, home movies that should have stayed at home. But with The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola emerged from her father’s shadow with purpose, the work of a film-maker who wasn’t just doing it because she could but rather because she should, an innate ability that would have pierced through with or without the help of an Oscar-winning parent. Set in 70s Michigan, in a suburbia that’s both recognisably banal and at times ethereal, The Virgin Suicides opens with a suicide attempt. Cecilia Lisbon, the youngest daughter of five, has tried to kill herself, an act that leads to concern and confusion from those in the community. “You’re not even old enough to know how bad life gets,” she’s ignorantly told. “Obviously, doctor, you’ve never been a 13-year-old girl,” she smartly replies. It’s the beginning of the end, as told to us by an unseen narrator, the grownup version of a neighbourhood boy from the time, part of a quartet of curious locals whose obsession with the Lisbon girls has continued long after their deaths. Coppola keeps us at a distance from the sisters (played by Kirsten Dunst, AJ Cook, Leslie Hayman, Chelse Swain and Hanna R Hall), offering us brief anecdotes and scrappy clues so that we, like the boys, are left with only random pieces of the puzzle. The parents, played by Kathleen Turner and James Woods, are strict but not unloving, religious but not extremist, clueless but not in a way that isn’t relatable and so while speculation from gossiping neighbours places responsibility for what happens solely at their feet, we know it’s not that simple; it never is. The rush of unfamiliar, unwieldy emotions that come for us all during adolescence are too easily minimised by those who have already gone through it, as if the bigger picture they now see should be visible to all, and so, for me, at the core of the film is a collection of muffled screams. The first real scream we hear is when Cecilia kills herself, soon into the film, not long after her first attempt. We’re shown how those who knew her and those who didn’t all struggle with what to do, what to say, how to react, who to blame, an impossible situation that arrives without precedent. Coppola notably shows us no sign that the grief experienced by the surviving sisters is taken into account, is treated with the severity it deserves, and so life goes on as normal to those on the outside. But there’s a wound that lingers. When the girls are forced to stay inside as punishment, after Dunst’s Lux spends the night with a boy, Trip Fontaine (played by a 21-year-old Josh Hartnett at the height of his heartthrob years), we see the toll it starts to take. Their imprisonment is to them a clear sign that they’re neither understood nor respected. “We’re suffocating,” Lux says to her mother in a telling fragment of a scene near the end. “You’re safe here,” she replies. “I can’t breathe in here,” Lux answers. The dreamy aesthetic and Air’s transcendent, perfectly matched score led some to dismiss the film as a mere mood piece, of style over substance, but it’s too grounded, too rich in detail to fall into that overused categorisation. We see that in a flash forward to an older Trip, whose teen bravado has faded into pathetic delusion, and we feel it in the finale as the boys discover the girls’ bodies, while dreaming of the “impossible excursions” they were planning to take. It remains Coppola’s best film, in my opinion, because of this, because the emotions that accompany the atmosphere haunt with equal force. It’s as much about those who leave us as it is about those who are left behind, lumbered with what Coppola refers to as an “oddly shaped emptiness”, a misty, unfocused form of grief that I now know firsthand. The final, mournful piece of narration expresses sadness over the loss but also a stinging sense of regret. If the boys had just called that little bit louder, if they had just arrived that little bit sooner, maybe things might have been different. They’re agonising questions that we, as those who are still here, will always ask ourselves, knowing that the answers will for ever remain a mystery."
"Alexander Tolotukhin, a 31-year-old film-maker from Belarus and a pupil of Alexander Sokurov, makes his feature film debut with what might be called a brief cine-novella set on the eastern front of the first world war. It certainly shows Sokurov’s influences in its soft, painterly compositions and extensive dubbing that makes the dialogue sound often like a subdued murmur. It also feels like classic Russian movies such as Tarkovsky’s Ivan’s Childhood or Klimov’s Come and See. What makes it distinctive – and, unfortunately, not as good as it might have been – is an odd framing device. We don’t see the film straightforwardly. We periodically see a modern-day orchestra rehearsing the musical score that is to go on it – pieces by Rachmaninov. This is an interesting quirk in some ways, but the film would have been better without it, impeding as it does your emotional reaction to the drama and not enhancing the musical accompaniment’s meaning. Yet the story is absorbing. Alexey (Vladimir Korolev) is a fresh-faced boy with troops at the front who is blinded in a gas attack and from then on employed to listen out for advancing German aircraft. He does this at a strange monitoring post with a great funnel, which Alexey is strapped into, like a pilot – and he does well to warn everyone of an imminent attack. There are grisly episodes: despite his blindness, Alexey is beaten with Dickensian cruelty for spilling food on an officer. He has to have a tick removed from the side of his face with a knife and is always having to shake the lice out of his jacket. Eventually, the Germans close in, and poor Alexey is not much worse off than his cowed comrades. Perhaps the point is that war makes blind cattle of them all. It is a well-made little film, though the orchestral meta-level was a mistake. "
"This feature from actor-director John Connors won the audience award at this year’s Dublin film festival, and it’s a generous, big-hearted, honest tribute to the McCann family from Greystones, County Wicklow, who endured a public heartbreak. In 2018, daughter Jade had become a beauty influencer on Instagram; her profile assumed a new dimension when she started documenting the way her dad, Anthony, a former boxer, was dealing with his prostate cancer. Things became even more complex when Jade was diagnosed with sarcoma, and she began talking in the same artless way about that. Connors intersperses his own black-and-white footage of Jade and Anthony (and her mum, Kim, and brother, Eoin) with Jade’s own Instagram videos, which are shot portrait-style, often in her car, with text and wacky emojis. We can see how the Panglossian self-promotional rhetoric of social media, with its habitual filtering and airbrushing, is coming into contact with something darker and more unmanageable. Often, Connors will include updates about the way Jade’s follower count is fluctuating – perhaps because the public was unsure how to take what she was telling them. It’s a touching film, precisely because it has a rough-and-ready, homemade quality. Jade is no more of a narcissist than anyone else on social media, and there is a heartrending openness about what she is trying to do. If there is a fault in this film, it is that it does not analyse clearly enough what it means to go through such a tough experience in the real time of social media. Specifically, it could have been more candid about what type of trolling Jade had to withstand – that was clearly an issue – and how she reacted to what appear to have been shifts in public opinion. But there is something affecting in the simplicity of this film, which has a sadness and sweetness."
"A likable performance by Richard Dreyfuss livens up this easygoing drama about second chances and late-life adventure from actor-turned-director Shelagh McLeod. Dreyfuss plays a retired civil engineer who, all his life, has dreamed of going to space and is now in with a chance of winning a golden ticket. The role is a nice mirror to Close Encounters, in which Dreyfuss ditched his wife and kids to fly off with the little green men. Here he is a family-oriented man who nursed his wife through dementia and is adored by his grownup daughter. He has lived a good life but perhaps stifles a pang of regret at the average-ness of it all. It’s a film of tender feelings, though perhaps a little predictable and bluntly sentimental. Dreyfuss is Angus Stewart, a 75-year-old with a dodgy ticker living in a nursing home. His face subtly registers the indignities of the care home regime: dinner at the nursery appointed hour of 5pm, tickings off from staff who talk to residents as if they were naughty puppies. It’s Angus’s grandson who persuades him to enter a lottery to win a seat on the first commercial flight into space, which is being bankrolled by an obsessive tech billionaire (Colm Feore). Of course, Angus makes the shortlist of 12 finalists. In a minor way, the plot becomes unexpectedly timely; experts are split on a life-and-death matter. Angus, an authority on road surfacing, spots a major safety issue with the flight runway. Who will the billionaire trust – his team of expensive consultants or the old timer? It’s a big-hearted if formulaic tale, with a few plot implausibilities: for instance, at one point Angus sweet talks his way past security at the launch site’s barbed wire gate. And, for a movie that is making a point about how the wisdom of older people is overlooked, its care home residents come dangerously close to looking like patronising stereotypes. "
"Last year, Ari Aster was praised for setting the horrors of Midsommar in bright, sunlit scenes: by refusing the easy scares of nighttime, the director succeeded in making something especially disquieting, a paranoid waking nightmare. Although All Is Well, the debut feature film by German director Eva Trobisch, is not a horror film, it similarly thumbs its nose at the register of darkness you might expect from a drama about somebody recovering from a sexual assault. Janne, the young woman in question, never names her attacker; never seeks revenge; doesn’t have a moment of reckoning – and, as she attempts to continue her life as usual, Trobisch frames her in solidly neutral whites. The pale workshirts she wears; sunlight through white blinds; white bricks at Janne’s trendy office; computer light on her face; the walls of a hospital clinic: it’s as if the world surrounding Janne is undisturbed. That unsullied universe only heightens the weight of the torment we know she is going through. Janne is suffering. At the start of the movie, she and her boyfriend have just folded their small publishing outfit when she attends a school reunion at which, in short succession, she receives a job offer and is raped by Martin, another partygoer. Trobisch, with a remarkable knack for storytelling, gets through all of this in 20 minutes; 20 minutes filled, too, with so much observation and humanity. As Janne and Martin get pissed at the party and wend their way back together, the two are filmed giggling, drunkenly proffering beer to a passing cat. The movie’s gift for the plausible, the banal, is evident in all of this – as it is when Janne’s laughing, disbelieving derision towards Martin, when he makes overtures, seems to be what pushes him to assault her. The film is a bold, rich portrait of a woman, but it also trains a gimlet eye on the cringing weakness of men. This continues after Janne returns to the apartment she shares with her boyfriend – a mostly amiable, loving oaf of a man, with anger problems and an inability to listen – and takes the job she was offered. In a horrifying twist, Martin also works at Janne’s new office, and the two will have to work together. Trobisch is astute in the way she threads the workspace into the narrative; this is now just one more area where Janne has to keep it together, one further instance of oppression. Aenne Schwarz, playing Janne, offers a masterclass here – not only anchoring the film’s story, but cluing us in to all of Janne’s warring anguish and resolve; her gnawing exhaustion, too. Schwarz gives us the merest split second of pain before switching on her capable public face; it is extraordinarily disquieting to see Janne lean in to greet Martin with a kiss on either cheek. As the movie continues, Schwarz shows Janne’s control slipping, all the while maintaining an appearance of remaining steadfast. All Is Well, as should be clear by now, doesn’t do things quite like other movies. The film is slow-paced and forensic, in the vein of recent German films; it is perhaps reminiscent of Toni Erdmann in the way it incorporates work into its study of character. There is weirdness and absurdity here too; things that can’t be explained away – as when Janne, in helpless torment after an argument with her boyfriend, takes off her clothes on the landing outside the flat, and posts them through the letterbox. Trobisch, maintaining a riveting control over character and incident throughout, is brazenly uninterested in shortcuts or easy answers. To wit, a late confrontation between Janne and Martin, sharply written, in which Martin now finds himself the one saying no – this scene never spills into the dramatic, and doesn’t offer catharsis. The movie’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-it opening scene gives the tone of the film, as Janne impassively watches an advert for a cleaning product, in which a woman admonishes two men for dirtying her floor. That whiteness again! The film’s sublime rug-pull of an ending – one of the greatest ends in recent times – sees Janne’s situation spilling over into the public sphere, as she rides the subway. It’s intelligent, because here Janne is a public body, a civilian and a dissident. We have transitioned seamlessly from an interiorised depiction of one woman’s ordeal to a more exterior perception of Janne, all the while knowing the turmoil that inhabits her. Now, in the subtle framing of the scene, under the eye of onlookers, Janne is just one other woman, a nameless individual, a nuisance, at the end of her tether."
"Eliza Hittman does not make feelgood films. Instead, the Brooklyn-born director’s work is more likely to leave you with a strange sensation in the pit of your stomach: exhilaration spiked with a heavy dose of unease. Her first two features were impressionistic, ominous pieces about unorthodox sexual awakenings, bristling with closeups of clammy limbs and anxious faces. But for her latest film, Hittman has shifted her gaze away from those adolescent encounters and towards something even more disconcerting: their potential aftermath. Never Rarely Sometimes Always centres on Autumn (Sidney Flanigan, making her acting debut), a withdrawn 17-year-old with a dysfunctional home life who finds herself pregnant. Her attempt to get an abortion is a quest that takes her from Pennsylvania to the uninvitingly bright lights of New York City, a place Autumn and her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder) must endure, penniless and exhausted, as they are shunted from clinic to bus terminal and back again. Meticulously understated and gut-punchingly sad, Never Rarely… looks as if it could be Hittman’s breakthrough moment. Thanks to rave reviews, festival accolades and champions such as Moonlight director Barry Jenkins (who exec-produced the film), Oscar buzz is now steadily building (buzz that was given a major boost thanks to the Academy’s decision to relax its anti-streaming rules for films whose cinema releases have been scuppered by the pandemic). Hittman describes her subjects as “everyday lives and everyday struggles”, which, while technically true, skims over just how unsettling her films can be. Her first two features, It Felt Like Love and Beach Rats – about a teenage boy trying to hide his burgeoning homosexuality – were sultry and dreamily ambiguous, heavy on lingering looks and light on expository dialogue (explaining the ending of either film would be an impressive feat). Never Rarely…, on the other hand, is tautly told and coldly realistic, painstakingly chronicling the hoops that Autumn jumps through in order to get an abortion. Yet the secret of its success is the story it doesn’t tell: how our protagonist became pregnant in the first place. It is a narrative chasm the viewer is left to fill with their worst suspicions: what we do know is that Autumn has been mistreated in the past and, in the absence of a clear perpetrator, everyone becomes a culprit. “I was thinking about not having one antagonist but about the ways in which the world is in smaller and larger ways hostile to women,” Hittman explains in her slow, deliberate way. “It’s unavoidable.” It certainly feels that way in Never Rarely…, which frequently resembles a horror movie whose villain is the malign, shapeshifting spirit of the patriarchy. From a student heckler to Autumn’s menacing stepfather, the creeps just keep coming: customers at the shop where Skylar and Autumn work; the girls’ boss; the man masturbating in the subway car. Hittman says her decision to portray this threat as structural rather than personal reflects the lack of accountability in these scenarios – often the act of apportioning blame can feel futile. “Ultimately for women in this country, there’s no justice that comes with accusing or confronting [abuse]. That’s something I think young women are very aware of.” Unlike her often reticent protagonists (Autumn is borderline mute for the majority of Never Rarely…), Hittman is eager to talk about her work – although she does tend to demur from explanations when a solitary “mm-hmm” will do. When we speak she is in lockdown at home in New York, adjusting to a brave new world of endless video calling (“Zoom work is draining”) and trying to fulfil contractual obligations while supervising young children (before we get going she must persuade her five-year-old to grant her the time to do this interview). Yet despite sounding slightly frazzled by pandemic-era parenting, she is conscientiously counting her blessings, from having a stable career (Hittman teaches full-time at the Pratt Institute, a private New York university) to being able to drive to an empty beach nearby and walk around (“That’s been very restorative”). Checking your lockdown privilege is something one feels especially inclined to do after watching her film. The plot might be set in motion by the US’s complex patchwork of age-related abortion laws (Pennsylvania requires parental consent; New York doesn’t), but recent events have broadened its relevance. Coronavirus-related upheaval has made getting an abortion an extremely fraught process for women who weren’t faced with such restrictions in the first place (Texas and Ohio were able to suspend all abortions in March by classifying them as elective procedures), as well as intensifying the vulnerability of those who were – a situation Hittman describes as “a crisis on top of a crisis”. Despite its timeliness – not just in light of the pandemic, but also the Trump administration’s assault on reproductive rights – Never Rarely… has been in the pipeline for nearly a decade. The film may cleave to Hittman’s signature setup (grotty New York backdrop, troubled teenager front and centre) but it should be noted that she originally intended to make a completely different film, centring on an au pair in Ireland, a premise Hittman developed after learning about Savita Halappanavar, an Indian dentist living in Galway who was denied a life-saving abortion in 2012. Hittman began researching Ireland’s eighth amendment – the recently repealed law that asserts a pregnant woman and her unborn child’s equal right to life – and the voyage women seeking an abortion took across the Irish Sea to mainland Britain. “Something about that journey felt very heroic to me,” says Hittman, “and unrepresented on screen.” But she struggled to muster up interest in the film during the Obama years, partly due to the administration’s reputation for progressiveness in that area – an impression Hittman describes as an “illusion”. Yet Hittman also felt a resistance to the film on a more fundamental level. “When I started talking about the project, a common reaction was that it felt like a topic that would be better served in a documentary,” she says. “There are stigmas around representing female issues and experiences in the context of a fictional narrative film.” It has to do with the skewed perspective that means women’s stories tend to be othered – rendered specialist subjects – due to the prioritisation of the male gaze. “Documentaries are presenting information about topics people don’t know about and that’s the medium to explore – quote – issues,” she explains. It acts as a kind of feedback loop. “Women’s stories are less represented on screen so they’re seen as niche.” The mainstream’s unwillingness to engage with the realities of abortion means many have no real idea of what it entails – Autumn certainly doesn’t. And yet the procedure itself is not a source of horror in Never Rarely…. In fact, it is almost the only thing in the film that isn’t – there are no mixed feelings, only relief. What is indisputably disturbing is the sight that greets Autumn outside one of the abortion clinics: a group of chanting protesters who crowd her and Skylar, zombie-style, as they approach. Due to the pandemic, the film was only in cinemas for a few days in the US. Had it been given a full release, did Hittman think there might have been similar demonstrations? “I guess we’ll never know,” she says merrily.  Still, on the internet, Hittman has seen “groups of people who are anti-abortion rally messageboards to drive the rating of the film down”. The review aggregator Metacritic notes the critics’ rave responses, but the average user review is a dire 3.2 thanks to submissions from members of the public, who describe the film as “hateful and misandrist”. Whatever methods the protesters are pushing, they can’t quell the conversation Never Rarely… is prompting, or the solace it’s providing. It is something Hittman attributes to film’s unifying power – a phenomenon she thinks the pandemic has only intensified. “There’s something beautiful about this crisis that we’re all faced with,” she muses, “and that’s people’s desire all over the world to connect through cinema.” Never Rarely Sometimes Always is streaming now on digital platforms"

"This rather slight documentary on talent and genius in sport is chatty and anecdotal, but could perhaps have been boiled down further to a crisp hour-long documentary for television. There is, however, something worthwhile here, as film-maker Gabe Polsky unfashionably hits back against the “moneyball” theory of sports and its obsession with stats, performance levels and athletic targets. It takes as its cue a strange institution: the NFL Scouting Combine, a weirdly Soviet-style annual showcase in which specially chosen college football players are invited to perform various punishing tests of running and bench-pressing while boffins mull over the resulting numbers and decide on a draft pick and salary. But is all that – and the competitive fanaticism in schools – taking the joy and artistry out of sport, as well crushing the seed of genius? Sports journalist David Epstein says we are in danger of “making something important because it is measurable, not measuring it because it’s important”. Sporting heroes including football’s Pelé, ice hockey’s Wayne Gretzky and the NFL’s Jerry Rice smilingly tell the same story: they worked hard and practised incessantly, but they were also encouraged to cultivate their intuitive inspirational spark and were not put through the formally rigid programme that today’s athletes must endure. Educationalist Sir Ken Robinson is also interviewed and, as ever, he is the voice of sweet reason. To be fair, the stat fiends and the moneyballers could shrug and say they are doing this because it gets results. I should have liked to see an interview with Michael Lewis, the author of Moneyball, the non-fiction classic which popularised the whole idea. It’s food for thought, though."
"Dame Judi Dench’s interview in the new issue of Vogue is a lovely thing, touching on everything from her early career in the theatre to her thoughts on the outbreak. But that isn’t why you’ll read it. No, you’ll read it to witness Dame Judi Dench struggle to describe her Cats costume. She has several attempts at it. She looked like “a battered, mangy old cat,” she said. Like “a great big orange bruiser”. Her cloak alone looked like “five foxes fucking on my back”. You sense that Judi Dench isn’t necessarily the biggest fan of Cats. Dench’s comments are a welcome inclusion to my favourite form of 2020 entertainment; the stars of Cats reacting to Cats. Because you can tell a lot about a person by how they respond to their participation in what is destined to be an eternal punchline. Do they stand by the director? Do they remain professional and rise above the baffled din? Or do they give up all pretence of dignity and, like Dench, slag it off just as hard as everyone else? For fun, I have unearthed some quotes by the stars of Cats, varying from outright horror to brave professionalism. Your job is to guess who is responsible for each of them, and your prize is getting to remember that Cats exists."
"Try to imagine the least film-noir scene possible and you might come up with a group of five-year-olds learning to whistle. It is late morning, pre-lockdown, in a classroom at Nereida Díaz Abreu school on La Gomera in the Canary Islands, and the teacher – a bent knuckle crammed in his mouth – is relaying instructions in a piercing, swooping, set of whistles. The kids look quizzically skywards, then collapse in hysterics, although most eventually nail it. “Touch your left ear with your right hand,” the teacher reiterates in Spanish. “Ay-ay-ay!” the children hoot in disbelief. They are learning the el silbo gomero, the island’s whistling language, which dates back at least to the 15th century and is now the unlikely star of a new Romanian film noir, The Whistlers. A bent Bucharest cop Cristi (Vlad Ivanov) is summoned to the distant island by a local drug gang to learn their secret language, so he can help them retrieve €30m stolen by their eastern European middleman. It is a rich, roundabout handbook on the subtleties of communication; even the film’s structure, a series of flashbacks in which you are perpetually looking for who is double-crossing whom, seems to collude in this. With its deep-cut volcanic ravines, shaggy Tolkienian laurel forest and Tenerife’s volcano floating above the cloudline, La Gomera hits the visual jackpot. But the film’s director, Corneliu Porumboiu, insists it was the island’s aural dimension that attracted him. He came across el silbo 10 years ago on a French TV documentary; the Canaries’ Spanish colonists inherited the language from La Gomera’s Guanche inhabitants, who used it to communicate across the steep valleys. “It was this strange kind of bird language that seemed to come from ancient times. So for me using this in a super-technological society created a certain type of tension and poetry – and was funny as well,” Porumboiu says. Contrary to film noir’s most famous whistling tip, from Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not – “You just put your lips together and blow” – el silbo takes some mastering. The film’s silbo consultant, Kico Correa, insisted the lead actors had to learn for real. “It’s been classified as Unesco World Heritage, so it needs to be treated with special respect,” he explains to me at a harbourside cafe. “You can dub the sound, but the lip movements needed to be credible.” Ivanov and Catrinel Marlon, who plays the film’s moll, Gilda, were both put on to a two-week silbo crash course in Bucharest, followed up later with Skype sessions. It was not simply a case of training in the physical mechanics, but also how to understand its system of letter substitution. It strips down an underlying language – Spanish, in La Gomera’s case – to just two vowels and four consonants. The same approximate whistling pitch, for example, is used for “A”, “O” and “U”. Rephrasings, clarifying questions and awareness of the context at hand are sometimes needed to avoid misunderstandings. Even though the actors’ whistling was eventually dubbed by the island’s silbo teachers, Correa gives them A for effort. Marlon, who started slightly later than Ivanov, had more natural aptitude, he says. A fashion model, she whistled so hard during practice that she had to pull out of a photoshoot in Italy because her lips were too chafed. Porumboiu lasted just a single day on the course because he was busy preparing the film. The Whistlers is a clear break from the garrulous, sly and sometimes wilfully pedantic arthouse he produced when he graduated as a leading light of the 00s Romanian new wave. But the film’s use of el silbo is perfectly in line with the director’s longstanding interest in communication; how the relationship between language and meaning is rarely straightforward. It is there in his debut 12:08 East of Bucharest, with its radio show guests bickering about how the exact moment the news of Ceauşescu’s deposal was relayed to their backwater town is crucial to deciding whether it can be said an actual revolution took place there. Or the police captain played by Ivanov in Police, Adjective, who turns to the dictionary for the definition of his profession to solve a crisis of conscience. Or the bureaucrat in Porumboiu’s last film, Infinite Football, whose tinkering with the rules of the sport doesn’t pan out in reality. The director wrings out a colourful stream of comic possibility from misinterpretation in these films, but language, via el silbo, plays a darker, concealing role in The Whistlers, a world in which people can rarely express themselves truthfully. The director, speaking on the phone under lockdown in the Romanian countryside, is at a loss to explain his interest in the theme. “To be honest, I’m not doing it on purpose. It’s a personal matter, this feeling that we don’t understand each other.” Where does it come from? “I think it’s coming from … my inability … ” He tails off. Back in March on La Gomera, I am having my own communication issues. Five minutes of efforts better described as spitting than whistling are enough to leave my deoxygenated head spinning. But Correa – a short, calm Gomero who resembles Robert Forster – has had to learn patience in his day job organising the island’s silbo syllabus. The language had virtually died out in the 1970s, associated with a peasant lifestyle many people were keen to leave behind. Correa’s parents were among a minority who didn’t view it as backward. “My family thought differently: we’re going to make our children learn it, so they can be in advance,” he says in French, the only language both of us understand. El silbo’s moment came in the late 90s, when an upsurge in interest resulted in a push to make it compulsory on the school curriculum. Now learning it for half an hour each week is obligatory for six-year-olds and upwards; three- to five-year-olds also receive tuition, mostly in comprehension. “We don’t make a big effort to say: ‘You should learn it to support your culture,’” says Correa. “It’s too much weight for kids. We encourage them to do it for fun. We say: ‘When you go to Tenerife and say you’re from La Gomera, people are going to ask you if you can whistle.’” I also sit in on an impressively adept classroom of teenagers, chattering away in silbo like manic songbirds. But how much do they use it in everyday life? Marta, a regular victor in the class’s silbo competitions, says: “Sometimes. For fun. But mobile phones are easier.” Gabriel, rosy-cheeked with an unexpected Mancunian accent (his family came to live on La Gomera nine years ago), sheepishly admits he doesn’t practise enough. He can understand the language, but his whistling is below par: “We only have lessons once a week, but I can’t really do it.” The education programme is vital for preserving this rare offshoot of the world linguistic tree. But from the silence reigning over La Gomera’s stepped basalt cliffs, where there are few shepherds now, it is clear that it’s not quite a living language, either; it’s mostly heard in classrooms or in restaurants, in demonstrations for tourists. While The Whistlers is unlikely to make the island’s hills suddenly alive with the sound of unusually articulate birds, it should help magnify el silbo’s worldwide cultural status. Correa appears briefly in the film as a Gomero gangster, but was originally slated for a bigger part as the teacher; as Porumboiu learned more about the language and the role expanded, it called for a professional actor. Correa, though, is not disappointed. The sound of his ear-splitting whistles ringing out between Bucharest apartment blocks on screen testify to him having fully communicated his passion: “My character in the film is el silbo. It’s me.” The Whistlers and Infinite Football will stream from 8 May in the UK and Ireland on Curzon Home Cinema"
"Michelle Obama is a class act – one of the classiest – and her intelligence and poise now look like something from a lost golden age. The publication of her globally bestselling memoir Becoming in 2018 brought her dazzlingly into the public sphere on her own terms. It gave her an international A-list status to rival her husband’s and provided Democrats and non-Trumpians around the world with a manifesto of decency and dignity to cling on to. Now we have this watchable, but carefully authorised, behind-the-scenes documentary for Netflix (from the Obamas’ company, Higher Ground Productions) about Obama’s American book tour (with a stopover at London’s O2 Arena). It shows her getting in and out of armoured sports utility vehicles, chatting easily and good-naturedly with her security detail, with colleagues and family members backstage, with beaming celebrity moderators onstage (starting with Oprah Winfrey) and with people getting their copies signed in bookstores who often dissolve in floods of tears just in coming face to face with her. (I was sorry, however, that we didn’t get to see again her amusing cameo in the TV comedy Parks and Recreation, which showed Amy Poehler’s earnest public official Leslie Knope reduced to a gibbering fangirl in her presence.) Obama goes back to the family home in Chicago and talks about her background, and particularly about her late father (who died of MS), about meeting and marrying Barack, about raising children in the White House and about the terrible blow of leaving for the last time: she says she sobbed on the official plane for 30 minutes, partly out of sheer relief that her official duties were over. And this is interspersed with her meetings with girls and women of colour, talking about how her experiences can help them. Malia Obama has a cameo, speaking in a cool, smart vocal-fry. This is Obama’s own film, so we can’t expect any tough scrutiny. The nearest we get to her losing her cool comes when her elder brother, Craig, starts mocking her outfit, with what looks a high belt – and she doesn’t like it one bit. I also wondered exactly how delighted she was when Barack made what appeared to be a genuine surprise onstage appearance during one of her events, which he cheerfully compared to Jay-Z coming on during a Beyoncé concert. She is still upset with her high-school teacher who told her she wasn’t smart enough to go to Princeton (but she did) and she is still mad at the press and media, who before the 2008 presidential election tried to paint her as a shrewish extremist. We see the notorious cartoon magazine cover, depicting Michelle and Barack as jihadis exchanging a fist bump. The magazine intended all sorts of essentially supportive ironies, which were not appreciated. Inevitably, it’s the things that don’t get asked that stick out. Nobody ever asks Obama why she took her husband’s surname, or if she had any qualms about that. Could it be that from the very first, she knew that Barack might have political ambitions and she wanted to tailor her own personality to that? The film doesn’t raise the question of Hillary Clinton’s tilt at the White House and Michelle’s own speech supporting her at the Democratic National Convention. And she doesn’t go low enough to talk (much) about Voldemort himself, other than to speak to Native American people about how embattled they feel during his grisly reign. She continues to go high, though: an altitude of which so few politicians are capable.  Becoming is available on Netflix on 6 May.  "
"Simon Pegg was the first person I’d ever met who was as obsessed with George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead as I was. One evening, I was round at Simon and his pal Nick Frost’s flat for drinks when I said we should make our own zombie movie, a horror comedy. It would be from the point of view of two bit-players, two idiots who were the last to know what was going on, after waking up hungover on a Sunday morning. A flash point came when I ventured out once to buy milk at five in the morning, after staying up playing Resident Evil. I was taken with how deserted and eerie the streets were. What would a British person do if zombies appeared now? In American zombie movies, everyone had high-powered weapons. What would someone do without all that? This turned into the first scene I filmed, where Shaun walks to the shop completely oblivious to the zombie attack. We wouldn’t have been able to make the film without fans of Spaced, the sitcom I’d worked on with Simon. We put a call out, asking them to be our zombie extras, and the response was overwhelming. We had no money to pay them, though, and I’m keenly aware that after the long hours they put in, some of them weren’t Spaced fans afterwards.  Our zombies spent a week cooped up on set. They had to stand outside The Winchester, the pub where our heroes take refuge, banging on the windows and not doing much else really. When we eventually involved them properly, they had this electric energy: a pure, crazed hysteria. I needed to record some zombie sounds so one lunchtime I stood in the middle of the pub and asked them all to attack me. One came straight at me and bit my leg. They’d gone feral. We wrote to people asking if would be OK for us to trash their records. Simon sent a nice letter to Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits asking if we could use Brothers in Arms, but it came to nothing. Sade was the coolest. She said we could trash Diamond Life without hesitation. We were going to have a David Bowie joke in the part where they’re deciding which records to throw at the zombies. “Hunky Dory? Ziggy Stardust? The Labyrinth Soundtrack!” In the end, we went with Prince because we thought it was funnier: “Purple Rain? Sign O’ the Times? The Batman Soundtrack! Throw it!” Helen Mirren turned down the part of Barbara, Shaun’s mother. She sent us a note saying she wanted to be Nick, because he had funnier lines. Bill Nighy said yes immediately but, being a dapper dresser, wasn’t too impressed by his character’s beige, suburban wardrobe. He still managed to look dashing. A bunch of kids were unhappy about us filming on their estate. They threw stones and eggs. The only way we could stop them was by giving them parts. They went through full makeup and eventually became teenage zombies. It was a case of keep your friends close but your zombie enemies closer. An extra came up to me one day and, thinking I was a crew member, said: “Straight to video, this one.” The success rate for British films was still quite low and one of the biggest jobs was convincing everyone the effort was going to be worthwhile. Later, we sent all the people who said nice things about the film a name tag, like Shaun’s but with their name on it. I got an email from Stephen King telling me he was wearing his. And when Simon and I eventually met George Romero, he had his on. Romero saw the film before its release, but Universal had a security guard watch it with him. I love the fact they thought he was going to pirate a movie that was a tribute to him. It was an amazing year, probably the best year of my life. I wrote an episode of Spaced where my character fights zombies in his flat. We had such a fun time shooting it, we thought we ought to make a zombie movie – like it was that easy. We really were so naive. We thought we could do anything. Edgar loved Queen and had the idea of playing Don’t Stop Me Now – one of the most positive, exciting, happy tunes ever – over a scene of extreme violence in The Winchester. We choreographed the entire fight to that song, which was a real worry because it hadn’t been cleared for use and could have ended up being way too expensive. So we wrote a begging letter to Queen guitarist Brian May and he was lovely about it. We spent ages in the pub set. It was a really hot summer and one of the zombies fainted. Fortunately, there was a working tap and the cast would have a much-needed beer after filming. Steve Emerson played John the zombie landlord. He’d been a stuntman on Brannigan, we discovered, and had been thrown into a jukebox by John Wayne. Despite being well into his 70s, he encouraged us to really hit him during the fight scene. So we did. The reaction to the film was extraordinary. George Romero loved it and I saw a picture of Stephen King wearing a Shaun of the Dead T-shirt. I’d made it on to the chest of a horror master. "
"The Restigouche River snakes through the Canadian wilds just north of the border with Maine, its name derived from the Listuguj Mi’gmaq First Nation people who have called the area home for centuries. In 1780, their settlement played a pivotal role in the French and Indian war, when the Acadian and Mi’kmaq armies took refuge there after retreating from the British ships upstream. At the time, the French dubbed the newly established battery “Pointe de la Mission”; they named the other one that they had set up across the river “Pointe aux Sauvages”. This would not be the last time the white settler population would visit violent crisis upon the Restigouche. The Quebec provincial police conducted a pair of brutal raids on the small community over two days in June 1981, citing overfishing by the local population. Injustices were carried out and later formally apologized for, but this time around, the Mi’kmaq would have a hand in formulating the record. The Native film-maker Alanis Obomsawin captured the second raid on camera and relayed her perspective with the documentary Incident at Restigouche. For a young Listuguj boy named Jeff Barnaby, witnessing the cruel might of the Canadian government along with the rejoinder from a First Nations artist would effectively determine the course of his life from then onward. That, and getting into George Romero. “The Quebec government deciding to raid my little reserve, the approximate size of which was two thousand people at the time, in this really disproportionate response,” the now-adult Barnaby tells the Guardian from his home in Canada. “That shaped my perception in a couple ways: first by showing me that film could be used as a safe form of social protest … You hear Native people talking about learning self-perception through Hollywood depictions, but I was growing up watching real Mi’kmaq men and women onscreen, because of Alanis’ film. For the past 20 years, she was the only Native film-maker that I had to look up to and build my ideas around. Around this time, I was also watching a lot of horror films, and my brother had brought home a Beta copy of Night of the Living Dead. That was all I needed.” Synthesizing these two influences – the zombie flicks that captured his imagination and the cultural turbulence that molded his reality – has yielded Barnaby’s new film Blood Quantum, a crucial and wholly original entry into the canon of First Nation cinema. The horror-thriller, a mainstay of festival Midnight Madness sections over the six months since its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, arrives online this week via the niche streaming service Shudder. The genre-focused library will provide a fitting platform for Barnaby’s vision of an undead invasion exacerbating the tensions between white Canadians and their indigenous neighbors. It’s an exceptionally gnarly specimen of the zombie picture, but moreover, the film articulates a viewpoint largely unexplored in the world of scary movies. “You’re starting to see Native cinema take shape,” Barnaby says, “as a genre and across genres.” His film places a familiar premise – lurching ghouls hungry for brains descend upon a small town, forcing its denizens to take up arms and mount a counteroffensive – in a fresh context that informs and enriches the genre’s ageing bag of tricks. The concerned conversations that always fill out the first act of movies like this graft the usual pseudoscientific speculation to superstitions passed down through Native tradition. We later learn that the infectious germ cannot be transmitted to anyone with First Nation blood, even a drop, lending the film its central dramatic thread as well as its title. (For years, “blood quantum” laws restricted rights based on fractions of identity passed through interracial parentage.) One of the survivors is a teenage mother-to-be (Olivia Scriven), pregnant with a Mi’kmaq boy’s child. She’s one of many white refugees hoping to find safety in a First Nation-run sanctuary, a bracing reversal of the area’s usual power balance. As one of a small number of First Nation film-makers with public reach, Barnaby cannot help but be implicated in conversations much bigger than himself. The dynamics of his script invite questions about cross-cultural resentment, opposition and solidarity; one shot invokes the famed Face to Face photograph depicting a Canadian soldier staring down a Mohawk warrior during the 1990 Oka Crisis standoff. All the same, he tries not to get too bogged down in the politics of real life. “At no point, as an Indigenous creator, do I want my audience to think that what they’re looking at is an accurate representation of Native life,” he firmly states. “It has Native language and Native actors, but this is the creative interpretation of a popular cinematic trope, in this case zombies. I’m indigenizing zombies. But I’m not trying to make any particular statement about the accuracy. It’d be like showing Mark Wahlberg onscreen and saying he speaks for the Irish. I don’t think I should be carrying that weight! I don’t speak for Native cinema; I speak for Jeff Barnaby, a res rat that grew up watching Obomsawin films. If I drift into any authenticity while being me, that’s great, but by that same token, everyone needs to realize that what they’re watching is Native fiction. It’s a fusion.” Barnaby takes glee in juxtaposition, mashing up disparate elements and situating his art at the collision point. That goes not just for his narrative grafting of walking-dead terror to his Mi’kmaq milieu, but for his anything-goes style. He empties the aesthetic toolbox, from split-screen to splashes of lurid color to manipulations through fast- and slow-motion. He takes special pride in the expressionistic animated interludes that break up the film, leaving the larger-than-life impression of a bone-crunching comic book. He spared no expense at replicating that adrenalized feel for the live-action scenes, such as the gloriously gory set piece that involves a bridge, a steady stream of the walking dead channeled on to it, and a barricade of giant snowblowers mulching them into viscera soup. “Getting on an interprovincial bridge for three days was a minor miracle and cost us a small fortune,” Barnaby says. But that scene was crucial to establishing the tone, placing it in a register well removed from anything resembling social realism. “I wanted no explicit morality – just a redneck story of a teenage pregnancy, something relatable, with no effort to solve the racism it shows.” Barnaby makes a crack about bogus racial dynamics in the 2005 film Crash before concluding, “In the strictest sense of the term, I wanted it to be a Native exploitation film. He amplifies the actual Native struggles of resource scarcity and friction with Canadian officials to heroically outsized proportions, shrugging off the “thinly veiled” allegories used in the past to sanitize and distort First Nations heritage. “We face a culture that doesn’t prioritize Native stories, unless you’ve got a white person to tell it,” he says. “You need a Kevin Costner to hold your hand, or you have to stage the whole fucking thing in space with blue space-cats. I didn’t feel like I needed to hide the First Nations part in something else.” Barnaby is more than a representative but less than a standard-bearer, a person who wants to sculpt the dialogue about public perception of Native people without dominating it. In short, he’d like to be one of many voices contributing to a rich and varied body of art, a full-scale paradigm change he sees as entirely possible. “Look, there’s still a football team called the Edmonton Eskimos,” he concedes. “But we have a stronger cinematic presence, the most prominent Indigenous film center next to New Zealand. We have so many great film-makers coming out of Canada, both fiction and documentary, so my hope is it’s only going to be a matter of time until this – for lack of a better word – renaissance spreads wider over culture in Canada.” Until that day comes, he’s just going to keep making his movies his way, with one eye to the currents of history and the other to the B-movie grindhouse. In fact, he sees these as inextricably linked, braided along the Restigouche. For Barnaby and the others raised along its banks, the sensational and the sobering have always uneasily coexisted. “Apocalypse films speak to a deep-seated desire to see the powers that be topple,” he says. “We’re starting to see rumblings of this everywhere. We’ve all just fucking had it with late-stage capitalism. You’re starting to see permutations of these ideas manifest themselves in all these dystopian apocalypse films. I don’t think the people making the movies are even aware of this, but the proletariat’s getting ready to riot. What I am doing here isn’t even prescient, because it’s a pulse that was already in the culture. It’s always been in the culture.”"
"Most of America’s cinemas have gone dark in the coronavirus pandemic, but attendance at the Ocala drive-in in Florida is surging. Seven nights a week, people are pulling up in their cars at the 1948 cinema, which reopened following refurbishment in 2011, to see films such as Trolls World Tour, Back to the Future and Horror Nights. It is one of just a handful of outdoor theaters across the country that have stayed open during the stay-at-home measures, and owner John Watzke said people are driving two or three hours to visit the cinema. “This time of the year I normally would not sell out [of tickets] because children are in school and stuff, but I am finding now on Fridays and Saturdays I am reaching my capacity and have to turn people away.” Watzke said he wanted to stay open because of his experiences after Hurricane Katrina, which caused devastation in 2005, and when “anything that brought a few minutes of a normal life to us was appreciated.” With many facing financial uncertainty and confined to their homes unable to see friends and family because of the virus, he wanted to provide an outlet. “My thought is if you’re sitting in the house together, you can ride in a vehicle together, why can’t you watch a movie together?” Since the outbreak he has introduced new safety measures including almost halving capacity from 460 to 250, asking employees to wear masks and gloves and moving food orders online, which are then delivered to vehicles. They also check employees’ temperatures every three hours. “If I did not feel that the guests and my staff were perfectly safe I wouldn’t have done this,” said Watzke. While far from its peak of the late 1950s, when the US had over 4,000, drive-ins have seen a resurgence in recent years. Despite the easy accessibility of at-home streaming services, today there are still about 305 around the country. Last weekend there were approximately 25 drive-ins open across the US, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association (UDITOA), a rise of around five on the previous weekend. They expect that number to continue to grow each week. Meanwhile, most of America’s 5,548 indoor cinemas remain closed. The National Association of Theatre Owners said depending on conditions and guidance from officials, most indoor theatres are “tentatively aiming” to open in late June or early July – in time for the release of the Christopher Nolan film Tenet. Of those that are open, drive-ins are already seeing a boost following coronavirus, which they expect to last beyond the immediate crisis, as people seek socially distanced entertainment. As well as showing films, drive-in owners are also preparing to fill a new role in a post-pandemic world by hosting church services, graduations, live shows and meetings. Josh Frank, owner of Blue Starlite, a mini urban drive-in concept with two theatres in Texas, said he expects drive-ins will see a “big spike” in ticket sales in the next two to three months. He added: “Outdoor drive-in movie experiences are going to be incredibly sought after – at least for the next year or two – even when things do start to reopen because it is simply the safest, most comfortable way of getting out to see a movie, a live show or anything.” Tickets for his theatre in Round Rock, which is currently open, have been selling out “within minutes” and he’s been adding additional shows. He plans to reopen his Austin theatre in May. His cinemas usually show classic movies, but he is now also showing independent arthouse films and put on a South by Southwest short film showcase after the festival was cancelled. He has also been approached about staging live comedians. Auto Drive In, a family-run business in Greenwood, was declared “essential” after South Carolina’s stay-at-home order was put in place. Carolyn McCutcheon said tearful parents thank them for staying open and she considers the three-screen drive-in, which was built in 1945, a “community service”. “They decided we were an essential business because family had to have a place that they can go for entertainment. They have to be able to de-stress.” The venue, which runs dinner and cinema nights on Fridays and Saturdays and now hosts “drive-in church” on Sundays, has installed additional safety measures. McCutcheon, who thinks more drive-ins should be allowed to open, said most people stay in their cars with the windows closed. “You can work with the system and have it the way they want it because everyone’s so well-trained,” she said. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has expressed sympathy for drive-in theatres, saying at a recent press conference: “Where is the public safety issue? It’s a drive-in theatre. You’re in the car with the same people.” But under official state policy they remain non-essential and therefore currently barred from reopening. Once they are allowed to reopen, Beth Wilson, owner of Warwick Drive-In in New York, is expecting them to have a “very good season” during which she also hopes to host school graduations. John Stefanopoulos, of Four Brothers Drive In, also in New York, said before the cinema was forced to close for the shutdown, business was “almost double what it was the previous pre-season opening”. John Vincent, UDITOA president and owner of Wellfleet Drive-In on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, said with their “built-in social distancing” he expects drive-ins will be among the first activities available when stay-at-home orders are lifted. He added: “We’re eager to lead the way and it will most likely happen that drive-ins lead the recovery in terms of the theatre industry, but we are hoping that the whole industry can come up as rapidly and safely as possible.” But he said without many of the indoor theatres, they are not going to be able to access first-run movies. “We can only go so far with retro movies. We really do need a strong, robust-as-can-be theatrical business in order to survive.”"
"One of the most surprising reveals of last October’s unprecedented Netflix data dump was the astounding popularity of cheap psycho-thriller Secret Obsession. While the streamer proudly touted new films from Alfonso Cuarón, Paul Greengrass and the Coens in the same period, it was a no-star, dim-plotted slab of schlock that netted more viewers, with an estimated 40m households eager to find out just how secret that obsession really was. Modelled after a Lifetime TV movie (with a Lifetime TV director at the helm), it was an important victory for Netflix because it revealed a substantial audience for tiny-budgeted thrillers with generic titles, a bracket they could easily fill at little expense. Which brings us to Dangerous Lies, a comically titled new thriller from the director of Fatal Lessons, Dangerous Heart and It’s Christmas, Carol!, a similarly cheap yet not unenjoyable Friday night diversion. Originally called Windfall, the patchwork plot follows a young couple living on the breadline, or what a film such as this thinks is the breadline (their “lousy” apartment is enviably spacious). In the first scene, we see Katie (Riverdale’s Camila Mendes) and Adam (The Boys’ Jessie T Usher) stumbling across an aborted robbery at the diner where she works. Adam shoots and kills the assailant and four months later, they’re dealing with the aftermath. Katie is now working as a carer for Leonard (Elliot Gould), whose loneliness has made her an important part of his life. When he suddenly dies and the couple find a large stash of money in his house, they find themselves telling some … DANGEROUS LIES! If anything, that awful title helps to fill us in on exactly what to expect here, despite how generic it might be. This is the sort of low-rent, trope-filled thriller that used to exist on the bottom shelf of a video store, aiming for undemanding customers whose first, second and third choices were all rented out for the night. Taken as such, it’s perfectly passable, a solidly made time-waster that drip-feeds its reveals with enough skill to keep us onboard, even as we sigh and rage at the characters for acting in increasingly dopey ways. It’s one of those films where smart people do stupid things and the script, from Hallmark channel regular David Golden (whose credits include Finding Father Christmas, Engaging Father Christmas and Marrying Father Christmas), stretches credulity so far that the film frequently threatens to buckle under the weight of its characters’ terrible choices. It’s pacy enough to secure at least our divided attention, competently trotting along in the background revealing surprises that aren’t really that surprising, like a pulpy, well-worn airplane novel that you guiltily devour in a day. You’ll be wrapped up in the moment before poking through its many many holes seconds later. Mendes and Usher make for a charismatic pairing, there’s some silly snarling from The OC’s Cam Gigandet as a mysterious realtor, some concerned lawyering from Gotham’s Jamie Chung and some embittered detecting from Dawson’s Creek’s Sasha Alexander, a low-paid parade of “Oh that one from that thing” actors (strangely the weakest link is a frankly bored Gould, barely phoning it in). The familiarity of the title, the premise and the cast will all help to thrust it to big numbers, I imagine, and I’m sure there are plenty of others like this on the way: clumsily titled, scrappily written and easily consumed. I just wish those lies had been a bit more dangerous …"
"A performance of few words but immense physical eloquence by Julia Garner anchors this impressively chilling #MeToo-era drama about workplace harassment and abuse. Following a day in the life of a young woman with dreams of making her mark in the film and television industry, it’s a sobering portrait of a dirty little secret that was brought into the news spotlight by the Harvey Weinstein scandal. All the more powerful for its understated tone, this low-key piece packs a hefty punch as it exposes the web of silence that enabled a very modern horror story. Garner (who won an Emmy for her work on TV’s Ozark) is Jane, a high-achieving college graduate who finds herself on the bottom rung of the ladder as a junior assistant to an unnamed entertainment mogul in New York. The appointment may hold promises of great opportunities ahead, but for now it’s fairly soul destroying. An opening sequence, played out to the lonely strains of Tamar-kali’s sparse score, finds Jane being driven to the office before dawn, turning on the lights above her colleagues’ desks – first in, last out. Her tasks are menial yet weirdly demanding: making coffee, changing the paper in the photocopier, ordering lunch, and arranging travel and accommodation for an ever-changing roster of offhand executives and needy clients. When her boss is out of the office Jane discreetly cleans his lair, sweeping powdered detritus from his desk, removing used syringes from his waste bin, picking suspiciously abandoned earrings out of the carpet, even scrubbing stains off the couch – a subject of ribald office banter. It’s clear from the outset that he’s a grotesque philanderer (and worse), leaving Jane to field increasingly irate calls from his wife (“I’m not going to lie for him”), then getting yelled at down the phone for “interfering” in his “personal affairs”. During the course of a single day in which she does nothing but pander to his needs, we watch Jane write two separate apologetic emails, both of which include the humiliating assurance that she will not “let you down again”. The demoralising effect of such Kafkaesque torment is, of course, entirely deliberate, deployed with practised ease to wrongfoot and disorientate. While the sight of Jane being yelled at on the phone may be distressing, even more sinister is the email that follows, assuring her that she’s being treated harshly because she’s “good”, but could be “great”. Later, when a driver tells Jane that her boss thinks she’s “smart”, this downtrodden assistant is almost pathetically grateful for the secondhand compliment. Crucially, both the abuse and the praise are forms of attack, working in tandem to undermine Jane’s self-confidence, ensuring that she remains in her place, eager to please and placate. Originally envisaged as a work of “scripted nonfiction”, this insightful film by Kitty Green (who made the documentaries Ukraine Is Not a Brothel and Casting JonBenet) mutated into a drama inspired by the real-life stories of women working in the film and TV industry. The result may be fiction, but everything about it rings true, from the slight shabbiness of the office, which has no hint of old-school movie glamour, to the day-to-day bullying practised by Jane’s workmates, who know that this is what’s needed to succeed. Within this toxic ecosystem, no one is interested in Jane’s tentatively voiced concerns for a vulnerable young girl who’s just been flown in from Boise, Idaho, and who seems primed to become her predatory boss’s next victim. In a scene of skin-crawling smarminess, Jane’s tentative complaints are sideswiped by the slimy HR exec Wilcock (Matthew Macfadyen), who implies that she’s motivated by jealousy and hysteria but offhandedly reassures Jane that she’s safe because “you’re not his type”. Brilliantly, Green opts to keep the monster at the centre of this labyrinth off screen, the presence of Jane’s faceless boss registered mainly by the sound of his laughter and screams seeping through closed doors and down telephone lines. It’s an astute choice that lends a universality to this unseen spectre, focusing our attention instead on the trickle-down toxicity of his regime, enabling his crimes, silencing his enemies, turning his underlings into de facto accomplices. Astutely, Green shows us how the boss’s behavioural mantle has been adopted by everyone in this workplace, creating a culture in which covert aggression and harassment are just business as usual. It’s a credit to Garner that, as a character who effectively has no voice, she manages to say so much about Jane’s predicament through posture, pose and gesture; the way she seems constantly uneasy in her office chair; the fleeting glimpse of alarm in her eyes at the sound of a ringing phone; the slump of exhausted defeat that accompanies her lonely late-night sandwich. The weight of the world is on her shoulders, and thanks to Garner’s nuanced performance and Green’s skilful direction, we feel it upon ours too."
"‘What about the Oscars?” might not be the question at the top of your mind as you consider the manifold uncertainties raised by the coronavirus pandemic. A Hollywood awards ceremony scheduled for the end of February 2021, one might think, has fewer immediate concerns than most cultural institutions do right now. Yet panic has been rising within the Academy: the show itself may go on, but with cinemas closed for the foreseeable future and dozens of major titles either rescheduling or indefinitely delaying their release dates, will it have have enough standout films to celebrate? For some weeks now, the joke around the industry has been that Leigh Whannell’s hit psychothriller The Invisible Man – one of the few popular and critical successes to be released in the year’s early months – may as well collect its gongs now. But a crucial rule change announced on Tuesday by Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and president David Rubin has ensured that it will face some competition after all, even if its rivals never see the inside of a cinema. For the first (and, they claim, only) time, the Oscars are lifting anti-streaming rules, granting eligibility to “films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are initially made available on a commercial streaming or VOD service” – as long as they’re put on a members-only streaming site within 60 days of their digital release.  It’s a change that ensures a film such as Eliza Hittman’s acclaimed, festival-feted abortion drama Never Rarely Sometimes Always still has a shot at Oscar glory. Having had its scheduled cinema release scrapped by the lockdown in March, the film’s distributors opted to release it straight to VOD: a switch that in other years would have rendered it ineligible because the Academy required films under consideration to have a one-week theatrical run in Los Angeles county. It’s a condition that famously forced Netflix to release prestige Oscar hopefuls including Roma and The Irishman in cinemas, though Academy members have shown resistance to their streaming overlords. Vocally led by such champions of the theatrical experience as Steven Spielberg, anti-Netflix sentiment in their ranks was thought to be a significant factor in Roma’s contentious best picture loss last year, not to mention The Irishman’s zero-for-10 wipeout at this year’s ceremony. Now more conservative voters will have to adapt and accept online releases as, to haul out a ubiquitous phrase these days, a new normal. Even when cinemas do reopen, the Academy will have to adjust its restrictions. With the pileup of postponed films likely to exceed screen availability, Oscar-qualifying releases will need to be extended to include cities other than Los Angeles. Hudson and Rubin were quick to stress that the new streaming rule is a one-time-only change, made to accommodate the extraordinary circumstances of Covid-19. Still, at a time when the future of the cinema-release model is in doubt – with Universal having bluntly announced that the premium-VOD release approach it took with Trolls: World Tour will continue to be its strategy when cinemas reopen – many in the industry are wondering if this is a genie the Academy can put back in the bottle. For now, voters can cling to some sense of tradition. The stipulation that films under consideration must have had a previously planned theatrical release still eliminates direct-to-Netflix fodder such as, say, To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You from contention. It raises more of a question mark in the case of, say, the buzzy Hugh Jackman film Bad Education, which premiered as a theatrical feature at Toronto last year but was repurposed for TV when it was acquired by HBO. That renders it ineligible for the Oscars even under the Academy’s new rule, but the distinction is now a nominal one: surely it’s only a matter of time before younger members ask what a theatrical release even means any more. As it stands, it took a global pandemic to finally accelerate a conversation that has been pressing on the Oscars for years."
"News last week that Woody Allen’s latest, the Amazon-disowned A Rainy Day in New York, was the world’s number one film at the box office spread fast, mainly because of its inherent absurdity. Allen, a figure associated more with critical acclaim than commercial success, is currently outgrossing Pixar’s Onward with a film that might never see a US release, a bizarro turn of events that felt indicative of what’s become a very surreal year in film. The overwhelming majority of global cinemas remain closed due to the ongoing pandemic and so Allen’s blockbusting triumph was the result of having just opened in South Korea, a country that’s far ahead in the knotty process of restarting its economy. Without real box office numbers to analyse, we’ve been forced to look elsewhere to find out what films people are watching and with its unparalleled dominance in the world of streaming, the best place to look is of course Netflix. While the platform still refrains from any regular form of data-sharing, it drops the odd humblebrag when something hits big and has also implemented a daily top 10 feature which allows us to at least see what shows and films are the most watched even if we don’t know how many people are watching. While the list is often predictably led by the streamer’s latest high-profile original (in large part a result of it receiving the most aggressive on-site promotion), what’s become far more interesting to observe is the number of forgotten B-movies that have been nestling alongside, granted a second life for an audience arguably far larger than they’ve ever had before. In recent weeks, the US top 10 has included teen horror House at the End of the Street, action thrillers Sleepless and Den of Thieves, fact-based drama Soul Surfer, Single White Female rip-off The Roommate and sci-fi adventure Lockout. Each of these films shares a number of characteristics: a recognisable star lead, a wide theatrical release and a middling or underwhelming performance at the box office. So they land on Netflix and are met with a vague awareness of the film but with a stronger familiarity attached to the actors propping them up, the kind of combination that time and again has led to rental success in the past. Take 2017 for example. What was the most rented title of the year? Wonder Woman? Rogue One? Thor: Ragnarok? Nope, it was the Ben Affleck thriller The Accountant, a film that did solid business theatrically but blew up at home, consumers perhaps waiting for the most fitting price point for a film that didn’t demand the big-screen experience. With Netflix, the psychology of what to watch is obviously very different, with no cost attached to each individual film, but with so much choice and with it being just one of many widely used services, strong viewership for every new addition is by no means a guarantee (higher-profile recent adds to US Netflix, including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, District 9, Back to the Future, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Artist, all failed to make a showing in the chart). What’s revealing is to then see what does cause people to click en masse and how a mostly forgotten film that might be part of a cheap bulk acquisition can gain a new fanbase. An early sign of this came in 2015 when the Netflix arrival of A Very Brady Sequel led to an unusual viral afterlife for a comedy released almost 20 years earlier. The film, a well-received, tongue-in-cheek sequel to an update of the earnest family TV show, made less then $22m at the US box office leading to the third film heading straight to the small screen. Its cultural impact was minimal but within weeks of landing on Netflix two decades later, it was responsible for a flurry of memes from an audience who were most likely not born when it came out (Sure, Jan remains in rotation now). We haven’t seen quite the same social media explosion just yet for any of the titles mentioned but without the standard May release schedule in place, a thirst for the new is stronger than ever. So now, rather than rushing to see Fast & Furious 9 or Black Widow, millions of Americans are instead watching House at the End of the Street, a poorly reviewed 2012 thriller starring a pre-Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence. Shot in 2010 and then shelved for two years, the film eventually did average business on release but was promptly forgotten about as Lawrence’s star continued to ascend. But renewed interest (it’s been in the US top 10 since being added to Netflix on 7 May and trended on Twitter soon after) has led to film sites, eager for content, to post a deluge of clickbait pieces from Looper’s The ending of House at the End of the Street explained to Screen Rant’s House At The End Of The Street 2: Will It Happen? (spoiler: it won’t). The Jamie Foxx thriller Sleepless has seen a similar trajectory, lingering in the most watched for weeks after making only $20m in the US on release in 2017 (see: We Got This Covered’s An Underrated Jamie Foxx Thriller Has Been Surprisingly Popular On Netflix). What’s encouraging for Netflix is that these successes have emerged from smaller companies, rather than big studios. The reason this matters right now is that the increasingly fractured nature of streaming means that individual studios are taking back their own movies for their own platforms. Pre-existing deals mean this hasn’t all happened automatically but soon, Disney+ will house all Disney films and some family-friendly Fox titles, Hulu will have other Fox movies including Searchlight, Peacock will take Universal films, HBO Max will have Warner and New Line titles and CBS All Access will take Paramount catalogue. It’s one of the reasons Netflix has been acquiring and producing so many “original” films to stock up, to fill up their homepage with enough reasons to subscribe before the great drought begins. This surge of clicks for films briefly leased from less prestigious companies, those unlikely to launch their own platforms, not only suggests to Netflix that there’s life outside of the big studios but also helps them to figure out the formula for their own future original films. The platform’s two biggest success stories of late – Spenser Confidential, starring Mark Wahlberg, and Extraction, starring Chris Hemsworth (now, allegedly, Netflix’s biggest two film premieres ever) – fall in line with the aforementioned B-movie hits: reviews were tepid and plotting was simple but both were anchored by a recognisable star and millions were happy to press play without further expense. Given the muted box office clout of both actors outside of franchise fare (Wahlberg stumbled with Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day and Mile 22 while Hemsworth couldn’t turn Bad Times at El Royale or In the Heart of the Sea into hits), it’s unlikely these films would have made a dent theatrically yet scored over 85 million and 90 million online viewers apiece. Netflix has responded to the success by giving the green light to an Extraction sequel, another Wahlberg action film described as a “blue-collar 007” and an action-heavy franchise-starter for another fallen star, Jessica Alba. Rather than wait for B-movies to receive a second life years after a big-screen release, Netflix is cutting out the middle man."
"Swedish film-maker Anders Banke has directed an unimaginative, stolidly old-fashioned second world war drama about a fictional US-British mission to nab a Polish scientist from under the noses of the Nazis. It’s soullessly performed – as if the actors have been instructed to play it in manly, soldierly fashion, straight-backed, not a quiver of feeling – and there are a couple of howlingly bogus scenes. The firefight skirmishes in frozen snowy forests, however, are nicely done. Set in 1943, it opens with a conventional bit of sparring between British and American top brass over whose soldiers are the toughest. The Yanks want the Polish scientist and they want him yesterday, so they put their best man in charge of the mission, decorated marine corps Major Kaminski (Gossip Girl’s Ed Westwick, unblinkingly stiff). Kaminski leads a specialist team of British soldiers into Poland disguised as peasants (though apparently dressed for a GQ fashion shoot in sheepskin coats and cashmere rollnecks). They have one day to rescue the scientist (Pawel Delag), and the plan is to intercept a convoy taking him to a cabin in the woods. Naturally, things go wrong, but Kaminski, who’s half-Polish and speaks the language, hooks up with partisans from a nearby village. (The script helpfully provides a definition: “Partisans, or armed civilians, whatever you want to call them!”) The Nazis are in pursuit and the Russians are not far behind. But there’s time in the partisans’ secret hideout for the scientist to deliver a lecture on atomic weapons research, and for a spot of romance between one of the soldiers and a beautiful resistance fighter. The story has the makings of a gripping adventure, but something is lacking."
"Film-makers like it when critics use the word “restrained” to describe their work because it implies an intellectual rigour mostly absent in the excessive spectacles of mainstream cinema. Audiences who are looking for something more substantial like it too, for the same reasons. So for what it’s worth, let me say this right off the bat: director Ben Lawrence’s Sydney-set drama Hearts and Bones, which revolves around the relationship between a war photographer and a South Sudanese refugee, is certainly restrained. It is a human-oriented drama that builds a thoughtful and contemplative space, empathising with characters grappling with difficult circumstances outside the common experience. It is also the kind of drama you sometimes want to grab and shake to life. Get the lens a little dirty; knock the camera around a bit; bring a sense of urgency to the edit; get the script (by Lawrence and Beatrix Christian) to draw bold conclusions to the ethical questions it raises rather than pussyfoot around with vague ruminative responses. One thing you never want to mess with is the performances. The protagonist is played by Hugo Weaving, an actor who expresses pathos as if it were a weight constantly pulling him down. The most intense moments in Weaving’s performances, in this film and more generally speaking, tend to occur when he feigns losing control; when the performer’s trademark stoicism gives away to a volcanic inner force. Weaving plays Dan Fisher, a famous photographer who suffers panic attacks in increasing frequency. This is partly to do with angst concerning his pregnant partner Josie – played by an affecting Hayley McElhinney, whose performance balances assurance with tenderness. The nature of Dan’s trepidation towards their impending baby is best left for the film to disclose. Mostly, however, his PTSD-like panic attacks connect to terrible things he has seen during wartime, one of which we witness in the film’s opening moments. That moment, which involves Dan prioritising the duties of being a photographer over intervening in a dangerous situation and potentially saving a life, casts a pall that hangs over the rest of the film. Yet it remains unexplored: just left there, hanging, as a way to make the point that the protagonist Has Seen Things. By the end of it we have no idea whether Dan subscribes to the bogus, outdated idea that a professional photographer (or documentarian) should never interact with the environment around them, but only capture it. That used to be a badge of honour certain photographers wore, as if capturing suffering were a more noble pursuit than helping another human in front of them. Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, Dan is approached by a South Sudanese cab driver, Sebastian (Andrew Luri), who arrives on his door with a special request: that Dan photograph an African community choir he belongs to. My first thought was that this would lead to the broken Dan becoming whole again by belting out a few uplifting songs with the choristers. But Sebastian has an ulterior motive: he doesn’t want Dan to exhibit photographs of a massacre at the village where he lived 15 years ago. He has his own reasons for this, which are explored over the course of the running time and are points of tension between the two characters. Most of the drama involves dealing with deep-seated emotional wounds and growing tensions between the two men. Newcomer Andrew Luri is terrific opposite Weaving, more than holding his own against the seasoned veteran. Luri plays Sebastian as a determined but deeply conflicted man whose solutions often exacerbate his problems. Every once in a while he responds to a stressful situation with violence, creating a sense of untrustworthiness that agitates an otherwise pleasant demeanour. At times you want to give him a hug; at times you want to stay well clear of him. The tone, temperament and pacing of Hearts and Bones is certainly consistent, though visually there is nothing particularly rich or cinematic about it. Lawrence and his cinematographer Hugh Miller conjured a more interesting, and much moodier look in the director’s previous film, Ghosthunter, an atmospheric documentary investigating a Sydney security guard who claims to chase spirits in his spare time. Ghosthunter similarly explores themes of long-standing trauma, and the inability for any of us to escape our past. Both of Lawrence’s films ruminate on one of the greatest lines uttered so far in 21st century cinema, spoken by, of all people, the protagonist of the 2009 family film Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: “You can’t run away from your own feet.” It took deep thought to come up with a line like that, and terrific efficiency to distill such profound sentiments into so few words. Hearts and Bones makes profound statements also but is not a work of narrative economy, that’s for sure. Dramatically, it has a vague, lingering quality, at times meditative (another critic-deployed word film-makers tend to like) and sometimes a little inert. On the plus side, the performances are very strong and have plenty of space to breathe. The tone is measured, contemplative and, yes, restrained."
"The coronavirus pandemic has cost Walt Disney $1.4bn in the last three months as the virus shut down its theme parks around the world and halted film and TV productions, the company announced on Tuesday. The world’s largest media company said its operating income for the three months ending 28 March had fallen 37% to $2.4bn after it was forced to close parks, cancel cruises and delay future productions. Disney felt the impact of the pandemic earlier than many US companies. It closed its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January and its outpost in Japan in February before closing resorts in the US and Europe a month later. The company estimates it lost $1bn over the three months in its parks, experiences and products segment, mostly due to revenue lost because of closures. Disney+, the company’s new streaming service, however, has benefitted from the global quarantines imposed to slow the virus. Disney+ had 33.5 million paid subscribers by the end of March and passed the 50 million mark in April as more people stayed home and signed up. On a call with financial analysts, the chief executive, Bob Chapek, said the company is “seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some sense of normalcy in China” and would reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on 11 May with a phased approach. Chapek said Disney would put new procedures in place at its parks once they reopen, including limiting guest capacity, temperature checks and masks. Disney’s stock hit at an all-time high before the pandemic. In 2019, a record seven Disney movies brought in more than $1bn each including Avengers: Endgame, Frozen II and The Lion King. Its shares fell 2% in after-hours trading."
"I’m in north London with my husband and 12-year-old twins. The twins rule the roost. It’s hard work, bloody home-schooling. The amount of printer ink I’ve gone through! I have managed to write a whole new movie script in lockdown, which I’m thrilled about. I feel too slovenly to watch TV in the daytime, so I still haven’t caught up on all the amazing series I’ve recorded, including Killing Eve and Homeland. After dinner, it’s whatever the kids want to watch. One of our favourite shows is Pen15, although we have to talk loudly through the inappropriate bits. It’s about the pains of high school for two grown women who play themselves acting 13 with a cast of 13-year-old kids, and it’s one of the funniest shows on TV. The kids also love Fresh Off the Boat, so we’re all rocking the old-school hip-hop vibe, and a go-to is always Modern Family. We’re trying to educate our kids, so on the weekends we’ve been sitting down with some classic movies. We watched Car Wash and I’ve now realised that the film’s ensemble cast, comedy, social comment and blinding soundtrack have inspired every movie I’ve made. We’ve loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Queen & Slim. We loved Knives Out, which gave our son a taste for thrillers, so he’s been watching Money Heist. I tried to watch an episode but it made me too anxious. I was like, “I can’t cope with this” and switched over to The A Word but my son said it was too boring because he was too souped up from playing Call of Duty and watching Money Heist. So now he’s banned from gaming for a bit. My daughter loves Bring It On and Pitch Perfect. We watch The Greatest Showman over again. We love a good musical. When the kids have gone to bed, I like to wind down with a good music documentary on Sky Arts or BBC Four whilst my husband is asleep on the sofa. I loved the stories of the Jam and the Hollies. My husband then gets up early to watch all the basketball docs on Netflix. He cried during the Michael Jordan series The Last Dance. Lionsgate is showing a live stream of Bend It Like Beckham tomorrow. I’ll be commentating on Instagram Live. It really hasn’t dated, apart from David Beckham having become a middle-aged family man. I’ve heard that the US team, the Women’s World Cup champions, all got into soccer after watching the film. I’ve been told that the England women’s squad know the dialogue by heart. Whenever it’s on, people like to tweet along, one of the most popular lines being: “Get your lesbian feet out of my shoes.”"
"This gentle, animated pirate adventure from the popular Norwegian franchise Captain Sabertooth is pitched at very young children, but even they may find it a little tame. Sabertooth is a weirdly bland baddie. A pirate in the debonair mode with a bouffanty Louis XIV wig and fine moustaches, he’s unfunny, undastardly, with not so much as a catchphrase to distinguish him. And there’s not much here for adults either, just a smattering of self-aware gags. (Spot the Shoreditchy, man-bunned pirate with a luxurious beard and designer tats.) The film is set in the Marmalades, an exotic archipelago terrorised by a band of scurvy ruffians led by Captain Sabertooth (perfunctorily voiced by Kyrre Haugen Sydness). Scheming to get his hands on a legendary magic diamond, Sabertooth kidnaps a young boy, Pinky (Tighe Wardell), whom he mistakenly believes nabbed the loot. Actually, the thief is another kid, half-starved barefoot orphan named Marco (Phonsie Wardell), who looks spookily similar to Pinky. Another pair of villains is also in pursuit: Maga Khan, the barrel-chested lord of one of the islands, and his heavily botoxed wife, Sirima (Mary Murray). The plot proceeds on autopilot, though a couple of the characters are nicely done: the pirate ship’s chef is a temperamental Frenchman doing his best with store-cupboard supplies and the occasional rodent he whacks with his broom. In normal times, Captain Sabertooth is the kind of film that gets slipped out during half-term when parents tend to be at their least fussy and most desperate. Now that cinemas are shut and half-term is a fuzzy nostalgic memory, adults might prefer to download Aardman’s fun, zingy The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists for an at-home treat, or Ray Harryhausen’s The 7th Voyage of Sinbad for something more swashbuckling."
"Name: Behind-the-scenes disasters. Age: Eternal. As old as art itself. Prehistoric man (and, of course, woman) probably came to blows about what colour the bison on the cave walls should be.Anything more recent? There’s Gladiator, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary. Ah, what a film. Wasn’t Russell Crowe wonderful? Indeed. But it was also one of those movies where the off-camera battles were almost as bloody as the on-camera ones.The script? Indeed, or rather the lack of one. Three different writers worked on it and it was still being rewritten during filming. Crowe reportedly had to improvise lines as he went along. “At my signal, unleash hell!” Yes, that was one of his. And hell was unleashed at times. “We were dodging bullets on a daily basis,” he told Variety about his experience on set. Oliver Reed’s death halfway through filming can’t have helped. You really are a fan. Reed, who was playing gladiator trainer Proximo, died of a heart attack after challenging a group of sailors to a drinking contest. He won and then collapsed. His role had to be completed by a digital body double. Yet the film was a huge success. Second highest grossing film of 2000 after Mission: Impossible 2. Oscars for best film and best actor for Crowe (though not best director for Ridley Scott). Singlehandedly reawakened Hollywood’s interest in swords-and-sandals epics. Who says creative tension is a bad thing? Yes, there are lots of examples in cinema history of hellish movie-making producing heavenly results. Gone with the Wind is a prime example. A two-year delay in filming, numerous writers and three different directors. The result? An all-time Oscar-garlanded money-spinner. Frankly, my dear ... And then there was The Wizard of Oz. A dozen writers, often competing with each other, along with four different directors, hired and fired at will. The original Tin Man ended up in hospital after being poisoned by his aluminium powder makeup and had to be replaced. Then there was the Wicked Witch of the West, who caught fire while making a dramatic, smoke-filled exit from Munchkinland. Health and safety was evidently not the watchword in cinema’s golden age. Actors always have to suffer for their art. Poor Kate Winslet has said she got hypothermia while filming Titanic. Was it worth it? Worldwide earnings for the film of $2 billion say it was. Not to be confused with: Heaven’s Gate, which had an infamously troubled birth and was a box-office catastrophe. Do say: “Take 367.” Don’t say: “It’s a wrap.”"
"Bring out your tiniest violins: in a normal year I’d be writing this column from the balmy French Riviera, with a glass of rosé at my side, amid the annual Cannes film festival. That, of course, has all been called off. For the first time since the second world war – not counting the time things shut down halfway through amid the May ’68 movement – the festival has admitted no Cannes do. A year without Cannes leaves the arthouse release schedule a bit disoriented: traditionally, UK distributors pick over the festival’s highlights for the next year and beyond. (At Curzon Home Cinema, for example, you can currently stream Portrait of a Lady on Fire and The Whistlers, both plucked from last year’s Cannes competition.) Through the miracle of streaming, however, you can curate your own festival of past Palmes d’Or to treasure. Cannes’s top prize, like any film award, hasn’t always got it right – Fahrenheit 9/11 felt a dated victor in 2004 the second it was announced, while one might query why Bille August won twice and Tarkovsky not at all – but a trawl through the Palme d’Or’s history still makes for a pretty invigorating world cinema primer. The official record has the first ever winner of Cannes’s top prize as Union Pacific (streamable on Chili), the kind of Hollywood blockbuster that would never win today, though it comes with a heavy asterisk. Cecil B DeMille’s grand-scale western, one of his freshest and liveliest epics, was awarded the prize retrospectively in 2002, to honour what was to be the inaugural 1939 festival, until war pushed it back. The first actual festival took place in 1946, where the top honour was split between 11 films, cast-iron classics Brief Encounter (Amazon) and Rome, Open City (BFI Player) among them. A stickler for technicalities, however, would say the first Palme d’Or – under that name, as opposed to the Grand Prix du Festival – wasn’t awarded until 1955. It went to Marty (iTunes), a tender, empathetic, working-class Bronx romance that was bracing in its day for bringing TV-scale storytelling to cinemas, and has aged rather gracefully. (For years, it was the only film to win both the Palme and the best picture Oscar – until Parasite, of course, which will be available to stream next month.) In 1959, Black Orpheus (Amazon Prime) set a more exotic Palme template. Marcel Camus’s bossa nova-laden relocation of the Orpheus and Eurydice legend to the favelas of Brazil still sways with seductive, sensual energy. European winners dominated the 1960s, with Luchino Visconti’s lavish, wholly enveloping 19th-century epic The Leopard typical of the canon minted by the festival in that era. (It’s available on iTunes in the director’s 185-minute version, with the full 205-minute whack harder to find online.) Ditto Buñuel’s severe, incendiary Viridiana (Google Play); the luxuriant, hedonist sprawl of Fellini’s La Dolce Vita (Amazon Prime); or Antonioni’s amorphous, dreamy, still mysterious Blow-Up. Here, Cannes established itself as the spiritual home of surname-only auteurs. New British cinema got a look-in too. Lindsay Anderson’s 1968 schoolboy-insurrection study If... (Amazon Prime) still feels like a youthful revolution, while in 1971, Joseph Losey’s The Go-Between (currently on Mubi) brought angular modernism to the costume drama. New Hollywood surged back with Palme d’Or victories for the swaggering likes of Altman, Scorsese and Coppola. The latter’s ingenious paranoia puzzle The Conversation (1974) is just about to expire on the BBC iPlayer, or it’s freely available to Now TV subscribers. Asian cinema, largely left out for decades, made its presence felt in the 1980s with wins for Kagemusha (Chili), Kurosawa’s majestic oil painting of a jidaigeki epic, and The Ballad of Narayama (Amazon), Shohei Imamura’s underseen, harshly exquisite study of rural senicide. My own favourite Palme winner remains Paris, Texas (1984; BFI Player), Wim Wenders’s bluesy, bittersweet slab of lonesome Americana. Five years later, a Wenders-led jury would herald a new indie era by bestowing the prize on Steven Soderbergh’s brisk, acidic relationship tangle sex, lies and videotape (Amazon). History was made in 1993 by Jane Campion’s luminous, feminist-tilted erotic drama The Piano (iTunes), the first female-directed film to take the Palme. It remains the only one, as the prize’s last quarter-century has passed through such high points as Abbas Kiarostami’s minimalist but emotionally torrential The Taste of Cherry (Chili); Cristian Mungiu’s stark, path-breaking 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (Curzon Home Cinema); and, proving that Cannes juries very occasionally have a sense of humour, Ruben Östlund’s puckish, shaggy-dog art satire The Square (Curzon again). What direction would 2020’s Spike Lee-headed jury have taken? We’ll have to wait until next year to find out. The Truth (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) Out on all media following its Curzon Home Cinema release, Hirokazu Kore-eda’s unexpected swerve into French arthouse drama is airy and amusing. You can feel the film-maker isn’t entirely in his element, though an imperious Catherine Deneuve sure is. Rebel in the Rye (Movie Partnership, 12) JD Salinger famously prevented film-makers from getting their mitts on his work. One can’t imagine he’d have welcomed this diverting, well-dressed but squarely conventional biopic, coming to VOD three years after its Sundance premiere. The Flavour of Green Tea Over Rice (BFI, U) The title’s irresistible and the film lives up to it. Yasujirō Ozu’s delicate, piercing 1952 marital study never found the broad critical following of his Tokyo Story, made a year later, but its rewards are rich, and this 4K restoration captures them well. Destry Rides Again (Sony, PG) You couldn’t ask for more blithe, light lockdown viewing than this latest addition to the Criterion Collection: a 1939 comic western that canters along without a care, carried by the unlikely but sparky star chemistry of Marlene Dietrich and Jimmy Stewart."
"Disney has reopened its Shanghai theme park with new physical distancing rules preventing Mickey Mouse from posing with customers, more than three months after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to close. Visitors must wear face masks, undergo temperature checks on arrival and be given timed entry slots in a much changed theme park experience. Tickets for the reopening on Monday went on sale on Friday and sold out within minutes. Visitor numbers are limited to 30% of the park’s 80,000 usual capacity. Only visitors with a green rating on China’s health QR code app will be allowed through the gates, further embedding the use of the digital passport-like documents that have allowed some Chinese citizens to move relatively freely, but which have restricted others. Some facilities such as children’s play areas and theatre shows remain closed. No parades or night shows will run either. “Close interaction and close-up photos with characters will be suspended during the initial phase of reopening,” Shanghai Disney Resort said in a statement. Disney closed the Shanghai park on 24 January, before closing other theme parks across the world in March. However, the US entertainment company is eager to reopen facilities and try to make back lost revenues. The Walt Disney Company’s net income fell by 91% in the first three months of the year compared with 2019, as the company revealed a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) cost from the pandemic. The company was heavily exposed to the virus, which forced the cancellation of cruises and the closure of the cinemas playing its blockbuster films – although the timely launch of its new streaming service, Disney+, has cushioned some of the blow. The group also scrapped its dividend, but it drew criticism from Bernie Sanders, the former US Democratic presidential candidate, and Abigail Disney, an heir to the Disney fortune, after it furloughed more than 100,000 employees to save money on salaries, despite retaining large rewards for its leaders. Bob Iger, who moved from chief executive to executive chairman in February, gave up his salary for 2020, but could still receive millions of dollars in performance related incentive payments."
"From Joe Wicks’s high energy PE lessons to Boris Johnson’s “mild symptoms” video tweet to recreating a daily commute in the shower, online video is playing a bigger role in the collective experience during the coronavirus lockdown than ever before, British Film Institute curators have said. Anxious to document a unique moment of history, the BFI has announced details of a “rapid response” plan to collect in its archive the best of those videos. It wants the public to make recommendations, whether it is a film that made them laugh or cry or simply shamed them to stop panic-buying. Will Massa, a contemporary curator at the BFI, said it had been collecting online video for a number of years but the coronavirus crisis and lockdown had brought about a “tidal wave” of important new content. It provides a window into the national psyche like never before, he said. “Even though we are mainly isolated in our own homes there is this sense of digital connectivity that is definitely new with regard to a feeling of nationhood. “Ten years ago we wouldn’t have been experiencing something like this in quite the same way. We certainly wouldn’t have had an insight, in quite the same way, into the public mood.” Choosing and collecting the videos is challenging simply because there is so much of it. “We realised quickly that we wanted to get on top of this not least because online video, in its very nature, can be quite precarious. We’ve all had the experience of seeing a video one week and trying to find it the next.” One of Massa’s favourite films is a campaign video made by the stage director and musician Tom Guthrie to help raise awareness of the plight of freelance musicians. The adaptation of Pete Seeger’s Where Have All the Flowers Gone brought a tear to his eye, he said. “It really says something about the way in which we are able to connect digitally and why this form of moving image is distinct from things that have come before it.” The BFI expects to collect about 100 videos as part of the project, and curators have come up with their own suggestions to kickstart the public campaign. They include: Massa said he was confident future generations would look back and be struck by the sheer talent of people under lockdown. “I have been really impressed with the skills of people. The creativity which has been stimulated is really amazing,” he said."
"My father, David Dent, who has died aged 97, produced 13 feature films in the 1950s giving British actors such as Diana Dors, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Sid James and Petula Clark some of their earliest big-screen roles. He was born Cecil David Abrahams in Glasgow to Arthur Abrahams and his wife, Hettie (nee Lazarus). Arthur was a charismatic and successful travelling film salesman who changed his surname to Dent after the picturesque village of that name in the Yorkshire Dales. The family moved to London when David was two and he attended University College school before going to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1940 to study jurisprudence. After a year of study, during which he won the Winter Williams law scholarship, David was commissioned into the army, eventually joining the 4th Hussars, Winston Churchill’s old regiment. (While producing the BBC documentary series Timewatch in the 1990s, I was astonished to spot my father among a huge crowd of soldiers in a 1943 British Pathé newsreel covering Churchill’s trip to Egypt.) He landed in Italy in April 1944 and saw active service as a tank troop leader as the allies pushed north. Mentioned in dispatches and promoted to captain, he ended the war in Austria. On home leave in September 1945, David found that his Oxford scholarship granted him early demobilisation. He graduated in 1947 and served as a pupil to the barrister and novelist Henry Cecil Leon, author of the successful Brothers in Law series. In 1949, David joined his father and elder brother Stanley in the family business, Adelphi Films, an independent distribution and production company. He produced a diverse variety of British films, ranging from the football comedy The Great Game (1953) and Is Your Honeymoon Really Necessary (1953), both starring Diana Dors, to dramas such as The Crowded Day (1954) and Intimate Relations (1953), whose incestuous undertones gained it an X certificate. He produced Penny Points to Paradise and Let’s Go Crazy (1951), both comedy feature films starring Sellers and Milligan. My Death Is a Mockery (1952), about capital punishment, was withdrawn from circulation after it was said to have inspired the 16-year-old Christopher Craig to murder a policeman. In later life, David ran a fashion publishing business and a commercial property company. He retired in 2007, aged 85. In 1957, David married José Crayson, a television producer; she died in 2015. He is survived by my sisters, Carey and Louisa, and me, and five grandchildren."
"Jaws is not a film about a shark. I knew this before I watched it because, every few months for the best part of two decades, Mark Kermode has reminded me on his Wittertainment radio show. But not until I watched it did I understand the extent to which Jaws is not a film about a shark, and it would still elude me now had I not watched it when I watched it. You can’t come cold to Jaws, but everything you think know is irrelevant once the opening sequence is under way. Set in the ocean around Amity Island to John Williams’ brilliant, horrendous score, it submerges the viewer with an oppressive helplessness that is intensely familiar. Death is imminent, and all we can do is wait. Tone established, we cut to people on the beach, enjoying joy. They remind us that life is both precious and fragile, because we know one of them will soon lose theirs in the course of simply going about their business. The stress is profound, and all we can do is hope for the impossible – that the threat either fades away or swerves off course – until it doesn’t. We see an end that is lonely, protracted and savage, but then see neither body nor grieving relatives, so do not really feel loss, the victim a statistic whose death does not speak to us. We feel relieved that we had no relationship with her and guilt at that relief, before life swiftly resumes. But Martin Brody, the police chief, sees the corpse and, fearing further tragedy, shares his fears with the mayor – a try-hard blow-hard who oozes smarm, privilege and phoney eccentricity. In the way of a man who has never had to take responsibility for his actions, he responds with crass condescension, prioritising profits over people – Independence Day is imminent – and glibness over substance. Jaws is not a film about a shark. So we return to the beach for our next horrendous death, before which a woman wonders when she’ll become “an islander”. “Never!” her councilwoman friend tells her. “You’re not born here.” The cost of this smug, insular exceptionalism – this islander mentality – will soon be measured in blood. The vulnerability of the second victim, a young boy, is even more disquieting than the first, and this time we see the mother who loves him. When she returns shortly afterwards, utterly bereft, we can no longer ignore the reality that death is irreversible and everyone is someone’s something. In desperation, she slaps Brody. Naturally, people are concerned, so a town meeting is called. Brody is asked if he is going to close the beaches. He says he is, only to be overruled by the mayor, whose power and privilege mean he still feels safe. Thus danger you can’t see is abetted by leadership you can see through. Jaws is not a film about a shark. The mayor’s problem is that ingrained within him is a disgust for detail and decency, which is why he was surprised by an attack that was both predicted and planned for. Because he does not care for people not of his type, he refuses to shock people who must be shocked by something shocking, for fear of them being shocked, while those whose job it is to understand the specifics – we might call them experts – become ever angrier. Quickly, those fearing something terrible happening are painted as unpatriotic stiffs, bringing science to a pride fight. As such, though there’s a clear way to avoid aggravation – staying away from the water – people choose not to, unwilling to compromise the freedom that helps them make sense of things. Believing itself to have conquered the world, humanity is used to doing as it pleases, so when that turns out not to be the case it responds with confused belligerence, determined to show an oblivious opponent precisely who is boss. Jaws is not a film about a shark. The mayor’s desire to solve the problem lasts only until the cost becomes apparent. He can’t bring himself to sensibly pay a professional putting himself in harm’s way for the cause, so various chancers seize the chance to make a wedge, killing any old shark and proclaiming an easy victory. Those who know better insist to the contrary but, his already unstoppable arrogance fortified, the mayor encourages islanders to visit the beaches on the Fourth of July, even allowing his own kids to partake, and then, when people stay on the shore, pressurises someone to lead them into the water. A modern-day comparison might be to imagine a disease that can be spread by shaking hands and an exhibitionist prime minister then shaking hands with those suffering from it, at the same time as allowing huge sporting events to proceed and evoking war as an everlasting deposit into a national wank-bank able to cure every ill. Meanwhile, sensible people grow increasingly despondent at the preventable horror soon to be visited on unsuspecting patsies. The constant dread is of who will be next – when will someone we know die? – until finally we see the hideous threat with our own eyes. The reality, though, is that its effect – a severed limb – is far more traumatic, likewise the suffering visited on the children proximate to it. Jaws is not a film about a shark. Now, the mayor has no choice but to act, his realisation fired by his personal proximity to disaster. Consequently, the experience does not change him. He stumps up money for the hunt, but his performance reveals the incompetent invertebrate we already knew him to be. So three men set off to kill the shark – the bounty hunter, the scientist and Brody – and before they do, we see how worried Brody’s wife is. Previously, she had assuaged her feelings with sex and drink, but now the peril is directly upon her, she cannot, which is to say that everyone thinks they understand it until they understand it. Out at sea, booze, singing and camaraderie soon give way to squalor, rancour and claustrophobia, people trapped against their will with death marauding somewhere outside. Eventually, though, they neutralise the killer in a scene of ecstatic, triumphant relief and, victims forgotten, we assume that Amity immediately reverts to the vacuity that underpinned its catastrophe to begin with. Yeah, Jaws really is not a film about a shark."
"With A-listers such as Scarlett Johansson, Will Smith and Steven Spielberg on its books, Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is a fixture of the Hollywood establishment, but its latest client is a little different. On 6 May, Variety revealed that CAA had signed up Miquela, a 19-year-old, Brazilian-American model, pop singer, influencer and self-described “change-seeking robot with the drip”. That’s right: Miquela isn’t an actual human. She is a virtual celeb, created in 2016 by a California tech startup named Brud. But her career is looking pretty real right now. According to Variety, CAA will work with Miquela in areas “including TV, film, and brand strategy and commercial endorsements, raising the prospect of a movie or show featuring the character”. So there’s a tip for all you struggling actors wondering where you have been going wrong: try not existing! From an industry perspective, virtual actors are an enticing prospect. They are literally totally malleable. They will never complain, they are always in prime condition and camera-ready (creepily, Miquela is for ever 19 years old). They will even work through an industry-stalling pandemic without complaint. And their salary demands are competitive. Miquela also brings along a fanbase. She has 2.2 million Instagram followers, she’s duetted with real-life singers, and she has sagas with virtual boyfriends and frenemies (no doubt negotiating their own deals right now). She pushes the right buttons: young, fashionable, fluent in social-media discourse. She is not ambitious, she’s just programmed that way. Is Miquela the vanguard of an army of virtual actors, poised to put human stars out of work? If that is the future, then blame the movies for paving the way with stories such as Her, Ex Machina and, especially, Al Pacino’s forgotten romcom Simone (where his virtual thesp wins the best actress Oscar). We are not there yet, though. For one thing, Miquela is not a genuine AI; she is scripted and voiced by humans, so is effectively an animated character. Nor is she much of an actor. Her face has limited range when it comes to nuance or emotion. Mind you, they said that about Arnold Schwarzenegger once. CAA clearly senses which way the wind is blowing. It knows that being a successful actor is never just about acting. The reason, say, Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson command huge salaries is not because they are so good at inhabiting a role (sorry guys, hate to break it to you). Celebrity is an inextricable factor in the equation, and it’s no longer exclusive to humans. You could argue that virtual actors will never advance the arts or capture essential truths about humanity, but they don’t have to. They just have to fake it. And isn’t that what acting’s all about, anyway? "
"It is highly unlikely that anyone will ever win an Oscar for playing the caped crusader. Somehow, despite the remarkable enduring prominence of the dual role of Bruce Wayne and Gotham’s dark knight, the idea of honouring someone for being very very good indeed at dressing up as a giant bat to scare criminals probably has less chance of finding traction with the Academy than Uwe Boll has of coming out of retirement to win best film. The Joker? Well that’s another matter entirely. But this does not mean that the pressure is off when portraying Batman, far from it. Pull on the cape and cowl, and audiences and critics will still be mulling over your performance three decades later, as Val Kilmer and George Clooney have learned to their cost. There is no such thing as a cheap pay cheque for a forgotten movie in the era of on-demand streaming video, Twitter and the fanboy blogosphere. Fortunately for Robert Pattinson, he has signed on to make his debut in the upcoming The Batman at a very good time indeed. The British actor’s admission to GQ this week that he is not even working out in an effort to bulk up for the role of the gilded superhero might once have drawn mild criticism from knuckleheaded corners of the geek community, but now feeds into a continuing sense that Pattinson is setting himself up as the anti-Batfleck. Where Ben Affleck bulked up to ridiculous proportions to play a gun-toting, meat-headed mega-jock of a caped crusader, it is hoped Pattinson will represent a less showy and ultra-violent return to the dark knight’s traditional role of costumed Gotham detective in Matt Reeves’ film. Pattinson also hinted that he has found his Batman “gap”, the natural space to craft a unique version of the superhero that we won’t have seen before on the big screen. “I kind of like the fact that not only are there very, very, very well-done versions of the character which seem pretty definitive, but I was thinking that there are multiple definitive playings of the character,” he said. “You’ve seen this sort of lighter version, you’ve seen a kind of jaded version, a kind of more animalistic version. And the puzzle of it becomes quite satisfying, to think: Where’s my opening? And also, do I have anything inside me which would work if I could do it? And then also, it’s a legacy part, right? I like that.” While Pattinson may not have been hitting the gym, it sounds like he’s been preparing for the role in other ways, not least by examining quite where some of his predecessors went wrong. “I was watching the making of Batman & Robin the other day. And even then, George Clooney was saying that he was worried about the fact that it’s sort of been done, that a lot of the ground you should cover with the character has been already covered. And that’s in ’96, ’97?” All of which brings us to another former Batman who has been reminiscing recently. If Kilmer wasn’t quite so terrible as Clooney in the famous suit, he certainly runs gorgeous George a close second. (We’ll excuse Affleck for now as his performances are still a little too recent to have received a final and definitive critical appraisal.) Joel Schumacher’s Batman Forever is memorable these days largely for Jim Carrey’s spectacularly overcooked turn as The Riddler, a typical example of the comic’s ultra-manic early forays into Hollywood. Kilmer is utterly anonymous as Batman/Bruce Wayne, seemingly incapable of bringing anything to the role beyond the odd cheeseball one liner. In an interview with the New York Times, the actor talks about his preference for character roles – he mentions his turn as Doc Holliday in Tombstone, and even says he would have loved to have been a regular on Saturday Night Live. By contrast, he found Batman to be an empty shell, a realisation crystallised when the grandchildren of billionaire Warren Buffet arrived on Schumacher’s set one day and were completely unimpressed at the sight of Kilmer in full costume, yet fascinated by the Batmobile and the caped crusader’s other toys. “That’s why it’s so easy to have five or six Batmans,” Kilmer told the newspaper, suggesting that anyone could be in the suit. “It’s not about Batman. There is no Batman.” The comment makes sense to those of us who recall Kilmer’s supporting turns over the years with such pleasure. His turn as the irascible, ultra-violent Gay Perry in Shane Black’s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang turned the tough guy private eye cliche beautifully on its head, while his sweaty, cold-eyed Doc Halliday was a thing of jaded splendour. It’s easy to see how Kilmer felt his talents were being wasted behind a mask. And yet the idea that there is nothing in Batman to create a memorable performance from seems undercut by Pattinson’s determination to find something in the role to value. Perhaps, rather than an empty carapace, the dark knight is a blank canvas on which to paint one’s own ideas. Christian Bale, widely considered to be the best big-screen Batman, has admitted to being devastated when he found out that Affleck was taking the role. Director Christopher Nolan certainly played his part by delivering an intriguing, real world spin on Gotham in the Dark Knight trilogy, but the Wales-born actor responded with a nuanced, psychologically driven take on the caped crusader that stands in complete contrast to the one-dimensional figure of the Schumacher era. Where Kilmer opted out of returning as the caped crusader in 1997’s Batman & Robin because he wanted to do some “real” acting with Marlon Brando in the ill-fated The Island of Doctor Moreau, Bale helped transform the superhero genre into a space where high-profile actors no longer dare to phone in their performances. Pattinson will surely take his cue from the latter – honourable mention should also go to the excellent Michael Keaton – though it is a pity Kilmer’s time in the A-list came before the comic book movie really found its feet. He would have made a splendid Batman villain."
"I’m self-isolating alone, but, for five nights a fortnight, I have my children, Albert, eight, and Esme, six, to stay. We just watched a Japanese animation film called The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, which left the three of us completely spellbound, and my son in tears. It’s based on a 10th-century Japanese folktale called The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, who finds a tiny child in the bamboo who he raises with his wife. She’s a child of the moon but suffers the heartbreaks of being human, and when she’s called back to the moon, she doesn’t want to leave. It’s got things in common with Blade Runner. I watch very little television because it’s my job, so it’s a bit of a busman’s holiday. I don’t tend to watch much drama because I make it, so I know all the smoke and mirrors and I find it very difficult to spend my disbelief. I tend to stick to documentaries. I’m watching OJ: Made in America for the second time; it’s nearly eight hours long. It’s a portrait of an individual – OJ Simpson – and of race in America. It’s an account of Los Angeles, a corrupt judicial system and a grotesque miscarriage of justice. It’s a commentary on racial politics in America. It’s an absolute masterpiece. It came on in the middle of the night on BBC Four, and I just had to watch it again. I’m particularly interested that America has so much sway over our lives. I think it’s fair to say that without Donald Trump there would be no Boris Johnson. The idea of a celebrity moron becoming the most powerful person in the country was patented by the US. It’s also a portrait of celebrity in America. The idea that you can buy justice is something I think we all need to be aware of. I’m also watching Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus. He’s the guy who created Beavis and Butt-Head. It’s an animated history of American music. I’ve particularly enjoyed the ones on Bootsy Collins and George Clinton as I’m a big fan of black American music. I recommend it to anybody."
"What better way to celebrate the recent Alien Day than to place the eight movies in the long-running space saga into some kind of order of excellence? And also perhaps to ask how so many film-makers have managed to muck up the original film’s formula. Let’s start at the bottom. The two Alien vs Predator movies from 2004 and 2007 are now remembered largely for their staggering blandness, as if everybody involved had forgotten what made the early films so chilling. Ostensibly B-movies, but lacking the joyful, half-cocked knockabout bombast of a Roger Corman or Ray Kellogg film, they even disappointed fans of the crossover comic books that spawned them. If 20th Century Fox thought it was getting the new Ridley Scott when the studio hired Paul WS Anderson to direct ’s Alien vs Predator they were sadly mistaken. Bringing the xenomorphs to Earth, as Fox had intended to do in 1992 prior to David Fincher’s Alien 3, turned out to be the dumbest move since John Hurt decided to take a closer peek at the funny egg thing on LV-426. Even a smart moment of stunt-casting – Aliens’ Lance Henriksen as Charles Bishop Weyland – couldn’t paper over the cracks of this weirdly bloodless film. Aliens vs Predator: Requiem upped the gore but dropped quality levels even further, with untried music video directors Colin and Greg Strause at the helm. That the saga survived at all after this twin descent into movie purgatory is remarkable in itself. Next worst, because their collective failure made a mockery of attempts to revive the space saga, are 2012’s Prometheus and 2017’s Alien: Covenant. When Scott was persuaded to make his first science-fiction film in the best part of three decades, hopes were high that we might see a return to the pared-back slasher-in-space majesty of his 1979 film. But where Alien was a claustrophobic, searingly linear story of blue-collar workers coming into contact with the ultimate cosmic horror – a movie in which nobody knew what the hell was going on – Prometheus was a sprawlingly portentous slice of backstory that promised to tell us absolutely everything. Then failed to do it. Its only real triumph was Michael Fassbender’s cold-eyed android David, whom Scott decided to bring back for the sequel. In the end, nobody actually wanted to know how the xenomorphs were originally spawned, because the most fascinating thing about these acid-blooded monstrosities is their devilish inscrutability. I’m placing Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Alien Resurrection (1997) next. It’s a flawed movie in terms of its inception (would a clone Ripley retain the personality and memories of her “parent”?) but Sigourney Weaver delivers an eye-poppingly nutty performance as the part-human, part xenomorph Ripley 8, and there are some enjoyably sickly moments to compete with anything in the previous three movies. The scene when Ripley meets earlier failed versions of herself that have been pickled for posterity, and Brad Dourif’s fondness for the murderous extra-terrestrials, even as he is about to become a vehicle for their reproduction process, particularly stick in the memory. Alien 3 (1993) is next on my list. David Fincher’s battles with Fox over the final cut are well documented, as is the flawed decision to kill off poor Newt after she did so well to survive the horrors of the previous episode. But the movie boasts an impeccable supporting cast of British character actors who all enjoy themselves immeasurably, and the decision to retain the earlier films’ use of a pinched and airless setting within which the xenomorphs can wreak their mindless violence turns out to be a splendid one. Weaver, as ever, is excellent throughout. And now we come to the big decision: whether to plump for the original Alien, which shattered the horror paradigm forever, or its 1986 sequel Aliens, which launched James Cameron towards Hollywood megastardom and stands as one of the greatest action movies of all time. I’m going to plump for the latter in first place, if only because the advanced special effects of the 1980s made Giger’s slimy xenomorphs so much more scary and realistic. There are few moments in Hollywood history more iconic than Ripley’s final exo-suited battle with the alien queen, a scene so gratifyingly violent that the film-maker couldn’t resist plagiarising himself in Avatar. And the fact that we know exactly what is waiting for the band of cocky space marines only makes their plight even more delicious, even when watched for the umpteenth time. Final mention, however, goes to Scott’s original Alien. At the time, there had simply been no more terrifying movie ever made by Hollywood, while Weaver delivered a career-making performance as the mid-ranking warrant officer who takes command and fights for survival. If the memory-wipe system employed in another great sci-fi flick, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, really did exist, the first thing most horror fans would do would be to use it to eradicate all recollection of this cosmic classic from our noggins, just so that we could enjoy a virgin viewing of Scott’s spine-chillingly majestic film all over again."
"The Indian actor Rishi Kapoor, who built a career as one of Bollywood’s romantic heroes, has died of leukaemia at the age of 67. Kapoor, part of a famous Bollywood family, was admitted to hospital in Mumbai on Wednesday and died on Thursday, according to a family statement. “The doctors and medical staff at the hospital said he kept them entertained to the last,” said the family in a statement. “He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him.” Kapoor had returned to India last September after undergoing treatment for cancer in the US for almost a year, and was admitted to hospital twice in February. His father, Raj Kapoor, and grandfather, Prithviraj Kapoor, were doyens of Bollywood, the vast Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai. Kapoor began acting as a teenager and received the National Film Award for his debut role as a child artist in his father’s 1970 film Mera Naam Joker. He went on to act in more than 90 films, often as the romantic lead, and became well known for his talents in singing and dancing. In one of Bollywood’s most legendary off-screen love stories, he ended up marrying Nitu Singh, who had co-starred as his love interest in several films. Their son Ranbir Kapoor is now also a current top Bollywood actor. Kapoor’s career experienced a revival over the past decade as he took up supporting character roles in Bollywood films. The actor’s death came a day after that of another Bollywood giant, Irrfan Khan, at the age of 53. Fellow Bollywood actor and Kapoor’s co-star star Amitabh Bachchan tweeted: “Rishi Kapoor gone … Just passed away … I am destroyed.” Priyanka Chopra said Kapoor’s death was the end of an era, adding: “Rishi sir your candid heart and immeasurable talent will never be encountered again.” The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said Kapoor was a powerhouse of talent: “I will always recall our interactions, even on social media. He was passionate about films and India’s progress.” With India currently under lockdown, the Kapoor family issued a statement to urge fans not to publicly gather to pay their respects to Kapoor as is the tradition in the country. Kapoor’s last comment on Twitter had been to ask people to stop attacking those on the medical frontlines of coronavirus in India, writing: “We have to win this war together.” Kapoor’s family said: “In this hour of personal loss, we also recognise the world is going through a very difficult and troubled time. There are numerous restrictions around movement and gathering in public. We would like to request all his fans and well-wishers and friends of the family to please respect the laws that are in force.” Kapoor’s popular hits included Laila Majnu – a story of legendary Indian lovers – Debt, Moonlight, Sometimes, Sea and Lightning. In 1999, he directed Let’s Go Back. He switched to supporting roles in the 2000s and popular movies included Namastey London and Love Aj Kal, or Love Today And Tomorrow. He acted until recently and his last movie, The Body, was released in 2019. Kapoor is survived by his wife, son and daughter."
"Peter Sellers is widely admired as a British comic genius, the creator of some of the most memorable characters of 20th-century film and broadcasting. He was central to the cult 1960s BBC programme The Goon Show, once described as “probably the most influential comedy show of all time”, while his later role as Chief Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films brought him international stardom. But in private he was a difficult, domineering and jealous man who married four times, and once said of himself: “If I can’t really find a way to live with myself, I can’t expect anyone else to live with me.” Now we have fresh testimony from one who tried – and failed. Sellers’s former wife Britt Ekland has opened up about their troubled marriage, describing Sellers – who suffered from serious ill health as well as alcohol and cocaine dependency – as deeply controlling and mentally unstable, but unable to receive the medical treatment that he would have got today, partly because he was so valuable to the studios. In a major BBC Arts documentary, Peter Sellers: A State Of Comic Ecstasy, the former Bond actress recalls her four-year marriage from 1964. She remembers that Sellers would choose what she should wear, buying her entire wardrobe without consulting her, and threatening her with divorce “every Friday night – and by Monday there would be a make-up lunch or present”. She adds: “He obviously suffered from or was bipolar, severely bipolar. He was a very tormented soul who should have had more help. But instead he was unable [to] because he was such a valuable asset.” Sellers, who died in 1980, made his name, with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, through the seminal radio comedy The Goon Show. He became a global star with classic screen roles such as the inept Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther in 1963, to which he took Ekland on their first date. The couple met after he saw a photograph of the Swedish actress in a newspaper and realised that they were both staying at the Dorchester in London. In the documentary’s archive footage, Sellers says: “I thought that I would like to meet what I saw.” Ekland had come to Britain to be launched as 20th Century Fox’s new star. She recalls being in the bath when there was a knock at the door: “I wrapped a towel round me and rushed to open the door … This very tall gentleman said ‘I’m Mr Sellers’s valet’. Would I like to come to his suite?” In a whirlwind romance, Sellers called her two days after their first date, she recalls: “He said, ‘I have told the press that we’re going to get married’ … By the time we married [it] was probably little more than three weeks [later].” Returning from their honeymoon, she was photographed in a fur coat: “He decided what I was going to wear. He just pre-decided everything without ever asking me.” Ekland, who went on to star in The Man With The Golden Gun, also recalls how Sellers’s actions got her fired from the 1964 film Guns at Batasi: “He called me and said, ‘Ask the production if you can have an extra day off’. And they said no. He just said that’s taken care of. Someone drove me to the airport. The next thing I know I land in California, where I’d never been before, with no clothes. The plan was I would spend the weekend and then I would fly back. When I arrived, he said, ‘I have a doctor here because you don’t look well’. The doctor said, ‘She’s suffering strain and stress. You can’t possibly go back to filming’.” Asked in the documentary whether she was ill, she exclaims: “Of course not. I was 21 years old, fit as a fiddle, but I had no choice. I couldn’t have said, ‘I’m sorry, I love you, but I’ve got to go back to work now’. There was no option for that … I was fired from the film.” She continues: “I was taken straight back to our marble palace. He took me into the bedroom, which was all gold and white, and then next to it was a walk-in closet. He’d bought everything you could possibly need as a woman who didn’t have any clothes, from evening gowns to bikinis. The bikini was actually of mink … I was floored.” Although she has previously been quoted describing her marriage as “an atrocious sham”, John O’Rourke, the documentary’s producer-director, told the Observer: “She’s always quite private about this chapter of her life because she had her first child, Victoria, with Sellers … She hasn’t gone into huge amounts of detail. There have been a lot of books and documentary films made about Sellers over the years. She refused to speak to them … She mentioned bipolar disorder. Obviously Britt’s not a medical professional. But she did live with him for four years.” In the documentary, Ekland says that when she reads her diaries she sees repeated use of the Swedish word for “fight”. She recalls an argument in Rome, after they were harassed by paparazzi: “He just went on and on … This continued all night and he took my radio and smashed it. In the end he called our agent and said, ‘Come and pick her up’. I knew that this time I could never go back.” The tragedy is that Sellers brought out so much of life’s funny side. In the documentary, one of Milligan’s children recalls: “Dad would have to lie down on his bed to talk to Peter because they’d be laughing so much.” But Sellers’s grandson Will says: “The sad thing is that, like a lot of comedians, happiness eluded him.” Peter Sellers: A State Of Comic Ecstasy, BBC Two, 9 May.

"Few towns will be feeling the cultural impact of the pandemic next week as much as Cannes. At this time it should be abuzz with preparations for the film festival, which was due to open on 12 May. The red carpets would be at the dry cleaners, the hotels would be stocking up on champagne, and women would be packing their high heels (several female attendees were turned away in 2015 for wearing flat shoes). However, despite attempted postponements and workarounds (red carpet masks?), Cannes is not happening this year. Autumn festivals such as Venice and Toronto are also in doubt. As with so many other aspects of life, the pandemic has exposed the fragility of film festivals, and raised the question of how much we need them at all. In answer to the last question, just look at the films that premiered at Cannes last year: Parasite, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Atlantics, Pain and Glory. Cannes sorts the good from the mediocre, champions talent new and old, and sets much of the agenda for the rest of the year. It is one of the giant trees that supports the global ecosystem of cinema. Beyond its commercial functions (it remains one of the movie world’s primary marketplaces), Cannes has also come to symbolise an idea of cinema, as opposed to mere movies: of a mature and legitimate art form, like opera or ballet, to be consumed at prestigious gatherings in formal attire – even if the movie is, say, Kung Fu Panda (which premiered there in 2008). Reiterating this commitment, festival director Thierry Frémaux excluded titles by Netflix and Amazon from competition in 2018, since they would not be released on the big screen. Frémaux has also ruled out the idea of hosting Cannes virtually this year. “Its soul, its history, its efficiency, it’s a model that wouldn’t work,” he told Variety.  As much as his passion for cinema, Frémaux’s principled stance could also betray the fear that if a virtual Cannes was a success, people might ask if we still needed the real thing. If it’s cinema that really matters, why the whole circus of red carpets and private yachts and parties to which you’re not invited? In terms of sustainability, frugality and championing your new magnum opus on humanity’s struggle, it’s not really such a good look, even without the masks. Cannes might not have a choice, though. Later this month, in what could be interpreted as a circling of the wagons, it is participating in We Are One: a new, free, streaming film festival with programming from major festivals including Berlin, Venice, Sundance and Toronto. Not only is Cannes banding together with its rivals, the event is being hosted by – quelle horreur! – YouTube. Of course, Cannes and other festivals are vital and must return, but maybe this is a chance to reassess their priorities. "
"This documentary from Netflix is a real heart-soother. Directed with tremendous sensitivity and intimacy by Chris Bolan, it’s a love story about two women now in their 90s – Terry Donahue and Pat Henschel, who have been together since the 1940s. For decades they kept up the pretence of being “just good friends” to their families before finally coming out a few years ago. Talking to outsiders, they still describe each other as “cousins”. The legacy of shame and fear among older people in the gay community is explored in the film, but the overwhelming mood here is love. The romance between Terry and Pat never seems to have gone stale. Terry was a pioneering sportswoman, a baseball player in the professional women’s league that inspired the Penny Marshall movie A League of Their Own. She was 22 in 1947 when she met the love of her life, Pat, then 18. They’ve kept the early love letters, the bottoms ripped off in case they were caught by the authorities. Another gay woman interviewed remembers police raids on lesbian bars in the 50s. Women dressed in butch clothes were arrested for impersonating men; many lost their jobs or custody of their kids when their names were printed in the newspapers. This wasn’t part of life for Pat and Terry in Chicago – as Canadians, they feared being deported, so avoided the lesbian scene. A Secret Love is directed by Terry’s great-nephew, who prods and picks at the family’s dynamics revealing complexities that are universal. Pat has a bit of a spiky relationship with Terry’s niece, Diana, who wants the couple to move into a care home. Terry has Parkinson’s and is becoming frail. Pat is stubbornly refusing to budge. But it’s Terry who has resisted getting married. Will that change as they live more publicly as a couple? It would be a spoiler to say more, but it’s incredibly moving. “There’s no crying in baseball!” Tom Hanks’s grumpy coach said in A League of Their Own, but I was bawling my eyes out watching this film."
"There’s a satisfying ease to Netflix high school comedy The Half of It, a charming twist on the Cyrano de Bergerac formula that deserves slightly more attention than most of the streamer’s other made-to-order sleepover pics. A teen market that had been underserved by studios has now been exhaustively cornered by the company but often without much care or inventiveness, a conveyor belt of content that prioritises quantity over quality. It’s refreshing then to see a film such as this emerge from the same production line, slickly ticking all the same boxes but with a noticeable uplift in enthusiasm, grafting its own identity on to the boilerplate format. In the simple town of Squahamish, Chinese-American teen Ellie (Leah Lewis) feels like an outsider. Living alone with her dad, who can’t speak much English, and spending her school time either avoiding bullies or writing their essays for them, she’s grown accustomed to fading into the background. But when gawky jock Paul (Daniel Diemer) asks for an unusual favour, her lonely life takes a surprising turn. He’s in love with Aster (Alexxis Lemire) and wants to use Ellie’s writing abilities to impress her with a love letter. But as Ellie invests more time into helping Paul get the girl, she realises that she might want the girl instead … There’s a reason why the central dynamic of Edmond Rostand’s play continues to find its way into romantic comedies so many years later, its themes of inner beauty, insecurity and well-intentioned deception proving dramatically irresistible. Even Netflix has skirted near similar territory before in 2018’s catfish comedy Sierra Burgess is a Loser. So while it makes some of the mechanics of The Half of It feel a little bit, well, mechanic, it’s a difficult escalation not to engage with, especially as writer-director Alice Wu works hard to elevate, avoiding the far-fetched farce and convoluted circumstances we might be expecting given the material. There’s a temptation to overload teen comedies with too much extraneous plot but Wu’s film is mercifully streamlined as she avoids adding in, say, a mean girl adversary or any inconsequential parental subplots, focusing on the triangle and little else. Ever since Love, Simon’s respectable box office numbers showed that, shock, queer teens crave experiences similar to their own to be reflected in the same glossy way as their straight peers, we’ve seen more LGBT representation in high school movies. It’s predictably slow progress but The Half of It is another sensitively crafted step in the right direction, deftly conveying the difficult unsureness that can accompany same-sex attraction at a young age. The characters work their feelings out in ways that are messy and confusing which does leave some of the last act feeling similarly messy and confusing, with Wu wrapping things up a little too abruptly, missing a few emotional beats and leaving a few unanswered questions. Religion hovers over the film (Ellie plays piano at the church but doesn’t believe while Paul and Aster attend and do believe) but Wu can’t seem to find a reason why, with some late in the day attempts to make a connection falling flat, especially with regards to how some of the characters view homosexuality, and the insertion of the church ultimately feels like one of the few elements in the film that could have been easily excised. But what keeps the film mostly on track, even in its scrappier moments, is its central trio of accomplished young actors, who’ll probably see a substantive, and deserved, uptick in both career choices and Instagram followers after this lands. The real find is Lewis, who meters out hidden strength behind a meek demeanour, refusing to turn her character into a stock geek. Her husky voice is eerily reminiscent of Jennifer Lawrence and she shares a similar on-screen confidence at a young age, one I look forward to seeing more of in the future. There’s magnetic chemistry, both romantic and platonic (Wu’s focus on the importance of friendship makes for a nice change), between the three characters and even when the formula is at its most predictable, they manage to smoothly paper over any cracks. Like last November’s surprisingly efficient comedy Let It Snow, The Half of It is a strong, warm-hearted and quietly progressive addition to the expanding Netflix teen movie pack which treats its target audience with the respect they deserve."
"There is a strange noise coming from Tracee Ellis Ross’s Los Angeles garden. Hang on, she says, looking away from her computer screen to the window with an alarmed expression. “I’m just going to go check that out. Stand by!” If this were a horror movie, then the stylish woman disappearing into the distance would never come back. But it isn’t a horror movie, it’s a Zoom interview, and Ross, a Golden Globe-winning actor best known for her role in the US sitcom Black-ish, is talking to me from the sunny living room of her home. Or at least she was; right now, I’m staring at a fiddle-leaf fig tree and a comfortable-looking couch. In a youth-obsessed Hollywood, many women find their careers decline with age, but at 47, Ross appears to be just hitting her stride. The actor, activist and entrepreneur has been in the public eye since her 20s, but started getting serious attention only in her early 40s, with Black-ish. Now on its sixth season, the show centres on an upper-middle-class African American family, living in a largely white LA neighbourhood, and stars Ross as the matriarch, anaesthetist Rainbow “Bow” Johnson. Its unapologetic handling of race-related issues has turned the comedy into something of a cultural phenomenon. Barack and Michelle Obama are fans; Donald Trump, who tweeted that the show was racism at the highest level, is not. A few minutes after vanishing, Ross slides back in front of her computer and gives the all clear. There is no emergency except, you know, the one we’re all living through. At the time of speaking, LA has been under lockdown for almost a month and, like the rest of us, Ross is still struggling to get to grips with it. “I think we’re all dealing with these waves of emotion where everything seems fine. And then it hits you. It’s like the fear is just waiting right there.” She gestures towards the window. The fear has not infiltrated her wardrobe. Ross’s hair is styled into two Princess Leia-like space buns and she’s wearing a floral, Georgia O’Keeffe-esque top. Even through the awkward interface of a Zoom call, her signature mix of goofiness and glamour comes through – a willingness to poke fun at herself that is a large part of her on-screen appeal. As Black-ish creator Kenya Barris once put it, Ross “can do expressions and physical movement that take a joke from a five to a 10”. But if Ross seems down to earth, her childhood was anything but. Her mother is Diana Ross, and her father, Robert Ellis Silberstein, is a successful music executive, who managed the likes of Ronnie Wood and Meat Loaf. As a child, she attended an elite school in Manhattan, and did a stint at the type of Swiss boarding school where a typical gym class means a skiing lesson. She did a photoshoot with Andy Warhol when she was 11, and modelled in her teens. How, I ask, did she avoid turning into a brat? “I’ve always been taught that you work for the things you want,” Ross says. “My mom always joked: ‘I’m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I’ll make sure there’s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that…’ I mean, I had a job in high school. I worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren. My mom was like, ‘If you want to keep buying those clothes, you’re going to have to figure out how to pay for them.’ There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life.” Ross speaks fondly of her family, to whom she is extremely close. Her parents split when she was five but remained on good terms, and the childhood she shared with her siblings (four of whom were Diana Ross’s children, and three of whom were step-siblings from Ross’s second marriage) sounds happy and wholesome. “My mom always put us in bed, then she’d go to the recording studio while we were sleeping. She’d sit with us for dinner and she never left for more than a week.” Ross remembers her mother getting the kids to help her make the beds, and she remains a pro at hospital corners. Actually, she says, she still has some of those sheets. “I nicked them out of the closet at home and Mom doesn’t know I have them. They remind me of my childhood.” But being her mother’s daughter didn’t necessarily help when it came to work. “When I was starting in my career, being the child of somebody famous was not what it is today,” Ross says. “It might unlock the door, but the people sitting on the other side have their arms crossed and are asking: ‘OK, is she as good as her mom?’” She got her first big break as a comic on MTV’s The Lyricist Lounge Show in 2000. The same year, she landed a lead role on the sitcom Girlfriends, which ran for eight seasons, making it the longest-running live-action network sitcom at the time; but its predominantly black cast meant it was always pigeonholed as a “black show”. “The landscape of television was not the same as it is now,” Ross says. “It was still very segregated. We go through waves in this country, around celebrating black narratives: the early 2000s were not that time.” Despite the size of Girlfriends’ audience, she didn’t get invited on to the late-night TV shows, or the award shows, or the high-profile industry events. “It wasn’t a matter of how many eyeballs were watching the show,” she says. “It was a matter of which eyeballs were watching.” Then, in 2014, Black-ish came along and “everything started to happen”. In 2017 she won a Golden Globe for her role, making her the first black woman to pick up the award since 1983 (when Debbie Allen won for Fame). Her proud family had already taken out a full-page ad in the Hollywood Reporter to congratulate her on the nomination. Ross says one of the things that drew her to Black-ish was the way it disrupted conventional narratives. There is a warmth and respect between Bow and her on-screen husband, Andre “Dre” Johnson, that isn’t always evident in sitcoms. “Often the comedy of married couples on television is about how they roll their eyes at each other, how they frustrate each other,” she says. “I’ve never enjoyed that. “There’s a lot that poked holes in the status quo, particularly as a woman of colour,” she continues. “While the story is told through the eyes of the man, I’m not just the wife. I’m not just a doctor. I’m not just a mom. I’m all of those things. And my point of view is not seen in relation to Dre’s – it’s based in my experience and my life.” Sometimes, Ross says, Bow’s autonomy was “naturally written into the script” and sometimes she pushed for it. “I’m very conscious about not perpetuating stereotypes,” she explains. “In a scene, if they have written that I’m doing ‘lady-chores’ such as the cooking, I’m like: why? It’s not pivotal to the story. Let Dre do the chopping and I’ll stand here at my computer, or drink a glass of wine, or hold a book. I speak up and I drive them crazy sometimes. But in the context of being a black woman on television, I am very aware of what that imagery says and the stereotypes it perpetuates. My interest is in offering other expressions, other examples, other imagery.” Some of that “other imagery” is the experience of being mixed race, which we don’t always see on mainstream TV. “I had never, ever played that in my career,” Ross says. “Even though [being half black and half Jewish], that’s what I live.” While her character is clearly mixed race, Black-ish didn’t meaningfully explore that facet of Bow’s identity. “It ended up being relegated to this space of jokes,” Ross says. “As a mixed person, you’re constantly being bombarded by questions such as, ‘Are you this, or are you that?’ which is the least interesting part of being mixed…” She trails off for a second, losing her thread. “You know when you haven’t been talking a lot?” she says. “It’s like you lose access to words.” She makes a wide-mouthed, silly face and recovers from Quarantine Voice™ enough to explain how this particular frustration led her to co-create Mixed-ish, a prequel to Black-ish that debuted on ABC last year. While Bow’s heritage was a comic sidenote in Black-ish, Mixed-ish centres it: Ross narrates the story of Bow’s childhood, as the daughter of a black mother and white father growing up in 80s America. But there were mixed reviews, with some critics deeming the show’s politics too simplistic, and it’s not clear whether it will be back for a second season. Meanwhile, there is one thing Ross has not yet turned her hand to in a long and varied career. She has modelled, given a TED talk (on the power of women’s fury) and signed up as an ambassador for Time’s Up. She has appeared in music videos for Drake and Kanye West, a former neighbour. She runs her own company, Pattern, a successful haircare line for people with naturally curly hair. But there is one thing she has spent her entire life petrified of doing: becoming a singer. “I have wanted to sing since I was a kid,” she tells me. “But it was something I buried, because it was too scary a dream.” There was, after all, a lot to live up to. A year ago she landed a lead role in a movie. Directed by Nisha Ganatra (who worked on Amazon’s Transparent), The High Note sees Ross play a superstar singer, Grace Davis, whose career has peaked. Afraid of creating fresh material, Davis keeps trotting out old hits until her assistant (played by Dakota Johnson) convinces her to record new work. Ross sings six original songs in the film, a dream come true for her. Then, all of a sudden, it was a dream deferred. The High Note was due to premiere in May; in an alternative, coronavirus-free universe, Ross would be crisscrossing the country on a busy promotion schedule. Now, she says, she’s not sure if a premiere will ever happen. The film will be released, but nobody is quite sure when. A lot of people are dealing with much worse than cancelled movie premieres, she says. “This is a very small disappointment.” But still, it stings. “At 47 years old, to go into the studio and start singing, and discover that I actually had a voice that could work… it was life-changing for me.”  Did she really wait until 47 to start? “Pretty much. In high school, I took choir – it was one of the required courses – and we had to perform The Pirates Of Penzance. I was furious. I was so scared of singing in front of people that I marched myself to the headmaster’s office: ‘Mrs Regalman, I do not think that it’s fair to force somebody who doesn’t want to sing and who doesn’t want to be on a stage to be on a stage.’ And she told me I had to do it. So I did the play but I just mouthed the words.” Ross sang in public a couple of times after that, but says she would always add “a flare of comedy or hide behind a character”. So it wasn’t until very recently that she decided “to face one of my biggest childhood fears. And, typical me, I didn’t do it small – I decided to do it as the lead in a movie playing a musical diva.” A couple of months ago, Ross unveiled a clip of her singing in the film, during an on-stage interview with Oprah Winfrey. Curled up in her chair in an electric-blue suit, she looked on the verge of tears as the song, called Love Myself, played to a live audience. “I had no memory of getting myself curled up in that chair until I looked over and saw the screen,” she says. She wasn’t the only emotional one: Oprah cried, too, and the audience applauded; Ross has a beautiful voice. On-screen and off, she has spent much of her career challenging established narratives. She is often asked about her unmarried status, and has become a sort of accidental spokeswoman for the joy of being a single, childfree woman. The idea that being a woman means having a husband and kids is so deeply ingrained, she says, that most people don’t even know how inappropriate they’re being when they ask why she’s not married. Strangers poking around in her uterus used to irritate her, but she doesn’t “mind any more. It no longer stings. It’s just an opportunity for me to expand somebody’s idea of the world and add something different. Women, particularly black and brown women, are told we should occupy a smaller area of real estate. Everything in my being and my career is about encouraging women to give themselves permission to take up the space. I am very comfortable making people uncomfortable. Not just for my own wellbeing, but hopefully so that other women don’t have to bear that weight quite as heavily as my generation.” She remains “happily and gloriously single”, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t men in the background. When I ask whether she’s had texts from exes during lockdown – something of a pandemic phenomenon – she grins. “Oh, that’s definitely come up,” she says coyly, but won’t go into detail. “I have a heart that is very open and available to find the right man,” she continues. “But, you know, the old expression ‘sweep me off my feet’ seems ridiculous. I want to find a man who will meet me where I am. Because, actually, I like my feet. I like them grounded on the floor.” Our conversation is interrupted by the ping of a text message from a special man in her life. It’s her dad, wishing her a happy Passover. Ross has been doing regular group calls with her family since lockdown began. “FaceTime with my dad is like this,” she says with a laugh, manoeuvring the computer under her armpit. “I’m like: ‘I can’t see you!’ And he’s like: ‘I can see you!’ And I’m like: ‘I know, I can’t see you!’” What does she miss most about normal life? “I really miss smelling the people that I love,” Ross says. “Being able to nestle my head in my mom’s neck, or in my best friend’s. When I hug my best friend, it’s a full body hug. And I know what her scent is – not just her perfume, but just what she smells like. I don’t think I realised how important that is.” The hardest moments of lockdown, Ross says, seem to be between 10.30pm and 1am. It’s then that the “collective trauma and bizarre nature” of what we’re going through really hits her. “I just want something to distract me and it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s just me. Oh hi again! Hey you!’” There has been some solace, she says, in the fiddle-leaf fig she’s sitting next to. “I’ve been doing a lot of talking to her. She was a little upset to begin with because I forgot to water her for the first few weeks – a lot of leaves started to fall off. But this last week has given me some encouragement that maybe my father’s green thumb got genetically passed down, after all.” She looks at the plant with a quiet expression of satisfaction. “You know, I think she’s back to a joyful state.”"
"Amid the pressures of the current crisis, we could all use some uplifting, unchallenging, bittersweet sentimentality. That’s exactly what’s on offer from Astronaut, a film with a small budget, a big heart and an A-list Hollywood star blessed with enough twinkly charisma to pull off a potentially preposterous role. More at home on a TV screen than it perhaps would have seemed in cinemas, this wistful drama from Shelagh McLeod (her directorial feature debut) may not be earth-shattering, yet it retains the power to charm, thanks in large part to a central performance by Richard Dreyfuss that ranks among his best work. Dreyfuss is Angus Stewart, a retired and recently widowed civil engineer who always dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Ailing with age, Angus has moved in with his daughter Molly (Krista Bridges), a development that hardly delights Molly’s husband, Jim (Lyriq Bent). Secretive Jim is dealing with down-to-earth problems of his own and has no time for talk of stars or wishes. But young son Barney (Richie Lawrence) is delighted to have Grandpa around, sharing his sense of wonder at the magical comet that lights up the sky, adding a fairytale element to the drama. “People have been looking up at the stars for ever,” Angus tells Barney, “and I think it’s always for the same reason: to see where we belong”. Angus clearly doesn’t belong in Molly’s house (“He said he didn’t want to be a burden,” snaps an overheard Jim); nor indeed in the Sundown Valley retirement home, which plays the kind of relaxing music that drove Jack Nicholson to distraction in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Indeed, the only place Angus feels at home is in his dreams of space travel – dreams that could become a reality thanks to a TV lottery organised by billionaire Marcus Brown (Colm Feore) to win a once-in-a-lifetime seat on a commercial spacecraft. Angus may be too old and too infirm to qualify but, in the whimsical, wish-fulfilment world of McLeod’s film, he still has a shot. We know from the outset that this very modest drama has neither the resources nor the desire to turn into a space-travel extravaganza. Indeed, Angus (who once specialised in fixing roads and runways) soon becomes more concerned with the earthbound safety issues Marcus seems to have ignored than in his own rather foolish attempts to win a seat on the ship. Could it be that Angus’s place is down on the ground after all? There are plot holes wider than lunar craters. Could Angus really have made it on to the spaceflight shortlist with just a hastily acquired fake ID, even if Barney does insist that he “could look 65”? Would Marcus really be this cavalier about a mission into which he has sunk so much time and money? And how likely is it that Angus’s particular area of expertise would align quite so neatly with a critical plot development? But to focus on credibility gaps is to miss the point of the story, which (despite the title) has very little to do with space travel. Dreyfuss has compared Angus to Roy Neary, the character he played in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, suggesting that this is what might have become of Roy had he not climbed aboard that alien spacecraft all those years ago. It’s an astute observation, not least because it reaffirms that the main journey here is internal rather than external. Spielberg’s movie may have been a jaw-dropping cinematic spectacle but it was the sight of Dreyfuss obsessively building a mountain from mashed potato that became its defining image. Similarly in Astronaut, it’s not the hokey space-lottery plot that matters but Dreyfuss’s face as he listens to a doctor telling him to “keep up the good fight, Angus, because what’s the alternative?” Later, in a scene filled with verbose small talk, we observe Dreyfuss listening to a chirpy retirement-home manager babbling about fire doors and dinner times while his family attempt to kid themselves that he can be happy here. Dreyfuss doesn’t say a word in the entire scene but his silence is so eloquent that it drowns out everything else. Significant, too, that Angus’s best friend in Sundown Valley is Len (Graham Greene), who doesn’t speak because “no one listens”. There are moments of sharp humour (a brassy singer telling her OAP audience: “I’ll see some of you next week”) and Virginia Kilbertus’s tinkling score manages to combine childish innocence with world-weary melancholia. But it’s Dreyfuss who carries the movie, pulling us over the cracks in the narrative, drawing us into his world, providing a much-needed element of magic. Astronaut is available to stream on all major platforms from 27 April"
"In our house we’ve devised a democratic rota for movie viewing. Every night one of us – me, my wife and our children, who are 13 and nine – chooses a film for us all to watch. And every Thursday, we do the National Theatre Live (they’re still quoting One Man, Two Guvnors, but Treasure Island was a fail). And it’s been really fun. For anyone lucky enough, like us, to not have to go out to work, who has a home and a garden and food, this can be weirdly nice family time. We were fortunate in already having lots of DVDs as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime I succumbed to Disney+ because of all the Pixar and Marvel movies. Ant-Man was quite good; The Incredibles, Toy Story and Wall-E were brilliant. The youngest picked 101 Dalmatians and we’ve seen all of The Mandalorian. We went through a Spielberg phase – Jaws, the Indiana Jones films (in the wrong order). The film that went down really well was Inception; the next day we just listened to the soundtrack. We watched Mad Max: Fury Road the other night, which was fantastic and is still crazy. I think everyone had strange dreams that night, our youngest has been trying to make some of the vehicles out of Lego. The kids weren’t so keen on Harold Lloyd but they actually enjoyed the Marx Brothers’ A Night at the Opera. We did fast-forward the songs, but one scene where they move all the furniture out of a room while being chased had us all crying with laughter. It’s quite exciting showing them grown-up films we like. We’ve also done lots of Hitchcock: Rear Window, North by Northwest, The Birds, Vertigo. My wife will occasionally cover our youngest’s eyes if it’s too scary – The Birds was sometimes – and we turned off Rope after 10 minutes because my wife felt it was too disturbing. It’s good to sit and discuss films properly, then set them homework for the next day – like an essay on how they felt watching this or that Hitchcock. It’s also a great age to introduce them to the concept of ratings, and discuss why one film might have got a 12A and the other a 15. I’d never seen The Ladykillers, so it was terrific to catch up on that, and Once Upon a Time in the West was a big success. Now I’m thinking of showing them a Kurosawa film, then perhaps a short spaghetti western my wife and I made as students, if I can find a copy. Maybe one day they’ll watch The Warrior. We’ve discussed watching one of the movies I directed, but it seems like a waste of a choice. One other thing we haven’t watched is disaster movies; I’d like to rewatch Contagion, but don’t think the children should. The other night I tried Wings of Desire. That really didn’t go well. You could see the kids’ minds were blown by the concept of angels hearing people’s thoughts, but it was a tad too mature. Still, at least it got everybody to bed early that evening."
"There’s a better movie buried underneath the many corpses in the crude and confused Netflix comedy Coffee & Kareem, one of their algorithmically assembled weekend options patchworked together from a stack of search terms. It’s an attempt to update a buddy movie formula that flourished most in the 1980s with films like 48 Hours, Turner & Hooch and Tango & Cash but with a half-open eye on the current climate. The most recent theatrical attempt, the Kumail Nanjiani/Dave Bautista-starring Stuber, flopped last summer while Netflix has seen its own, the Mark Wahlberg/Winston Duke vehicle Spenser Confidential, reportedly score huge streaming numbers, despite a small issue of quality. It’s a platform that then makes a lot more sense for a throwback such as this with Stuber director Michael Dowse returning to try his luck again within similar territory, in extremely quick succession. It’s based on a script from the first-time writer Shane Mack, one that attracted enough attention in 2014 to be included on the Black List, an annual roundup of the best unproduced screenplays doing the rounds. There’s just about enough here to see why with Mack’s knack for comedy, both broad and weirdly specific, proving that at the very least he’d make a solid inclusion in any sitcom writers room. His dialogue is overstuffed with quips but for every one that lands, about five others tank, with an overreliance on lewd one-liners. In the first 15 minutes we’re promised something far more entertaining than what the following 70 minutes deliver. Incompetent cop John Coffee (Ed Helms) is dating single mother Vanessa (Taraji P Henson), much to the annoyance of her son Kareem (Terrence Little Gardenhigh), who is forced to spend time with him after school one day. In a set of circumstances that would seem far-fetched even if the film were animated and populated by talking animals, the two end up on the run from some “bad guys” after the same criminal who escaped from Coffee’s custody is also approached by Kareem to beat Coffee up. The pair have to then get along etc, etc. The lack of certification on Netflix content and any restrictions that would then come with it has meant that quite often, films or shows that would otherwise be tailored for a wide PG-13 audience are given a free pass to go hard R. It can be jarring to suddenly hear the word cunt in an otherwise tame romantic comedy and in Coffee & Kareem, a silly kids movie set-up is matched with an overwhelmingly aggressive crudeness as every opportunity for puerile jokes about shit, dicks, asses and rape are rolled out until any shock value has been completely beaten to a pulp. The novelty of watching a 12-year-old curse was tested in last year’s Good Boys, a joke that isn’t unfunny the first time or maybe even the second but when it becomes a lazy substitute for, say, an actual witticism soon starts to grow dull. It’s a strange movie that can seem mildly interested in tackling bigger issues before swiftly backing down. Any contemporary comedy about the dynamic between a white cop and a black boy can’t avoid the uncomfortable reality that we often associate with such a pairing and Mack’s script highlights the distrust that Kareem understandably has for Coffee. But its treatment feels a bit too flip for such an uneasy subject and elsewhere Mack relies on tired stereotype subversions such as the black henchmen who are, twist, surprisingly sensitive and the black stripper who is, twist, surprisingly academically ambitious, that feel patronising at best. There’s also a confused attempt to make some sort of comment on the gay panic humour that often pervades films such as this but Mack’s long-running joke, that to scare men away you have to pretend to be aggressively gay, isn’t smartly employed enough for it to work as satire and, as such, just comes off as a bit questionable. For a film centred on the relationship between two male characters, it’s actually the women who end up stealing the show, with Henson, who really deserves so much better than this, proving to be an energetic comic presence once again, giving far more than her thankless role requires and Betty Gilpin, as Coffee’s cop nemesis, bringing a solid 80% of the film’s funniest moments. Gilpin, excellent on Glow, the best thing about toothless Trump America satire The Hunt and hysterical on chatshows, is having so much fun on screen that I started to crave whatever she was on, which would make the film’s mess of a final act that much more palatable. Barely 90 minutes and barely memorable enough to stay in one’s mind for any longer, Coffee & Kareem is truly decaf entertainment."
"Do you cut the red wire or the blue wire? One renders the explosive mechanism harmless. The other causes everyone to die in an almighty explosion. And you make your decision as the sweat pours off your forehead, and makes your fingers holding the pliers slippery, with the traditional, sadistically pointless digital clock installed in the device inexorably counting down to zero … red wire? … blue wire? … red wire? … blue wire? … tick, tick, tick. Talk about being triggered. In 1974, while the nation went into stoic semi-denial about the IRA bombing campaign, I went into a trance of excitement about the bomb-disposal suspense thriller Juggernaut, which was showing at the Watford Odeon in the school holidays. The cinema had just been split into three screens: a big one upstairs in the former balcony, and two small screens downstairs created by partitioning the rear stalls. My memory is that I was in one of these boxy “minis”. Apparently inspired by a bomb hoax on the QE2 a couple of years previously — though I’ve only just found that out now — Juggernaut was about a terrifying mega-bomb planted on a transatlantic ocean liner called the Britannic, sailing from Southampton to New York. The seas are too rough for the passengers to be taken off in lifeboats. The Irish-accented bomber (codenamed: Juggernaut) telephones the liner company boss with a surprisingly modest ransom demand for £500,000 (rather like Dr Evil naively requesting a “million dollars”.) Richard Harris plays the scotch-swilling cavalier tough guy with the reckless courage and intuitive bomb-disabling ability who is parachuted to the ship with his team to do the business. David Hemmings is his loyal assistant. Juggernaut had a very good cast. Apart from Harris, there was Omar Sharif, who gave a diffident, slightly torpid performance as the ship’s captain, having an ungallant affair with a beautiful passenger (Shirley Knight); Ian Holm is the company chief, Anthony Hopkins is the Scotland Yard cop whose wife and kids are aboard the Britannic; Roy Kinnear is the frantic entertainment director who at one point actually says “Hi-de-hi!”. Roshan Seth is the Ugandan Asian steward who can switch accents to white-Brit when it is expedient. Veteran American character actor Clifton James (who was the glowering sheriff in the Bond films Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun) plays an American tourist. Cyril Cusack has an uncredited role as the defiantly uncooperative IRA veteran who is questioned by Hopkins in prison about who might be behind this. His questioning now looks very gentlemanly. The director is Richard Lester and the writer is Richard Alan Simmons who demanded to be credited as Richard DeKoker after a quarrel about the way his script was rewritten. (Again, I’m finding out about this now.) I loved Juggernaut as a 12-year-old, though it didn’t have the high gloss of big Hollywood disaster movies such as The Poseidon Adventure. And watching it again now, what strikes me is the awful weather: the cloudcover of this-is-not-America Britishness, which instantly signalled the fact that this is coming from Blighty not California. The Britannic is very different from the sleek digital hallucination of James Cameron’s Titanic. It is a real ship: with unsightly rust marks on the hull where the anchor comes up. The scenes on board make it look like a ropey cross-Channel ferry. I sat through it pop-eyed with my Kia-Ora and carton of Maltesers, before staggering out into the bland weekday sunshine of Watford High Street, the world of Dolcis shoe shops and Clements department store, weirdly not much less glamorous than the Britannic, with its world of slightly depressed passengers making the best of things and not questioning authority. (Some years later, Linsday Anderson’s Britannia Hospital was offered as a condition-of-Britain metaphor. Maybe we should have been thinking the same way about Lester’s ocean liner Britannic.) So I sat down to this again, thinking that Juggernaut would just look hilariously awful. But no. Actually, it’s a really tough, forthright, well-made action thriller which holds together tremendously well, and despite the creaky, groany moments … well … the big blue/red wire finale had me on the edge of my seat. Juggernaut now has an almost gritty social-realist look. And watching it now, something hit me like being whacked over the head with a frying pan. “Juggernaut” is Irish — BUT SO IS RICHARD HARRIS! CLANGGGG! Of course, Harris’s character has to be Irish, at least subliminally (his own accent is subdued and he is a Royal Navy officer,) so that there is the all-important non-controversial political balance. Fans of 70s trivia and ephemera will love things like the kids playing on the rudimentary Pong computer game in the ship’s lounge bar and the arcade-style pinball machines. (We 70s kids really did do a lot of playing on these games on holiday, or hanging around pennilessly looking at them.) And we get to see some vintage “executive” novelty desk toys that were all the rage in those days. There are, of course, also some dodgy attitudes, in throwaway “funny” lines that have clearly been dubbed in post-production. As the Britannic departs, leaving the crowds behind on the quayside, we hear a campy voice: “Right, Humphrey, my place or yours?” Oo-er. Similarly, a south Asian deckhand dealing with a dog on board mutters: “I’ll have you in a bloody curry if you don’t move.” Yikes. Yet later, Seth’s steward will tell Knight that he has endured racism in both Uganda and Britain and it is a “sad world for refugees”. There is also an outrageously and, in fact, dangerously real-looking Sweeney-type cop car scene as Hopkins’s vehicle careers around the streets, almost hitting some kids as it screeches to a halt. It really does look as if risks were taken. Also, there is an amazing scene as Harris and his comrades parachute from the plane. The mask of one jumper comes off and you can hear: “Christ! Bloody mask!” Again, it really did look like a real mishap. And the scenes showing the jumpers getting hauled aboard the ship from the sea are amazingly well done and genuinely gripping. Juggernaut feels more like an old-fashioned war movie than a disaster movie, and Harris’s character is supposed to have learned his trade disabling Nazi bombs in the blitz. It’s a period piece from both the 40s and 70s. Surprisingly entertaining and effective. And the message that things will be all right in the end due to the dedication and expertise of professionals … that is also acceptable."
"A Saudi female doctor runs for local government, causing consternation in a community still wrestling with the idea of female emancipation, in Haifaa Al-Mansour’s second Saudi-set feature, following her debut, Wadjda. Enraged that the councillor refuses to fix the road outside her hospital, Maryam (Mila Al Zahrani) sets out on the campaign trail armed with snacks, determination and a googled checklist of how to win an election. Like Maryam’s approach to local politics, the film is well-meaning but occasionally naive. There are a few too many rote scenes in which an initially faltering Maryam finds her voice and earns respect. However, it’s impossible not to feel a swell of satisfaction when Maryam stomps into a meeting of dreadful Saudi men and douses them in shrivelling disdain. And the music – as a musician, Maryam’s father is almost as scandalous as his daughter – is stirring and poignant."
"There are few more problematic venues than the local multiplex if your aim is to avoid contracting Covid-19. That’s why cinemas were among the first businesses to be hit by the pandemic. And it could be a while before any of us are able to watch anything on the big screen. Hollywood is putting on a brave face for the time being. Only one movie, Trolls World Tour, has so far been shifted from theatrical release to streaming platforms, though films such as Disney’s Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Universal’s The Invisible Man, Warner Bros’ The Way Back and Lionsgate’s I Still Believe have all made their way to the small screen far more rapidly than would have been expected prior to the outbreak. The president of the US-based National Association of Theater Owners, John Fithian, indicated this week that multiplex owners were keen for Trolls World Tour to be an “outlier” rather than an indicator of the new Hollywood normal. But Warner Bros recently denied reports that superhero movie Wonder Woman 1984 might go straight to streaming platforms. The fact is that studios are unlikely to continue honouring the longstanding theatrical “window” , which ensures cinemas get movies for a significant period before they are allowed to debut in the home, when multiplexes are unable to open. Movies, unlike live gigs or going to see a DJ spin in a nightclub, can be consumed at home with the minimum of disruption to the experience. It’s not only possible to monetise content streaming, but audiences are already used to paying for movies online. It is therefore inevitable, should the pandemic last for more than a couple of months, that more and more releases will make the leap straight to the small screen. Might there be a silver lining here for those of us waiting with bated breath for the next big sci-fi, fantasy or comic-book movie? For a while, it’s been clear that Hollywood has reached such a level of technical excellence that audiences viewing big-budget movies in the cinema are no longer bothered if the film makes no logical sense, has terrible dialogue and features clunky acting. How else to explain the runaway success of Michael Bay’s Transformers films or DC superhero flicks such as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice? Let’s imagine for a moment what Hollywood might look like in a world without cinemas. We would lose moments such as those glorious watery fight scenes in Blade Runner 2049, the outrageous pulsing of Hans Zimmer’s gorgeously bruising score pummelling the eardrums into ecstasy while Roger Deakins’ epic cinematography sets synapses on fire and almost causes our eyes to pop clean out of our skulls with its sheer high-definition intensity. Denis Villeneuve’s film is a perfectly enjoyable watch on the small screen, but at a high-spec cinema it’s a religious experience. Likewise, James Cameron’s Avatar has its detractors, but few can forget the first time they saw it in blistering 3D on the big screen. On the other hand, might the shift to streaming lead to some interesting changes in the way film-makers approach their art? Imagine if the creative team behind The Mandalorian had been in charge of making the latest Star Wars film, Rise of Skywalker, and had been given the time and patience to deliver a fitting finale to the long-running space opera, rather than a botched, overly self-referential rush job with zero new ideas. Is it too much to hope for that we might see a gentle transition towards a cinema of ideas over spectacle. It’s been palpable in recent times how well cerebral science fiction works on the small screen, from shows such as Westworld and Black Mirror to straight-to-streaming films such as I Am Mother. While both feature their fair share of action thrills and spills, these are predominantly dialogue-based concoctions that are perfectly enjoyable on a laptop. When similar ideas end up being translated for the multiplex, the result is often far lazier, as if the focus is on making those high-octane set pieces really pop at the expense of storytelling. The best we can hope for is a half-decent Terminator movie every few years. Perhaps in years to come, we’ll see this period as a turning point for big-budget cinema, when the closure of multiplexes for long periods encouraged film-makers to try a different route to getting their ideas in front of an audience. When, forced to turn down cinema’s volume, Hollywood finally realised it needed to turn up the imagination."
"A terrifying performance from nine-year-old German actor Helena Zengel is at the centre of this sombre drama from Nora Fingscheidt. She plays Benni, a violent, uncontrolled and near-feral problem kid who takes the social services to breaking point and beyond. At one stage, a strategic soundtrack use of Nina Simone’s track Ain’t Got No – I Got Life seems to suggest that we should sympathise with Benni as a tiny whirlwind force of nature who resists being crushed by drab authority. But that’s not how this gruesome, compelling film is playing out. Most of the time, Benni is simply scary, a sociopath in training, quite unteachable and unreformable, horrible to the people trying to help her like the scorpion that stings the frog because that’s its nature. Benni has a charming streak that has seduced a number of social workers to make an emotional investment in her, to take risks for her, to go out on a limb for her, only for her to let them down and in a sense to consume them as eagerly and unrepentantly as a vampire. All the time, her dials are up to 11, screaming, laughing too loud, swearing, punching. Her key social worker, Frau Bafané (Gabriela Maria Schmeide), tries to get Benni into special schools or facilities; dozens turn her down and Benni is too young to be effectively incarcerated as an inpatient. While Benni is eerily unaffected, the strain takes its toll on Bafané, reducing her to an emotional wreck, and the same is true of another social worker, Micha (Albrecht Schuch), a tough young guy who is no pushover, and who takes Benni away for a tough-love stay in his cabin in the woods. It’s a trip that involves borderline-inappropriate intimacy with this intense child – a risk that appears not to have occurred to the entirely blameless Micha. And all the time, the stakes get higher and the morale lower. There are times, when Zengel is performing with other children, especially younger children, when you get the strange sense that this isn’t acting – it is actually happening. A grisly, gripping watch."
"Jeremy Marre, who has died aged 76, was a British documentary maker specialising in films about popular music of every possible kind. Widely travelled, and with eclectic taste, he had a lengthy career that included adventurous documentaries about music in Africa, the Americas, the UK and the US, and profiles of artists such as Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, Youssou N’Dour and Count Basie. His first major success was Roots Rock Reggae (1977), which grew out of an earlier commission on the British reggae scene for the ITV arts programme Aquarius. Deciding that he needed to go to Jamaica to fully understand the music, Marre “scraped together some money” and travelled to Kingston, filming in lawless areas of the city. Threatened by some locals who accused him of being a CIA agent, he convinced them he was English only after they quizzed him about cricket. He returned with historic footage of artists including Bob Marley, Sly & Robbie and Jimmy Cliff, but still had difficulty in placing the film. As Marre explained in an interview with fRoots magazine in 2014, “the BBC said it was boring, and you can’t mix music and politics, while PBS in America turned it down as communist propaganda. But it won a documentary prize at Cannes and then the BBC wanted to show it. It was different to anything, with no presenter and no commentary.” It is now regarded as a classic film of the genre. Mark Cooper, the former head of music television at the BBC, who worked with Marre on many of his films from 2005 on, called him “one of the key architects of the ‘rockumentary’ and music films”. “What all his films had in common,” Cooper said, “was great journalism, a desire to listen to the artist and a desire to give voice to the artist.” Marre also had a knack of being in the right place at the right time. As a result he did not just chronicle popular music history, but helped to make it. He was in South Africa during the apartheid era, where he filmed black musicians long before the growing interest in world music brought them popularity in the west. Among those featured in Rhythm of Resistance (1979) was the Zulu choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Paul Simon saw Marre’s film and was so impressed that he decided to record with the group and other black South African musicians – and the result was his acclaimed 1986 album Graceland. Albert Mazibuko, the group’s eldest surviving member, said: “Everyone points to our work with Paul Simon as the moment we became well known around the world. However most people do not realise that if it wasn’t for Jeremy Marre and his Rhythm of Resistance documentary, Paul Simon would never have known there was a Ladysmith Black Mambazo.” Simon – with whom Marre would work later on a film about Graceland – said: “Jeremy had a deep curiosity and knowledge of a great deal of interesting music around the planet.” Born in north London to Ivan Marre, a consultant dermatologist, and his Russian-born wife, Olga (nee Shlain), Jeremy was educated at Highgate school, north London. He graduated from University College London in law in 1965 and started reading for the bar before deciding he was more interested in film than law. He studied for an MA in film at the Royal College of Art but quit, finding it “pretentious”, and moved to the Slade School’s film department, where he was “happier … you could do what you wanted”. He then took “odd jobs, from camera assistant to trainee assistant floor manager”, to build up his expertise and get a union card. In 1970 he received a BFI grant to make a short film inspired by Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers, Uneasy Dreams: The Life of Mr Pickwick. Through his company, Harcourt Films, from the mid-70s Marre set out to film the music of the world for a series that would be branded Beats of the Heart. Over seven years he made 14 one-hour films, including Roots Rock Reggae and Rhythm of Resistance, that explored, as Marre put it, “the dynamic and often controversial role music plays within distinctive societies around the world … This music, sometimes called world music, is – in the words of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff – ‘the cry of the people’.” The series covered popular music styles from Latin to Nigerian, Gypsy and Chinese. For Shotguns and Accordions (1983) he travelled to the marijuana-growing areas of Colombia. Many of the films were shown on Channel 4, all of them were released on DVD and video, and they were accompanied by Marre’s book of the same name. Marre made his reputation through world music films but moved on to cover a wide range of subjects. His prolific output included The Left-Handed Man of Madagascar (1990), which explored ancestor spirit festivals and which won a New York film festival award, and On The Edge (1992), a four-hour C4 series on improvised music from around the world. Reigning in Hell (2006) investigated the feared American prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood. Marre also tackled more conventional subjects, such as with Classic Albums, a series that spanned 1997 to 2018, but always retained a distinctive film-making style.  Towards the end of his career, Marre made a series of profiles of musical celebrities, such as Otis Redding (2013) and Count Basie (2018). He used as little voiceover and commentary as possible, and never appeared in his own films, but instead used such techniques as getting an actor to voice the artist’s diaries. “He liked the films to breathe … and the subjects and contributors and archive to speak,” said Cooper. He was good at “winning the trust of his subjects because he was genuinely interested in them”. So he was able to persuade Redding’s wife and daughter to contribute to his profile, and discovered unseen archive from Count Basie’s estate “that gives a sense of Basie the man and the human being – and that’s vintage Jeremy”, said Cooper. The singer Pauline Black of the British Ska revival band The Selecter, who was involved in Marre’s programmes Soul Britannia (2007) and Reggae Britannia (2011), said that “Jeremy’s singular skill was allowing British black folks to tell our own story in our own words”. Marre even made an impression on “the godfather of soul’”, James Brown. Marre’s son Oliver recalled going to a Brown concert with his father when he was a teenager “and JB stopped the show and shone a spotlight on my dad. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen,’ he mumbled, ‘there are few men you can trust in this world. This man is one of them.’” Marre married Diana Silman, a teacher, in 1970 and she accompanied him on many of his early filming trips. She survives him, as do their two sons, Oliver and Jesse, and four grandchildren."
"I’ve never seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. There, I’ve said it. It wasn’t easy. When your job is writing about films, not having watched Stanley Kubrick’s space epic is like being a taxi driver who hasn’t passed the driving test. It’s a basic qualification. Because 2001 is officially a masterpiece: number six on Sight & Sound’s list of greatest movies; the best sci-fi ever made according to Time Out and the Guardian. It’s one of those films that movie lovers all seem to have watched at an impressionable age. Christopher Nolan has spoken about going with his dad when he was seven to see a rerelease in Leicester Square.I’m not sure how I didn’t see it growing up. My dad is a film buff who adores Kubrick and never bothered too much about age certificates and ratings. We first watched The Shining together when I was 10 or 11. In my early teens, I was obsessed with Full Metal Jacket. Then came A Clockwork Orange and Dr Strangelove. I never got on with Lolita but I’m in heaven with Barry Lyndon. I’m a big Kubrick fan, I’ve even read the biography his chauffeur wrote. You can probably hear the whiny high-pitched “take me seriously please” desperation here. But to be honest, I think the real reason that I never saw 2001 is that I’m just not very science-y. The thought of infinite space does not fill me with a sense of awe. I did keep meaning to see it, but then well, I never did. And the funny thing is, I understood the pop culture parodies without having watched it. I wouldn’t say I’ve ever lied about it. But I’ve definitely nodded along as someone banged on about the psychotic computer HAL 9000 or tripping off their nut while watching 2001. My partner doesn’t know I haven’t seen it. If I’d told him on the night we met and talked non-stop for two hours about films, would he still have asked for my number? Anyway, thank you Guardian for making me watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. Going to the cinema was not an option so I rented it on Google Play and watched on an ancient projector. And, what can I say? It’s a bloody masterpiece. I watched the opening Dawn of Man sequence in wonder at this perfect image of the spark of human consciousness. What fun Kubrick would have had, I thought, with Andy Serkis’s motion capture technology. Yet his society of human ancestors (played by mimes in furry suits) is perfect. The colour, the extravagance of all those beautiful space sets, what a vision of a future. I still have the imagination of a potato when it comes to space but I loved this movie. What I will say is that 2001 does not work as escapism. I usually like a film with big long expanses of silence to get lost in. I’m quite partial to a bit of uncompromising slowness. But right now, my brain is 50 miles a minute. Concentrating on anything for more than 43 seconds is impossible. The film’s sense of emptiness made me edgy. But I’ll be back, when cinemas reopen. Funnily enough, I watched 2001 with headphones on while my toddler napped with a fever in bed next to me. She woke up right at the end, at the bit where the freaky big baby in a bubble hovers next to the moon. She was transfixed – the moon and babies are two of her favourite things. So, who knows, maybe for her it will be a film she remembers watching at an impressionable age."
"It’s Freddie Mercury’s fault. When he and his lavishly coiffed backing band released Radio Gaga in 1984, the video used footage from the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Superimposed over Fritz Lang’s visionary cityscape were the foursome in a flying car. Later in the video, they performed a gig before the film’s downtrodden masses. Not many cinematic classics could survive such brutal repurposing. For me, Lang’s film got tainted by association with Queen’s song – one that, ironically enough, became part of the very radio blah it ostensibly indicted.I’ve always loved the films noirs the German emigré made in Hollywood after the war: The Blue Gardenia, While the City Sleeps, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. I’ve also long doffed the proverbial fedora to Lang for narking both Josef Goebbels and Joseph McCarthy. I’ve even forgiven him for directing Lee Marvin to throw coffee in Gloria Grahame’s face in The Big Heat, one of the greatest films noirs. But throughout my life I stayed away from Metropolis, imagining it to be outdated cardboard sci-fi fit only to be plundered by pomp rock grave robbers.I couldn’t have been more wrong. Metropolis, when I finally watched it recently, seemed not just creatively fresh but amazingly topical. For instance, when Maria’s robotic doppelganger exhorts the masses to rise up from their underground city, her cry resonates down the decades: “Who is the living food for the machines of Metropolis? Who lubricates the machine joints with their own blood? Who feeds the machines with their own flesh?” Her call to revolution now captures, at least for me, our post-Fordist era of Big Data vampires from Fitbit to Facebook. That said, neither Lang nor his wife, Thea von Harbou, who wrote the screenplay, were luddites. Indeed, it’s striking they imagine it takes a humanoid programmed by a power-crazed inventor to sucker the workers into smashing the machines, which undermines a Marxist interpretation of the film. Striking for me, too, that Metropolis came out in the same year as Heidegger’s Being and Time. But, while Heidegger tore into human debasement by technology, the last 30 minutes of Lang’s film is more conflict.  In that thrilling half hour, our blond Aryan jodhpur-wearing hero (turncoat son of the Tower of Babel-dwelling oligarch Joh Frederson) and his saintly blond Aryan girlfriend Maria (whose evil double gets mistaken for her throughout the picture) rescue the proletariat’s kids from an apocalyptic flood in the subterranean workers’ city. The flood, poignantly, was unleashed by deluded workers who’ve destroyed the water pumping Heart Machine. Without machines we will die, suggests the film; with them we risk becoming less than human. Late capitalism: it’s a dilly of a pickle.Above this barbaric underworld, the toffs ponce about in a manicured garden and patronising a Weimar-era nightclub filled with my worst nightmare: Teutonic flappers and their stormtrooper beaux. It is a society that I couldn’t help but think fully deserves the opening of the seventh seal and the resultant apocalypse that Metropolis’s priests rightly anticipate. But it’s not the message of Metropolis that thrills me; it’s the visual virtuosity. The aerial shot of Maria through a skylight struggling to escape her pursuer is a stroke of genius. Shadow play on the walls gave me chills. And I loved the bombastic offices with their huge doors and empty spaces for proto-Hitlerian masters of the corporate universe to strut. Not only Albert Speer but the Coens’ Hudsucker Proxy are footnotes to Metropolis’s set design.So much of future cinema and TV, I now realise, steals from Lang’s masterpiece. Not just Face/Off: the central conceit of John Woo’s film is anticipated by Maria’s face being copied by Rotwang on to his Frankenstein’s-monster-like metal robot during the kind of surgery you can’t get on the NHS. Robots from Dr Who’s Cybermen to James Cameron’s early terminators depend for their existence on Lang’s cybernetic prototype. Lang requires his actors to perform mechanical ballet in sync with their Moloch-like machine, prefiguring the dancers and synchronised swimmers of Cecil B DeMille’s Broadway Melodies of the next decade. Dali’s surreal sequences for Hitchcock’s Spellbound plunder Lang’s dreamy montages. All later apocalyptic disaster movies, few of them as philosophically sophisticated as Metropolis, would have been unthinkable without Lang’s exemplar.Two misgivings. There is a moment when the blond hero breaks down a door bearing a Star of David and runs amok in the inventor Rotwang’s lab. Lang’s mother was Jewish (though Lang was raised as a Catholic) but that scene made me queasy, particularly when I later read that von Harbou, who wrote the novel on which her screenplay for Metropolis is based, and whom Fritz divorced in 1933, went on to work on dozens of pro-Nazi movies. What’s more, the film’s trite, three-times repeated moral – The mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart – undercuts the otherwise nuanced politics of the film. Grotesquely, Lang and von Harbou seem to suggest what Germany needs is blond Aryan nitwit to broker rapprochement between worker and megalomaniac boss, rather than – as I would prefer – the latter to be taken outside and shot for the public good.I watched Metropolis with my 14-year-old daughter and we were both gripped for 140 minutes by a silent movie thanks to a bonkers mashup of mythic story, Gottfried Huppertz’s heart-pounding score, and still utterly beguiling cinematography. We could have watched the 1984 version with a soundtrack by synth pioneer Giorgio Moroder featuring songs by, there’s no easy way to say this, Pat Benatar and Freddie Mercury, but we aren’t peasants. Instead the version we saw, made from a print found in Buenos Aires in 2008, excited and stimulated me more than any film I’ve seen for years. How could I have deprived myself of it for so long?"
"Tom Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of The King’s Speech, has revealed some of the logic behind the creative choices guiding his most recent film, Cats. A starry version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s hit stage musical, Cats primarily met with ridicule, nausea and confusion when it premiered just before Christmas last year. Critics queried the special effects and eroticism, audiences largely stayed away and some of the stars disowned the film. Hooper’s director’s commentary, recorded for the film’s home entertainment release, sheds light on some of the decisions behind what is regarded as one of the most calamitous missteps in movie history. Though Hooper does not directly address the film’s reception on the audio track, some of his insights defend - or defer – widely reviled choices, including the moment where Rebel Wilson’s tabby cat unzips her own fur – to reveal a further layer of further beneath. “This gag,” says Hooper, “is kind of my own tongue-in-cheek way of referencing that I’m using digital fur as clothing because Rebel actually unzips her digital fur to reveal it as clothing. But then the joke is that underneath she has more real fur, which of course is not real fur.” Other baffling elements are also discussed by Hooper, who credited Wilson with the idea of having the mice her character enslaves and terrorises played by children. He then adds: “Women playing cockroaches – whose only unusual trait is that they have an extra pair of arms, in homage to the cockroach number of limbs.” Wilson appeared on stage at this year’s Oscars alongside her Cats co-star James Corden to present the award for best visual effects. In their introduction, the pair referenced the poor reviews the film – and its effects in particular – had attracted. The following day, the pair and the telecast’s producers were criticised by the VFX Society, saying “the best visual effects in the world will not compensate for a story told badly.” In his commentary, Hooper praises the “great acting” of the duo, in particular Corden’s apparent break of the fourth wall in an alley-set scene. “I love the idea that James is sort of stepping out of the film for a moment to acknowledge the kind of natural tension between their claim that they were cats and the kind of hybrid design.” Hooper credits other actors with grace notes in the movie, including one unscripted look exchanged by Judi Dench’s Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen’s Gus the theatre cat, which indicates the pair were once lovers. Dench and McKellen, said Hooper, “decided their cats had some sort of romantic backstory”. Hooper, 47, has not yet announced his next project, but his commentary does give some insight into his current activities. “I must admit I’ve actually tried bowing down to a cat and saying ‘Oh cat’ just in the slight hope that it might unleash the cat to talk to me,” he says. “It hasn’t yet worked, but I will continue trying.”"
"The mysteries pile up in this schlock thriller faster than the bodies did in director Jeff Wadlow’s last film, Truth or Dare. But one question remains unsolved when the credits roll: who on earth is this film for? Based on a hit US TV show from the late 70s, it’s a reimagining that turns a campy fantasy into a darker, hard-to-define mixture of The Cabin in the Woods, Westworld and Lost. It’s a strange beast, never fully committing to jumpy horror, trippy sci-fi or soapy melodrama. Instead, it makes a clumsy attempt to do it all, taking itself far too seriously but with such goofy earnestness that it almost wins you over. The conceit remains roughly the same as in the original series: guests arrive at a tropical island expecting their fantasies to be realised, but at a price they might not be aware of. Pulling the strings is Mr Roarke (Michael Peña), a white-suited, wisdom-spewing enigma whose motivation is a mystery. His latest batch of guests have various issues to work through, from avenging a high-school bully to revisiting a failed romance. As they’re dragged further into the island’s supernatural recesses, they realise something might be afoot. As the latest offering from Blumhouse, the hit-making production company behind Get Out, Split, Happy Death Day and The Invisible Man, you’d be forgiven for expecting more scares. But Wadlow has something bigger in mind, and there’s something to admire in his ambitious agenda that stretches a modest $7m budget to laudable lengths. Yet the scenarios he concocts with co-writers Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs aren’t quite as juicy as he seems to think they are, and the film unravels as it heads towards its spectacularly ridiculous finale. The ramped-up silliness clashes with the script’s unearned lurches into self-serious drama, with laughable late attempts to turn the film’s chesspiece characters into figures of empathy. It’s a fantasy scenario for no one."
"‘Disaster” is how Gwyneth Paltrow has summed up her role in the 2001 film Shallow Hal, which will surprise few people who have actually seen it. Jack Black plays Hal, a man so shallow he has to be hypnotised in order to date a fat woman, who, through his boggled eyes, he sees as a very thin woman. The nastiness of Shallow Hal, which has long appalled critics and fans alike, was front and centre in the trailer, where Hal’s friend attempts to “rescue” him from speaking to a fat woman, Rosemary, who is, in fact, willowy Paltrow dressed in a fat suit. But because he cannot see what she looks like, he falls for her “inner beauty”. It is an uncomfortable mix – a film that pretends to preach body acceptance while simultaneously inviting laughter at bodies that don’t fit into jeans size six and under. Take the scene where she is called a “rhino”, or the one where she cannonballs into a swimming pool causing a tidal wave. The message built into the script’s DNA is simple: fat is funny; it is OK to laugh at fat people. This, Paltrow says now, was not clear to her until she had to live like a fat woman. “The first day I tried the fat suit on, I was in the Tribeca Grand and I walked through the lobby. It was so sad. It was so disturbing. No one would make eye contact with me because I was obese. I felt humiliated.” Fat characters rarely show up on TV and film, and when they do, they are hardly ever presented as people who deserve to be treated with dignity or respect. Despite public outcry over shows such as Insatiable – in which a formerly overweight teenager seeks revenge on the bullies who fat-shamed her while simultaneously being turned into a beauty pageant queen – and despite huge milestones being made with social media body-positivity trends, mainstream entertainment is yet to do much better. Toxic comments about people’s weight are abundant: Instagrammer Wendy Cheng felt comfortable enough recently to publicly criticise the model La’Shaunae Steward for her size, writing on her platform: “The morbidly obese should never have been seen as attractive.” For the people who are targets, jokes at their expense are like wounds – or as the singer and rapper Lizzo has put it: “Like a little mosquito bite. You don’t even know it’s there. But soon, you look up, you’re covered in mosquito bites.” As Paltrow has realised, even seemingly good-natured fat jokes are no shallow or insignificant thing. They hurt people, and then as now, need deeper reflection from those who choose to tell them."
"BDSM is – perhaps surprisingly – big news in Palm Springs, southern California. The director Jukka-Pekka Valkeapää, showing his new, fetish-themed, third feature, Dogs Don’t Wear Pants, at a festival in the city, was confronted with a crowd of incredulous pensioners. “There was a question: is this BDSM thing real? Is it invented?” he says, chuckling. One shocked septuagenarian collared him after the screening to inquire after the mental health of the film’s hero: a widower who, after losing his wife in a drowning accident, tumbles headlong into the S&M scene. “She was saying: ‘No, he’s gone crazy. He’s totally lost it,’” says Valkeapää, hooting with laughter. He simmers down. “It’s not a very noble thing to achieve, disturbing old ladies.” Dogs Don’t Wear Pants is indeed disconcerting, but in the best possible way. Rather than being a 50 Shades-style glossy brochure-tour of BDSM, it uses the scene to get intimate with the film’s lead couple – and explore the meaning, and the price, of true emotional honesty. The grieving Juha (Pekka Strang) is on autopilot until he takes his teenage daughter to a tattoo parlour and stumbles into the dungeon next door. There he meets Mona (Krista Kosonen), whose asphyxiation sessions give him a gateway to the final moments with his wife. Morbid on paper, Valkeapää’s kooky, tender film holds you under, then leaves you gasping with renewed lust for life. Valkeapää had no experience of the BDSM scene, nor had the writer whose script he inherited. So he asked his script consultant, a dominatrix called Wild Ira, if he and his actors could attend her sessions. Wild Ira was more than happy to oblige. So the team found themselves opposite a shackled punter being given the works. “She made the session from our point of view,” says Valkeapää, his euphonious Finnish vowels tickling the phone line. “She brought the client closer and closer to us during the whole session. I was just trying to concentrate on keeping myself on the chair.” Being in the room affected him deeply, he says – beyond the intellectual realisation that BDSM, with its “dramaturgy”, had strong affinities with storytelling. “These power dynamics had a very primitive quality, like those between a newborn and an adult who is the caretaker,” he says. “The newborn is the weak one, but still: the newborn is controlling the strong one. And also dependent on them. Nobody can avoid these emotions, or at least I couldn’t.” The team participated in three sessions; in the second, the customer had some kind of a seizure that abruptly halted things. “To see the client and the dominatrix, from being into this roleplay of teasing and being teased, suddenly become normal, like everyday people in an accident … that clash was really interesting,” says Strang. “It’s a pretend world, but it’s pretended in the same way as what I do for a living.” Strang had some fetish previous, after his lead role in 2017’s Tom of Finland biopic, but he also had doubts about the film. “There’s always a risk with these rough sexuality scenes that it might come off a bit pretended, or pretentious, like a 90s hardcore movie,” he says. Kosonen, one of Finland’s most famous female actors, needed convincing this was not just a sexy Miss Whiplash-style part; also, at that time, she was in the running for a role in Terminator: Dark Fate. But Valkeapää’s sensitivity to the emotions in the air, rather than the kinky paraphernalia, won them over. It was in at the deep end for Strang and Kosonen’s first day at work: him stripped naked; her shrinkwrapped toe-to-neck in rubber, whipping and choking him. “I said: ‘Please be rough enough that I don’t have to act,’” says Strang; they also employed each other’s real names as makeshift safewords. As much as simulating the physical BDSM experience, Strang insists he wanted to stay mentally “undressed”, too: “In sex scenes, actors tend to laugh it off and jump around naked. But I went the other way. Used the awkwardness and the anxiety that I was feeling and made it bigger.” Valkeapää says that thinking about the film in relation to the traditional romcom helped open it up: “This kind of obsession and attitude of: ‘You don’t love me, but you will.’ If you look at Sleepless in Seattle, Love Actually, most romcoms, they are filled with stalkers.” Valkeapää was also inspired in his subversion tactics by Manchester By the Sea, specifically by its use of Tomaso Albinoni’s well-worn Adagio for a tragic flashback. “I couldn’t believe they used this music. It’s as if you opened the sadness folder, and that’s the first thing you found. For a film that was so skilfully made, it showed such mediocre taste.” So he used the piece to overlay a sex scene, in which Juha’s one-night stand insists on putting it on to get her in the mood, but then can’t stop laughing. The BDSM community – used to being patronised on film – has responded with “overwhelming positivity” on forums, Valkeapää says. The Palm Springs community, at least the seniors, with bewilderment.  And what of him? Isn’t there a dom in every director? Aren’t they the kind of control freaks who mete out harsh sanction for every errant detail, such as misusing sad music in arthouse movies? Valkeapää thinks for a second. “I don’t think that analogy is the right one. When you’re making a film, it’s very hard to control everything; it’s not something I have illusions about. I think film-making is closer to being a gardener than a dominatrix. You’re subject to the forces of nature all the time, and you try to keep the flowers alive.” Dogs Don’t Wear Pants is out on 20 March"
"There’s an irresistible external narrative attached to Warrior director Gavin O’Connor’s new alcoholism drama The Way Back: the addict at its centre is played by Ben Affleck, an actor only recently embracing sobriety. While prepping the movie, Affleck was also entering rehab and has spoken since of how playing the role was a unique form of therapy, an intriguing real-world dimension for a film that reads on paper like familiar plane movie fodder. Because the other off-screen journey is that of a project slated for an awards-friendly, festival-bowing October release yanked back to the first weekend of March, a month not typically associated with serious-minded adult dramas. The story of an alcoholic who finds redemption by coaching a high school basketball team, The Way Back sits awkwardly between muted character study and Disney sports movie, mercifully shying away from sentimental cliche yet failing to add enough depth to work as something more substantive. It sleepily hits the beats we expect but without the emotion or passion required to make them land, a by-the-numbers exercise from someone with barely enough energy to count. Affleck is Jack Cunningham, a former high school basketball star whose days consist of working in construction and whose nights revolve around drinking himself into a stupor. What the film does manage to successfully convey is the sheer joylessness of drinking to excess for many addicts. Often on screen, we’ll see an alcoholic start the night as the life and soul of the bar before then falling into self-pitying darkness, but there’s something bracing about that being replaced with a sort of resigned compulsiveness instead. In one of the best scenes, we see Jack spend a night at home with a fridge filled with 30-odd cans of beer. His well-rehearsed routine of placing one in the freezer while starting another leaves him with an empty fridge by the time he mumbles himself to sleep, a bleak window into his lonely weekday life. When he receives an offer from his old high school to coach the ailing basketball team, his initial instinct is to turn it down and what the film is less successful in showing is why his mind then suddenly changes. The majority of the basketball plot feels like it’s been implanted from elsewhere as the script, co-written by O’Connor and Out of the Furnace writer Brad Inglesby, has precious little interest in fleshing out the specifics of Jack’s coaching. There’s no real journey here to speak of: he arrives, barks a few orders, they start winning every game. It’s all far far too easy and so what should have been rousing is instead decidedly flat. O’Connor who previously made the more openly formulaic sports pic Miracle for Disney, is clearly aware of the crowd-pleasing structure of the subgenre and he recycles it here adequately but without any real verve. The kids Jack coaches are ciphers, with two or three of them allowed a brief scene each, but none of them ever coming close to resembling an actual person and there’s no real detail in any of his advice, no scenes of them trying and failing to work better as a team. It just sort of … happens. While, as mentioned, there’s a bit more specificity to Jack’s drinking, it’s not handled with quite enough depth to counter the shallow nature of the sports side of the film. His addiction is easily explained away as the result of a traumatic event in his past, a pat reveal which ignores the messy reality that sometimes people just drink too much without experiencing something devastating first. The scenes between Jack and his ex-wife are perfunctorily scripted and, playing her, The Morning Show’s Janina Gavankar has an entirely thankless task, exemplified most brutally in their final scene together, which denies her a single line of dialogue. It’s really just a vehicle for Affleck, and a fitting one at that, and he’s solid at underplaying what could have been a more outsized role. But O’Connor pulls back so much at so many moments that there’s not a great deal he can really squeeze out of his character, who like everyone else in the film feels sorely underwritten. The Way Back is a film stuck on the runway, quietly circling around, always threatening to fly but never managing to get off the ground. It was a cathartic experience for Affleck but for the rest of us, it carries very little weight."
"I knew that Sonic the Hedgehog would be a hit film long before it came out, because I have a secret weapon: a five-year-old. My son latched on to the Sonic trailer – the updated one, not the disastrous one – the instant he saw it, and we watched it over and over (and over) for months. He made me act it out. He asked for Sonic-themed birthday presents. He loved the trailer so much that, when we went to see the film, he was palpably disappointed that it didn’t contain the cover version of Blitzkrieg Bop used in the trailer. It was obvious from seeing the trailer that Sonic would be a hit. This got me thinking. Can I use my five-year-old (and, where possible, my two-year-old) to predict the success of a film based on its trailer? This morning during breakfast, I made them sit and watch a batch, in the hope that one of them would be the next Sonic the Hedgehog. Here are my findings. Pixar’s film about two elf brothers who semi-successfully revive their dead father doesn’t have the immediacy of Sonic the Hedgehog, but nevertheless my kids watched the trailer transfixed. Did they want to see the film? “It looks funny, because the man turns too tiny in it,” the five-year-old said, referring to the final joke in the trailer. What else did you like? “Can we watch the Sonic trailer now?” Signs for Onward’s commercial success are not good. I was forced to watch the James Corden Peter Rabbit film on a sick day a few weeks ago, and it was actually much better than I would have guessed based on its horrible trailer. So I had high hopes for the sequel, which is out this month. Five seconds into the trailer, my two-year-old shouts: “FUNNY!” And then: “THIS IS A TRAILER!” And then, when Peter Rabbit Rabbit eats a rotten apple, he shouts: “THERE’S AN APPLE IN THE TRAILER!” Then: “TOMATOES!” The trailer got two big, sustained laughs out of my kids. When it finished, the five-year-old declared it to be, “The funniest thing I ever heard,” and the two-year-old pointed at the screen and intoned the word: “Cheeky.” Based on this, I suspect Peter Rabbit 2 will be a Paddington 2-style crossover hit. In which hard-boiled intelligence agent Dave Bautista mimics Kindergarten Cop by looking after a child for some reason. The trailer was met with open hostility. “It’s a bit too scary and bit too boring,” the five-year-old says 10 seconds in. One minute later, he asks of Bautista: “Why does he keep killing everything, but not his family?” That’s a good question, I reply. Why do you think? “Because he likes his family, but he’s a baddie.” The two-year-old attempts to lift the mood by telling me that I look like Bautista, but it’s too little, too late. The trailer is abandoned before it ends, and this leaves no doubt that My Spy will be a gigantic flop. Now to the biggest surprise of the test: Disney’s forthcoming live-action Mulan remake. We’re treated to a stately panorama shot of ancient China, and the five-year-old confirms my worst suspicions by sighing and saying: “This looks too much like a grownup film.” But then an army starts running up the side of a wall and the kids are in. “Woah,” the five-year-old shouts, setting up what will almost definitely end up being a poster quote: “This is boring but cool!” Then he asks: “Is this in China?” and perks up enormously. “This has great music!” he shouts. After it ends, he says: “Awesome, very cool.” Mulan will be an inevitable hit. After the surprise success of Mulan’s trailer, the one for the Michael Caine and Russell Brand adaptation of Jacqueline Wilson’s novel Four Children and It didn’t stand a chance. I chose the minute-long trailer, but not even it could hold their attention. “I want breakfast,” the two-year-old yelled. I tried appealing to the five-year-old. Is it good? Would you watch it? “The monster gave the kids powers,” he replied. Do you want a monster to give you powers? “No. Can I watch Sonic now?”"
"James Bond fans have called for the global release of No Time to Die to be delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The global premiere of the film, Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007, is set for the Royal Albert Hall on 31 March ahead of an international release at the beginning of April. The founders of two of the most popular fan sites – M16 Confidential and The James Bond Dossier – have written an open letter to the film’s producers asking for it to be delayed until summer citing public health concerns. “It is by no means easy to say this: the release of No Time to Die should be postponed,” says the open letter to EON, MGM and Universal. “It is time to put public health above marketing release schedules and the cost of cancelling publicity events. It’s just a movie.” Publicity tours have already been cancelled in China, South Korea and Japan, and Hong Kong has delayed the release of the film until 30 April. “Hundreds of fans and celebrities from around the world will be flying to the UK to attend,” said the co-writers of the letter, James Page and David Leigh. “The Royal Albert Hall capacity is above the 5,000 limit that affected countries are banning for public gatherings. Just one person, who may not even show symptoms, could infect the rest of the audience. This is not the type of publicity anyone wants.” The letter argues that as the coronavirus spreads fans will stay away from movie theatres. “The situation by late March and early April will not be conducive to the box office,” it says. “[Waiting] another few months will not damage the quality of the film and only help the box office for Daniel Craig’s final hurrah.” Disney’s plan to kick off its entry into the European streaming wars with a glitzy event to promote Disney+ has been left in tatters after the company cancelled over coronavirus fears. The entertainment firm had planned a star-studded private event in west London on Thursday, with hundreds due to attend from across Europe to unveil the service before its consumer launch on 24 March. “Due to a number of media attendee cancellations and increasing concerns at the prospect of travelling internationally at this time, we have decided to cancel our Disney+ launch events scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday,” the company said.  On Tuesday, Disney announced a deal with Sky to make its new streaming service available to millions of UK households. Disney+ is to be integrated into the Sky Q box, to be followed by Sky’s Now TV streaming service in the coming months. Disney+ will also be available as a standalone app."
"Here is a genially mediocre throwback to what has always been a rite of passage for US cinema’s frontline action men: the musclebound star demonstrating how good he is with kids, the better to establish a pension fund that may come in useful when their knees finally give out. Stomping along in the highly profitable footsteps of Schwarzenegger (Kindergarten Cop), Hulk Hogan (Mr Nanny, Suburban Commando) and Dwayne Johnson (practically his entire filmography), we now find erstwhile galaxy guardian Dave Bautista cast as a rough-edged CIA ass-kicker handed the last-chance assignment of babysitting fatherless tween Chloe Coleman. The ideal viewer would, like Coleman, be anyone too young to have suffered Vin Diesel in The Pacifier; accompanying adults will be mostly unsurprised, maybe mildly diverted. After raising a 12A-rated terror threat, writers Jon and Erich Hoeber pause for an hour so our guy can bond with the moppet and her mom (Parisa Fitz-Henley), whose panicky plumbing blunders are a retrograde nudge that she really requires a man about the house. Director Peter Segal contributes a few spoofy gags that would have slotted into his Naked Gun three-quel of 1994, but the most 90s element is Dominic Lewis’s score, insistently demarcating shtick “heartwarming” or “comic”. Gruff and roundheaded – not unlike a jacked Phil Collins – Bautista is amiable company, although he seems bemused at having to take dodgeballs to the face this early in his movie career, and perhaps by the mixed messaging. After doing all it can to persuade us America needs tough guys to watch over its young, My Spy climaxes with a group effort to repel its villains then a polite request for equal pay. Lowish-level titters are in evidence – mostly care of Kristen Schaal as Dave’s tech aide – while an analogue finale on a scrappy-looking airfield offers passing respite from the multiplex’s usual VFX-bloated city smashing. "
"How do you solve a problem like reviewing The Hunt? The schlocky horror film would ordinarily garner little attention beyond genre fans and a handful of critics. But after months of buildup touting it as a satire about liberal elites hunting rural Trump voters, the film now comes with some baggage. The Hunt, directed by Craig Zobel and written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof, appears at first glance to purposely provoke – one character references “the rat-fucker-in-chief”, another talks of “slaughtering a dozen deplorables” (a reference to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” remark). The context of this line becaomes clear when the plot gets going: 12 people wake up, gagged and confused, in the woods while a mysterious box sits nearby, filled with weapons. (The script is loosely inspired by Richard Connell’s 1924 short story The Most Dangerous Game, about a rich man who hunts other humans for sport.) It doesn’t take long for every variety of death – shooting, exploding, stabbing – to descend from a hidden and prepared upper class. The violence is gratuitous if cartoonish – one woman is shot at, impaled and then blown in half. But The Hunt does play with who to root for and who, if anyone, you can trust. Deaths are often swift and occasionally surprising; the characters are one-line stereotypes – rural woman from Wyoming, white wannabe rapper from Florida, Staten Islander who loves guns (Ike Barinholtz), Ivanka fan in leggings (Emma Roberts) – and are picked off one by one. The only “deplorable” with a clue how to fight back is Crystal (Betty Gilpin), a mysterious woman with an even more mysterious knowledge of martial arts. The Hunt’s release in the middle of coronavirus fears in the US is another unlucky development in the film’s rollout. It was originally slated for release last September, but mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, prompted a postponement. Soon after, details about the film emerged and rightwing anger followed, even from Trump himself. In February, it returned with an updated marketing strategy riffing on the controversy. A more spoiler-heavy trailer meant to frame the concept as a joke featured the tagline: “The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one’s actually seen.” The film-makers have claimed they didn’t anticipate any controversy from a film pitting “liberal elites” against “deplorables” in a violent human hunt, which seems like lobbing a mock grenade into a minefield and getting upset when people scatter. Nevertheless, they have something of a point: if you can set aside the noise, you’re left with a boilerplate B-movie that doesn’t say nearly as much as it thinks it does. The jokes are the words of stereotypes spoken with a straight face, an opportunity to have a character say “climate change is real”, poke fun at white liberal NPR listeners who debate using “black” v “African-American” (“White people – we’re the worst,” says one elite in reference to everything except his killing), and imbue “did you read that article?” with more menace. Which isn’t to say it completely lacks redeeming qualities, namely Gilpin. It’s good fun to watch her slink into a bunker and spit, “Bye, bitch,” or drawl through a rendition of The Tortoise and the Hare that ends in more violence. She bounces back from various injury in a matter of seconds and has a genuinely entertaining one-on-one fight with Hilary Swank, as chief elite villain. The rest of the satire, however, struggles to translate. In creating characters that embody the worst stereotypes of America’s political poles, and making America’s divide as literal and violent as possible, The Hunt feigns a viewpoint rather than actually putting one forward. It takes aim at everyone, redeeming no one. Which feels circular, and queasy, and takes us right back where we started: some empty talk about a divided nation, and a film not worthy of this much conversation."
"Premiering at the tail-end of this year’s Sundance film festival to faint applause, the earnest fact-based drama Lost Girls has made a swift beeline less than two months later for its rightful home: Netflix. While the platform has increasingly stretched itself to prove that it can, or at least try to, do everything, one of its most consistently popular subgenres is true crime, proved by everything from Making a Murderer to the recent hit The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, appealing to an endless, morally dubious, public lust for violence, tragedy and, sometimes, justice. Its output in this area can often feel exploitative, not a word that describes Lost Girls, a sensitively made yet frustratingly plodding film based on a still unsolved spate of killings by the so-called Long Island Serial Killer, detailed in a bestselling book by journalist Robert Kolker. Police believe that he killed between 10 and 16 people over a 20-year period but the film zeroes in on one missing young woman and how the search for her led to the discovery of four other bodies. It’s a tale of righteous indignation, police incompetence and the inability of men with authority to listen to and believe the voices of women. Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan) is a mother struggling on the breadline, working two jobs to try to provide for her two daughters. A third, her eldest Shannan, lives elsewhere with Mari reluctantly asking her for financial assistance every now and then. Exactly where Shannan gets her money from is unspoken but known by Mari, a family secret that gets unearthed when Shannan goes missing. As a sex worker who found her clients on Craigslist (the perpetrator was also known as the Craigslist Killer), Shannan was quickly ignored or at least de-prioritised by police, who judged her in the same broad and moralistic way that the media also did at the time. Unwilling to let her daughter’s disappearance become old news, Mari rallies together with the families of women whose bodies have been found and starts to put the pieces together with or without police help. Lost Girls is the first narrative feature from documentarian Liz Garbus, whose previous subjects have covered everything from Nina Simone to the Holocaust, and throughout the film, she struggles to find the right balance between muted naturalism and button-pushing Hollywood formula. Admirable restraint in some scenes is followed by crusty cliche in others and while some actors dial it down, others lean into tropes, such as Lola Kirke as a cartoonish prostitute and 30 Rock’s Dean Winters as a bumbling cop. Ryan is similarly unmodulated, believably raw at times and then uncomfortably grandstanding at others. It’s a pleasure to see her given so much screen time but it’s not a performance that ever cuts quite as deep as it needs to, our emotional attachment to the unfolding devastation wavering at best. Garbus and screenwriter Michael Werwie embed the film with a timely anger, showing us an all-too-familiar culture of victim-shaming and unfairly attributed blame, all at the feet of women. There’s also an undercurrent of respect afforded to those working in the sex industry who too often get labelled on and off screen and the film is never less than well-intentioned but intentions only get us so far. As sincere and as sensitive as the film might be, it’s never as involving or as effective as the story at its centre. One of the most shocking details is revealed in a text coda which thrusts a poorly developed subplot to the forefront, one of many strands and character dynamics that don’t get enough time or depth. At 95 minutes, Lost Girls is sorely lacking and, ironically, one wonders what a Garbus docuseries could have found instead."
"Game of Thrones actor Mark Stanley gives a less-is-more masterclass in acting in this low-key social realist drama from Scott Graham, set in a rundown Aberdeenshire fishing town. It’s a film with echoes of Andrea Arnold and perhaps Ken Loach – but Graham is a local boy, and brings a sense of place and character that is all his own. And Stanley is terrific: real and believable playing a family man in his 30s nagged by a sense that his life has gone nowhere. He’s become a kind of zombified version of himself, mumbling and clenched, with no way of communicating how he feels. Stanley plays Finnie, who as a teenager was a boy racer. Back then, he got matching Bruce Springsteen tattoos – Born to Run – with his girlfriend Katie (Amy Manson) and dreamed of getting out. Instead, they got married and had two children. Finnie now works in a fish-gutting factory, and the years have made him angry and exhausted. When Katie buys him a going-out shirt he shrugs; where are they going to go? These days it’s Finnie’s teenage son, Kid (Anders Hayward), who races cars, with his pregnant off-on girlfriend, Kelly (brilliantly played by Marli Siu). One night, after a family row, Finnie takes Kid’s car out, and ends up with Kelly in the passenger seat. Suddenly, he sees the possibility of a different life, a second act, a chance to do things differently and put his mistakes right. The film isn’t perfect. Some of the emotional scenes feel flat or underpowered; but moments in the car when Finnie is driving suicidally fast are horribly tense. And for a story about manhood in crisis, the women here are satisfyingly three-dimensional; it’s their tenderness that gives the film its beating heart. Finnie’s wife, Katie, is sparky and wise. And pregnant Kelly has the best line, delivered with humour and heartbreaking vulnerability: “How can someone love you the one day and not the next? I still love everyone I’ve ever loved. I’m like a dog.”  Run is released in the UK on 13 March."
"When the great Swedish actor Max von Sydow died last week at the age of 90, it was the mark of a robust and catholic career that there was little consensus between news outlets over which of his performances should lead the obituaries. More highbrow publications foregrounded his longtime collaboration with Ingmar Bergman, while others leaned toward English-speakers with The Exorcist. Blockbuster-oriented showbiz sites referred to him as the star of Game of Thrones and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. One headline briefly went viral on Twitter declaring “Max von Sydow, voice of Vigo in Ghostbusters 2, dead at 90”: it turned out to be from a dedicated Ghostbusters news site, so fair enough, but still. IMDb, meanwhile, has him indexed as “Max von Sydow: actor, Flash Gordon”. It’s safe to say, he was many things to many people. With more than 115 films made across 70 years, Von Sydow’s career is easier than most to honour with a streaming marathon. Some of his most essential showcases – Jan Troell’s stirring, beautiful family saga The Emigrants and The New Land; Ingmar Bergman’s shattering, surreal wartime marriage study Shame – can only be found on DVD in the UK. But through the likes of Amazon, iTunes and the BFI Player, you can programme a pretty thorough overview of a remarkable career, one marked as much by the grace and wit that Von Sydow brought to very serious films as the committed gravitas he brought to throwaway entertainment. You have to start with the Bergmans, don’t you? The 11 films he made with the Swedish auteur, from 1957’s The Seventh Seal (on BFI Player) to 1971’s The Touch (ditto) were instrumental in shaping the creative legacies of both men, even if the popular reputation they gained for granite-heavy solemnity isn’t entirely justified. The playing-Death-at-chess metaphor of The Seventh Seal is so easily parodied that many forget, or never find out, how nimble, poetic and drily funny Bergman’s existential fantasy is. It immediately and indelibly established Von Sydow’s screen image of stoic dignity, though that would later be pushed by the howling despair of his role as a grieving, vengeful father in The Virgin Spring (on Amazon), Bergman’s single most brutal, wounded work. And the still underrated The Magician (Amazon) is as complex and changeable a showcase as Bergman ever wrote for the star: a cool, frightening character study of a travelling 19th-century illusionist who may or may not have some manner of magic touch. Away from Bergman, Von Sydow still fared best with his fellow Scandinavians. It’s a shame his Troell collaborations have yet to hit any UK streaming sites, but Bille August’s Pelle the Conqueror is on iTunes, and indispensable for Von Sydow scholars. His mighty, heart-tearing tour de forceas an immigrant father trying to forge a new life for his son in rural Denmark earned him his first of two Oscar nominations (the other came a few years ago for keeping his head silently above the affected mess of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close), and conveys bone-deep pain and parental desperation without a hint of trumped-up sentimentality. August’s effective, affecting film, a Palme d’Or winner in its day, hasn’t aged as strikingly, but the performance (left) still stuns. Von Sydow’s international career, meanwhile, is a fascinating mixed bag, completing an impressive checklist of top-tier auteurs – from Martin Scorsese to Lars von Trier, David Lynch to Wim Wenders – though not always in top-tier roles. His best, most fully shaded English-language performances came in The Exorcist (on Chili) and Hannah and Her Sisters (Amazon), in which his funny but lacerating portrayal of bottomless depression proved a perfect spiritual foil to Woody Allen’s more self-aware, Bergman-fixated Eeyore-ism. That’s not to dismiss the deadpan camp of his aged-cheese villainy in Flash Gordon (free on Now TV, if you must) or Never Say Never Again (iTunes). Or even his surprisingly elegant, expressive Hollywood debut as Jesus Christ in the otherwise very stolid, very long mid-1960s biblical epic The Greatest Story Ever Told – on Amazon if you have a whole rainy afternoon to kill. That’s a role impossible to play credibly without equal parts integrity and plunging reserves of darkness: from his first duel with Death to his final passing, Von Sydow had both. 21 Bridges (Sony, 15) A surprisingly tight and tidy police thriller that benefits from Chadwick Boseman’s swaggering charisma, as a detective locking down Manhattan in pursuit of cop killers, to juice up its lean, B-movie plotting. Judy and Punch (Picturehouse, 15) Overlooked in cinemas, Mirrah Foulkes’s flawed but invigorating debut gives the titular puppet panto an elaborate feminist spin, shifting into a mob-justice allegory that escalates in wild and unexpected ways. Them That Follow (Sony, 15) An unexpected post-Oscar role for Olivia Colman: as a snake-handling Pentecostal petrol station attendant in Appalachia, one of a sect oppressing a young woman (Alice Englert) in this slow-burning but luridly compelling indie. Sunday Bloody Sunday (BFI, 15) An excellent reissue of John Schlesinger’s greatest film, a biting yet tender queer love triangle steeped in the contradictory sexual politics of early 1970s Britain, laden with extras including two early Schlesinger shorts. Long Day’s Journey Into Night(Eureka, PG) Finally available on Blu-ray, Sidney Lumet’s 1962 film of the Eugene O’Neill classic features Katharine Hepburn at her mightiest. It’s not Lumet’s most inspired film-making, but you won’t see a better-acted version on stage."
"Kate Beckinsale has described an obscenity-filled rant by Harvey Weinstein in which he allegedly called her “stupid fucking cunt” after he objected to her choice of outfit for a film premiere in 2001. In a post on social media, Beckinsale outlined events after a screening for the romcom Serendipity, in which she starred opposite John Cusack. She said Weinstein insisted on holding the premiere only a few weeks after the 9/11 attacks, calling it “the most insensitive, tone deaf, disrespectful idea possible”. Beckinsale said Weinstein had arranged for her to visit his home with her two-year-old daughter, and then launched a tirade at her when they were alone. According to Beckinsale, Weinstein was enraged that she wore a white suit and tie rather than a “tight dress”. “The minute the door closed, he started screaming, ‘You stupid fucking CUNT, you CUNT you ruined my premiere.’ I had no idea what he was talking about and started to shake … He said, ‘If I am throwing a red carpet, you get in a tight dress, you shake your ass, you shake your tits, you do not go down it looking like a fucking lesbian, you stupid fucking cunt.’” Beckinsale said she “burst into tears”, before objecting that the city was still in shock after the World Trade Center attacks. She added: “He said, ‘I don’t care – it’s my fucking premiere and if I want pussy on the red carpet that’s what I get.’ Screaming. Livid.” Beckinsale expressed relief over Weinstein’s 23-year prison sentence, saying she was “punished” as a result of the incident, “and for other instances where I said no to him for years, insidiously and seeming irreversibly”. “I hope [it] will be a deterrent to that sort of behavior in this and any other industry … Having said that, the crimes that are not crimes, the inhumane bullying and sick covert abuse for which there is STILL no recourse no matter who you tell (and I did tell), these too need to go.”"
"Inventively adapted from a story in Colin Barrett’s Young Skins collection, this striking directorial feature debut from Nick Rowland (who was Bafta-nominated for his 2014 short Slap) is an immersive tale of tortured masculinity and divided loyalties that pulls the viewer right into the raging bull mindset of its haunted protagonist. Set in rural Ireland, and boasting something of the “West Country western” flavour of Sam Peckinpah’s Cornish epic Straw Dogs, it’s a fable of failed fathers and false families, unflinching in its depiction of grim realities, but laced with a redemptive transcendence that reminded me of Andrew Haigh’s Lean on Pete, or Chloé Zhao’s The Rider. Cosmo Jarvis (unrecognisable from his magnetic turn in Lady Macbeth) delivers a performance of few words but hugely eloquent physicality as Douglas “Arm” Armstrong, combining the powerhouse presence of Matthias Schoenaerts in Bullhead with the broken-boxer vulnerability of Jason Patric in After Dark, My Sweet. Having been traumatised – both physically and mentally – as a brutal youth in the ring, Arm took what looked like an escape route, becoming an enforcer for the notorious Devers clan. He calls them “my family”, but he’s more like their attack dog, answering to the clicks and whistles (“there’s a good boy”) of Barry Keoghan’s insidiously bullying Dympna. We meet Arm delivering a gruelling beating that will notably fail to satisfy the Deverses’ blood lust, with fatal consequences. Yet beneath the knuckles and muscles, Arm (who was “a violent child”) is riddled with insecurities, particularly concerning his ex-girlfriend Ursula (Niamh Algar) and their young son, Jack (Kiljan Tyr Moroney), a five-year-old with autism whose equine-therapy sessions inspire the film’s enigmatic title. Ursula wants to move to Cork, where she has found a school that can attend to Jack’s needs. But Arm is in no hurry to aid their departure, still clinging to his dreams of becoming a good father. Juxtaposing flashes of lens-flared sunlight with empty daytime greys and hellish nocturnal black and red hues, Calm With Horses uses a bold colour palette to accentuate the quasi-mythical themes of its seemingly down-to-earth story. There’s something genuinely demonic about Ned Dennehy’s Paudi, the foul red-eyed apparition at the heart of the Devers family who becomes Arm’s tormentor-in-chief. Yet like Ben Wheatley, Rowland places such horrors cheek-by-jowl with absurdist kitchen-sink comedy, with Hector (David Wilmot) channelling the spirit of Father Ted’s Dermot Morgan as he attempts to ingratiate himself with a wealthy widow, while keeping inconvenient familial nastiness at a polite distance. As for Arm, his life is divided between the unfeeling brutality of his job and the clumsy empathy that is starting to make him pull his punches. A scene in which he struggles helplessly to calm one of Jack’s screaming fits suggests that he has no handle on his son’s experience, yet it also chimes with an opening voiceover suggesting that father and son have long been locked in the same struggle. No wonder Arm winds up briefly riding the horse that has helped to calm Jack, suggesting that this destructive cycle – this legacy of attempting to make sense of the world through violence – could perhaps be broken. “This isn’t you,” Arm is told as he does the Deverses’ bidding, a phrase echoed in Ursula’s heartbreaking declaration that “you remind me of you sometimes … you know, I miss you”. Buoyed by Joe Murtagh’s screenplay, which keeps the warring elements of the narrative elegantly balanced throughout, the excellent ensemble cast create a complex emotional ecosystem through which our troubled antihero stumbles in search of his identity. Cinematographer Piers McGrail contrasts broad landscape vistas with claustrophobic interiors, and even injects a Friedkin-esque sense of reckless energy into a down-and-dirty car chase, which unexpectedly pumps up the third act. Meanwhile, a superb electronic score by Blanck Mass (aka Benjamin John Power) gets right under the skin of the drama, lending an edge of frayed distortion to melancholy melodies, capturing the film’s blend of roughness and innocence. Like Daniel Lopatin’s pulsing accompaniment to the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems, the score for Calm With Horses seems to inject itself into the bloodstream of the central characters, helping us to see the world through their eyes, and share their often fractured experiences. Matis Rei’s supple sound design completes the picture, woozily weaving in and out of the score, leading us through these shifting moods with heady ease."
"Like hemlines or facial hair, the Batmobile has always been a barometer of fashion – from Adam West’s extravagantly finned 60s version to Tim Burton’s 80s stretch limo to Christopher Nolan’s urban battle machine. Judging by early images, Robert Pattinson’s ride in the forthcoming reboot resembles none of these so much as a 1970s muscle car. This is bang on trend, because if you want to be taken seriously in the movies these days, a muscle car is what you need to be driving. The definition is vague but the term broadly applies to a handful of souped-up US models of the late 60s and early 70s, whose mean lines and outsized horsepower made them the coolest cars on screen. None of your fancy European sports cars, thank you; these were more like crime cars, built for a fast getaway, an interstate smuggling run, or a leap across a rickety bridge that the pursuing cop cars just weren’t going to make. Muscle cars were lionised at the time in movies such as Vanishing Point, The Driver, Bullitt, Two-Lane Blacktop, Smokey and the Bandit, Gone in 60 Seconds (in the 2000 remake the most sought-after car was basically the same model), not to mention the good ol’ Dukes of Hazzard, which eventually ran out of Dodge Chargers to trash. Half a century on, they are very much back in vogue. While all kinds of flashy new models drift through the Fast and Furious franchise, Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto, for example, keeps it firmly old-school, lovingly restoring (then usually trashing) 1970s classics, beginning with the Dodge Charger his daddy gave him. On the character posters for Furious 9, there’s Diesel in classic pose, frowning, biceps bulging, in front of yet another Charger. It is probably written into his contract. He is not the only one: see also Ryan Gosling in Drive, Kurt Russell in Death Proof, and John Wick, who drives a 69 Ford Mustang (“She’s not for sale”). The recent Ford vs Ferrari pined for a similar vintage. And let’s not forget Clint Eastwood’s beloved 1972 Ford Gran Torino, which kicks off a rumpus in his movie of the same title. Like so many others, it symbolises a bygone era of not just powerful motor cars but the macho values that went with them. Muscle cars might look way cool on a film poster but you can’t help feeling they are the kind of “proper cars for proper men” Jeremy Clarkson would approve of. None of which bodes particularly well for Batman’s fresh start. If he really wanted to reflect the times, perhaps he should be driving something greener. A Prius, maybe? Although the last thing you want as a caped crusader is people climbing into the back thinking you’re an Uber. Who knows, perhaps Pattinson’s Batmobile will turn out to be a self-driving, solar-powered electric version. As long as it is black and looks mean, nobody will really mind. "
"When remembering the great Max von Sydow, it’s hard not to recall those iconic images of the medieval knight peering over the chess board into the sinister countenance of the grim reaper in Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, or receiving a tender shave from Mathieu Amalric in Julian Schnabel’s The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. But there was another side to the twice Oscar-nominated Swede. These days, it’s far from unusual to see an Oscar-winning doyen of the art house turning up as a villain in a superhero movie, or donning the mo-cap suit to play a four-limbed alien in some outrageous space fantasy. But back in the 80s, Von Sydow’s turns in the likes of Flash Gordon, Dune and Conan the Barbarian would have been a little more unexpected to the cinema-going public. Perhaps he just had the knack of choosing the right movies to ham it up in. John Milius’s Conan the Barbarian, from 1982, was a film essentially led by a bodybuilder with a limited grasp of English pronunciation (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and a statuesque 6ft-tall American dancer named Sandahl Bergman who had featured briefly in Bob Fosse’s All That Jazz but also had limited acting experience. But the presence of Von Sydow – along with Milius’s innate understanding of the brutality and glory of the swords and sorcery genre and a remarkable supporting cast – led to a fantasy film that stands alongside Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy at the very pinnacle of the genre. Von Sydow only appears briefly as King Osric the Usurper, who sets Conan and his friends on a quest to rescue the monarch’s daughter from the cult leader Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones on sparkling form), and yet he probably has more lines than Schwarzenegger. His majestically outraged diatribe on the horrors of Doom’s snake cult adds a genuine veneer of classical elegance to Robert E Howard’s pulp fantasy trappings, and reminds us we are not just watching some knuckle-headed action piece. Von Sydow had a rather larger part in the 1980 space romance Flash Gordon, another movie that blended serious thesps such as Brian Blessed and Timothy Dalton with untried actors (in this case, rookie model-turned-actor Sam J Jones in the title role). Whatever you think of the dubious wisdom of casting a Nordic actor as an alien with cod-oriental features in 2020, Von Sydow’s turn as Ming the Merciless is a thing of operatic grandeur. As with every Von Sydow performance, no matter how silly the project and how lowbrow the genre, there is never a sniff of suggestion that he is phoning it in: the actor, who had been a fan of the comics as a child, gives it everything as the cruel and maniacal cosmic nutter and is at the very heart of the movie. Yes, it’s pure space pantomime, but this is pantomime of the highest order, as full of delightfully hammy power chords as the Queen songs that soundtrack it. Von Sydow never did anything quite so brazenly burlesque as Flash Gordon in his later career. But it was surely turns such as these – as well as his appearance in the misfiring David Lynch space fantasy Dune – that led to him being cast as Lor San Tekka in JJ Abrams’s The Force Awakens. We never did find out (at least on screen) too much about the significance of the enigmatic Force acolyte in the first of Disney’s Star Wars films, but Von Sydow had enough presence in his short death scene with Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren to help jaded fans of the space opera believe in it again after the horrors of the prequel trilogy. A less typical Von Sydow genre performance was his fabulously evil turn as the frozen-hearted “pre-crime” police chief Lamar Burgess in Steven Spielberg’s beautifully crafted, futuristic thriller Minority Report, based on Philip K Dick’s 1956 short story about a world in which people are jailed for murders they have not yet committed. This was a rather more hard-boiled turn, as the clear-eyed, sober villain who knows he has set the controls for the heart of evil, but simply cannot bring himself to break up the dystopian clarity of a deeply dysfunctional system. I suspect it will be for his earlier, pulpier 80s films that fans of science fiction and fantasy will best remember him. For a generation or two of genre geeks, Von Sydow was that rare example of the serious thespian whose very presence could elevate ostensibly lightweight fantasy cinema into the most superlative of cultural touchstones, like Alec Guinness or James Earl Jones before him. He will be dearly missed."
"Digital deepfakery has progressed since this emerged in 1995, but there is a warm glow to be had from the adorable talking piglet who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. It melts in the mouth like a Waitrose pain au chocolat. Amélie is the innocently mischievous gamine who has whimsical fantasy adventures in Paris. As with others on this list, there is a debate about whether really great films deserve a “comfort” ranking, but Humphrey and Ingrid’s great romance in wartime Morocco soothes the soul. In troubled times, we all need a blast of supermodel Derek Zoolander’s compelling “blue steel” face. A film that never goes out of fashion. Perhaps this is cheating (you could as well put on something from your Downton Abbey TV DVD boxset) but a visit to the Crawley family’s leisured world will go down like a non-Christmas glass of sherry. The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly’s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents’ youth is always reassuring. Great performances from Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield and John Turturro in this true story of a rigged TV quiz show. A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying. Cinematic greatness is always comforting: wonderful songs and comedy in this fantastic New York musical with Vivian Blaine, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons. Director Rob Reiner makes the first of his two appearances on this list with this great romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal. Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s. Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Bythewood’s Love & Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It’s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court. This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film’s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan – led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny. When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot. A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called “botanising on the asphalt”. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago’s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad’s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it. The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people’s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV – and realise that have feelings for each other. Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night. At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber’s shop – and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back. All together now: “By Grabthar’s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!” Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called Galaxy Quest and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes’ help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection. William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: “Nobody knows anything.” But we certainly know that this film is absolutely great: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own. This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she’s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh’s appalling flatmate Spike who says: “I’m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins”, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily. A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia’s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president – and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia’s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US’s quasi-colonialism in action? Nancy Meyers is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don’t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the divorced woman with grown-up kids who is now a “chocolatier”, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way. Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time – and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives – and the way society somehow finds that a woman’s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage. Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep’s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway’s unwilling guide. There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: “We need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.” Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood – and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can’t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with Céline Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage – especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That’s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster – how it was going to be like Lew Grade’s Raise the Titanic; what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc – but the film’s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing."
"Sulphur and White is a painful, disturbing and absorbing episodic drama based on the life of NSPCC campaigner and abuse survivor David Tait – played here by Mark Stanley. As a young man in his 20s, Tait is a London financial trader with the sharp suits and dead-eyed demeanour of Patrick Bateman, the reptilian monster of American Psycho. But we can see that this master of the universe is the way he is because of a terrible childhood wound. Growing up in South Africa, his unhappy mum (Anna Friel) was bullied by an insecure dad (Dougray Scott) who, nervously keen to fit in with the social circle, allowed his teen son David to work part-time job at the petrol station where he was being abused by a paedophile ring of local men. And the horror escalated from there. As an adult, David is icy, hollowed-out, but fiercely committed to making something of his life, even as his marriage and state of mind continue to crumble. He endures a grotesquely parodic father-son relationship with his money-worshipping boss, Jeff (Alistair Petrie), but then falls for his colleague Vanessa (Emily Beecham), who might yet show him a way out of his misery. Where screenwriter Susie Farrell and director Julian Jarrold succeed is in constantly refusing an easy moment of empathy or relatability for David, even at the moment of crisis that starts the drama. He is almost always opaque, everything is alienated and traumatised and strange, and we, the audience, are estranged from him in the way everyone around him must have felt. The movie does not let us in to his feelings, except perhaps at the very end. A potent, valuable piece of work."
"Can I ask you something?” says Greg Kinnear, slightly nervously, toward the end of our conversation. “Did you notice that I’m wearing a prosthetic nose?” He is not talking about right now – he is on the other end of the line in a hotel room in British Columbia, so he could be sporting nothing but clogs for all I know – but rather how he appears in the new film Misbehaviour. In this British comedy-drama about the Women’s Liberation Movement protests that disrupted the 1970 Miss World event, he plays the US entertainer Bob Hope, who hosted the pageant that year and made no secret of his disdain for the idea of gender equality. A month earlier, the comic had appeared in a TV special, Bob Hope Looks at Women’s Lib, in which he imagined how different the TV networks would be if they were run by women: no televised sport but the offices would be spotless. I tell Kinnear that I hadn’t noticed anything up with his schnoz; after a few minutes of the showbiz smugness, the slight squint and the right hand pressed flat against his body as though slipping inside an invisible pocket, it is possible to see him as Hope, despite the disparity in age (Kinnear is 56, while Hope was a creaky-looking 67 in footage from the event). “Well, you sure know how to warm a guy’s heart,” he says. “But I’m worried about it. I said to my wife, ‘Is the nose too subtle?’ Because I think people are going to be asking: ‘What’s happened to Kinnear’s nose? Has he been drinking?’” It’s hardly Nicole Kidman in The Hours, I tell him. “Right. For her, it was like: ‘Oh my gosh, look at the nose!’ It was all anyone talked about. And here I am, my first interview out of the gate, and you’re saying: ‘I didn’t even know you were wearing one.’” Kinnear may have been acting for a quarter of a century, but he still has the joshing, laid-back bonhomie that made him such an effective television presenter, just the right side of snarky and smarmy – first on Talk Soup, an irreverent Clive James-style roundup of eccentric cable-TV clips from the early 1990s, and then as a chatshow host on Later with Greg Kinnear. “We went out in the wee small hours,” he recalls, “when you get your smokers and tokers.” It was from here that he was plucked by Sydney Pollack to star opposite Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in a remake of Billy Wilder’s Sabrina, which led to his Oscar-nominated performance in As Good As It Gets as the gay artist forced to fall on the mercy of his misanthropic, bigoted neighbour, played by Jack Nicholson.  Playing Hope in Misbehaviour brought him back full circle to the sort of entertainer he used to be. Even before Kinnear’s TV career took off, he hosted a weekly hour-long show on Armed Forces Radio in his teens (as the son of a diplomat, he lived in Athens and Beirut before returning to the US to finish his education) on which he would, he tells me, “fill the hour with mindless talking and music.” While he has yet to acquire national-treasure status, there are certainly similarities between his career path and Hope’s. “It all began in radio for him, too, and that led to TV and a huge career at NBC – the same network where I worked – as well as movies. His job was so obviously a big part of who he was, part of his soul, even.” But as Kinnear is only too aware, Hope does not emerge from Misbehaviour with dignity. “We have a guy here living in a different era, which, when held up in today’s light and where we’re at, it does look, uh, slightly off.” The film makes no secret of Hope’s infidelities; even before the feminist campaigners (Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley among them) are pelting him with flour, his wife Dolores (Lesley Manville) is bracing herself for a repeat of the personal Miss World humiliation of a decade earlier, when he returned from his hosting gig with the winning contestant in tow. And that was only the mistress she knew about. His agent, Louis Shurr, once told a publicist: “Our mission in life is to keep all news about fucking and sucking away from Dolores.” “I wasn’t so familiar with that side of him,” Kinnear says, “but I thought this was an interesting aspect of the movie. You’re taking this beauty contest, this event that was so commonplace and accepted, you know – ‘This is what we do, people.’ And to bring that up in 2020, it’s like I can’t think of anything that signals more clearly the cultural changes and shifts that have occurred, even just in the past few years. I tried to find the reality of who he was in that day and age and what he was there to do – to be that smiling, winking guy with these bathing-suit-clad beauties. And I think the movie shows that the times were changing around him, and he was caught off-guard by that.” Does he think a persona such as Hope’s can be a straitjacket? “Well, you either change with the times or you don’t. And you can see he was very flat-footed in that moment and he doesn’t quite understand it. You see that situation all the time now and maybe in a more accelerated way in our current environment. It does show that progress is being made, whether or not we’re ready for it.” Kinnear, who is in the middle of shooting a nine-part television adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand, says that film sets are a very different place to be now. “The other day someone said: ‘Oh yeah, human resources are on set today.’ You know, a person who’s there to make sure people are feeling safe and following the rules and aren’t being compromised by someone who’s doing shit they shouldn’t be doing.’ And I thought: ‘Wow, where were human resources back in the 1990s?’” Even setting aside the infidelities and his sexism, Hope is a prime candidate for “cancel culture”, which seeks to strike from the record the achievements of anyone whose moral and behavioural standards fall far below our 21st-century expectations. In the 1980s, for instance, Hope was using homophobic slurs and cracking Aids jokes. Kinnear asks me for a quick definition of cancel culture but it’s evident immediately that its principles are at odds with what he as an actor relishes in a role. “A person’s imperfections are always part of the great work of studying any character, showing all sides and finding the truth. Even the most noble, regal character still has flaws. For me, it’s a case-by-case basis. Egregious behaviour, where someone should have known better – well, I’m not sure you can write that off as: ‘Hey, the times were different!’ But I do think also there are many examples of behaviour where you can say: ‘Listen, this was a time when things were different and it’s unfair and ridiculous and pointless to some degree to pretend that their contribution was not meaningful.’” There is a line that Kinnear delivers in As Good As It Gets that sums up the sentiment: “If you look at a person for long enough, you can see their humanity.” He practically trills when I mention it. “I love that line and I’m so glad you’re citing it. It’s true. There is always something to be discovered if you give it time.” To Kill a Mockingbird is much on his mind at the moment – he takes over from Ed Harris as Atticus Finch next month in Aaron Sorkin’s sellout Broadway adaptation – and he invokes that character here also. “Atticus says that you can’t really get to know a person until you get inside their skin and crawl around.” As a father of three daughters aged between 10 and 16, he is keenly aware of the male bias in the movies that are greenlit. “It’s like turning an aircraft carrier around. It’s very slow. And you do feel that the inherent maleness of showbusiness for so many years is reflected in the vast majority of stories that get told. Misbehaviour I look at as a really entertaining story but it also has a strong female voice that I love and it isn’t told like a two-hour civics lesson. It’s just honest and powerful and it makes a dad of three daughters feel good.” Will he show them the movie? “Oh my gosh, yes. The oldest one wants to take it to show at her school. In general, they are not particularly keen on watching anything that wasn’t made in the last four-to-seven minutes. For them, if a song didn’t drop in the last 15 hours, then it’s old.” I have to point out, though, that he said “drop” rather than “come out.” “How about that? They’re gonna be so proud of me. That’s the most contemporary term I’ve used in the past seven years.” The air of the bumbling dad is endearing. “I don’t do any social media and they are always telling me I don’t have much of an online footprint. They’re just used to me being a goofball.” To the rest of the world, he’s Mr Nice. “I know the Nice Guy thing,” he sighs. “‘Good old Greggy Kinnear!’ As an actor, you can’t avoid who you are. You can’t get out of the way of your own persona. Jack Nicholson told me he thought 85% of who you are as an actor is just who you are, and the other 15% is what you can dial in and out. That sounds about right to me.” His self-effacing nature, and those smiley, sad-eyed features, worked a treat in the likes of As Good As It Gets, Little Miss Sunshine and Ira Sachs’s heartbreaking Little Men. But his trustworthy image has also been used to subversive effect, such as in Paul Schrader’s disturbing Auto Focus, in which he played another beloved Bob – in that case, Bob Crane, the star of the US sitcom Hogan’s Heroes, who happened also to be a sex addict with a compulsion to film himself in the act. “Yes, well, that was a slight shift for me there,” he concedes. “I love that film. I was really surprised I got tapped to play the guy. But I didn’t think: ‘How are people gonna perceive me?’ It was just a damn good story. I try not to be too persona-oriented. Some actors are good at knowing where their sweet spot is and, for the rest of us, it’s a work in progress. I still have the excitement in my career of not knowing what the next page will be.”"
"That stress can induce nosebleeds is partly cinematic myth. Going by the frequency with which they appear in film, you would imagine most of us are constantly stuffing tissues up our nostrils. A recent release in this flow is Emma, Autumn de Wilde’s sugary Austen adaptation. A pristine visual palette of pastel pink, yellow and blue accompanies an impeccably behaved Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy), so composed that when her friend is attacked by gypsies, she ballet-dances her to safety with arms elegantly poised. A biting contrast, then, that at the moment Mr Knightley asks “Will you marry me?”, her nose inopportunely spurts blood. Emma’s spill is not the first in recent years. In 2017’s Lady Bird, the protagonist (Saoirse Ronan) has a nosebleed following her first time having sex. The same year, in Call Me By Your Name, a trickle of blood runs down Elio’s (Timothée Chalamet) nose during a vexing lunch. A short film by Luna Carmoon shown at the London film festival about a toxic female relationship takes its title from the spectacle itself. Nosebleeds are becoming an unexpected device in films seeking to complicate our streamlined romantic narratives. This trope is well established in horror. Scanners, David Cronenberg’s 1981 film about a league of telekinetic citizens, has been credited with the first “psychic nosebleed”, a nosebleed caused by strain of telekinetic or other mental powers, or from catching a whiff of the paranormal. In Firestarter, another 80s sci-fi movie, blood runs down a telekinetic father’s face. In The Ring, a journalist’s nose gushes when she discovers, while viewing a supernatural tape, that she can pluck a fly from the screen. Here, it is ambiguous whether the nosebleed is caused by paranormal force, sheer terror, or both. For men, the psychic nosebleed shows a human body unable to sustain a superior brain. But for women, things are more complicated. Ripley’s nosebleed in Alien exemplifies a supposedly feminine loss of bodily function under high-pressure – blood that conveys her human mortality but also seems other. These dribbles are uncanny, a symbol of death that should be contained. Tellingly, in Chronicle, Steve (Michael B Jordan) compares his nosebleed to a “face period”, making a connection with menstruation luridly clear. Though Stranger Things’ Eleven (Milly Bobby Brown), gets telekinetic nosebleeds, critics have suggested that her nasal eruptions may represent the onset of puberty, “a harbinger of chaos”. Eleven is lucky – Arra (Claudia Kim) in The Dark Tower dies from a nosebleed, supporting the notion that this loss of bodily control is somehow effeminate. Nosebleeds are synonymous with arousal in Japanese manga. Emma draws on the sexual aspect of nosebleeds; after several gasps, the nosebleed is the culmination of her emotional upheaval. The first in any Austen adaptation, it’s an unfulfilling climax of things not going as planned. Lady Bird’s nosebleed follows another let down, her first sexual experience not living up to expectation. As the film’s director Greta Gerwig notes, “the movie that’s playing in [Lady Bird’s] head” is “not the movie she’s in”. Both nosebleeds occur when their tenacious heroines have their supposed grip on their lives yanked away. But their vulnerabilities are accepted, even admirable. A combination of body positivity, feminism and increasing honesty surrounding dating culture seems responsible for the nosebleed’s leak into romance. While directing Emma’s proposal scene, De Wilde reflected on the “body betraying you” at critical romantic moments. Emma’s nosebleed undercuts romantic idealism. It’s a mishap that’s as likely to happen in the 18th century as now. As taboos around periods begin to be dismantled, a spot of female blood no longer makes us scream. Carmoon’s Nosebleed makes blood far less terrifying than what is ticking away inside her protagonist’s head. Alongside Emma and Lady Bird, it leans toward nuanced, flawed, three-dimensional women. Gerwig has stressed that her film is not a love story, though Lady Bird may think she is in one. The director explains: “I like setting up expectations, then subverting them and delivering them somewhere else.” The nosebleed is a device that steers scenes away from perfect love, De Wilde says, to “turn it on its head”. De Wilde claims that Emma and Mr Knightley working together to solve the nosebleed problem is “just as romantic as the proposal”. When asked about the lack of sex in Call Me By Your Name, director Luca Guadagnino cites the intimacy and tenderness in their actions. “Their love is in all things”, he says – even, perhaps, in mopping up Elio’s nostrils."
"Perhaps impatient, as we all are, for the next renaissance or breakthrough for the Pixar/Disney animation studio, commentators are a bit overexcited about this new film. Onward is actually decent entertainment with some sweet moments, although its real novelty may well be the fleeting revelation that one character is gay (a traffic cop called Specter, voiced by Lena Waithe, who talks about her girlfriend’s daughter). The setting is an alternative-reality anytown America where magic exists, along with various fabular creatures, but all of it has long since been superseded by the efficient and ubiquitous magic of technology. Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) are teenage elves whose dad died when they were young, now being raised by their mom, Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). On Ian’s 16th birthday, Laurel gives him a present that his late dad had entrusted to her – a wizard’s staff that endows Ian with magical powers which could bring his dad back to life. But a chaotic accident means that they lose the mystic jewel that goes on the top of the staff, and the brothers have to go on a standard-issue supernatural adventure quest to get it back. There’s a fair bit of wit and fun, and some tender moments, although the attitude towards death isn’t nearly as radically powerful as it was in the 2017 Pixar/Disney classic Coco. And, ungracious as it might be to point out, Onward’s simple debt to Harry Potter is a bit obvious sometimes. Still, it is a likable family comedy that finds an easy rhythm without effort."
"Toni Morrison’s intellectual warmth and humanity unfurl in gentle, unforced triumph in this docu-celebration by film-maker and photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, which was completed in 2019 just before Morrison died. Part of what makes it so interesting is the repeated, unfashionable emphasis on the power and importance of literary fiction. Oprah Winfrey and Angela Davis testify to this importance, and Morrison’s importance within it. In his own commentary, Walter Mosley says: “Books have an incredible impact on our culture, even though most of our culture doesn’t even know it.” The film takes us through Morrison’s early education (there’s a great photo of her playing Elizabeth of York in a student production of Richard III, with a queenly bearing), then her remarkable career at the highest pinnacles of American high culture. She was a fiction editor at Random House, a humanities professor at Princeton and a Pulitzer- and Nobel-winning author of novels including Song of Solomon and Beloved – a triple-whammy of achievement as a mentor, teacher and creator, in which her role as an artist is paramount. Morrison is fascinating when she speaks about the prevalence of the “white voice” in literature when she was growing up, the fact that even black figures such as Frederick Douglass and Ralph Ellison seemed to be addressing a white audience. She struck against that and was rewarded with patronising reviews that finger-wagged about her only writing about the black experience without bringing in white characters to make it important and universal. She tells her creative-writing students to look beyond their experiences and their “little life” and asks them, for example, to imagine that of a Mexican girl. In other words: don’t stay in your lane. I would have liked to hear her views on the cultural appropriation debate, but sadly that was not touched upon. This documentary is a potent commercial for the books themselves. "
"As chequered histories go, the story of Artemis Fowl’s marathon trek to the big screen is not quite up there with that of Terry Gilliam’s famously long-gestating The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, but it is not far removed. First conjured up almost two decades ago under the now largely defunct Miramax studio, it has had to survive the departure of several directors, numerous attempts at a screenplay and the removal of Harvey Weinstein as producer. Unfortunately, as the film enters the final strait of its long journey to the multiplex, the news is not getting any better. Finally due out in May, with Kenneth Branagh in the director’s chair and a cast that includes Judi Dench, Colin Farrell and Josh Gad, the movie is now facing almost universal derision from fans of the eight-novel original series of books by Irish author Eoin Colfer that inspired it. The problem is the latest trailer, the first to offer up a proper look at what Branagh has done with the world of pre-teen criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II, often described as a sort of miniature Hans Gruber from the first Die Hard movie (if Alan Rickman’s teutonic terrorist had been determined to make his fortune by unveiling the existence of a magical fantasy underworld rather than just ruining Bruce Willis’ Christmas.) The fans say this version of Artemis is simply not cold and calculating enough, resembling a typical Hollywood wide-eyed innocent thrust suddenly into a world he never imagined existed rather than the sharp-minded kid who works out there must be a hidden world of fairies and decides to use it for his own ill-gotten gain. Branagh’s movie seems to be conflating the plots of the first two books in Colfer’s series, allowing Artemis’s kidnapped dad (Farrell) to appear from the very beginning (rather than being introduced in part two). The 12-year-old’s antagonist in the first book, elf reconnaissance officer Holly Short, is introduced as his ally, as is the dwarf Mulch Diggums (Gad), who in the books starts out very much on the other side. A lot of the fun of Fowl’s journey from callow evil genius to antihero with a conscience, which takes place over several of Colfer’s stories, is rather lost, and there is a funny whiff of Spy Kids to the whole affair. What’s surprising here is not that Hollywood appears to have got Artemis Fowl (or at least its marketing) so wrong, but that studios still haven’t woken up to the importance of fan service in 2020. The two totems of fantasy film-making that Disney ought to have been looking at when adapting Colfer’s books are Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series. Jackson won Oscars and almost universal praise from fans of JRR Tolkien’s novels by cleaving close to the original text but changing just enough to squeeze the movies into cinematic shape. By the time of part three, 2003’s Return of the King, Tolkienistas were so in thrall to this vivid and vivacious Kiwi vision of Middle Earth, that there was barely a murmur of complaint when the film-maker started adding shonky new elements such as the fate of elf maiden Arwen being tied to the fate of Sauron’s dastardly one ring. The Potter films are a different kettle of Anglerfish. In many ways the movies followed the original novels too closely, in a manner that often gave the weakest episodes a 90s TV movie quality, as if producers were determined to eschew pacing and dynamism in favour of squeezing in every scene and character that JK Rowling had included in the books. But fans loved them and went to seem them in their droves. Eventually, critics were also grudgingly won over. The point here, as the makers of the recent Sonic the Hedgehog movie will no doubt tell you, is that if you’re going to mess with the original vision that inspired a particular film adaptation, you had better have a damned good reason for doing so. It remains to be seen whether Artemis Fowl’s tinkering with the original text makes sense when the full movie hits cinemas, but it cannot be a positive thing that Disney has alienated the very audience it needs to drum up hype for this movie before anyone has even seen the film’s opening frame."
"“Great music doesn’t happen when things are perfect,” says Sharon Horgan’s brassy Lisa in this formulaic yet ultimately winning British dramedy. “It happens when you care.” That’s a truism that could equally be applied to the film itself, an “inspired by real events” crowd-pleaser from The Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo. Military Wives may indeed be far from perfect (to say it flirts with cliche is to understate its enthusiastic commitment to contrivance), yet for all its manipulative flaws, this goodhearted tale of the partners of service personnel finding musical strength together works the kind of movie magic that will leave you laughing and crying, often against your better judgment. Kristin Scott Thomas is splendid as the brittle colonel’s wife Kate, stoically grieving the loss of her beloved son Jamie, who followed his father into the forces. When her increasingly distanced husband, Richard (Greg Wise, nicely underplayed), heads off to Afghanistan for yet another tour of duty, Kate tries to fill the void by playing a more active role with the spouses and partners left behind at the base. Meanwhile, Lisa finds herself charged with the new responsibilities of rallying the troops at home by organising coffee mornings, cake bakes and knitting circles. It all seems “a bit Little Women”, until someone suggests a singing group – a grand idea that puts the classically inclined Kate on a collision course with the more freethinking Lisa, who has no intention of “singing Onward Christian Soldiers with a pole up your arse”. Instead, she gets the group to take a run at familiar 80s pop classics (Don’t You Want Me, Only You etc), to the horror of Kate who remains unimpressed by such “sober karaoke”. Nevertheless, it all starts to come together, and the prospect of this ragtag band performing in public promptly heaves into view. Viewers of the BBC Two show The Choir: Military Wives, which memorably climaxed at the Festival of Remembrance in the Royal Albert Hall in 2011, will recognise the basic coordinates of the plot. It’s no surprise that these women are on the road to great things, like the heroines of Nigel Cole’s 2003 Brit-pic Calendar Girls, which had a similarly plucky, upbeat feel. En route, they will encounter melodrama aplenty, as tragedy and triumph are intertwined in a wholly predictable dramatic arc, punctuated by slightly awkward moments of air‑punching musical feelgoodness. It’s unashamedly broad-strokes fare, with characters occasionally reduced to thumbnails (the one who can’t sing, but can; the one who can sing but can’t) in service of a well-rehearsed narrative. Despite the constant threat of loss, there’s little of the earthy heft that drove Mark Herman’s superior Brassed Off toward its own Albert Hall finale. Instead we get talk of “top brass” and “tall poppies” as the story barrels toward late-in-the-day breakups and 11th-hour resolutions, complete with an obligatory Richard Curtis-style race against time to crank up the third act. Yet only the most hardhearted viewer could resist getting swept up in what Cattaneo rightly calls a celebration of “the emotional power of music, and the catharsis of singing together”. I’ve seen Military Wives twice, and both times found myself crying like a baby at several key sequences. It helps that some of the songs at which the group take a swing (notably Cyndi Lauper’s Time After Time) are pure emotional kryptonite, annihilating the critical faculties. But there’s more at play here than mere jukebox button-pushing. The scenes between Kate and Lisa have proper comic oomph, with Scott Thomas and Horgan making the most of their chalk-and-cheese pairing, demonstrating whip-smart timing, particularly during the early rehearsals. More important, talented writers Rachel Tunnard and Rosanne Flynn sprinkle their script with small but well-observed details that really hit home: Lisa packing away her husband’s things in preparation for “another six months of being a single mother”; the silence that follows newbie Sarah (Amy James-Kelly) asking: “How do you cope? Do you not talk about it?”; Kate’s description of an on-base house as “the magnolia box”. These are the notes that ring true, ensuring that the audience are fully invested in the characters when they start writing songs based on phrases from letters to their loved ones. “We don’t have the privilege of being against the war,” says Lisa in one of the film’s sharper moments, “we’re married to it.” It’s a credit to Miltary Wives that, for a couple of hours, we all feel married to it too – for better or worse."
"The UK’s largest cinema chain says fears over the spread of coronavirus have not yet significantly impacted ticket sales, despite a 20% fall in its shares over the past two days. Following news on Wednesday that the release of new James Bond film No Time to Die would be pushed back from April to November, Cineworld’s shares fell 13%. A further 7% decline was registered on Thursday as concerns continued to grow, leading to some analysts suggesting that globally there would be a minimum loss of $5bn on the film industry. Meanwhile AMC, the world’s largest cinema chain, has seen a 30% drop in shares over the past fortnight. A spokesperson for Cineworld, which owns multiplexes throughout Europe as well as UK arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas, pointed to the fact that most releases remain on track, with studios apparently reluctant to change schedules unless it becomes absolutely necessary. “Admissions remain high,” Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK cinema association told the Guardian. “In line with the advice given by the deputy chief medical officer this week, all sites will remain open,” he said. A similar defiance was demonstrated by the Cannes film festival, which said it remained committed to proceeding as planned in mid-May. On Thursday, the French government extended a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of May. “[These] instructions don’t concern the festival,” a spokesperson said, “as we are never more than 5,000 in one enclosed space. As of today, nothing indicates the festival will not take place.” “It’s a confidence thing,” one industry source added. “You can’t start saying you’re worried. It has to be very on until it’s suddenly very off. In part, that’s just a legal and insurance thing.” More than 12,000 delegates attended Cannes last year, but the largest cinema at the Palais des Festivals seats only 2,300. Invitations to the Cannes lineup press conference in Paris on 16 April were sent out on Friday morning. No mention was made of any uncertainty; instead the invite noted that “accreditations continue at an intensive pace” as requests are up 9% from last year. Cannes regained credibility as a launchpad when three of its 2019 premieres – Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire – performed well during awards season. This followed a couple of underpowered editions for the festival in which its programme was overshadowed by Cannes film festival director Thierry Frémaux’s row with Netflix, whose films he barred from awards eligibility. Pressure on festival directors not to skip a year would therefore be considerable, despite both unsettling government advice and increasing industry precedent. On 4 March, organisers of the Cannes MIPTV content market – which also takes place in the Palais – announced they were cancelling this year. Forty of France’s cinemas have been closed and the number of confirmed cases in the Cannes area has reached double figures. More than half of Italy’s cinemas are closed and regulations prohibit people from sitting less than a metre away from each other in public. Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the national association of exhibitors, has unveiled a system he hopes would comply and enable cinemas to remain open: allowing the booking of every third seat in a row, with empty seats directly in front and behind. Lorini said his team had been “working round the clock” to try to make the plan viable. On Friday the International Indian Film Academy Awards were postponed because of “sensitivity” over the mounting health crisis. Originally due to take place on 27 March, the annual gala is Bollywood’s version of the Oscars. The inaugural Red Sea international film festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was cancelled earlier in the week, and increasing numbers of attendants – including Amazon and Apple – have withdrawn from the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. SXSW has a significant film sidebar, and is still scheduled to take place for 10 days from 13 March. But it is the mainstream end of the film industry which is likely to be hit hardest by the spread of coronavirus, while smaller films and streaming sites such as Netflix could be set for an unexpected boost. MGM’s decision to delay the release of the Bond film was applauded by many, despite a potential $50m bill to cover logistics – as well as costs and share falls for the many sponsors whose tie-in campaigns have already begun. Momentum was built by the release of Billie Eilish’s theme song last month, as well as a $4.5m Super Bowl advert, that will be chalked up to long-lead brand awareness. Had MGM stuck to its original date, estimates suggest that there would be a minimum 30% reduction to a global box-office take that was anticipated to top $1bn. In earmarking an alternative window quickly, the studio has bought dominance over a key date in the cinema-going calendar – No Time to Die opens in the US over Thanksgiving weekend – while the seven-month hiatus allows time to redraw plans. “That feels like a safe amount of breathing room,” said a source close to the production. “Tentpole movies live or die on large audiences going out of their houses and watching them in cinemas with hundreds of other people. Right now, nobody wants to do that.” “In China infections seem to have peaked but you can’t see them opening cinemas before June,” said another industry insider, “nor people being keen to go for a while after that. Add three months for the rest of the world and November starts looking very attractive.” Widespread cinema closures across China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan and South Korea have already done drastic damage to the global box office, with one consulting firm suggesting that the loss during China’s new year holiday alone amounts to around $1bn. Among projected big-hitters yet to be released in China’s 70,000 screens are Dolittle, Sonic the Hedgehog and Oscar contenders such as 1917, Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit and Little Women. When cinemas do reopen, the backlog will cause further delays and local titles will be prioritised. Bond’s distributors did not directly mention coronavirus in their Wednesday statement, instead saying that the decision had been taken after “careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace”. Two-thirds of the money made by Bond movies comes from outside the US, with east Asia increasingly courted by Hollywood producers. Forthcoming blockbusters such as Mulan – whose $200m budget makes it Disney’s most expensive live-action remake yet – and the ninth Fast and Furious film are highly reliant on Asian markets for their profits. The Chinese premiere of Mulan was cancelled some weeks ago and updates are anticipated from Disney on any changes to the worldwide launch, which is currently still scheduled for 27 March. Early estimates suggest that Mulan’s US opening weekend may still manage a $90m take, with some crediting coronavirus’s reportedly less dramatic impact on children as one reason that family films may not suffer as much as their adult counterparts. How Mulan fares will have substantial implications for the strategy surrounding Disney’s first blockbuster of the year: Avengers spin-off Black Widow, which is meant to open worldwide at the start of May. Should these films flop, many forecast a domino effect as studios scramble to reschedule tentpole releases. F9, Scooby-Doo movie Scoob!, Wonder Woman 1984 and Netflix’s Eurovision movie are all early summer releases whose release dates look vulnerable. Production disruption is already considerable, with Paramount halting a planned shoot in Venice on Mission: Impossible VII last week citing “concerns of the crew”. “Who is going to underwrite a movie which goes into production next week?” queried one source. “If an actor is due on set in say, late March, their agent might well forbid them from working, saying it’s too dangerous.” Nervousness was demonstrated by talent agency CAA on Wednesday when it clamped down on anything other than virtual meetings. The same day, Sony Pictures’ offices in London, Paris and Poland were shut for the remainder of the week after a UK employee was feared to have been exposed to the virus while travelling abroad. Paramount is, however, pressing ahead with the release of the sequel A Quiet Place Part II on 20 March. Just a 10th of the original film’s $340m take came from China; the curious parallels between the plot – a family self-isolates to try to survive – perhaps boosting its box office appeal among populations relatively unaffected by illness. Contingency plans for mid-range releases may involve fast-tracking them to streaming services, where there is likely to be a substantial appetite from a captive at-home audience. Water-cooler titles such as Promising Young Woman – in which Carey Mulligan feigns drunkenness on nights out before taking bloody revenge on men who attempt to take advantage of her – are thought to be prime candidates for films that could do well online, if a cinema release appears optimistic. However, legacy inertia could make such innovation challenging. “The ecosystem of release strategies would be really damaged by that kind of thing,” said one source. “Everything is booked and lined up already. I don’t know if that tactic has real financial merit.” The industry’s structural makeup may also prove problematic, with studios and exhibitors prizing competition over collaboration, meaning strategy communication is limited. “It’s uncharted territory,” said one source, “but that also means there are lots of opportunities out there if streamers can move quickly.” Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment, but a boom in users and dwell time over the coming weeks appears likely. Even long-established studios are seeing silver linings online. Contagion, Steven Soderbergh’s unfortunately prescient 2011 thriller about the global outbreak of a deadly virus, has proved such a viral hit over recent weeks that it’s already Warner Bros’ second-best-performing film of 2020."
"Now that Cats has faded from view, doomed to become an artefact held up by future historians as a decadent totem of how human beings spent their precious time back when they were allowed out of the house, it might be time to welcome Judi Dench back into the fold. Better yet, Judi Dench dressed up as a dog. The Dench reappearance came earlier today as part of a cluster of older stars demonstrating jaunty defiance in the face of the coronavirus. In a 10-second video posted to Twitter by her daughter Finty Williams, Dame Judi turns to face the camera in a novelty dog hat, pulls a cord that makes the hat’s ears pop up and shrieks: “Oh, there you are. Just keep laughing. That’s all we can do”. End of video. It’s slightly less screen-time than Dench had in Shakespeare in Love, but arguably even more worthy of an Oscar. In a time streaked with anxious uncertainty, this is exactly what the world needed to see. An 85-year-old woman, in the highest-risk demographic, scraping a few atoms of positivity from what has been a terrible year. If you didn’t love her then, you should love her now. Especially since her dog hat is about a thousand times more convincing than the nightmarish suit she was made to wear in Cats. Just as gleeful as Dench, and even more educational, was the video posted by Elaine Paige. The accompanying tweet was full of sterling advice about cleaning phones and bank cards, but the video itself was a sight to behold. Where to start with it? The ostentatious gold-studded jacket? The fact that her rubber gloves have enormous flowers strapped to them? The legendary “don’t cry for me, I’m the cleaner” pun? Her subsequent laugh, which remains the single dirtiest thing ever received by human ears? It’s an awful lot to take in, but it is wonderful. Dench and Paige join Mel Brooks, who this week appeared in his son’s tweet about the importance of social distancing.  And Anthony Hopkins, who has apparently chosen to mark his time in self-imposed quarantine by playing beautifully calm piano songs to an exclusive audience of one murderous-looking cat. You get the impression that this is going to be a golden age for celebrity memes. Film and television production is halted. Venues are closed. Perhaps this is how stars will maintain their cachet in a time of widespread isolation. Who will be next? Bette Midler seems to have largely checked out, and Dolly Parton is carrying on as if nothing has happened. Never more do you sense that people are ready for Cher to make a novelty video. She’s certainly bubbling under at the moment, urging people to stay inside by tweeting a picture of an antique gong for some reason. Should she attempt to turn that strain of magisterial batshittery into video, the reaction would probably be big enough to send the virus packing all by itself. Dench has stepped up. Paige has stepped up. Brooks has stepped up. Cher, the world is waiting."
"The Cannes jury prize-winning third feature from French-Galician film-maker Oliver Laxe (best known for Mimosas) may be his most accomplished yet. After serving two years in prison, a middle-aged arsonist, Amador (Amador Arias), returns to his mountainside village in north-west Spain, where he resumes a serene, if mostly solitary, existence tending cabbages and injured cows with his ageing mother, Benedicta (Benedicta Sánchez). That is, until the land is ravaged by a second fire in the film’s third act. It is unclear whether Amador is the culprit, but that doesn’t matter to the unforgiving locals. Though dialogue is used sparingly, Arias manages to create a sense of deep emotions swirling beneath a tough exterior, thanks to his expressive face and diffident, kind eyes. Laxe has a masterly command of rhythm and pacing. The action feels unhurried, despite the film’s tight running time, and there is a spaciousness to the world-building; attentive sound design and 16mm photography capture Galicia’s damp, green allure. Falling eucalyptus trees have a gnarled grandeur; wet soil and sparkling ash are treated with awe. This reverence makes it all the more terrifying when destruction, as the title suggests, inevitably rages. Available to watch on curzonhomecinema.com"
"The portrayal of lesbians in mainstream cinema tends to involve prosthetic vaginas and gratuitous sex scenes; so Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire comes as a breath of fresh air. It is the story of the burgeoning relationship between two young women – emancipated artist Marianne (Noémie Merlant), who is commissioned to paint a portrait of sexually repressed Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), leading to a heated romance. On paper, it looks like the classic lesbian cinematic narrative – there is a buildup of tension, they finally kiss, and then their possibility of a future together seems doomed. However, what makes Portrait of a Lady on Fire different is its heightened self-awareness. The film is constructed with lesbian representation in mind through careful interrogation of the lesbian gaze. There is a lot of looking. Marianne looks at Héloïse because she has to secretly paint her, and Héloïse looks at Marianne out of curiosity. Eventually, there is a shift in the way they start looking at each other – out of desire. This is in sharp contrast with the best-known depictions of lesbian sex in films; in films such as Blue Is the Warmest Colour and Cruel Intentions, the male gaze has been dominant. In these films, lesbian intimacy is about touching; Sciamma, however, draws attention to how the women in the film look at each other, and the viewer is made aware of the complexity of lesbian intimacy and how sensuality is located far deeper. As Marianne has to paint Héloïse in secret, there are lingering closeups – particularly on her ear. The intimacy builds from afar, from the gaze. What’s more, Marianne is the only person Héloïse believes can represent her “as she is”; and the gaze is therefore inextricably linked to representation. The fact that Héloïse allows Marianne to paint her is a big deal: for her, the painting will lead to marriage and is the first step towards an unhappy future of surveillance and censorship. It shows how, if she must be represented as an artwork, she will only accept being painted by someone who understands her, and whom she is intimate with.Unlike Héloïse, Marianne has total control over how she is represented and seen by others. The film opens with Marianne being painted by her students, and although she is the one sitting and posing, she is issuing instructions on how she should be portrayed. Her status as an artist enables her to have a freedom that Héloïse will never have.  Period dramas can often reveal something about the present. Portrait of a Lady on Fire shows how lesbian dramas in cinema so often get it completely wrong. By drawing attention to the art of looking, Sciamma lets us see that lesbian intimacy is so much more than a sex scene, and how it’s about time cinema started to represent the lesbian gaze."
"The elite world of French cinema, one of the pillars of the country’s exception culturelle, was bitterly divided after Roman Polanski was named best director at France’s equivalent of the Oscars. Several actresses walked out on Friday night as the César was awarded to the Franco-Polish director who is still wanted in the United States after he admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. The award was viewed as provocative and a slap in the face for sexual abuse victims and #MeToo campaigners who have struggled to gain recognition in France. Outside the ceremony, feminists clashed with police. Polanski, 86, had stayed away, saying he feared a “feminist lynching”. On Saturday, Ursula Le Menn, an activist with Osez le Féminisme (“Dare to be feminist”), the group that organised the protest outside the ceremony, said the award showed that nothing had changed in the world of French cinema. “The empathy shown is a facade …. There is no real change of mentality,” she said. Polanski’s film, J’Accuse (An Officer and a Spy), about the Dreyfus affair, was nominated for 12 Césars, and won two others – for best adaptation and best costume design. But it was the decision to name him best director that caused the most outrage. “Polanski has presented himself like Dreyfus, a victim, and used his film for his own defence. For women who have had the courage to speak out about the abuse they suffered, there is an enormous pain seeing this man distinguished,” said Le Menn. “We ask women to come forward and speak out and they see not only are there no consequences for their aggressors, but those same aggressors are honoured in this way.” Actress Adèle Haenel, who last year revealed she had been sexually abused as a child by another director, shouted “Shame!” as she left the awards. Others followed, including the director Céline Sciamma. The ceremony’s host, Florence Foresti, also failed to return to close the event. On her Twitter account Foresti said she was “disgusted”. Alexis Poulin, a French journalist and co-founder of an online media site, said many in France felt the same way. “A lot of people in France are disgusted this morning. What happened yesterday was wrong and I have been saying this for ever. I think it’s unfair Polanski is given all these honours,” he said. “Giving Polanski a prize was quite a statement. The film is something a lot of people work on, not just him. Giving him the prize protects him – it says you cannot reach him and the French cinema elite will stick together: it’s like a cinema mob and he’s the godfather. “It says to the victims, ‘we don’t want to hear you, you are nothing, we don’t trust you’,” Poulin added. J’Accuse recounts the persecution of the French Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus in the 1890s, convicted of trumped-up charges of treason. In an interview to promote the film, Polanski admitted he saw himself like Dreyfus: “I am familiar with many of the workings of the apparatus of persecution shown in the film… I can see the same determination to deny the facts and condemn me for things I have not done. Most of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing about the case.” Poulin said the award had revealed a deep problem in French society. “Polanski fled and found refuge in France. In France, we accept rapists on the run because they’re artists. It’s a problem of French society.” Polanski admitted the statutory rape of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey in 1977 after more serious charges were dropped in a plea bargain. While awaiting sentencing, he fled the US. France has refused to extradite him. Since then, a number of other sexual abuse allegations have been made against the director, who became famous with his film Rosemary’s Baby. The most recent was last November when a French photographer, Valentine Monnier, accused Polanski of raping her in 1975, when she was 18, at his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland. Polanski has denied all the allegations. He received backing on Saturday from the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, who tweeted: “That the #Cesars waited until #Polanski was absent and could not respond, to mock him, humiliate him, overplay disgust and go so far as to refuse to pronounce his name, that says a lot about where the real “Miserables” were last night.”"
"Max von Sydow, the Swedish actor who made his name in a series of landmark films with Ingmar Bergman before progressing to international stardom, has died in France. He was 90. Sydow’s most iconic role was in Bergman’s The Seventh Seal (1957), in which he plays chess with Death. He also brought immense presence and gravity to roles such as Jesus Christ in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), a doomed priest in William Friedkin’s The Exorcist, and an intellectually snobbish artist in Woody Allen‘s Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). More recently, he appeared in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and on Game of Thrones as the mystical Three-Eyed Raven. The news was broken on Monday by his wife, the producer Catherine Brelet, who told Paris Match: “It is with a broken heart and with infinite sadness that we have the extreme pain of announcing the departure of Max von Sydow on 8 March 2020.” Speaking to the Guardian, Martin Scorsese – who directed him in 2011’s Shutter Island – called Von Sydow “something like a consummate actor, with a pride in his art and a dedication to his craft that I’ve encountered in very few people in my life.” He continued: “I had the chance to work with him only once and I cherished every minute of it. On the set he was remarkable, and off the set he a complete gentleman. “What he and Ingmar Bergman found together is more precious than gold. Tonight I’ll watch one of those pictures—maybe Shame, or Hour of the Wolf, or Winter Light, or The Seventh Seal—and find myself shocked, surprised and awed all over again.” Thomas Vinterberg, who directed von Sydow in his final film, Kursk (2018), told the Guardian that “for us Scandinavians Max is a legend”. He recalled Von Sydow’s final day of shooting, when, “after his last shot, everyone stood up and applauded this warm and impressive man, continuously. When he left the set, it continued in the street. “It was as if he was celebrated for his whole career, and it just went on and on. Both [co-star] Colin Firth and I were very moved by this, and it became the last time I saw him. It’s as if an era ends with Max. I will miss him.” Born into a wealthy family in Lund on the Swedish coast, Von Sydow studied at the country’s national drama school before meeting Bergman in 1955. The pair initially worked together on theatrical productions, but rapidly made a series of cinematic landmarks that cemented both men’s careers. The Seventh Seal was made in the same year as Wild Strawberries; Brink of Life, Rabies and The Magician followed in 1958. Other key collaborations included The Virgin Spring (1960) and Winter Light (1963). The Greatest Story Ever Told was von Sydow’s first large-scale US production, but it was 1973’s The Exorcist – riffing off a lifetime playing wracked men of God – that catapulted Von Sydow to international acclaim. The actor’s wackier side was showcased as Ming the Merciless in 1980’s Flash Gordon; his second foray into Hollywood fantasy was 1982’s Conan the Barbarian. He worked with David Lynch on 1984’s Dune, and picked up considerable acclaim for a moving role in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). The 1987 Swedish domestic drama Pelle the Conqueror earned him his first Oscar nomination, for best actor. Von Sydow continued to work through his 70s and 80s, combining substantial roles in Europe – including as the father in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly – with chewy supporting work in Hollywood productions such as Minority Report (2002), and, in 2011, Shutter Island, Robin Hood and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. This last title won Von Sydow his second Oscar nomination, this time as supporting actor, for playing a mute man whose cloistered existence is disrupted by the friendship of a boy who has lost his father on 9/11. Speaking to Hadley Freeman around the time of the film’s release, Von Sydow was wry about the new form of typecasting his ninth decade was bringing. “As you get older,” he said, “you get offered old characters and very often old people die in the middle of the script. It’s sad, but it’s not very interesting.” He proceeded to win a new generation of admirers for cameos in The Simpsons, in the first of the new Star Wars trilogy, 2015’s The Force Awakens, and as the Three-Eyed Raven in season six of Game of Thrones. Von Sydow was married twice, to the actor Christina Inga Britta Olin from 1951-1979; they had two sons. In 1997, he married Brelet and in 2002 became a citizen of her native France."
"This is, BuzzFeed News noted recently, a time when “only the last 72 hours seem to matter in politics”. It is the age of news as instant gratification, with goldfish-like attention spans measured out in alerts and tweets on unputdownable phones. A week can seem like a year, a year can seem like a lifetime. So it is reassuring to consider a project such as Flint, a documentary film five years in the making. The director, Anthony Baxter, was holed up for long periods at the Holiday Inn Express in Flint, Michigan, capturing 400 hours of footage about one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters in American history. This monumental testimonial has been pared down to a devastating two-hour feature that has its US premiere at the Environmental Film Festival in Washington earlier this month. It is a story of environmental law-breaking, months of cover-up and the most powerful country in the world poisoning tens of thousands of its own. It is also a timely parable about what happens when trust breaks down. “We’re in a post-truth world,” Professor Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech University, who helped expose the water crisis, tells Baxter while driving one night. “That’s what this whole story’s about. Who betrayed whom. Everyone’s betraying everyone. Who can you trust? There’s some folks telling the truth, there’s some folks lying and, to me, this defines a dark age. We live in a dark age. It’s defined by not knowing who you can trust in a society that runs on trust.” Flint, a former car manufacturing boom town that fell into economic decline, tried to save money in 2014 by taking its water supply from the Flint River but did not treat it to reduce a corrosive effect on old pipes. As a consequence, lead leached into the system, causing a public health catastrophe. Blood tests found children had high levels of lead; reading scores in Flint have subsequently fallen by 50%, according to the state education department. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician, tells the film: “Lead passes your blood-brain barrier. It’s a neurotoxin; it causes irreversible brain damage. So detecting it in children is too late. It is that canary in the coalmine: it’s already too late. We have just altered the life course trajectory of an entire generation of Flint children.” Experts also linked the water to legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia. Residents of Flint – where two in five people live in poverty – are still fighting in the Michigan supreme court for the right to sue state officials. In the film’s opening sequence, the narrator, Alec Baldwin, says: “This is the story of what happens next.” Baxter recalls: “The New York Times did a piece and it was just everywhere on the news but what was interesting for me was that once the cameras left, and you know how news cycles work, it was even more important, I felt, to stay with it because these families were really on their own and living in a situation where trust had broken down completely. “In a way, it reminds me of the coronavirus situation. You’ve got this situation with people not trusting what they’re being told by those in authority. When this vacuum of mistrust is created, it’s impossible for people to know what to believe and it was a really compelling thing for me to follow.” Baxter, 50, based in Montrose in the UK, is best known for documentaries including You’ve Been Trumped, A Dangerous Game, Dark Side of the Greens and You’ve Been Trumped Too. He never imagined that Flint would become such an all-consuming project. “Like a lot of people, I thought the problem would be fixed pretty quickly, there would be a solution found, the pipes would be replaced and there’d be federal government money. People were comparing it at the time to [Hurricane] Katrina and the thought was that the federal government would act. I, at the time, thought this will be a film that I would hope to finish in a couple of years’ time and then the story will be resolved.” It did not turn out that way. “A number of pipes have been replaced, sure, but the people of Flint wanted all the pipes replaced. They wanted every single bit of lead pulled out of the ground. I think if that had happened then it would have been a real physical sign to people that the federal government was doing everything it could to rebuild that trust. But instead it was just left to the people. All they got was bottles of water.” The film-maker’s patient, long-term approach enabled him to persuade residents to open up. There was Nakiya Wakes, whose water supply was cut off by the city because she refused to pay, forcing her to stockpile bottles. There was Jeremiah Loren, who at 12 suffered skin rashes and itches resembling chicken pox as well as changes in personality. His mother, Tammy Loren, is close to tears as she tells Baxter: “As a mother, it breaks my heart, because there’s nothing I can do.” Some of the footage was used by Michael Moore, a Flint native, in his feature Fahrenheit 11/9. Speaking by phone ahead of his promotional tour in the US, Baxter reflects: “You build that trust up with a community. They perhaps saw me at the beginning as a bit of a quirky individual in that I had this strange British accent, but in a way it gives me access to situations with families that perhaps an American reporter wouldn’t have in the same way. I don’t take that trust lightly at all and that’s why I felt so determined to get the film completed, even though it’s obviously taken much longer than I expected it to originally.” There are plenty of twists and turns. The actor Mark Ruffalo arrives with his not-for-profit environmental group Water Defense, whose “citizen scientist” (or “pseudo-scientist” to critics) Scott Smith carries out “tests” and argues that showering is dangerous; he later admits mistakes and turns tetchy in an interview with Baxter. Barack Obama visits Flint but uncharacteristically misjudges the mood. Astonishingly, mid-speech, he asks for a glass of water, then seeks to reassure the audience that it is not a stunt. His popularity in this majority-black city nosedives. Baxter says: “I think the African American community in Flint just felt so devastated by that. There was so much hope placed on Obama’s visit and to see him misread the situation in that way was really surprising.” Flint’s water no longer comes from the river and has improved, but some wary residents continue to use bottled water. Baxter himself faced that dilemma during his long stays there. “I would shower in the water but I wouldn’t drink the filtered water and today, if I go there and I’m staying in the hotel, I would still drink bottled water, even though I’m told that it’s safe. And that’s me as a visitor. If you’re a resident there, you can just understand the dilemma that they’re in constantly over this thing.”  As a story of official negligence that hits poor people and people of colour the hardest, perhaps the closest analogue is Grenfell Tower, a 120-home tower block in London that caught fire in June 2017, killing 72 people. Its plastic-filled aluminium cladding has been identified as the principal cause. Baxter recalls: “When the residents were marching down to the Flint city hall saying, ‘We’re getting skin rashes, we’re having hair loss, we don’t trust the water and then we’re being told it’s safe,’ I remember reading how the Grenfell residents were concerned about this cladding and the emergency situation in the tower, and they made these points very forcefully, but nobody seemed to listen to them. “That is what happened in Flint. People were really hammering down the doors saying, ‘Look, this is not right and we don’t trust what we’re being told.’ They were just being told, ‘Well, your water is safe, look, I’m drinking it on television’ – that was the mayor at the time. So again it was down to them to fight their corner. When I was in Flint and the Grenfell Tower fire happened, I remember thinking that this is America’s Grenfell on the ground.”"
"So all-consuming and all-conquering has Disney become, it even owns the rights to its analogies now. First Disney was Marvel supervillain Thanos, relentlessly acquiring pop culture’s Infinity Stones including Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel itself – all the better to obliterate half the Hollywood universe. Having swallowed up its rival 21st Century Fox for a colossal $71bn, Disney became the Death Star – an empire so intimidatingly huge and hungry it reduced its rivals to the status of scattered rebels. Last year, Disney dominated the movies like no studio has before, taking more than 38% of the world’s box office. Now, with its streaming service Disney+ rolling out, Disney is like Simba in The Lion King: as Mufasa tells him, “everything the light touches is our kingdom”. Maybe not quite everything, yet. But Disney’s gravitational pull is warping the very space-time continuum of the media landscape. You will have to work harder than ever to escape the Magic Kingdom’s reach. If it doesn’t get you with the Avengers, it will get you with The Simpsons, or National Geographic, or Wes Anderson. If it doesn’t get you with Elsa sticking plasters, it will get you with Baby Yoda memes. Can anything stop Disney? Are the rebels’ weapons useless against it? Or might the Death Star contain a fatal design flaw? One potential wrinkle came last month with the surprise resignation of Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger. His successor was also a surprise: the unheard-of Bob Chapek, formerly head of Disney’s theme-parks division. Iger, who was scheduled to retire at the end of 2021, will stay on as chairman to “make sure that our creative pipelines are vibrant”. Inevitably, the relationship between the two Bobs has been likened to that of “Sith apprentice and Sith lord”, though given Chapek’s background, he is also an uncanny parallel to Tom Wambsgans, Matthew Macfadyen’s character in HBO’s Succession, who plots his ascent from the lowly resorts division of the Roy media empire – at last, an analogy Disney doesn’t own. Iger was very much the architect of Disney’s spectacular renaissance. By all accounts a straight-talking, decidedly un-Thanos-like New Yorker, he rose through the ranks of ABC television before Disney acquired it in 1996. In his autobiography, Iger recalls his first board meeting as Disney CEO in 2005. He got straight to the point and said: “As you all know, Disney Animation is a real mess.” On a visit to Hong Kong Disneyland he had noticed that most of the characters in the parade were from Disney movies past, with barely any from the last decade. His solution was to go shopping. It helped that Iger had personal relationships with some key people – such as Steve Jobs, whom he persuaded to sell Pixar to Disney in 2006, for $7.4bn. He also got Jobs to vouch for him to Ike Perlmutter, owner of Marvel. Iger also had a relationship with George Lucas, which helped him acquire Lucasfilm. Rather than “Disneyfying” these assets, Iger was smart enough to let each of them operate independently. As he told Pixar’s bosses: “It doesn’t make sense for us to buy you for what you are and then turn you into something else.” In fact, he imported Pixar’s culture to rejuvenate Disney’s own animation department, just as he sidelined Perlmutter to give free rein to Kevin Feige, the mastermind of Marvel’s spectacular movie series. Considering Avengers: Endgame has taken close to $3bn alone, that $4bn price tag for Marvel looks like a sound investment. Iger and Disney also had the good fortune to be stocking the cupboard just as the whole media landscape was tilting in favour of “over the top” streaming services. Having vanquished its old Hollywood rivals, Disney now finds itself facing the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, HBO Max (which launches in the US in May), and Comcast/NBCUniversal’s forthcoming Peacock. “The old guard of the traditional entertainment business is going through changes nobody would have predicted even five years ago,” says Cynthia Littleton, business editor at Variety. “So there was a real feeling that if Disney did not prepare for the future, they could become a takeover target by a gigantic tech firm.” She describes Iger as a “once-in-a-generation executive”. “He gets a lot of credit for looking out at the landscape and saying: ‘We need to do this and we need to do this now.’” Littleton does not imagine Disney+ will catch up with Netflix’s 160 million subscribers any time soon. Its stated target was 60 to 90 million, although it already has 30 million subscribers in the US, and some analysts are predicting it could reach 130 million in five years. “I think they expect to be a really strong competitor, but they don’t see it as a zero sum game.” One weak spot in the plan is the content. Disney+ gives you more than 500 movies and 350 series from the Disney/Pixar/Star Wars/Marvel back catalogue, not to mention National Geographic and 30 seasons of The Simpsons – all for a very competitive £5.99 a month (compared to £8.99 for HD Netflix). But much of it is aimed at children and families. Flagship Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian has been a runaway success, but grownup subscribers expecting more of the same might be disappointed. Much of Disney+’s original content either plays it safe or pitches it wrong. There are family-friendly reboots such as High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, and a live-action Lady and the Tramp; there are new series such as The World According to Jeff Goldblum, in which the actor cocks a quizzical eyebrow at, you know, stuff. And there are dispiritingly on-brand shows like Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings (couples getting married at Disney theme parks), or Be Our Chef, in which families compete to make a Disney-themed dish to serve at Disney World. You have to wonder how vibrant those “creative pipelines” are right now. For the Mandalorian demographic, there are some Marvel spin-offs further down the pipeline: The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (due in August, although production has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis) and WandaVision (December). But shows have been cancelled or long-delayed, including a Tron-themed series and Star Wars spin-off Obi-Wan. Other, edgier fare has been moved to the streaming service Hulu in the US (it owns that, too), such as Love, Victor – inspired by the hit movie Love, Simon, with a gay protagonist dealing with his sexuality. The latter suggests Disney is keeping things “family friendly”, which could be tantamount to playing to a conservative common denominator. It is a similar picture in the movie world. With so many universes coming under the Disney umbrella, and so much return required of its investments, there is the fear that Planet Disney will now simply eject a steady stream of sequels and spin-offs. But with both the Marvel and Star Wars sagas reaching some kind of conclusion last year, you wonder how much appetite there is for more of the same. Disney and Pixar are still putting out original stories but, again, their big successes of late have been sequels such as Toy Story 4 and Frozen II, or remakes of Disney classics such as The Lion King. Next in the pipeline comes a live-action remake of Mulan, which could expose another compromising aspect of Disney’s supremacy. China is vital to Disney’s growth, and the Mouse House has learned its lesson with Mao’s house, so to speak. Its 1997 movie Kundun (directed by Scorsese) led to a virtual shutout by the Chinese authorities for its pro-Tibetan stance. Disney has, by all accounts, been making huge efforts to get back in ever since. It finally succeeded in 2016, with the opening of the $5.5bn Shanghai Disneyland, which Iger described as “the biggest accomplishment of my career”. But Disney only owns 43% of it; the rest is in the hands of the Chinese government. So the new Mulan is unlikely to be taking any chances. The story looks to be closer to the original Chinese legend than the 1998 animation: no Eddie Murphy-voiced comedy dragon, and no sexuality-subverting relationship with officer Li Shang, who falls for Mulan when she is pretending to be a man. It could still be a great movie, but Mulan betrays a concern over just how much Disney is honing its product according to commercial and political considerations. When Walt Disney opened Disneyland in 1955, he dedicated it to “the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America”. But Disney the company no longer represents American values; it seeks to embody those of the world – potentially including its most repressive regimes. This is not to suggest Disney is inherently problematic, or that it is doing anything the rest of Hollywood isn’t also doing. Against these totalitarian fears, you could set such frontier-pushing mainstream films as Black Panther or Captain Marvel or Moana – all of which have made radical steps in terms of representation and inclusion. Or Disney’s laudable embrace of the LGBT+ community (Mulan aside): it has hosted unofficial “Gay Days” at Disney World for more than 20 years. Disney’s dominance is not simply down to deep pockets; its reputation was built on courage and innovation. Despite its flops, it has consistently set the bar creatively. So you could see Disney as a machine designed to exploit the masses by any means, or you could see it as a creative coalition striving to make the best possible fare. Either way, we have never seen a kingdom like Disney’s, except, perhaps, in one of its movies. In The Lion King, Mufasa gives the young Simba a portfolio-management lesson straight out of the Iger playbook. “Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance,” he says. “As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.” To which Simba replies: “But Dad. Don’t we eat the antelope?” Still, having established itself as entertainment’s apex predator, is a last-minute plot twist in store? The coronavirus has disrupted the landscape immeasurably, and Disney has been disproportionately hit. As the biggest player, it has had to delay more high-profile releases than any other studio – including Mulan, which was due out on 27 March, and halt production on more movies. It has also had to close all of its theme parks, which is revenue it will never get back. The parks and products division makes up roughly 50% of Disney’s profits. In addition, another of its acquisitions, the leading US sports channel ESPN, has no actual sports to broadcast. It is suddenly looking vulnerable. In the past month or so, the company has lost about a third of its value – some $85bn. There is speculation that Apple could be contemplating a takeover bid. Having devoured its rivals, will Disney be unable to fight off an even larger predator? That would be the ultimate irony. Or perhaps it’s just the circle of life. Disney+ is available on various platforms from Tuesday 24 March"
"The title is a deadpan challenge, and it is up to us to decide where exactly this movie and its characters live in the disputed territory around truth, untruth, near-truth: the comforting fiction that we all create around what we remember of our lives. This is the first non-Japanese-language film from auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda (Palme d’Or winner at Cannes in 2018 for his film Shoplifters) and he has come to France for a very elegant and insouciant family drama set in Paris, which he has directed from his own script, translated from the original into French by Léa le Dimna. Catherine Deneuve gives a seductive and self-aware performance as Fabienne Dangeville, a creamily well-preserved movie star in her mid-70s who is a legendary figure in her native land – opinionated, vain, imperious with a haughty vagueness about which of her contemporary acting rivals are dead and which alive. (It hardly matters to her.) There is a great scene in which Fabienne whimsically proclaims that all France’s great female stars have surnames that begin with the same letter as their first names: Danielle Darrieux, Simone Signoret, Anouk Aimée – and it is a joy to watch Deneueve’s subtle wince or moue of suppressed disgust when someone adds: “Brigitte Bardot.” (No one dares point out that her own initials don’t match.) It is very stylish, amusing work from Deneuve who comes as close to really loosening up as she is ever going to get, and there is, incidentally, an entertaining, brief shot of her walking her dog in Paris that Kore-eda repeats in full as an out-take over the closing credits. Fabienne has just published her memoirs, outrageously entitled La Vérité, or The Truth, and, to mark this occasion, her screenwriter daughter Lumir (Juliette Binoche) has come from New York with her American husband, Hank (Ethan Hawke), a failing TV actor, and their young daughter, Charlotte (Clémentine Grenier). Instantly, these memoirs cause uproar: her long-suffering assistant Luc (Alain Libolt) quits, because he is not mentioned in them at all, and Lumir is furious because Fabienne has invented ridiculous anecdotes about the loving mamma picking her up from school – when in fact she was always away filming. Yet Lumir’s attitude to her mother and to their own troubled mother-daughter relationship changes subtly, and mysteriously, because Fabienne has invited her to come and watch the new movie that she is shooting, a sci-fi fantasy entitled Memories of My Mother, about a young woman in the future with a terminal disease who is able to use time travel to visit her young daughter at various ages; Fabienne is to play this daughter as an old woman. (It is based on a story by sci-fi author Ken Liu, and it has, in the real world, been adapted as a short film called Beautiful Dreamer, by commercials director David Gaddie.) It is intriguing to wonder if Kore-eda himself considered making his own version of Memories of My Mother, maybe in French, maybe with the same cast envisaged here – but then realised what a shame it would be to waste Deneuve in such a small part. In any case, this enigmatic story within a story has an echo with at least one part of Kore-eda’s previous work: his cult docu-essay fantasy After Life from 1999, which imagined a future in which people are allowed to choose the most ecstatic moment of their lives in which to spend eternity. The Truth starts as a droll tale but then morphs into something else, something stranger and more elusive, something with a hint of fairytale magic realism, which plays with the interconnection between cinema and reality: Fabienne is continually reproached with her attitude to a certain contemporary whose lost career runs alongside Fabienne’s own life in a sort of ghost parallel. Kore-eda might have had in mind at some subconscious level an inversion of the case of Deneuve’s late sister Françoise Dorléac (although the analogy is hardly exact). As for Binoche’s Lumir, the topsy-turvy spectacle of her mother appearing in a role much older than her character’s mother affects her strangely, and she begins to see how she might use her own daughter in a dramatic ploy to rethink their relationship, and re-establish her own power within it. It’s a startling, even shocking piece of imposture. This movie is an absorbing serio-comic flourish."
"In the impactful new Netflix documentary Crip Camp, we’re told a story so remarkable that it seems as if we should already know it or at least have a vague awareness of its existence. It starts with something small, a camp in upstate New York for those with disabilities, and ends with something big, an impassioned civil rights movement that led to vital systemic change. Like many of the best documentaries, more and more of which have been cropping up on Netflix, it educates us on an underrepresented minority, adding nuance and specificity to an experience that might have previously been painted in broad strokes, the kind of film that shouldn’t just be recommended viewing but also required. Premiering to great acclaim earlier this year at Sundance, after securing the Obamas as executive producers, Crip Camp is in itself the small film that became something big, now reaching millions of, quite literally given the pandemic, captive viewers. It starts in 1971 in the Catskills at Camp Jened, a loose, free-spirited camp designed for teens with disabilities. It was a utopia for kids who felt alienated and sidelined, a rare haven devoid of judgment and discrimination, an eye-opening experience for so many who’d felt shut out for so long. The teens who’d previously been rejected were suddenly accepted, moving from high school classes in the basement out into the light. Directors Nicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht immerse us at Jened through an invaluable amount of vintage footage as well as interviews with surviving participants. The freewheeling vibe of the camp, likened to Woodstock, is matched by a similarly unstructured first act which sits us with the teens as they play, smoke, flirt and, most interestingly, discuss key issues with each other. For so many of them, this was their first opportunity to speak about the intricacies of their experience, which admittedly were different given their range of disabilities, but there’s a thrill in watching them bond, especially in one illuminating scene where they lament the lack of alone time they’re allowed, protective parents never far away. But the camp is only the beginning and once the teens leave after the summer of 71, the film moves on to what life looked like and how that formative experience left an indelible impression. It was no longer acceptable to live in the background, to accept status as second-class citizens, and so many of them used this newfound, or newly awakened, energy to demand political change. The inarguable breakout star of the film is Judy Heumann, who was a counsellor at the camp and went on to lead the movement, fearlessly confronting a system that was intimidatingly stacked against her. She’s a captivating central figure, persuasively, passionately petitioning for equity and in one of the film’s most powerful moments, when certain legislation is passed, she poignantly refuses to be grateful for the basic right of an accessible bathroom. It’s a film that takes small, incremental leaps until we’re finally made aware of the bigger picture, of the brave strides made by people who met at a camp and realised that what they were being offered in their lives wasn’t good enough. It’s rousing stuff, especially when we see how Black Panthers and LGBTQ+ activists at the time rallied alongside, aware that their individual fights were ultimately not that different, and it’s one that’s similarly not over. The shameful lack of wheelchair access within New York’s subway system, which the film traces back to callous decision-making in the 70s, remains a major problem while disability groups have filed a complaint about Covid-19-based discrimination just this week. There’s understandable anger here but also humour and insight, Newnham and LeBrecht allowing those in the film to be seen as sexual, ambitious, funny, interesting individuals, more than what society has too often allowed. It’s as involving as it is necessary, a rare ray of sunshine on yet another cloudy day."
"As Covid-19 continues to gut the entertainment industry, shutting down theaters across the world to prevent community transmission of the virus, Universal Pictures announced that three theatrical releases – The Invisible Man, The Hunt and Emma – will shift from theaters to at-home release this week. The films will be available on-demand as early as Friday in the US and in international markets where they were previously released for 48-hour rentals at a suggested price of $19.99. “Universal Pictures has a broad and diverse range of movies with 2020 being no exception. Rather than delaying these films or releasing them into a challenged distribution landscape, we wanted to provide an option for people to view these titles in the home that is both accessible and affordable,” said Jeff Shell, the CEO of NBCUniversal, in a press conference Monday morning. “We hope and believe that people will still go to the movies in theaters where available, but we understand that for people in different areas of the world that is increasingly becoming less possible.” Additionally, Universal/Dreamworks Animation’s Trolls World Tour, originally scheduled to be the studio’s first post-coronavirus shutdown theatrical release on 10 April, will now be available for in-home viewing on the same date. The announcements follow a 22-year box office low of $55.3m this past weekend, as cinemas closed through the country. New York and Los Angeles, the two largest grossing cities in the US, both mandated full closure of theaters on Sunday. According to Deadline, New York City, currently facing the second-worst coronavirus outbreak in the US, saw a box office drop of 64% from the previous weekend; Los Angeles’s was 55%."
"Cinema attendance in the US and around the world slumped dramatically last weekend, as the effects of the coronavirus outbreak began to bite. In North America, box-office revenue dropped to its lowest level in two decades as audiences began to stay away. Variety reported that the total amount for Friday to Sunday in the US and Canada was about $55.3m, the worst result since September 2000, and a 45% drop from the weekend before. The top-performing film, Pixar’s Onward, recorded a fall of 73.1% for a total of $10.53m. Box-office declines are typical for wide-release films, but, for comparison, Pixar’s last original scripted animation, Coco, dropped by 45.8% at the same point in its run in 2017. “Social distancing” measures adopted by major cinema chains, such as Regal and AMC, including a reduction in cinema capacity, attendance capping and “enhanced cleaning”, also contributed to the diminished audience. The picture was similarly bleak outside the US. Cinemas were closed in France and Spain, joining China and Italy, and the UK and Ireland have limited capacities and implemented social distancing, such as seat gaps. Deadline reported that the top five films recorded $30.7m in non-US territories, around 85% less than the same weekend two years ago. The Vin Diesel comic book action movie Bloodshot emerged top, taking $15.1m to add to its US first-week total of $10.5m. Its best-performing market, unusually, appears to be Russia, where it took $2.4m. In the UK, Screen reports that box office takings for the top 5 films are down to £3.31m compared to a total of £6.47m, a drop of 49%. Like the US, Onward was the top-grossing film, but its takings of £1.3m was 50% down on last week’s. Misbehaviour the Miss World protest comedy drama, recorded £330,000 on its opening session. Future prospects look even worse, as restrictions increase. The mayors of New York and Lost Angeles, Bill de Blasio and Eric Garcetti, have both ordered cinemas to close as part of wider-ranging efforts to safeguard public health. The postponement of almost every major film due for release in the remainder of March and April – including A Quiet Place Part 2, Mulan and No Time to Die – means that even if cinemas remain open, box-office returns will be hit sharply, with the film industry’s global losses projected at $5bn. Work on many major film and TV productions has been suspended, including The Batman, The Little Mermaid and Stranger Things. Reports suggest, however, that as coronavirus cases drop in China, the country’s cinemas may be preparing to reopen towards the end of April, in time for the May Day holiday."
"Alastair Lee’s adventure documentary is meant to be about an attempt by the ultra-high-achieving blind rock climber Jesse Dufton to scale the Old Man of Hoy, a formidable 450ft sea stack off Orkney. Born with a degenerative eye condition, Dufton can only distinguish between light and dark. Unusually for a non-sighted climber in a team of two, he is the lead, which means he goes first, taking the risks, placing the gear into cracks in the rock, clipping in the ropes. His climbing partner is his wife, Molly Thompson. And here’s where the film really takes off, as a tender and moving portrait of a very English marriage. Dufton and Thompson are unsentimental plain-speakers: after the intoxicating thrill of a climb, don’t expect a high five, fist bump or cry of “Awesome!” The most you can hope for is a gentle: “Ace. Good work, matey.” But they are so obviously head over heels with each other: you see it in the gentle touch of her hand in the space between his shoulder blades at an indoor climbing wall; he knows exactly which way she wants him to move. The pair met at university, when Dufton still had a little sight remaining. The only time he lingers on his blindness is talking about no longer being able to see his wife’s face. Watching them climb the Old Man of Hoy, picking their way up a vertical face, a 100ft drop below them, is scarier than any horror film. Five hours into their trek, they’re only halfway up and things begin to get a bit hairy. But you sense this couple can get through anything together.  Climbing Blind is due for release in the UK on 20 March, and will be available for streaming on Vimeo on 20 May."
"Haifaa Al-Mansour’s latest film, The Perfect Candidate, opens with a doctor in her 20s driving to work. In any other film you wouldn’t register the fact that she’s behind the wheel. But this woman, dressed in a black abaya and niqab, is in Saudi Arabia, which until 2018 banned women from driving. Al-Mansour added the scene as a punch-the-air moment for female audiences in Saudi Arabia, an invite to a collective whoop of victory. “I know that in the west this seems like common-sense stuff,” she says. “But I think they’ve really helped women to see themselves as an independent people.” She fixes me with an earnest look, to see if I get it. “For younger professional women, it’s huge, because it gives them control over their destiny.” Al-Mansour is Saudi Arabia’s first female director. In 2011, she shot her debut, Wadjda, hiding in the back of a van. It would have been impossible for a woman to be seen openly on the street giving orders to men. So, she kept out of sight and used a walkie-talkie (“But I’m sure you could hear my voice all over Riyadh. ‘Do that!’ ‘Pull the camera back!’”) The film was gorgeous, a funny, big-hearted story about a gobby 10-year-old girl who would stop at nothing to get her hands on a bike. Al-Mansour shrugged off the death threats (“One of them told me they had a coffin ready for me”). Spend five minutes in her company and you are struck by her optimistic energy. The new film is another inspiring story of female resistance, this time about a young female doctor who runs, almost by accident, for office in local elections. This time around, following the easing of restrictions segregating men and women, Al-Mansour could work in public. “I wasn’t in the van this time,” she grins. “I was shouting at all my crew in person!” We meet in London on International Women’s Day, when social distancing is still a novelty. Walking into the cafe, 5ft-nothing in her Converse, she shakes my hand and then, mindful of the breach of etiquette, reaches into her handbag for a bottle of hand sanitiser and squirts me a dollop. The exchange smacks of her mix of warmth and no-nonsense.  Four years ago, Al-Mansour moved from Bahrain to Los Angeles with her American husband Bradley Neimann, a diplomat, and their son, Adam, 12, and daughter, Hailey, 10. (“They are very American,” she says of her kids. “They say ‘dude’ with an American accent.”) But she missed home and so she wrote The Perfect Candidate, which stars the impossibly beautiful TV actor Mila Al Zahrani as Dr Maryam, a supremely capable young medic working in a rundown hospital (healthcare is a major employer of women). The film catches society in the midst of a transformation, at a moment when women have more freedom, but society is slow to embrace them. When Maryam holds an all-female fundraiser, the response is depressing: “My husband will kill me if I vote for you.” “I hope you win, but I don’t vote.” I’m not giving anything away to say that Maryam has a tough time of it on the campaign trail – laughed at, patronised by a TV presenter, criticised as shrill and unfeminine. Was Al-Mansour making a more universal point? “Yeah, they are crushed. Look at Hillary Clinton. But seeing women in leadership positions is something people need to get used to.” At the start of the film Maryam wears the niqab; as she grows more confident in her identity it comes off. What did Al-Mansour want to say about the veil? “At the beginning Maryam wants to fit in. And what does society expect of women? To cover up. But at the end she understands what defiance means. It’s about respect. A human being’s identity is in their face. I think face covering is one of the most dangerous things that ever happened to the Muslim culture.” For the first time in our conversation Al-Mansour is deadly serious. “We need female Muslim scholars who can deconstruct a lot of the literature about a woman’s body and the veil. Like, for example, when I was a kid I was, I was told: ‘You are like a cake. If you don’t cover it, flies will come.’ So it’s blaming the victim. This is the psychology a lot of Muslim women go through – they have to cover because they’re responsible for someone’s else’s actions.” The dress code for women has changed in Saudia Arabia, she adds. Women are encouraged not to be completely covered. “But a lot of women still cling to that because that is taught from the beginning that is what makes them good and chaste and noble.” The film, I think, has demythologising effect, too. It’s a lesson to audiences in the west that behind the abayas and the veils, the women of the Middle East are modern citizens of the world. “Saudi women are sassy and very resourceful,” says Al-Mansour. “You try to buy a carpet from a Saudi woman; she will take all your money. They are very savvy. ” Al-Mansour gives the impression of being a natural-born rebel. She grew up in small conservative town, and describes herself as a shy kid, the eighth of 12 children in a liberal house. Her father was a poet. Where does the rebellious streak come from? “My parents,” she answers quickly. “We didn’t have money, but I feel really privileged. I was respected. My father and my mother never told me: ‘Because you are a woman you can’t do this.’” Music filled the house, and as teenager she watched Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies. “Whenever I told people at school I listened to music, they’d be like: ‘You’re going straight to hell. I don’t want to play with you.’ So, I felt like an outsider.” After studying literature at the American University in Cairo, she got a marketing job at a Saudi oil company. “In meetings they would never listen to me. I was invisible.” Al-Mansour began her career in film by making a short films with her siblings. In 2005, she met Neimann at a screening of one of her documentaries at the US embassy in Saudi Arabia where he was working as a cultural attache. When he was posted to Australia, she studied film in Sydney and wrote the script that became Wadjda. Right now, Al-Mansour’s plan is to make films in Saudi Arabia and the west. She arrived in Hollywood at the right time, she tells me. “I get a lot of chances. I get a lot of meetings. I have a chance now to build a resumé that allows me, hopefully, in a couple of years to direct a really big movie with a big budget.” Would she be up for making a blockbuster? She raises an eyebrow, surprised I would even ask the question. “Yes! I think I can make an amazing $100m film. Ten years ago, that would be unheard of, for a film-maker like me who’s not white and who’s not American, who’s not a man.” #MeToo and #OscarSoWhite have made real and meaningful differences for women such as Al-Mansour. “What happened with Harvey Weinstein was a wake-up call. All the misogyny that we took for granted is not acceptable any more. There is the intention for improvement and it’s up to us women film-makers to take opportunities and run with them and work really hard and show the world what we’ve got.”"
"The US box office has recorded zero revenue for the first time in history after the country’s near total cinema shutdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Data agency Comscore did not issue their weekly report after Hollywood’s major distributors, led by Disney, declined to issue any figures. According to Comscore’s senior media analyst, Paul Dergarabedian, the only comparable occasion was in the immediate aftermath of the Northridge earthquake in 1994, which hampered collection of data, but its commercial effects were limited to California. With major chains such as Regal and AMC shutting down last week, the halting of cinema income is far more profound. Even so, some films are reporting revenue. The box office leader, according to Box Office Mojo, is the midlife-crisis comedy Phoenix, Oregon, which has taken $3,842 from 17 screens. However, this is the outcome of a streaming partnership with individual cinemas, in which audiences can watch the film at home with a box-office split with a nominated venue. The film tweeted a tongue-in-cheek message congratulating itself on becoming the “lowest-grossing #1 film of all time”. According to Deadline, however, the latest Disney/Pixar film Onward is playing at 135 locations and grossed $71,000, while horror film The Invisible Man has taken $64,000 from 111 venues. This appears to have mostly accrued from drive-in cinemas, with the Glendale Drive-In in Glendale, Arizona becoming Onward’s biggest-earning venue."
"If you have ever strutted around in sunglasses and a silken bomber jacket, and didn’t even have to try to keep a straight face, chances are you’re into synthwave. This subcultural genre of music, characterised by anthemic analogue synth lines, is explored in this stylish but shallow documentary. The partly crowdfunded film makes a reverse historical sweep of the genre, ending where the music started with the sober, even ascetic work of Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. This was gloriously cheapened by Giorgio Moroder, who made the sound aspirational and decadent, inspiring not only pop but also film soundtracks, where synth sounds were easy signifiers for the future. The style fell out of favour as the 90s embraced guitars again, but Daft Punk became the key act to bring it back – their light-up pyramid stage set is the defining icon of the synthwave aesthetic – and influenced a host of new producers. Social media and blogging play their parts, as people start to share their fetish for the neon lights and kitsch fonts of the 80s as well as the music. Stranger Things, today’s most 80s-nostalgic pop culture, has a theme that is pure synthwave; another key moment is the 2011 Nicolas Winding Refn film Drive, which deployed a synthwave soundtrack and, married to the nihilistic glamour of Ryan Gosling’s lead character, cemented its hipster kudos. Perhaps the best definition is music that makes you feel cool while walking at night. Director Iván Castell employs a diverse and global set of talking heads, which gives a sense how far the genre has pervaded, aided by the internet – he hops from New York and Toronto to Antwerp, Grenoble and beyond. Unfortunately, many are given to platitudes of the “just make the music you want to make” variety, or asides such as “I used Fruity Loops [production software] for Christ’s sake!” which will baffle anyone but their fellow nerds, who are perhaps the only viable audience for this film. Leading lights of the scene such as Kavinsky, Johnny Jewel, M83 or Survive are conspicuously absent. Castell does admittedly snag John Carpenter, whose own synth scores gave such drama to Escape from New York and the rest. Carpenter is employed as a sensei-like narrator, recording his observations on to a cassette tape to be taken back in time by a Gosling-type pretty-boy street punk driving a DeLorean, in a series of impressively produced interstitial segments. This fantasy narrative gives the film its backwards-tracking structure to return to the source of synthwave, though Carpenter speaks as if he’s reading an autocue that’s been set up two yards too far away, and his rhapsodic guff about the “rebel beauty” of the genre and his wise-old-sage pronouncements – “don’t intellectualise it, it all comes down to one thing, instinct, that’s what you must keep close to you” – are classy filler. There are some interesting moments. It’s notable how many of the producers appear anonymously, filmed in the dark or, like Gost, behind a black veil with a skull perched on his knee. One puts this introversion down to them being “bundles of self-doubt”; others say it’s to focus on the music and escape the banality of today’s image-led social media. British trio Gunship, who drive a car with a keyboard for a grille, are enjoyably forthright about how much better 80s films were versus those of the “awful, meta, self-aware” present. And while there isn’t enough unpacking of why they and other musicians are so given to nostalgia, London producer 80s Stallone admits of his passion for the past: “I had more hair – I had a future!”"
"Tom Hanks, the actor who has tested positive for Covid-19 while shooting in Australia, has updated fans on the condition of himself and his wife, Rita Wilson. He thanked the Australians “taking such good care of us” in a Gold Coast hospital and emphasised again that the couple were in self-isolation. Adopting a slightly more sober tone than in his post on Thursday announcing that he and Wilson, both 63, had tested positive for coronavirus, Hanks said: “There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one day at a time.” The actor continued with a plea for people to do all they can to limit the spread of the disease and look out for others. “There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts,” he wrote, “and taking care of ourselves and each other, no?” Hanks concluded with a reference to one of his oft-quoted lines in the film A League of their Own: “Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball.” Production on the Elvis Presley biopic on which Hanks was working has been suspended. On Thursday, Hanks said that they had been feeling “a bit tired, like we had colds and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too.” The pair had already conducted a substantial number of engagements before they were tested and self-isolation measures have been taken by some of those they encountered while they might have been asymptomatic, including the hosts of chatshow Today Extra."
"The coronavirus has turned the UK into an outlier. The rest of the world has seemingly gone into lockdown, shutting schools and public transport in a desperate bid to quell the pandemic. But Boris Johnson has gone in a different direction. According to him, the UK is business as usual. But what prompted such a policy? Is he privy to more advanced scientific knowledge than all the other countries? Is he really such a vocal proponent of herd immunity? Or is there something else going on? Perhaps to find out, we should travel back to 2006, when Johnson told an audience that “the real hero of Jaws is the mayor”. Ah, Mayor Larry Vaughn, Amity’s foolhardy leader who orders the beach to remain open despite overwhelming evidence that there’s a massive shark in the water determined to eat everyone. Now everything suddenly makes sense. But still, at least Vaughn is finally getting his dues. Without him, Jaws would simply be a film about a policeman who spots a shark, imposes a stringent set of beachside social distancing rules and then kills the shark. But Vaughn is the necessary sand in the ointment. He can only see the potential economic losses caused by a beach closure, and pushes on against all arguments. “As you can see, it’s a beautiful day,” he tells the media at one point. “The beaches are opened, and people are having a wonderful time.” Vaughn is the entire reason why Jaws became an enduring classic. And yet, until now, the cultural impact of Vaughn has been minimal. True, in 2013 the comedian Howard Kremer released a song celebrating Larry Vaughn’s impressive the-show-must-go-on attitude (“Only three people got eaten / The rest had a great season / Cos of Larry Vaughn”). And, true, Boris Johnson is a self-confessed Vaughnaholic. But that’s about the extent of it. Looking back, Vaughn had three things going for him. The first, obviously, was his never-say-die attitude towards deadly shark attacks. The second was his incredible taste in blazers. This, remember, was a man so dedicated to his role as the mayor of a seaside town that he literally walked around in a jacket covered in little tiny anchors. Whatever you think of the man’s policies, you have to admire his style. I have for some years been a member of a Facebook group devoted to discussions of Vaughn’s anchor jacket. Paul F Tompkins once commissioned an imitation suit and the only thing stopping me from doing the same is my increasing suspicion that the money would be better spent on long-life food to feed my children when the coronavirus inevitably mutates and our quarantine period becomes indefinite. The third thing is Vaughn’s longevity. You’d think that, in a fair and just society, he would have been removed from office the moment the people of Amity caught wind of his preposterous self-interest in the face of disaster. But no. Do me a favour and watch Jaws 2. It’s set a few years after the devastating attacks of the original, but guess who’s still mayor? That’s right, Larry Vaughn. Better yet, despite even more overwhelming evidence that another shark is terrorising the coastline, Vaughn still continues to frustrate all of Brody’s plans. The electorate, it seems, holds a lot of stock in Vaughn’s total refusal to believe in the existence of sharks. Look, nobody is saying that Vaughn was perfect. In his ability to willingly send townsfolk to their deaths for short-term financial gain, some might argue that he was actually something of a villain. But to me, he is a figure of ultimate dignity. Was he a good man? No. Did he do his best? No. Is it a good thing that our prime minister is repeatedly being compared to him during a once-a-century global health crisis? No. But did he wear a nice jacket with some anchors on it? Yes. Yes, he did."
"After it premiered to mostly strong notices at Sundance in 2019, Big Time Adolescence seemed like an easy sell in theory, one of the easiest of that year’s crop of premieres: commercial, crowd-pleasing and the first major film role for a headline-grabbing comic. But it remained on the shelf for longer than expected, a full nine months before Neon and Hulu partnered for a relatively meagre $4m pickup. The lethargy was perhaps a sign of how difficult it has become to sell a big screen comedy fronted by a teen with streamers like Netflix instead becoming the go-to for a film such as this, appealing to a younger audience who have grown to reserve the multiplex for more pronounced events. So something this slick and this charming will prove to be a warm surprise for US viewers heading to Hulu this weekend, for more than one reason. Deftly realising the public hunger to watch new films at home as a pandemic threatens to shut down cinemas, the Disney-owned platform made the decision to drop Big Time Adolescence a week earlier than anticipated, tying in with its one week theatrical window, a small, token release that now seems entirely redundant given the sure-to-be-quiet state of the box office this weekend. Having seen the film both at its hyped festival premiere and now on the small screen, it feels far more comfortable in the latter scenario, a shaggy, low-key coming-of-age comedy that’s happily a world away from current, consuming concerns of Covid-19. It’s the story of Monroe, or Mo (Griffin Gluck), a 16-year-old whose only real friend is his sister’s ex-boyfriend Zeke (Pete Davidson), a twentysomething slacker who wears his inability to grow up as a badge of honour. As Mo is pushed to connect more others of his own age, he starts to question whether Zeke is the best friend he once thought he was. There’s not much to Nancy Meyers assistant turned writer-director Jason Orley’s first-time feature but there’s just about enough to prove diverting as well as promising for the future, when Orley has a story that’s a bit more distinctive to tell. Big Time Adolescence is a film about stunted growth, about a man whose best years were in high school and, while not as caustic as Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody’s Young Adult, it shares a similarly stark view of what happens next. Zeke’s idea of cool is one that hasn’t changed since he was 16 and so him and Mo continue to gravitate towards each other in away that’s messily both good and bad for them. Good because they share a loving brotherly connection that runs deeper than the surface-level laddishness might suggest and bad because the effects of Zeke’s strident immaturity are stalling them. The film works best when it’s studying the characters at its centre and their difficult dynamic, a fragile friendship that slowly starts to crumble with more exposure to the world around it. It’s less effective when it focuses on the specifics of the plot, a thinly etched set of circumstances involving high school parties, weed and climactic confrontations that will prove familiar to savvy audiences. Much was made of Davidson’s role at Sundance but it’s his co-star Gluck who steals the show. Davidson, an uncomfortably limited performer on Saturday Night Live, is playing a slightly exaggerated version of himself and there’s very little here to suggest that he’ll be equipped to do anything else. But Gluck, last seen in Netflix’s Tall Girl, offers a far more accomplished performance, perfecting a specific sort of self-possessed confidence that works well around certain social groups yet falters around others. He’s figuring out who he is and who he wants to be and the more he gains perspective on Zeke, he’s beginning to understand what to avoid at the risk of never fully growing up as well. It’s a gentle, predictable film that doesn’t exactly put any steps wrong in its depiction of adolescence but Orley doesn’t quite do enough right for it to linger in the memory for longer than the credits. The big in the title is a misnomer."
"They are one of the highest profile Hollywood couples who attract wellwishers and autograph hunters in droves. So when it was discovered that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson had tested positive for coronavirus while in Australia, the premier of Queensland let it be known that anyone who came into close contact with them should self-isolate. Social media shows the celebrity couple came into contact with quite a few people, though how many of those would qualify as “close contact” is unclear. Close contact is defined as being face to face with someone for at least 15 minutes, or being in the same enclosed space for at least two hours, so it is highly unlikely any quick chance encounters would lead to a transmission. Here is a timeline sourced from publicly available information of where Hanks and Wilson had been in the days leading up to their diagnoses. On Thursday, Hanks and Wilson confirmed that they had tested positive for Covid-19, and were currently in a hospital on the Gold Coast. Hanks had been in Queensland filming for an as yet untitled project about Elvis Presley, directed by Baz Luhrmann. “Tom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,” Palaszczuk said on Thursday. Three days earlier, the couple shared multiple shots of a cruise they took on Sydney harbour. Despite the pair posting photos with fans, Palaszczuk said that only people with “over 15 minutes of being in very close contact” were at risk, and “a selfie wouldn’t count as that”. Wilson also appeared on Channel Nine’s Today Extra show, as seen in this photo posted by hosts David Campbell and Belinda Russell. Hanks was at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on 8 March. Wilson performed at the iconic venue on the night of 7 March. The Opera House confirmed that Wilson performed in the Utzon Room, a performance attended by approximately 207 people, including Hanks. “Following news that the couple have tested positive for coronavirus in Queensland, the Opera House is in touch with NSW Health and Queensland Health and will be acting on their advice,” a spokeswoman said. Hanks and Wilson walked along the beach and then had a drink at the North Bondi RSL, according to footage captured by photographers. Two days earlier, Wilson had also performed in Brisbane’s South Bank. A week earlier, Hanks was spotted by fans while on a Gold Coast beach. It’s as yet unknown when Hanks and Wilson entered Australia, but it is clear the Wilson was in Los Angeles as of 28 February – at a charity event for breast cancer research. Similarly, Hanks and Wilson were in Los Angeles on 24 February. Hanks and Wilson attended the Oscars awards ceremony in LA, where Hanks was nominated for best supporting actor for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. However, it is unlikely he had contracted the virus at this point, a month before his diagnosis. However, it is clear that Hanks was also in Australia prior to his attendance at the Oscars, with Brisbane’s Courier Mail reporting that he shared a meal of 50c chicken wings on the Gold Coast with some fans. Again, it is unlikely the Oscar-winning actor had contracted Covid-19 at this point. Similarly, the actor posed for this photograph at a restaurant in NSW as early as 2 February."
"The best film category is dominated – just like everything else in the cultural conversation around movies – by Netflix, which has the majority of the nominees: Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story and Fernando Meirelles’s The Two Popes. The other two are Sam Mendes’s 1917 and Todd Phillips’s box-office smash Joker. This is a really good list, in my view, with one exception: I am unconvinced that Joker is anything other than an amazingly crass, boorish and shallow movie, stridently but incorrectly congratulating itself on its own supposed supercoolness: there is a decent, but overrated performance from Joaquin Phoenix.  1917 is one from the heart, a one-shot nightmare that succeeds in being tremendous, exhilarating and affecting. Scorsese’s wintry mob drama is a magnificent film, one of his very best. For me, the film flew by. Marriage Story is a gorgeous, beguiling film – desperately sad, and yet with a persistent heartbeat of romance. The Two Popes is the kind of undemanding middleweight biopic that tends to be rewarded during awards season: an imagined dramatic account of the confrontation between Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins) and the cardinal who succeeds him: Francis (Jonathan Pryce). I regretted the absence of Claire Denis’s sci-fi High Life – and even more the snub to Greta Gerwig’s wonderful new version of Little Women. Will win: Marriage Story. Should win: The Irishman. Shoulda been a contender: Little Women. This category is traditionally where the often-mocked Globes scores, because it makes space for the crowd-pleasers at which most awards bodies turn up their noses. It is a lively list this year, although I am astonished at the way pundits have rolled over for the fatuous and pointless Jojo Rabbit. It strikes a very queasy series of false notes. Dexter Fletcher’s Rocketman is a rousing and entertaining account of the early life of Elton John with a great (singing) performance from Taron Egerton, although it is clearly the authorised version permitted by Sir Elton himself. My favourite on this list is Quentin Tarantino’s dizzying, dazzling Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, a black comedy about late-60s Los Angeles which is brilliantly conceived and designed. Rian Johnson’s Christie-esque whodunit, Knives Out, has been much praised, although I have to admit to being the tiniest bit disappointed with the big reveal. Eddie Murphy’s Dolemite Is My Name is a hilarious Blaxploitation biopic comedy, and thoroughly deserves its nomination. But where on Earth was Booksmart? That really was an out-and-out comedy, without any pretensions to anything other than getting laughs.  Will win: Knives Out. Should win: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Shoulda been a contender: Booksmart. Here is where this year’s Globes look a little bit under par. It is great to see Adam Driver get his nomination for Marriage Story, while Antonio Banderas establishes a gold-standard with his great performance in Pedro Almdodóvar’s autofictional movie Pain and Glory. But I found Christian Bale’s mannered and twitchy performance as the hot-tempered racing-car genius in the middling Ford v Ferrari almost insufferable (the same goes for Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker). Jonathan Pryce does an honest, good-natured job with the role of Pope Francis in The Two Popes. It is very surprising that Robert De Niro somehow didn’t get a nod for his gloomy hitman in The Irishman, Brad Pitt probably deserved something for his troubled spaceman in James Gray’s Ad Astra. Will win: Adam Driver. Should win: Antonio Banderas. Shoulda been a contender: Robert De Niro. Cynthia Erivo brought sheer passionate commitment, charisma and verve to the role of the anti-slavery campaigner Harriet Tubman; her closest competitor is Renée Zellweger, who won hearts and minds with her very intelligent and heartfelt portrayal of Judy Garland. It is a good performance, although the film itself puts a sugary soft focus on the wrenching agony of Garland’s decline. Saoirse Ronan is characteristically forthright and excellent in the role of Jo in Gerwig’s terrific new version of Little Women. Scarlett Johansson is also very good in Marriage Story, with flashes of passion, anguish and rage that are all the more powerful for bursting out of that kind of opaque reserve that she habitually creates. I am very unconvinced by Charlize Theron’s mannered and odd impersonation of Fox News star Megyn Kelly in Bombshell; the film’s confusion over the fact that Kelly is no feminist shows up in her performance. Perhaps the Globes should have looked outside Hollywood and rewarded Yong Mei for her heartwrenching turn as the grieving mother in Wang Xiaoshuai’s So Long, My Son. Will win: Renée Zelleweger. Should win: Cynthia Erivo. Shoulda been a contender: Yong Mei. Some really great stuff here from Leonardo DiCaprio as a failing TV cowboy actor, and – the singing especially – from Egerton in Rocketman. There is a blast of comic energy from Murphy as the 70s Blaxploitation comic Rudy Ray Moore; as for Daniel Craig, he brings plenty of amusement and drollery to his performance as the intellectual private detective in Knives Out (although I sometimes wonder if he really does have comedy bones). It is a bit dismaying to see Roman Griffin Davis in here for his moderate child-actor moppet turn in the worryingly overindulged Jojo Rabbit. I would have liked to see Robert Downey Jr nominated for his very distinctive and personal performance as Tony Stark in Avengers: Endgame. Will win: Taron Egerton. Should win: Leonardo DiCaprio. Shoulda been a contender: Robert Downey Jr. My feeling is that Awkwafina has this sewn up for her starring turn in The Farewell, a heart-rending and sweet movie about the Chinese-American experience. Cate Blanchett can never be anything other than a potent and intelligent screen presence, and her performance as the agoraphobic architect who goes missing in Where’d You Go, Bernadette? has been much admired. As for Emma Thompson, she has been nominated for her role as an acid-tongued British talk-show host in Late Night – a good performance although, oddly, she is more obviously funny in a far inferior film, the box-office smash Last Christmas, in which she was the grumpy Croatian mum. Ana de Armas is really good in Knives Out, but again I have to say in terms of real comedy – not comedy-drama, not drama with bittersweet comic touches, but actual comedy – Feldstein is streets ahead of anyone here. One person who deserved to be on this list is that great singer and actor Jessie Buckley for her full-throated performance in Wild Rose, the story of a Scottish woman yearning to be a country music star. Will win: Awkwafina. Should win: Beanie Feldstein. Shoulda been a contender: Jessie Buckley. There are some big names and revered silverback gorillas in this list – all of whom are doing an excellent job, although I couldn’t help wondering if the Hollywood Foreign Press Association could cast its net a little wider? For opaque reasons, Anthony Hopkins has a best supporting actor nomination, despite being of equal importance to Pryce in The Two Popes. Tom Hanks’s performance as the American TV legend Fred Rogers is causing critics to gibber with awestruck delight, although Brad Pitt may pinch it with his wonderfully mature performance in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, which showcases his marvellous Gary-Cooper-like ease. But the frontrunners have to be Al Pacino and Joe Pesci for their fantastic performances as the Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa and the coolly understated mobster Russell Bufalino in The Irishman. I reckon Pesci will get it – to a roar of pleasure from the assembled crowd.  Will win: Joe Pesci. Should win: Joe Pesci. Shoulda been a contender: Wesley Snipes (Dolemite Is My Name). Jennifer Lopez started as an actor; do not rule out the possibility that she will be rewarded for her performance in the widely enjoyed raunchfest Hustlers, as the mentor-stripper who takes Constance Wu under her wing. Yet the Globe might well go Kathy Bates for her part as the everyman-hero’s mother in Clint Eastwood’s biopic drama Richard Jewell. Elsewhere, there is Margot Robbie for her (fictional) role in Bombshell; very uninhibited performance, and Robbie is not hampered like her co-stars by having to produce a quasi-impersonation of a real-life person. Annette Bening gives an intelligent, careful but uninspired performance inThe Report. But the winner here is surely Laura Dern, for her hilarious portrayal of a cunning divorce lawyer in Marriage Story.  Will win: Laura Dern. Should win: Laura Dern. Shoulda been a contender: Julia Butters (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). What on earth happened to Gerwig for Little Women? Or indeed Alma Har’el for Shia LaBeouf drama Honey Boy? At any rate, there are some heavy-hitters here: Mendes has a well-deserved nod for his superlative 1917, as do Scorsese and Tarantino. Perhaps the most notable nominee is the Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho for his fascinating social satire Parasite; fast becoming the talking point of the 2020 awards season. Will win: Martin Scorsese. Should win: Martin Scorsese. Shoulda been a contender: Greta Gerwig."
"Just when you thought Bong Joon-ho – the affable maestro of Korean cinema and now, with his class-conscious Cannes winner Parasite, champion of the people – could not get any more lovable, they let him on Jimmy Fallon. Foreign-language arthouse directors rarely, if ever, make it on to US talkshows; this was apparently the first ever Tonight Show interview conducted through an interpreter. With the director cheekily refusing to play ball at points, including breaking down what the film was actually about (“This is a talkshow – you have to say something!” Fallon chided him), the limelight improbably fell on the woman next to him: Sharon Choi. And Choi scored big. “Bong Joon ho’s translator will u marry me,” trilled one Twitter user. Maybe it was her all-black ensemble and cute Harry Potter specs, or maybe it was the flawless simultaneous translation they found so hot. “So eloquent … so swift … my inspiration,” cooed another. More plaudits: “The MVP [most valuable person] of awards season.” And then the ultimate endorsement: “In every recent Bong Joon-ho Q&A and interview on YouTube, his translator gets praised over and over in the comments. There’s a lot saying she’s one of the best in the world. Major props.” Choi – a 25-year-old Korean-American, also a film-maker, currently living in Seoul – has only been working with Bong since May, when her skills made her an indispensable part of his team at Cannes. But her scene-stealing has shone a light on interpreting, an overlooked aspect of film’s promotional circuit, especially on the arthouse side. It is a high-grade post, combining two-way linguistic expertise, formidable memory skills (good for keeping hold of rambling directorial musings) and a head for PR. Ever-present, as Choi has been as Parasite does the rounds, interpreters sometimes become a mouthpiece for certain directors. The fresh-faced young man that Takeshi Kitano had on hand during junkets in the early 00s was very conspicuous amid the retinue of yakuza-like goons who would hang around the director during his interviews. Chief responsibility is conveying the precise nuances of what a director wants to communicate about their precious latest work. In that respect, there is surely no more intimidating a client than Michael Haneke. King’s College academic Martin Brady has been his go-to man for years. He has obviously cornered the market in Austrian miserabilists; he works for Ulrich Seidl, too. Not only does Brady manage sparkling English-language renderings of Haneke’s icy existential pensée, but reportedly he also delivers his translations in a light Austrian accent. The director-interpreter relationship sometimes approaches symbiosis (possibly lulled into this state by the monotonous questioning on press tours). The Oldboy director Park Chan-wook’s interpreter, Jeong Won-jo, has been known to finish in English before Park has in Korean. The pair have an unusually tight partnership, with Jeong – who lived in New Zealand from the age of 12 – functioning as co-producer on Park’s English-language film Stoker and also The Handmaiden. The two jobs are not so far apart, he stresses: “They are both about conveying ideas and building bridges. [They are] to make sure the communication between Park and everyone else was everything it should be: timely and clear.” Perhaps the gleaming C3PO of cinema interpreters is the Iranian-born, French-based Massoumeh Lahidji, who spent 12 years as a Cannes in-house translator. A self-described “smuggler, or a midwife, helping things to happen”, she works in Farsi, English, French and Spanish – translating for the likes of Pedro Almodóvar, Asghar Farhadi, Martin Scorsese and Werner Herzog. At an Alfonso Cuarón masterclass at last year’s Lumière in Lyon, the festival director Thierry Frémaux gave her a billing almost on a par with the director himself. Lahidji, who came to Paris in 1982 after escaping revolutionary Iran through the Kurdistan mountains, fell into translation after a chance meeting with Abbas Kiarostami at her first Cannes festival. She accompanied him at festivals for the next nine years, subtitled his films and translated the script for 2010’s Certified Copy. She is especially renowned for conducting live translations without taking notes. “A notebook would only get in the way,” she told Le Monde this year. “I prefer to watch a face, the energy a person gives off. I’m custodian of it for a brief instant, then I give it back to the public.” She calls it the “art of the ephemeral”, but interpreting is also political: helping to level the playing field in cinema. “In a jury, when you have a male American film director, he speaks English and of course he feels much more in power than an actress who’s not comfortable speaking English,” she told AP. Translation is an act of democratisation in a milieu increasingly dominated by English – and it is the reason Bong got to go on Fallon in the first place, something not lost on Sharon Choi’s Twitter stans."
"Only in a Woody Allen film will you hear quite as much Dixieland jazz as this. Here is We Are from Jazz, or We Are Jazzmen, the zany jazz comedy musical from Russian director Karen Shakhnazarov, originally released in 1983, but now revived as part of the Melodia! festival of Russian musicals at London’s BFI Southbank and Ciné Lumière. Shakhnazarov is now a rather establishment figure in Putin’s Russia as director general of the official Mosfilm studios and supporter of the party line, but his breakthrough film showed him to be a sprightly, subversive, comic talent – a tweaker of authority’s nose. His story imagines the birth of jazz in the Soviet Union, and it has the spirit of Hollywood movies such as George Roy Hill’s The Sting or even Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot. Igor Skylar is Kostya, a brilliant young jazz pianist expelled from the music academy because jazz is emblematic of decadent American capitalism. Kostya tries valiantly to argue for the progressive, revolutionary credentials of jazz – the music of the African-American people, fighting against their white oppressor. But it is no good. So Kostya wanders the streets, recruiting street musicians for his band, and finds Stepan (Aleksandr Pankratov-Chyorny), Zhora (Nikolai Averyushkin), and Ivan (Pyotr Shcherbakov). Another kind of jazz musical might have concentrated on the picaresque adventures of our heroes, perhaps particularly their adventures in love; and it’s true that a beautiful singer called Katya (Yelena Tsyplakova) tries to tempt Kostya away from his pals to form a band with her. But this is more of an absurdist, bizarre, even existential jazz musical. The guys (they’re never that fussed about deciding on a name) keep worrying about jazz. What is jazz? What are they doing playing it? When will people understand and like jazz?  With a sickeningly ironic inevitability, the Soviet authorities, having disliked jazz, are forming committees in which they will decide what kind of jazz is sufficiently pure. And there are uproarious, dreamlike scenes in which they get to play lavish concerts on expensive sets: one including a giant rotating LP disc. Kostya himself sounds like a mature Oscar Peterson. A very entertaining fantasy comedy."
"“It’s happening again! It’s NEVER going to end!” That’s a cop, locked up in a secure psychiatric facility after shooting half his face off, ranting about the curse that drove him insane. His words may also be a healthy response to news that Sam Raimi has rebooted The Grudge haunted-house franchise. (Brief history: Takashi Shimizu directed the decent original and a sequel in Japan and made two out of three of the subpar Hollywood follow-ons.) Raimi produces here while directing duties pass to 30-year-old American Nicolas Pesce, who has come up with this franchise oddity: a mainstream horror movie with arthouse sensibilities, a potentially interesting streak of bleak realism and naturalistic performances – but zero scares. Forget about chilling to the bone, The Grudge barely drops below room temperature. Pesce does solid work piecing together several story strands within a fragmented time structure. Andrea Riseborough gives a grounded naturalistic performance as Detective Muldoon, a cop grieving her husband’s death, which deserves a better film. Muldoon’s investigation into the death of a woman in some woods leads her to a string of gruesomely senseless murders, all connected to one suburban house. The owner, Fiona Landers (Tara Westwood), has recently returned from Tokyo and seems to have transported the curse from the earlier movies in her hand luggage. Bad news for Fiona and anyone who sets foot in her house: they’re all lumbered with the murderous wrath of the demon with the long black hair and croaky death rattle (Junko Bailey). There are scenes here that should be scary but fall flat. A woman chews at the bloodied stumps of her own fingers. Nope. Maggots crawl into the nasal cavities of a decaying corpse. Nothing. The Grudge never gets going. And while Pesce doesn’t go overboard plundering the original films, the scares that he does resurrect – what’s that lurking under the surface of the scummy bath water? – are so well-parodied by now that they’re not creepy any more. Is there a ravenous fanbase demanding more of this? The Grudge may well be back for two or three more films, but I can’t help praying it stays dead and buried. "
"This contemporary adaptation of The Turn of the Screw takes the ornate enigma of Henry James’s gothic novella and whittles it down into something rather more flat and conventional. This version, directed by Floria Sigismondi (who showed promise with her music biopic debut, The Runaways), is a fairly basic haunted house horror flick, complete with jump scares, possessed mirrors and a score that sounds as if somebody pushed a children’s choir into a well. A false ending and a clumsily grafted alternative version is all that acknowledges the psychological ambiguity of the source material, and of previous film adaptations, notably Jack Clayton’s The Innocents in 1961. Mackenzie Davis stars as Kate, the primary school teacher turned live-in governess for an orphaned eight-year-old and her older brother. She arrives at a gloomy manor house that has been production-designed into a state of nervous exhaustion – life-size mannequins gaze at her in glassy disapproval; cobwebby net curtains wrap themselves round her face whenever she so much as glances at a window. And then there are the children. In fact, the two children are the film’s main asset, both existing in the uncertain hinterland between innocence and evil. As the precocious but overprotected Flora, Brooklynn Prince (The Florida Project) flits between mercurial mischief and malice; her older brother, Miles (Stranger Things’ Finn Wolfhard), exudes the charm and careless cruelty of extreme privilege. The children, sniffs the cadaverous housekeeper, are thoroughbreds. Her inference is that Kate is simply not in the same league. It’s a fair assessment. Davis has the look of someone who has been chucked into the deep end of an ornamental koi pond. And there’s very little in the curiously inert screenplay, by Carey and Chad Hayes, to which she can cling."
"Since 2016, live streaming – individuals filming and broadcasting themselves in real time – has become a major phenomenon in China, an industry and for, some individuals, a means to connect with the world. Zhu Shengze’s fascinating, troubling but overlong documentary is assembled from more than 800 hours of footage gathered from the output of 12 “anchors” over a period of 10 months. Her interest is not in the superstars of the medium but rather with those on the periphery of society who have found both a community online and a means to monetise their difference. But for all the positives suggested by this angle, there are constant reminders about the toxicity of the live-streaming environment. One of the anchors, a 30-year-old man who never reached sexual maturity and has the appearance of a child, is bombarded with questions about his genitals; another, a severely scarred burns victim, is admonished by a commentator:“You’re ugly.” Like Dave Eggers’s novel The Circle, the film prompts uncomfortable questions about the future of privacy as a right."
"This insipid confection about a 17-year-old A-level student who passes herself off as older in order to manage a band she admires is so blandly wholesome and inoffensive, given the music-scene milieu, you can only assume it’s intended for the pre-teen market. Perhaps it’s meant to access the little sisters and brothers of the demographic that will go for How to Build a Girl, a considerably naughtier, wittier music-themed coming-of-age flick adapted from Caitlin Moran’s semi-autobiographical novel that comes out next week. The comparison is perhaps unfair because this film is about as accurate a reflection of how people break into the music business as In the Night Garden is about temperate-zone forest habitats. Kat Malone (Ella Hunt) is a spoiled posh kid who lives with her career-minded mother (Katherine Kelly) and yoga-mad hippie gran (Joanna David). She attends a private school where she is constantly dodging the teachers’ attempts to confiscate her mobile. She scams her way into a gig with BFF Jane (Jennifer Leong) and talks floppy-haired bassist Alex (Dougie Poynter of McFly) into letting her manage their power-chord beat combo, an outfit with the atrocious name of Dollar Day. At first she has some success, particularly when she manages to replace the suddenly departed drummer with a talented busker (Idris Debrand) who she spots in the street. But everything goes Pete Tong once they start a mini tour of the Cotswolds. The band’s performances are on a par with afternoon soap operas like Hollyoaks, while the music (credited to Some Velvet Morning) sounds too much like the sort of middling pop pap my generation used to listen to instead of the hip stuff cool cats under 20 are grooving to these days."
"There’s an enjoyably inscrutable performance at the heart of this Brazilian fairytale for grownups. Clara (Isabél Zuaa), an unsmiling mystery women, arrives at the luxurious São Paulo apartment of pregnant Ana (Marjorie Estiano), to be interviewed for the position of nanny. But is that really the role on offer? And is Clara an entirely honest applicant? The first third of this two-hour-plus film keeps us wondering. It’s clear that something is off between the women, but impossible to determine where the balance of power lies. Is this a Rosemary’s Baby-style horror about satanic foetus worship? A Parasite-like study of the subversive intimacy between domestic servant and employer? Or some unholy combination of the two? Then, with all the sprightly mischief of one of Ana’s country-music workout videos, the plot dances off again, in an entirely different direction. To say any more would be to ruin the unpredictable pleasures of a genuinely surprising film, but everything Good Manners does – from lesbian sex scenes to furry animatronics – it does with elegance, humour and in shades of moonlit blue. Rui Poças’s painterly cinematography turns the tower blocks of a modern city into a kind of enchanted wood, complete with its own take on the big bad wolf from the storybooks. Clara proves as hard to ruffle as she is to read, a quality that is sorely tested by the film’s events. Some may appreciate a strand of body horror that relates specifically to the female body and motherhood. More squeamish viewers can be reassured that these grisly moments are rare and interspersed with musical numbers. Also contained within the story is a heartwarming and timely tribute to care workers, both unpaid and underpaid. This satisfyingly strange film really has it all."
"A young woman, haunted by her past, gazes thoughtfully out over a dark stretch of water. Suddenly, there is a ripple and someone in a frogman’s outfit emerges, splashes up to her, removes his mask and – oh, yikes, yikes and triple yikes – it’s only David Cronenberg, that’s all! The great film-maker’s wacky appearance in this movie, playing a conspiracist true-crime podcaster, sets a keynote of weirdo menace. Yet the guiding deity is probably David Lynch, with something of Atom Egoyan in the film’s dash of preposterous psycho-melodrama and the dark return of the repressed. Tuppence Middleton gives a sharp and engaging performance as Abby, who was traumatised by a sinister incident when she was seven years old, near the family home at Niagara Falls, on the Canadian side of the border. She witnessed a kidnapping, but as a child did not have the maturity to understand what she’d seen, nor the vocabulary to explain it. The burden of this unprocessed memory has left her traumatised in adult life and, when she returns to her hometown on the death of her mother, Abby begins to wonder if she can solve this coldest of cold cases – with Cronenberg’s help perhaps. It’s a pretty bizarre film, a thriller that appears partly to be composed of delusions and hallucinations, building to a shaggy-dog ending that wraps things up, though in a faintly exasperating way. Abby finds that the kidnapping may have something to do with a local Vegas-style magic act called The Magnificent Moulins (played by Marie-Josée Croze and Paulino Nunes) whose promotional videocassette she borrows from the library – the cue for some pleasingly retrograde, old-tech fetishism. Director and co-writer Albert Shin has come up with a diverting exercise in noir style."
"Reissues and revivals are not uncommon in cinema, but it is not often that a film has the chance of a total critical makeover. That seems to be what is under way for Welcome II the Terrordome, a micro-budget dystopian sci-fi which, in 1995, became the first feature directed by a black British woman in UK cinemas. “I call this my ‘angry film’,” says its director, Ngozi Onwurah, on the phone from Los Angeles, her gentle geordie accent unchanged by 12 years in the US. “Debates around race are meant to be measured and always have an entry point for white people; I’m not saying that’s wrong. I’m just saying I made it because I wasn’t in the mood for tempered debate.” The significance of Onwurah’s milestone was emphasised by the fact that, up until Amma Asante’s 2004 debut A Way of Life, she remained the only black British woman to have directed a full-length feature film. Welcome II the Terrordome doesn’t mess about: after an opening scene that depicts a version of the Igbo Landing story, in which a group of 19th-century Africans drown themselves rather than submit to slavery, the narrative then jumps forward in time to a nightmarish segregated Britain where a black family, played by the same actors, struggle for dignity and survival. Alongside Young Soul Rebels (1991) and Babymother (1998), Welcome II the Terrordome was one of only three British features from the decade that centred on black characters. Not that you would find much awareness of this context in media coverage from the time. The Daily Telegraph’s review called Welcome II the Terrordome “deplorable, both cinematically and in terms of its nihilistic view of the prospects for racial harmony”. Farrukh Dhondy, Channel 4’s then-multi-cultural commissioning editor, described it as “simply exploitative”. Perhaps most dismissive, though, was the Empire magazine review, which referred to Onwurah as a “he” throughout and chastised “him” for misreading the mood of race relations “in the more peaceable 90s” with a “would-be commercial movie”. Earlier this month, Empire took the review offline, stating that “its content absolutely does not align with our values”. The film itself, meanwhile, is available to watch on BFI Player as part of We Are Parable’s Black British film season, and a Criterion re-release is in the works. So is Welcome II the Terrordome in the process of a reappraisal? Dr Clive James Nwonka is a fellow in film studies at London School of Economics, the author of the forthcoming The Aesthetics of British Urban Cinema and the person who brought that 1995 review to Empire’s attention. He has doubts: “How is it possible to review a film with a clear pair of eyes, without thinking about the current moment?” Certainly a lot has changed since 1995. There is (slightly) more diversity within British film criticism, and movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have, at least in theory, made everyone more aware of the intersecting oppressions faced by black women. Much of what seemed exaggerated or outrageous to critics 25 years ago – police brutality, the link between slavery and systemic racism – simply does not shock in the same way today. “Actually, the anger I’ve started to feel in the last couple of months wasn’t dissimilar to the sort of anger I felt then,” says Onwurah. “My idea with Terrordome was to put all the things that were happening together in one night, to show what it would feel like if one thing happened straight after another and there wasn’t any calming down in between.” Now that social media provides us all with relentless images of black suffering and a comparably condensed timeline, that also seems prescient. Terrordome’s depiction of politicised fury cut against the grain of New Labour-era multiculturalism, to the extent that critics were mostly unable to fully engage, says Nwonka. “I don’t think the film needs to be given a free pass in terms of ‘Is it a fantastic film?’ I don’t think it is. But the film had a particular intention that I think would be much more acceptable now.” It was a film out of sync in other ways, too. Four Weddings and a Funeral had just been a huge international hit, firing up the British film industry’s commercial ambitions. “It can’t be a commercial film in the same way, because it has a different kind of politics,” says Nwonka. “[It’s this] normative desire for how black films should operate in this new 90s where, apparently, race has been consigned to the past.” The film’s potentially negative impact on black British respectability was also a concern for a pre-eminent black academic, Paul Gilroy. Writing in Sight & Sound at the time, he feared “its incompetence will unleash the laughter of the world against black British cultural activists”. At least now the “special moral obligation” that Gilroy argued for black film-makers can be spread across more shoulders: Michaela Coel is the toast of 2020 and more new black film-making talent is coming through. “Now will they get the chance to make second, third and fourth feature films?” asks Nwonka. “In the way that other film-makers who are non-BME also do? Without the same scrutiny, the same struggles?” That did not happen for Onwurah, although she did continue to make shorts and was about to go into production on a feature when the pandemic hit. Still, is there not a neat kind of poetic justice in her first feature, a time-travelling sci-fi, getting its own reincarnation? “Yeah, that is cool,” she says. “But it was the right reception at the time, because otherwise it wouldn’t have been doing what it was meant to do. People weren’t ‘there’ then.”"
"Amber Heard feared she would be killed by Johnny Depp, who was violent and abusive when high on drink or drugs, a London court has been told. Opening the defence case in the libel trial initiated by the Pirates of the Caribbean star, Heard said her ex-husband threatened to disfigure her face and on one occasion told her: “I’m going to have to watch you get raped.” Depp, 57, is suing the Sun’s publisher, News Group Newspapers, and its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an article that called him a “wife beater” and referred to “overwhelming evidence” that he had attacked Heard. Depp denies ever hitting Heard, 34, who has submitted details of 14 occasions during their relationship when she claims he assaulted her. Heard entered the witness box on Monday to begin what is expected to be three days of testimony. In her statement in the case, released at the same time, Heard said Depp would blame all his abusive actions on a “self-created third person, which he often called ‘the monster’”. She said some incidents were so severe “that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far. He explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship.” The violence included “punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking me, as well as throwing me into things, pulling me by my hair and shoving me or pushing me to the ground.” The physical assaults and the worst of the verbal abuse “would usually happen when he was drunk or high on drugs”, she alleged. Often he did not remember “once he had slept it off”. She added: “He had a violent and dark way of speaking: the way he talked about our relationship being ‘dead or alive’ and telling me that death was the only way out of the relationship; the way he would describe what he wanted to do to me if I left him or hurt him (for example, carving my face up so no one else would want me). “His language towards others who he didn’t like or was threatened by (detailing how he wanted to have someone tortured or how cheap and easy it would be to have someone knocked off) [was violent]. He could be very intense and dark.” Heard said Depp made “all kinds of demeaning and derogatory comments about actresses (‘two-bit whores’) and about me wanting to work as an actress. “He demeaned me anytime I tried to wear anything that could be seen as sexy, calling me a ‘whore’, ‘slut’, ‘fame-hungry’ and ‘an attention whore’, but it got worse over time. “He started saying things like ‘Well I’m going to have to watch you get raped’ and ‘I hope you get railed by a bunch of fucking fellas’. Sometimes he used racial epithets about the men I would be – or deserved to be – assaulted by.” In cross-examination, Heard denied having ever taken cocaine while she was with Depp but agreed she had taken MDMA and mushrooms a “handful” of times. Her statement said: “Johnny attacked me a lot of times, on many different occasions.” Asked by Eleanor Laws QC, representing Depp, about whether she had a problem with controlling her temper, Heard said: “I did have outbursts of anger at times. Yes, I lost my cool with Johnny in our fights.” She added: “I was nervous about being away from home when I was working because that always caused fights. Johnny was insecure and jealous, he was extremely insecure about me working away from home.” Heard admitted to becoming “extremely distressed” after her iCloud account was hacked and someone “stole naked photos of me and manipulated them”, releasing hundreds of images on to the internet. “They went everywhere and at home Johnny blamed me,” she said. Heard said Depp’s employees had not seen how their arguments developed. “These things happened behind closed doors … I never got violent. Many years into the relationship I did try and defend myself when it got serious and I thought my life was threatened.” Asked by Mr Justice Nicol whether she “threw pots and pans at Mr Depp”, Heard said: “Only to escape him.” Heard recalled the night when she and Depp finally broke up in May 2016, describing the “tons of damage” he inflicted on their LA penthouse. She maintained he had broken glasses, smashed sconces and punched paintings. Asked whether her account was a lie because other witnesses did not record the same damage, Heard denied embellishing her descriptions. Laws put it to Heard that she had made up her face so that it looked like she had been injured. “No, I have never done that,” Heard replied. She said she had used makeup after that incident. “I had to cover up my bruises to not look injured. It’s horribly embarrassing. You are constantly asked to comment.” Heard and Depp started going out in 2011 after meeting on the film set of The Rum Diary. They married in 2015. The hearing continues."
"Christopher Nolan’s new film Tenet, hailed for weeks as a key release to revive cinemagoing after the coronavirus shutdown, has been delayed yet again due to uncertainty over cinemas reopening in the US. Deadline reports that Tenet’s backers Warner Bros have taken the film off their release calendar, with no confirmed date, though studio chair Toby Emmerich says a date will be announced “imminently”. Tenet, a big budget science fiction thriller starring John David Washington, has already been shifted several times: originally due to open on 17 July in the US, it was moved to 31 July and then 12 August. Nolan has long been a champion of the cinema experience, and is understood to be keen to ensure Tenet does not break the release window by going to streaming or video on demand. He was also recently reported to have turned down a proposal that Tenet be released outside the US first, in territories where cinemas have already reopened, in order to support US cinemas. However, Emmerich’s statement implied that the position on an earlier international release may be changing; he said in his statement that “[Warner Bros is] not treating Tenet like a traditional global day-and-date release, and our upcoming marketing and distribution plans will reflect that”. Tenet’s $200m-plus budget would normally call for a swift global rollout in every territory, combining event-scale marketing and an attempt to restrict piracy. The change in direction follows increasing complaints by non-US distributors and cinema operators that their industries will be crippled by Hollywood’s focus on North American cinemas as reopening plans in the US have been upended by the chaotic response to the pandemic. An unnamed UK executive told Variety that, given that Hollywood blockbusters can earn up to 70% of their takings outside the US, “it feels like that’s been forgotten”. Tim Richards, CEO of multiplex chain Vue International, said: “We can’t thrive again as an industry without a concerted effort on the major releases.” Jocelyn Bouyssy, managing director of CGR Cinemas, France’s second biggest multiplex chain, said: “It will be a catastrophe if Mulan and Tenet are further delayed … We don’t know how long we can hold up like this.”"
"It sounds like a sci-fi movie, or the weirdest series of Big Brother ever. Eight volunteers wearing snazzy red jumpsuits seal themselves into a hi-tech glasshouse that’s meant to perfectly replicate Earth’s ecosystems. They end up starving, gasping for air and at each other’s throats – while the world’s media looks on. But the Biosphere 2 experiment really did happen. Running from 1991 to 1993, it is remembered as a failure, if it is remembered at all – a hubristic, pseudo-scientific experiment that was never going to accomplish its mission. However, as the new documentary Spaceship Earth shows, the escapade is a cautionary tale, now that the outside world – Biosphere 1, if you prefer – is itself coming to resemble an apocalyptic sci-fi world. Looking back, it’s amazing that Biosphere 2 even happened at all, not least because the people behind it started out as a hippy theatre group. “Just the fact that the same number of people came out as went in is a triumph,” says Mark Nelson, one of the original eight “biospherians”. Far from a failure, he regards Biosphere 2 as an unsung achievement in human exploration, as do many others. “I like to say we built it not because we had the answers. We built it to find out what we didn’t know.” Biosphere 2’s origins lie in late-1960s San Francisco, and a man named John P Allen. Already in his 40s by then, Allen was something of a renaissance man: a Harvard graduate, a metallurgist, a union organiser, a beat poet, and a traveller studying indigenous cultures. He founded an idealistic performance group called the Theatre of All Possibilities. As the name suggests, they wanted to change the world but weren’t sure where to start. Art? Business? Ecology? Technology? In classic counterculture fashion, they decided: “Let’s do all of it!” They didn’t actually know how to do any of it, save for staging somewhat freeform performances, but “learn by doing” was Allen’s philosophy – and it took them surprisingly far. In 1969, Allen’s troupe relocated to New Mexico and founded Synergia Ranch, named after the great architect Richard Buckminster Fuller’s concept of synergy, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. “He was a ball of energy,” says Nelson, who joined Allen’s troupe around that time, when he was 22. “He had a great feel for both ecology and theatre. And frankly, he was a very charismatic guy. We’d accomplish one thing, then say, ‘What’s the new challenge?’ He was forever upping the ante.” They turned their desert ranch into a self-sufficient homestead, planting trees and raising buildings, including a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome. They founded an art gallery in London (it is still running) and bought another ranch in Australia. In 1975, they even decided to build a ship. Their chief designer was a 19-year-old student with no experience of boatbuilding, but it proved perfectly seaworthy. They sailed around the world for several years, researching the Earth’s ecosystems. Having learned how these worked, they were ready to build their own. If humankind was going to settle other planets, they reasoned, it would need to learn how to replicate Earth. For a generation that came of age with the moon landings and such films as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Silent Running, this was not a particularly far-fetched notion. Helpfully, Allen and co had a benefactor: Ed Bass, an oil billionaire from Texas, whose own journey of self-discovery had brought him into Allen’s orbit. The Biosphere 2 launch was staged like a space mission. The media descended on the $150m Arizona facility, all gleaming white panels and ziggurats of glass, filled with forests, deserts, laboratories, recycling systems, pigs, chickens, hummingbirds, bush babies, and even a coral reef. There were speeches and fireworks as the jumpsuited volunteers (four women, four men, all white) sealed themselves in for the two-year journey into the unknown. After a stable start, problems began to emerge. Food, for one. “We really could have used more calories,” says Linda Leigh, another biospherian. Leigh had been involved with stocking Biosphere 2 with wild plants, but many of the food crops were too slow or too labour-intensive to be worthwhile. The wild coffee bushes took a fortnight to produce enough for one cup. Rather than luxuriating in a Garden of Eden, the biospherians became more like subsistence farmers. There was a lot of beetroot and sweet potato. “It was a challenge to make exciting meals,” says Leigh. “We’d rotate the cooking duties. Some people created new things like a taco-shaped like a dinosaur. Some people made horrible things like cold potato leaf soup.” Everyone lost a lot of weight. On top of that, oxygen levels decreased faster than anticipated, with a corresponding build-up of carbon dioxide. Earth’s atmosphere is about 21% oxygen, but inside the biosphere it fell to 14.2 %. “It felt like mountain-climbing,” Nelson recalls. “Some of the crew started getting sleep apnoea. I noticed I couldn’t finish a long sentence without stopping and taking a breath of air. We worked in a kind of slow-motion dance, with no energy wasted. If the oxygen levels had dropped any lower, there could have been serious health issues.” Understandably, morale deteriorated. Living under biosphere conditions was a challenge at the best of times. If the coronavirus lockdown feels restrictive, imagine spending two years with the same seven people and no internet. Nelson likens it to “a marathon group therapy session”. Added to which, true to their theatrical origins, the biospherians were on permanent display. Coachloads of tourists and schoolchildren arrived daily to tap on the glass and take pictures of the emaciated crew. Leigh remembers anthropologist Jane Goodall coming to visit. “She observed us like we were captive primates.” Cups were thrown and people were spat at, but thankfully there was no violence. “It was more of a coldness,” says Leigh. “Of not wanting to be around each other.” The team split into two camps of four: “Our group was all for bringing in extra food and more oxygen just to keep things going, so our own suffering didn’t impact the work that needed to be done. The other group had other ideas.” In other words, keep the biosphere closed and retain the purity of the experiment, no matter the cost. A similar debate was going on outside. Biosphere 2’s difficulties had not gone unnoticed, though Allen and the team had tried to conceal them. Eventually extra food was smuggled in and two oxygen pop-ups followed. The biospherians were overjoyed. “People starting laughing like crazy and running around,” recalls Nelson. “I felt like I’d been 90 years old and now I was a teenager again. I realised I hadn’t seen anybody running for months.” But on the outside, as debate raged in the media, the project started to be dismissed as non-science, or as one commentator put it, “trendy ecological entertainment”. Nelson certainly doesn’t see it that way. “Somehow or other, it all got truncated into: ‘This is a survival test for this colony, and the one and only measure of success is whether everything works perfectly, and there’s no necessity to bring in anything from the outside.’ That was never the intention.” The intention, in fact, was to continue the experiment, learning from their mistakes. A second mission went into the biosphere in March 1994, and looked to be faring better. A month later, though, out of the blue, Ed Bass decided on a mass purge. The purpose was to make the project more businesslike, it seems. Allen and his team were swiftly ejected and a new CEO was literally helicoptered in: Steve Bannon. Yes, that Steve Bannon. Investment banker, future right-wing operator and Donald Trump strategist. As a metaphor for the fate of the planet, it could hardly be more apt. “I look at it as a story about human ambition, its possibilities and limitations,” says Matt Wolf, director of Spaceship Earth. “I think the experiment revealed that humans are the most unstable element of a closed system.” Like many, Wolf was only dimly aware of the project before he started looking into it. Many of the original biospherians still live together on Synergia Ranch, he discovered, including Nelson and Allen, now in his 90s. Fortunately, they recorded everything: Wolf had access to over 600 hours of 16mm film and video. Biosphere 2 is now managed by the University of Arizona. Linda Leigh runs a community garden project in Oracle, a few miles away. Both Nelson and Leigh would happily volunteer to go back in. Both were transformed by the experience, in a way they wish society as a whole could emulate. “Inside Biosphere 2, everything made sense,” says Nelson. “Everything you did, you could see the impact of it. No anonymous actions. It was like my body suddenly got the message: every time you breathe, these plants are waiting for your CO2. They are your third lung. I thought, ‘My God, this is keeping me alive! I am absolutely metabolically connected to the life here.’” Even if history does judge Biosphere 2 a failure, is that really so bad? “The media can be very dismissive of people trying new things,” says Wolf. “So much so that people hesitate to try for fear of criticism or failure. If everybody feared failure, they would never try new and ambitious things.”"
"It took almost two decades for people outside Europe to be treated to a four-hour edit of Sergio Leone’s final masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in America, by which time Leone had long since departed this mortal coil. Blade Runner managed 25 years before the 2007 Final Cut restored Ridley Scott’s dystopia to its full glory. Few would argue that either movie deserved a second, or even third look in the edit bay. Leone’s sprawling tale of Depression-era New York mobsters was gutted for the North American market and the action became chronological, against the director’s wishes. Few Blade Runner fans would suggest that the original theatrical cut has any value other than as a warning against injudicious studio interference. And then there’s Justice League in 2017, which is also – at great expense – being restored to its original form for the launch of forthcoming streaming platform HBO Max. But it doesn’t appear, at first glance, to fit into the same category as some of its illustrious forebears. It is reportedly costing at least $30m to make, largely because there is not an existing version overseen by its original director, Zack Snyder, who left the project in May 2017 before it was completed following the death of his daughter. A lot of work must be done from scratch. (Fans have long rallied on social media using the hashtag #ReleasetheSnyderCut.) Joss Whedon oversaw the completion of the film, which apparently departed hugely from the original plan. Despite lightening the tone with wisecracking superhero banter along the lines of Whedon’s work on Marvel’s Avengers movies, critics and audiences were unimpressed with the result. DC had hoped to deliver an ensemble movie that would allow characters such as Ray Fisher’s Cyborg, the Flash and Aquaman, as well as Ben Affleck’s version of Batman, to then spin off into their own standalone movies. In the end, Affleck departed the role – his interest reportedly sapped by the troubled shoot – and nothing has been heard of since about a Cyborg movie. (Though Aquaman did arrive in 2018, and a Flash flick has again been recently touted.) Now it appears that critics were not the only ones disappointed with Whedon’s work. Fisher has been quietly flagging his disapproval during Hollywood’s Covid-19 hiatus, and last week shifted into what appears to be full-on attack mode. “Joss Whedon’s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable,” he tweeted. While it’s not entirely clear what Fisher is referring to, the Twittersphere has been rife with rumours. The film-maker and podcaster Kevin Smith has alleged that Whedon “trash-talked” Snyder’s work on Justice League after taking over on set. There have been suggestions that Snyder had planned to centre his version on Cyborg. In the theatrical release of Justice League, the part-human, part-machine superhero is very much a supporting character. This might explain some of Fisher’s antipathy towards the Whedon cut. However, it’s hard to know if this is the full story behind the young actor’s fury. This week, Fisher said he was unable to offer specific details about Whedon’s alleged on-set behaviour, for fear he could be “sued into oblivion” due to a nondisclosure agreement.  Over on Twitter, it appears to be open season on Whedon. Of course, none of this means that Snyder’s forthcoming cut of Justice League is somehow destined to be a masterpiece, as some fans believe. It might be darker, it might feature more screen time for Fisher and restore characters such as Darkseid and the Martian Manhunter to the screen, but whether it will turn out to be any better than the Whedon cut is hardly a given. We should probably remember that, at the time of his departure from the film, Snyder had only recently delivered one of the most risible superhero movies of all time in the cluttered, contrived and knuckle-headed form of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). There is an extended, alternate cut of that movie, too, released for home media formats a few months after the original film hit cinemas, and it is just as ill-conceived and poorly realised as the original theatrical cut … only longer."
"Julia Sawalha has said she has been “plucked, stuffed and roasted” after being told that she would not be cast in the forthcoming sequel to the hit Aardman Animation film Chicken Run as her voice sounded “too old”. In the original film, released in 2000, Sawalha voiced the lead role of Ginger, the plucky hen who inspires her fellow egg-layers to escape from a farm when they are threatened with being turned into pies. News of the development of a sequel first emerged in 2018, and Netflix’s involvement was announced in June. It is due to be directed by Sam Fell (ParaNorman) and start production in 2021. Sawalha posted a statement on social media saying she was told a week ago that she was not wanted for the sequel. “The reason they gave is that my voice now sounds ‘too old’ and they want a younger actress to reprise the role.” She added: “Usually in these circumstances, an actress would be given the chance to do a voice test in order to determine the suitability of their pitch and tone, I however was not given this opportunity. I am passionate about my work and I don’t go down without a fight, so I did my own voice test at home and sent it to the producers … However, they stated, ‘We will be going ahead to recast the voice of Ginger.’” Sawalha’s protest follows reports that Mel Gibson, who voiced the character of daredevil rooster Rocky, would not be involved in the sequel. While Rocky is named as a character in the official plot synopsis for Chicken Run 2, the role is due to be recast. Variety magazine reported that Gibson was told that as “the sequel will revolve around younger chickens, therefore casting younger voice actors” was necessary. The report also claimed that Gibson’s history of controversial behaviour, including an accusation of antisemitic comments by actor Winona Ryder, which Gibson denies, played no part in the recasting. Sawalha added: “I feel I have been fobbed off with the same excuse … To say I am devastated and furious would be an understatement. I feel totally powerless.” No official announcements have been made for the Chicken Run 2 cast, but original film cast members Jane Horrocks and Lynn Ferguson have been added to the film’s IMDb page. Aardman has been contacted for a response."
"‘If you make films that don’t fit into a particular slot, distributors and publicity people just don’t know what to do with them,” muses Mike Hodges from his Dorset farm. It’s the story of his career. Hodges, who turns 88 this month, made two of the best-known British movies ever: definitive gangster thriller Get Carter and sci-fi romp Flash Gordon. But many of his other films, through no fault of his own, barely saw the light of day. His 1974 sci-fi thriller The Terminal Man never got a UK release; he was fired from Damien: Omen II; Mickey Rourke IRA thriller A Prayer for the Dying was re-edited behind his back. And then there’s supernatural thriller Black Rainbow, that Hodges wrote and directed in 1989. It is one of his best films, but its distributors fell into financial difficulties, so it never got a full cinema release. “By the time I made Black Rainbow I’d got kind of used to it,” Hodges laughs. “I was pretty angry of course, but there we go. One of those things.” Black Rainbow, which has just been restored and released on Blu-Ray, brings some overriding themes of Hodges’ career into focus. Its central figure is a medium named Martha (Rosanna Arquette) who tours the American Bible belt with her alcoholic father (Jason Robards), offering her audiences a sunny preview of the afterlife and supposedly communing with their dead relatives. One night, she contacts a man on “the other side” whom his wife insists is still alive. Not for much longer, it turns out. The man is murdered in exactly the way Martha predicted. The killing is connected to a scandal at the local chemical plant, to which Martha is now a witness. The plot deftly ties together many strands: worker exploitation, corporate and governmental corruption, environmental destruction, religious fundamentalism. For a story about prophecy, it is uncannily prophetic. “When I wrote it more than 30 years ago, it seemed to me society was in a very dodgy situation,” says Hodges. “We were building an edifice that was very vulnerable, and people weren’t paying attention.” In the US especially, Black Rainbow’s warnings seem to have come to pass. “The worst aspect of America has been the way Christianity and capitalism are now hand in hand. The reason they’ve got Trump as president is because of the fundamentalist religious people backing him, irrespective of the fact that he’s a totally immoral man. He’s managed to get a cohort of people around him who really are dangerous.” Hodges was raised a Catholic, but lost his faith at a young age, he says. He claims his boarding school in Bath, run by the Irish Christian Brothers, was a place of corporal punishment and sexual abuse. “I was tampered with, but not in any really serious way,” he says. When his parents discovered what was going on, the school investigated. “But they came back and said, ‘No, this is untrue. This is a childish fantasy.’ And our parents sent us back. It was horrendous.” After school, he spent two eye-opening years doing national service on the lower deck of a navy minesweeper, visiting “every disgusting fishing port in the UK”. “My parents were conservatives, but what I experienced on the lower deck changed all that for ever. I’d lost my Catholicism and then I lost my conservatism.” Starting at the bottom of television, he graduated to current affairs series World in Action before moving into fiction and cinema. In retrospect, a similar set of preoccupations runs through many of Hodges’ films: religious zealotry, loneliness, corruption, corporate greed and a certain fatalistic view of progress, especially the American variety. Hodges even suggests Flash Gordon as a stand-in for American foreign policy: a dim-bulb jock stumbling into cultures he doesn’t understand. Compared to Hodges’ usual bad experiences, Flash Gordon was a breeze. Drafted in by Italian mogul Dino De Laurentiis as a replacement for departing director Nicolas Roeg, Hodges essentially made it up as he went along. “I had no idea what I was going to do when I took over,” he laughs. “I think that’s part of the success of the film. It’s like a souffle. We managed to put all the right ingredients in and it sort of rose, in some mysterious way.” In many respects Flash Gordon, which marks its 40th anniversary this year, was a forerunner of the modern superhero genre. “Except it was a comedy,” Hodges qualifies. “The story was ludicrous! Watching the rushes every day, you could hardly keep a straight face.” De Laurentiis never saw the joke, Hodges says. He had to tell the crew to stifle their laughter when he was in the room. Hodges doesn’t watch modern superhero movies, though. “I never liked them to be honest with you. They’re quite dark, I think, aren’t they?” One stroke of good fortune in Hodges’ career came with 1998’s Croupier – a taut, typically fatalistic gambling thriller led by Clive Owen. On its UK release it made little impression and Hodges wondered if he’d ever work again. But surprisingly it became a cult hit in the US, which led to a rerelease in Britain and eventual success. Hodges describes it as one of the happiest memories of his career. He has no intention of returning to film-making, he says. He is quite happy in his vegetable patch and writing noir fiction. But now that most of his output is available (The Terminal Man is due for a Blu-Ray reissue next year), perhaps it is not too late for a career reappraisal. He deserves a slot of his own."
"Kelly Preston, who appeared in the hit films Jerry Maguire and Twins, has died, her husband, John Travolta, said. She was 57. Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years, who was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago, died on Sunday. “It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,” Travolta said. “She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.” The couple had three children together. Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television, at times appearing together in films with her husband, including in Battlefield Earth in 2000. Preston starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film For the Love of the Game, and in 2004 appeared in the music video for Maroon 5’s She Will Be Loved. She had frequent guest-starring roles on TV series including Medium, CSI: Cyber and Joey. Preston and Travolta were married at a midnight ceremony in Paris in 1991 when the couple were expecting their first son, Jett. They had two children, daughter Ella Bleu in 2000 and a son, Benjamin, in 2010. Jett died aged 16 in January 2009 after a seizure at the family’s holiday home in the Bahamas. The death led to a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25m from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son’s death. Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case. He cited the severe strain the case and his son’s death had caused the family. Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston’s first role back the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, The Last Song, which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth. Travolta and Preston met while filming The Experts in 1988.They last starred together in the 2018 film Gotti, with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss wife, Victoria. Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered, Travolta wrote on Instagram. He added: “I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.” Preston’s death was first reported by People magazine."
"‘If you can’t cope with the ants, don’t mess with the anthill.” So goes a slogan chanted by the activists occupying land belonging to a sugarcane processing plant in the north-eastern Brazilian town of Santa Helena – one branch of the Landless Workers Movement (MST) that has been battling for land access for smallholder farmers in the country since 1984. The cause is unimpeachable, and even more pressing with Jair Bolsonaro’s current backing for ruthless agribusiness whose giant footprint excludes almost everyone else. So it’s surprising that the effect of this advocatory and visually sharp documentary – director Camila Freitas’s feature-length debut – is somewhat deadening. Filmed over four years, it forgoes commentary, simply accompanying the peasant-activists as they daydream about how to allocate the terrain, debate their principles, and try to win hearts and minds in town. Structured around long dialogue scenes shot through with testimony of injustice and struggle, it finally exudes a strange passivity despite all the idealism being traded. No charismatic individual strong enough to carry the film emerges; the rounds of protest against the status quo, away from the fields, seem Sisyphean. Perhaps the conservative forces ranged against them are too great to expect such a breakthrough. But Freitas’s instinct is essentially passive, too, refusing to dramatise undercurrents and factions in the movement that might benefit from more historical explanation.  Even the film’s visual power feeds this feeling of futility. The ravishing shots that punctuate the conversations emphasise the unyielding system, as with one of listless judges staring into space in the courtroom. But otherwise they return to the landscape, the eternal need to till and tend, and the serene indifference of nature. Reflection, not revolution, seems the only viable option."
"Reviewing Eliza Hittman’s powerfully understated drama Never Rarely Sometimes Always in this paper recently, I noted that by approaching the urgent subject of reproductive rights through the prism of a coming-of-age story with road-movie inflections, Hittman’s film avoided ever seeming polemical. The same is true of this terrific (and very different) feature from writer and star Kelly O’Sullivan, a vibrant and emotionally engaging tale that dresses its subversive self-determination manifesto in the clothes of a ditzy, bittersweet comedy about midlife disappointment. Laughing and crying my way through Saint Frances (the deserving winner of several major festival audience awards), I was reminded of the outraged reactions that greeted Gillian Robespierre’s 2014 comedy Obvious Child, with one conservative critic carping: “If America laughs at this, America is beyond redemption.” Yet by refusing to accept the taboo status afforded to such everyday subjects as menstruation, birth control, abortion and postnatal depression, O’Sullivan brilliantly injects a radical element into this wryly tender portrait of an anxious single woman pinballing between jobs, relationships and uncertain life goals. We first meet O’Sullivan’s Bridget at a party, listening in bemused horror to a middle-aged man’s indulgent nightmares of failure, cut short by her own deadpan declaration that she’s a 34-year-old waitress – or, as she puts it, “a server”. After hooking up with the younger Jace (Max Lipchitz), Bridget finds herself facing an unwanted pregnancy at around the same time that fate conspires to offer her new employment, nannying for six-year-old Frances (Ramona Edith Williams, channelling the unmannered precocious energy of The Florida Project’s Brooklynn Kimberly Prince). Overwhelmed by the arrival of their new baby, well-to-do lesbian couple Maya (Charin Alvarez) and Annie (Lily Mojekwu) rope Bridget in for summer-season childcare, despite the fact that she’s clearly unprepared for parenting – surrogate or otherwise. Will her avowed child-phobia (“You must really like kids”; “I don’t”) prevent her from doing the job? And what will her employers, one of whom is devoutly religious, think of her own decision to have a termination? Directed with loose-limbed intimacy by O’Sullivan’s real-life partner Alex Thompson, Saint Frances (the title implies healing, but also nods towards a wonderfully playful confession scene) benefits from Nate Hurtsellers’s hand-held cinematography, capturing these characters with empathetic candour. Whether it’s the discovery of menstrual blood on bedsheets after a night of energetic love-making with Jace, or a long-lens exchange between Bridget and Frances on a suburban street, we get the sense of eavesdropping on genuine encounters, in all their raggedy richness. At times we’re left laughing heartily at life’s absurdities – a scene in which Bridget mock-scolds Frances by bumping her push-buggy, only for the child to cry out in delight (“Again!”), is a smile-raising treat. Elsewhere, there’s a beautifully sardonic edge to the comedy, typified by Jim True-Frost’s excruciating guitar-teacher-guru Isaac, who thinks his musical compositions are divinely inspired, and who views contraception as women’s work. What’s most impressive, however, is the degree to which the incidental details of this frank and feisty film ring true. Like Michaela Coel’s outstanding BBC TV series I May Destroy You, Saint Frances expands the representation of women’s lives on screen in a way that is so casual you hardly notice it’s happening. Indeed, when Bridget finally gets to say exactly what she thinks about the events that define this drama, her words (which amount to a mission statement) are framed within a throwaway comedic device that undercuts her honesty with a hilariously dry punchline. It’s just one instance of the delicate balancing act that this gently marvellous movie gets just right."
"There’s an abrasively realist candour to this Colombian portrait of a woman pushed to the brink by the incremental stresses of her daily life. Silvia (Carolina Sanín) is a single parent, a public-sector lawyer tainted by a brewing scandal, and the daughter of Leticia (Leticia Gómez), an explosively ill-tempered widow who responds to her cancer diagnosis with chain-smoking and vitriol. It’s this latter element that brings the film, directed by Franco Lolli, its arcing, unpredictable energy. The relationship between Silvia and Leticia is like a magnifying mirror, bouncing and building their matching antagonism. Both performances are superb, but Gómez, as the razor-tongued matriarch, is particularly bracing. Even as she sinks towards death, the sharp edge of her perennial displeasure cuts through her weakness. Meanwhile, Silvia’s son has inherited the family anger management issues, and Silvia listens with barely concealed irritation as his teachers voice their concerns about an incident involving a toy kitchen. More like snapshots from a family album than a neatly tied up journey, Litigante delivers emotional authenticity and a raw open wound of an ending."
"Who wants to live for ever? Not Charlize Theron, evidently. Playing immortal warrior Andy, leader of a covert band of unkillable mercenaries, Theron spends almost as much time battling many centuries worth of accumulated angst as she does slicing and dicing entire battalions of attackers. Armed with ennui and an ancient axe, Theron brings layers of complexity to a role that is otherwise largely defined through exemplary fight choreography. Gina Prince-Bythewood’s crisp, efficient direction of this adaptation of an action-fantasy comic-book series by Greg Rucka serves the physical element of the performances well. A fight on a rattling cargo plane between Theron and KiKi Layne (playing Nile, a reluctant new recruit to the immortal club) is a blast. Even Andy cracks a smile at one point. “She stabbed me,” Theron’s character later tells her right-hand man, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). “I think she has potential.” Where the film is less well supported is in the screenplay, which Rucka himself adapted, and which gets bogged down in some decidedly muddy character motivation at a crucial point. Equally tone deaf is a score that sidesteps the timelessness of the central characters, feeling more disposable than eternal. Still, there’s plenty to enjoy, not least Layne’s terrific turn as the newbie with a fresh take on forever. "
"Finally. Finally! After four months of being starved of the big-screen experience, four months of sitting at my desk watching films on my MacBook, four months of enduring a cowed miniaturisation of the cinema experience, four months of spilling mugs of tea over the keyboard and grumpily reloading the web link only to find the wifi has gone down and I’ve got the spinning wheel of death … I have the chance to see a film at the proper scale – at one of the new drive-in movie events that are popping up all over the country. And your car provides a natural bubble for social distancing. This one, held by the Drive In Film Club, was at Alexandra Palace in London, in the car park next to the ice rink, which usually hosts a slightly low-morale funfair in summer. I went on to the website and booked a ticket for the Pixar classic The Incredibles.  The thing is, I’ve never been to a drive-in before. Even when I was in my 20s, these impossibly glamorous US events were becoming rare. I associate them with hot summer nights, John Travolta with his arm around Olivia Newton-John in his cool roadster, a little speaker hooked over the driver-side window, and young people in shorts rollerskating up to the car with hot dogs and Coca-Cola. This isn’t exactly the vibe on a cloudy afternoon in London, where traffic marshals in hi-vis yellow tabards sternly direct cars to the correct entrance with windmilling arm movements. Still, I’m ready for the little speaker to be hooked to the side of the car so I can hear what’s being said on the screen. Someone in a hi-vis tabard leans over as we roll in: “To get the audio, tune to 87.7 on your FM dial.” Wait! What? The radio appears to be entirely presets. I panic and frantically twiddle the dial past Magic FM, Classic FM, Radio 2, Radio 4, Classic FM again and back to Magic FM, while huge faces on the screen in front mouth all-but wordlessly. I fear this is going to be a silent movie performance accompanied by the sound of Carolyn Quinn on the PM programme. Then, sound and vision magically link up, just as – gloriously – the Pearl & Dean ads begin. I had forgotten how much I’d missed this: not just the big screen, but the sound. With the windows open, it reverberates from car to car and a bank of speakers at the front creates the “house” effect of sound emanating from the screen. I’d missed the echo and the communal boom of the cinema. Obviously, the sound is not the same inside your car and, looking around at all the other vehicles, it is easy to think you could be at a car boot sale. But it is still liberating and I quietly squeak with excitement as I select a Diet Coke and a giant pack of Maltesers from the snack delivery system accessed from a website on my smartphone, paid for online and delivered to my car within 10 minutes by a rollerskater in a mask. (Any problems with that, or anything else, and the protocol is to flash your hazard lights and not sound your horn and distract from the film.) As well as the ads, an announcement reel is played that appears to be the genuine article from US drive-ins from the 50s and 60s. It tells “mom and pop” to go with their kids if they need to leave the car for any reason. This was a real homage to the “authentic” Eisenhower-era drive-in. As for The Incredibles, it is as brilliant as I had remembered – and this is the first time I have seen it on the big screen since it came out in 2004 and blew me away. What a treat. So why can’t drive-ins be a habit that we pick up from the lockdown? And if getting new films shown in this way is a problem, then why not reinvent the drive-in as the new frontier for cinephilia and make these events a showcase for classic movies, foreign movies, or little-known gems? Why not exploit empty spaces such as car parks like this all the time? As the Beach Boys put it: “Forget about the plot, it’ll do very well / But make sure you see enough so you’re prepared to tell / About the drive in / I love the drive in …”"
"There’s something particularly horrific about watching a person you love gradually lose all semblance of themselves. In the psychological horror film Relic – which debuted to critical acclaim at Sundance in January and arrives on Stan this week – the Australian first-time director Natalie Erika James explores the nightmare through a metaphor which, for her, is close to home: the devastating impact Alzheimer’s disease can have on its sufferer and their loved ones. Emily Mortimer, Bella Heathcote and Robyn Nevin star as three generations of women, reunited in their small-town home in Creswick, Victoria, after the elderly matriarch Edna (Nevin) goes missing. When Edna mysteriously reappears with no explanation, the family confront an unknowing, ominous presence that threatens to possess their rickety house and those inside it. “I started writing Relic when I was [in Japan] visiting my grandmother, who had Alzheimer’s,” James tells Guardian Australia from her home in Melbourne. “And on this trip, it was the first time she couldn’t remember who I was. It made me think about the ways in which, over time, her relationship with my mother and me had shifted.” Relic, a co-production between Australia and the US, was written by James and Christian White, with Jake Gyllenhaal and the Russo brothers attached as producer and executive producers respectively. A single-location drama, it patiently stews in claustrophobia, with unnerving thrills and a surprising, harrowing intimacy. As a self-described “bookworm”, James’s childhood was spent living a “transient life” between Japan, China and Australia, shooting school events and her own personal art films with a video camera. But it was her summers at her grandmother’s place that made the lasting impression. “[My grandmother] lived in this house that I had always been scared of as a child, because it was an older, more traditional-style Japanese house – and I was watching way too much Asian horror,” she recalls with a laugh. The restraint of gothic and Asian horror films, particularly J-horror, set the tone for her debut feature. “There’s this suspension of what is real and what is supernatural. In Relic, there is a similar thread of: is there an intruder, is there someone in the house, or is there a ghost? Or is it dementia that’s causing all of this?” In Relic, the horror is steeped within the darkened hallways and candle-lit, labyrinthine interiors of the family home, with tension culminating into heightened, grotesque territory. James didn’t want the fear to come from traditional jump-scares; instead, she frames the forthcoming menace through “what is unseen”. This meant favouring practical effects over VFX, including the use of an animatronic puppet, and incorporating a sound and lighting design sourced primarily from within her storyworld. The raw construction of the film, she believes, grounds Edna’s deteriorating state – even in its eventual monstrous externalisation – in the real, lived troughs of human horrors. “The film talks specifically about Alzheimer’s, but it also applies to anyone who is experiencing loss in all its forms – in having to parent their own parents, or seeing their decline,” James explains. “It’s a really emotionally fraught situation because there’s often the sense of the grandparents needing help, but being unwilling to ask for it as well.” These taut familial dynamics are at the heart of the narrative. “There’s a sense of simmering resentments between the three [women]: the idea of one family member’s expectations, another’s guilt and a judgement of inaction.” Having premiered the film at the Sundance film festival to glowing reviews – Variety called it “impressively scarifying” – Relic also drew comparisons to Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook and Ari Aster’s Hereditary: all inward-looking female-led arthouse horror films encased in a domestic setting. Both films, which also premiered at Sundance, have since launched the careers of their directors; whether or not Relic will do the same is yet to be seen (IFC Midnight has acquired the film for US distribution). James is already in the early development stages for her next feature, inspired by her short film Drum Wave – a folk horror centred on a young pianist who must confront her fear of motherhood when she marries into a remote island community. The trend towards both critically and commercially successful mid-budget “smart horror” – films including Get Out, A Quiet Place and The Witch – has presented a new opportunity for her as a film-maker. “It’s a really exciting time because audiences are more receptive to the idea that horror can be the perfect space to talk about social or deep, emotional issues in an accessible way,” she says. “I think we’re seeing an influx of films stand up on their artistic integrity, as well as being these thrilling genre rides. “The meeting point between the two is my favourite type of film – and certainly the films I want to continue making.”"
"‘What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered?” This is what Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, asks in 1993’s time-loop classic Groundhog Day. This hypothetical has also been an uncomfortable reality for the past three months in lockdown as we live our own version of 2 February in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, over and over again. Like Connors, you may have developed new skills such as playing the piano or ice sculpture. Unlike the jaded weatherman’s pursuit of the TV producer Rita, any budding romances in 2020 will have been reliant on arranging an awkward Zoom date. Danny Rubin, who co-wrote the film with Harold Ramis, laughs when he considers the way in which fiction has become reality, although he suggests the experience is “more like a jail movie”: “‘What has my life been reduced to and how can I make it bigger despite the walls around me?’” he says. He sees more similarity between Connors’ experience and “the scientific trials for a vaccine that rely on repetition and minor changes in order to make a breakthrough”. Rubin’s idea set the template for time-loop movies, with the plot device – a character living the same day repeatedly – becoming a Hollywood favourite. The writers of Source Code (2011) and Edge of Tomorrow (2014), for example, used repetition and action to craft two fine sci-fi movies. Meanwhile, the forthcoming romcom Palm Springs throws a couple into the mix, with Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, falling for each other while endlessly tumbling through the same destination wedding. The appeal of the time-loop film is clear: who doesn’t dream of being able to relive at least one day in their life? However, the experience of lockdown may have turned what once seemed like a far-fetched dream into a triggering reminder of a thoroughly miserable moment for humanity. Christopher Landon, whose 2017 horror movie Happy Death Day spawned a 2019 sequel, suggests that the time-loop trope has always been a little nightmarish. “These movies are never set on the best day of your life,” he says. “There’s a real phobia of being trapped somewhere. Especially on a day that’s not terribly exciting.” This is certainly true of Happy Death Day’s Tree Gelbman, who spends the duration of the film attempting to solve her own murder. Each time she dies, her day starts over and she must try to establish who the slasher in the terrifying baby mask is once again. The only thing comforting about watching Happy Death Day in 2020 is that the masked killer is covering his mouth and nose. Landon says that he has been contacted by many fans on social media who have discovered his films while staying indoors. “People relate to them right now because not only are we stuck in the pandemic, but the world is also in a state of turmoil,” he says. “It’s funny and tragic. I don’t want people to feel like they’re stuck in the same day and getting murdered over and over again.” Landon even suggests he is plotting a third instalment inspired by recent events, although he is reluctant to divulge any of the gory details. See You Yesterday, produced by Spike Lee, is another time-loop film connected to the horrors of reality. Stefon Bristol’s 2019 Netflix movie was inspired by the 2014 Ferguson protests, sparked by the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police in Missouri. Set in Brooklyn, New York, the film loops a day in which a time-travelling teenager, CJ Walker, loses her brother in similar circumstances, highlighting the bleakly repetitive nature of police brutality in the US. “We see these same images of young black people being killed over and over again,” Bristol says. In his film, the time loop is “a symbol to highlight these tragedies. New names, but same story.” Bristol points out that time travel is not necessarily an escapist fantasy for black people, for whom the past is often a hostile environment. “Everyone wants to go back in time and see what if …” he says. “I never want to go back in time. Experience and pain is the best lesson. Leave that shit for the movies.” Between the pandemic and a painful reminder of power’s corruptive force, this summer has added a dark context to one of film’s most beloved formats. What, if anything, can we learn from these films as we emerge from lockdown and start looking forward? Rubin suggests that Groundhog Day may offer pointers. “Phil goes from thinking only of himself to considering the feelings of those around him,” he says. “Expanding from selfishness into empathy is something we need.” He adds: “When you stop seeing things solely from how you profit from them and start looking at them from new perspectives, that leads to doors becoming unstuck. Some people get there eventually and some never do. Right now, we need a little more balance.”"
"Terry Gilliam began filming his twisted Cervantes adaptation in 2000, but the production was derailed by endless problems, chief among them a storm that destroyed sets, as well as the admission to hospital of its title-role actor, Jean Rochefort. Revived and finished in 2017 with Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce, the film’s troubles were not over: there were legal challenges  to its premiere at Cannes (and health hiccups), and Gilliam weighed in unhelpfully on the topic of #MeToo while promoting the movie. This charming, complex animation has the longest production history of any film on record. It was begun in 1964 by Richard Williams, who later received acclaim for his work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but financiers wrested it from his control in 1993. From there, two versions were released (The Princess and the Cobbler, followed in 1995 by Arabian Knight), neither of them complete or sanctioned by Williams, who died in 2019. Various fan edits (known as The Recobbled Cuts) have brought the film closer to his original vision. Sixteen years elapsed between work starting on the screenplay of this Bollywood historical epic about Akbar the Great, emperor of India in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and the film’s release. The production itself lasted 12 years, on and off. When shooting was almost complete, the director, K Asif, wanted to junk the black-and-white footage and start all over again in the newly available Technicolor format. His producers were unenthusiastic; some colour scenes were added instead. Barbara Hershey gave Martin Scorsese a copy of Nikos Kazantzakis’s novel about Christ’s human, fallible side when they worked together on the director’s second feature, Boxcar Bertha, released in 1972. A version he planned to shoot in 1983, with Aidan Quinn in the lead, was thwarted partly by a campaign by Christian fundamentalist groups. When it was released five years later with Willem Dafoe replacing Quinn, and Hershey as Mary Magdalene, its opponents rained fire and brimstone down on the project. Franco Zeffirelli called the film “truly horrible and completely deranged”, his opprobrium undiminished by the fact that he hadn’t seen it. Richard Linklater set aside a month each year from 2001 to 2013 to shoot Boyhood piecemeal in between his other films, allowing the cast, including Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and newcomer Ellar Coltrane (who was six when shooting began), to age magically before our eyes thanks to that most special of effects: time. The director is now a year into an even more ambitious project: an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s counter-chronological musical Merrily We Roll Along, starring Beanie Feldstein, Ben Platt and Blake Jenner, which will be in cinemas – if they still exist – circa 2039. Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo were in their teens when they started work on their groundbreaking pseudo-documentary, a chilling “what if?” that imagined Britain in the aftermath of its defeat in the second world war. During seven years of on-again, off-again production, they received moral and financial support from the director Tony Richardson, while Stanley Kubrick was so fascinated by the endeavour that he donated “short ends” from Dr Strangelove – rolls of film not completely exposed – for the pair to use. It took five years for David Lynch to complete his unnerving and morbidly funny industrial-horror debut. Filming ground to a halt whenever the production ran out of money; family and friends (including Lynch’s art designer Jack Fisk and Fisk’s wife, the actor Sissy Spacek) chipped in to supplement the meagre income the director was earning from a paper round delivering the Wall Street Journal; Lynch also separated from his wife during the shoot, and slept in the disused stables where some of the film was made. Stanley Kubrick had the idea of adapting Arthur Schnitzler’s novel Traumnovelle in the late 1970s, when he considered casting Steve Martin in the role that would eventually go to Tom Cruise. By the time Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999, 12 years after his previous film, Full Metal Jacket, it had shed several cast members during a shoot that lasted more than 15 months (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Harvey Keitel, unavailable for reshoots, were replaced by Marie Richardson and Sydney Pollack respectively) and Kubrick himself had died. It was fitting that audiences should endure a lengthy wait for a film that has delayed gratification baked into its bones, with Cruise’s character repeatedly on the verge of having sex but never quite getting down to it. This full-bodied Bollywood musical is uxoriousness in celluloid form. It was 1955 when the poet and director Kamal Amrohi conceived of a story in which his wife, Meena Kumari, would play the dual roles of a prostitute who dies in childbirth and the daughter who grows up to struggle, like her late mother, to escape her ignoble background. Shooting began in black-and-white in 1958 only to start all over again in colour and finally CinemaScope before hitting the ultimate speed bump: the couple’s separation in 1964. Five years later, Amrohi persuaded Kumari, who was by then suffering from liver cirrhosis, to complete the film in exchange for a divorce. She attended the premiere in February 1972 and died the following month. You wait a decade or two for an awol director to return to the fray and then three turn up at once: Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas and Terrence Malick all reappeared at the end of the 1990s. Lucas took the longest (it had been 22 years since he directed the first Star Wars film) but loses points by dint of returning with The Phantom Menace. Malick at least had the decency to come back with this masterpiece. These days he pops out movies like Tic Tacs, but audiences had to wait two decades between Days of Heaven in 1978 and The Thin Red Line, his meditative follow-up about the battle of Guadalcanal in the second world war. It reduced stars such as John Travolta and George Clooney to walk-ons, left Mickey Rourke and Bill Pullman missing in action on the cutting-room floor and demoted Adrien Brody from leading man to near-wordless onlooker. All grist to the mill: the result was profound enough to be well worth the 20-year wait."
"Lilly Wachowski, who co-directed the Matrix films with her sister, Lana, has confirmed that they should be read as allegories for the transgender narrative. Subsequent to the films’ release, both sisters came out as trans – Lana in 2012 and Lilly in 2016 – and some fans have since identified apparent resonances for the experience in the movies. “I’m glad that it has gotten out that that was the original intention,” Lilly told Netflix Film Club on 4 August. “The world wasn’t quite ready for it. The corporate world wasn’t ready for it.” “I love how meaningful those films are to trans people,” she continued, “and the way they come up to me and say, ‘These movies saved my life.’” Theories about the film have centred around the idea that the unease Keanu Reeves’s character, Neo, feels – described as “a splinter in your mind” – represents a type of gender dysphoria. Therefore, the red pill he takes to see reality as it is could be seen as a hormone tablet. Wachowski expressed some scepticism about the blatantness of such readings, saying: “I don’t know how present my trans-ness was in my brain as we were writing it.” But she said that her and her sister’s identities did mean they readily embraced a mix of genres and an eagerness to explore “the seemingly impossible becoming possible”, as well as being as inclusive as possible. “I think it freed us up as film-makers because we were able imagine things that at that time you didn’t necessarily see on screen.” She also revealed that they had intended the character of Switch to be gender fluid, presenting as a man in apparent reality, and as a woman in the world of the Matrix. “The Matrix ... was all about the desire for transformation, but it was all coming from a closeted point of view,” Wachowski said. A belated third sequel recently recommenced production, after the set was shut down in March. Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Jada Pinkett Smith will return in the film, which is due for release next year."
"There’s a defining moment in David Lynch’s Wild at Heart where Lula (Laura Dern), a liberated southern belle, takes the wheel of a 1965 Ford Thunderbird convertible while Sailor (Nicolas Cage), her parole-skipping boyfriend, nods off in the back seat. On some dusty stretch of highway outside San Antonio, Texas, she starts flipping through the AM dial for something to listen to, but every station is surreal or gruesome or both: “… severed …”, “… recent divorce, shot and killed her three children …”, “…shot right between …”, “… a heinous …”, “… had sex with the corpse …” and one final grisly item about the crocodiles brought in to devour the floating corpses of 500 turtles released into the Ganges to help reduce human pollution. Lula pulls the car over in disgust. “Sailor Ripley, you get me some music on that radio this instant!” she screams, and he obliges, scanning past more talk-radio mayhem before landing, improbably, on a track by the Minneapolis speed metal band Powermad. As the two thrash along in the embankment – Sailor, with his karate-kick dancing style, seems like a terror in nightclubs – Lynch’s camera cranes upwards to a magic-hour sunset across the field. And then suddenly, the adrenalized thump of Powermad’s Slaughterhouse fades out and the lush strings of Richard Strauss overwhelm the soundtrack. Romance pokes through the violence and discord like a bloom through cracks in the pavement. Love conquers all. The sequence is Wild at Heart in microcosm, with the AM stations representing treacherous pitstops on the lost highways between a deep south correctional facility and sunny California, where Sailor and Lula hope to carve out some place for themselves. The appeal of road movies is that they allow for a certain amount of narrative spontaneity, with every exit teasing the possibility of a new and unexpected subplot. That uneasiness is the lifeblood of Wild at Heart, which sets a love of the purest and most passionate kind against a sun-scorched landscape of ceaseless hostility. The forces of good and evil that Lynch had limited to a small town four years earlier with Blue Velvet are blown out into the larger expanse of the American road. Thirty years ago, Wild at Heart arrived in theaters after winning the Palme D’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was greeted, according to the critic Dave Kehr, with “the most violent chorus of boos and hisses to be heard in a decade”. Such a reception at Cannes can often be a badge of honor – L’Avventura and Taxi Driver also got an earful – and Lynch would get booed again when he premiered Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me at the festival two years later. But Wild at Heart opening to polarized reviews and middling box office, and its reputation over the years hasn’t improved as much as Fire Walk with Me or Lost Highway, which both seemed ahead of their audience at the time. While other Lynch films have been treated to Criterion editions and repertory play, it was hard to find on DVD in the US for years and it’s still not available to stream anywhere. This was not the expected fate for a Palme-winner from one of the greatest film-makers. And yet, it’s not impossible to understand why it’s slipped through the cracks a little. Wild at Heart is a film of extreme violence and ugliness, and it’s far more conceptually loaded than it needs to be, with a complicated thicket of murderous lowlifes and Wizard of Oz references that are sometimes clumsily grafted on to the action and the dialogue. Coming after a tightly constructed noir like Blue Velvet, the film feels deliberately unruly, loaded with discursive flashbacks and soap opera twists, and moments of glib provocation, as if Lynch were aiming to repulse people as a lark. John Waters once said, “If someone vomits watching one of my films, it’s like getting a standing ovation.” Perhaps that’s what those Cannes boos felt like for Lynch. But the chaos that surrounds Sailor and Lula – “Well, we’re really out in the middle of it now, ain’t we?” she declares – has the effect of heightening their relationship, much like the pop of three-strip Technicolor when Dorothy emerges into Munchkinland. For all the scenes of them grinding away in seedy motel rooms, and for all the past traumas and injustices they can never escape, Lynch sees Sailor and Lula as innocents, so pure in their love that they would make the robin tweet in Blue Velvet. When Sailor serenades Lula with Elvis tunes, it’s easy to get hung up on Nicolas Cage’s kitschy impersonation of The King or the piped-in screams of young women from an old live recording. But Lynch is utterly sincere about Sailor and Lula, and optimistic that they can overcome the evil forces that are aligned against them. The key to Wild at Heart is Laura Dern’s performance as Lula, who craves freedom from a pathological mother (Diane Ladd, Dern’s real mom) and from a childhood shaped by sexual assault and the death of her father under dubious circumstances. She clings to the most flawed imaginable vessel in Sailor, who’d be the type to stumble into prison stints under the best of circumstances, but who also happens to have witnessed the fire that killed her father. As she and Sailor dodge the bloodhounds and assassins her mother sends after them – Harry Dean Stanton, JE Freeman, Grace Zabriskie, Isabella Rossellini and David Patrick Kelly are only a partial list of their pursuers – Lula insists on finding some place where they can be happy together. Maybe it’s a dancefloor, maybe it’s cigarettes on a motel bed, maybe it’s a sunset on the side of the road – she will eke out pleasure in the moment, even if they have no future together. Lynch puts Dern through the emotional wringer here, like a devastating encounter with a car crash victim (Sherilyn Fenn) who spends her last moments in shocked delirium or an extended stay in the Texas hellpit of Big Tuna, where the oily Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) identifies and exploits her deepest vulnerabilities. When Lula tells Sailor, “You mark me the deepest,” Lynch makes sure the audience knows all the marks she’s accumulated. He engineers a happy ending for her because she deserves it. There’s a place for her and Sailor off the doom and static of the radio dial, somewhere over the rainbow."
"Even as part three begins filming in the UK, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is beginning to look like a cursed franchise. Many of us are wondering how it even made it this far: the second instalment of the Harry Potter prequels was an over-designed mess and a box-office disappointment. Since then, the magic has worn off alarmingly. JK Rowling has turned into a kind of cultural Sorting Hat, alienating swathes of fans with her comments about the trans community. Ezra Miller, who plays a pivotal character, saw their reputation as a non-binary style icon take a fall this April after footage emerged of them appearing to choke a female fan to the ground. And then there’s Johnny Depp, whose recent libel trial aired way too much dirty laundry about his relationship with Amber Heard – allegations of domestic violence, abuse, alcohol, drugs and even defecation. So, Fantastic Beasts 3: The Chamber of Toxicity? In retrospect, Warner Bros might be wishing it had pulled the plug in March, when the production was halted by the pandemic and before this perfect storm of PR disasters struck. But given the success of the Harry Potter movies, Fantastic Beasts is too valuable a property to simply give up on. As we know, the modern movie business depends on franchises, not just to fill cinemas but also to draw subscribers to your streaming platform – a growing concern post-Covid. You set them up, you milk them for all they’re worth, you reboot them. Which is why we’re also due a sequel to a Spider-Man spin-off (Venom 2) and the umpteenth reincarnation of The Batman – also from Warners, whose misfiring stewardship of the DC superhero franchise includes a planned solo movie for The Flash, played by, er, Ezra Miller. As well as the industry, you wonder what this situation means for acting. Traditionally, we’ve allowed great actors to be eccentric, erratic, even downright terrible human beings. Plenty of latitude was given to old-school “hellraisers” such as Oliver Reed or Richard Burton, but you’d never trust them to anchor a mega-budget, multi-movie franchise. Depp, a lifelong idoliser of celebrity rogues, managed to keep Pirates of the Caribbean afloat for 14 years, but success has clearly been a double-edged sword for him. With so much at stake, casting a modern franchise movie has become more like selecting a political candidate. It is as much a matter of background checks and risk assessments and psychological profiling. Talent is still an asset, but nothing too “wild”, thank you. Better a safe pair of hands. Depending on your point of view, this is either making Hollywood a duller place or a safer place. But when the off-screen antics are more talked about than the on-screen ones, you know you’ve got problems. "
"The British food writer and fermentation expert Thom Eagle writes that “crunch, heat – but not too much heat – sweetness and sharpness and salt” are what make a good pickle. This warm and whimsical caper about an immigrant worker who is brined for a century in a vat of pickles is sweet enough, but lacks an essential wince-inducing bite. Based on Simon Rich’s 2013 short story Sell Out, serialised in the New Yorker, it stars Seth Rogen as Herschel Greenbaum, a “ditch-digger” in rural Poland circa 1919 who emigrates to America with his wife and lands a job in pest control at a pickle factory in Brooklyn. A freak accident sees him falling into a vat of brine; a hundred years later the barrel and a perfectly preserved Herschel are discovered. He connects, then clashes with his great-grandson Ben (also played by Rogen), an app developer and all-round hipster cliche. Following the codes of the fish-out-of-water comedy subgenre, Herschel marvels at Ben’s SodaStream machine and the fact that he owns 25 pairs of socks (“You have two feet”). The orphaned Ben, on the other hand, is taken aback by his great-grandad’s fierce family loyalty and entrepreneurial streak. Discovering that his late wife’s grave sits beneath a giant billboard for vanilla vodka, a heavily accented Herschel proclaims he will “start pickle empire and make $200,000” to buy back the plot. Outraged that an organic grocery store is selling cucumbers for 90 cents a piece, he ends up foraging his ingredients from the supermarket’s bins and selling artisanal gherkins ($4 a reclaimed glass jar). His unruly beard only adds to the authenticity of his brand. The pickles are a hit until Herschel’s cart is shut down by the city’s health and safety department. His trajectory goes viral, along with some of his unsavoury tweets, and he experiences the whiplash of fickle public opinion. Jokes about gentrification work, but attempts to parody today’s social media outrage cycle feel laboured. Elsewhere, quips about non-dairy milk alternatives and unpaid internships are already dated. Boop Bop, the app Ben is developing, rates and ranks corporations based on how problematic they are, a kind of TripAdvisor for ethical businesses. So when Herschel’s shenanigans compromise a contract with a startup, Ben’s instinct is revenge, highlighting an apparent willingness to leave all ethics at the door. Millennial self-interest and performative liberal politics are contrasted with “authentic”, let-it-all-hang-out conservatism. It’s a simplistic critique. Still, the frequently charming Rogen brings enough of his affable, nice guy credibility to each character to ground both loose cannon Herschel and his straight man foil. While its gags about politics are slippery, the film is surprisingly adept at handling the more substantial theme of generational guilt. “You were raised Jew! Are you not still Jew?” Herschel asks the secular Ben, curious about how he views his heritage. Indeed, the film’s prologue is a 10-minute short film about the immigrant experience in and of itself. In the fictional town of Slupsk, Herschel narrates the story of his marriage to Sarah (Sarah Snook, Shiv from HBO’s Succession) and their journey to Ellis Island. Their romance blossoms at the side of a bog, where they bond over the fact that both lost their parents to the Cossacks, and their mutual favourite colour (black). At border control they are met with antisemitic remarks. Debut director Brandon Trost (previously a cinematographer and one of Rogen’s regular collaborators) shoots this sequence as a sepia-tinted fairytale, but struggle is baked into their American dream. Even the film’s title shrewdly suggests that America is built on the labour of immigrants."
"Beyoncé’s second visual album after Lemonade is truly worth the wait. An accompaniment to her Lion King album The Gift, to describe Black Is King as just a visual album is an understatement – it is a film in and of itself. Black Is King is a global contemporary reimagining of the story of The Lion King across several countries and three continents, following a human Simba’s journey with Beyoncé as an ethereal narrator and guide. The film uses sound clips from The Lion King to assist with transitions that shape the story, and all of the protagonists from the film are recreated as real-life characters with more personality and substance. The hyenas are a devilish biker gang, and Mood 4 Eva depicts life with Timon and Pumba in a lavish mansion. Fundamentally, Black Is King speaks to the beauty and richness of blackness without it seeming grotesquely wealthy or too contrived. The film offers varied production styles: sometimes minimal, with Beyoncé singing in vast open spaces on songs such as Bigger; other sequences are loud and colourful, with vibrant imagery and high energy dancers on My Power. Black Is King is a visual feast; it provides several slow-panning scenes of stillness where we absorb the striking beauty and duality of bright colours against deep brown tones. On Already, we see dancers celebrate under the red, black and green Pan-African flag designed by Marcus Garvey: a truly unapologetic statement of black unity in a time that feels like the world has forgotten us. Beyoncé has described this project as a “labour of love”; it was co-directed by Kwasi Fordjour, the Ghanaian creative director of her Parkwood Entertainment company, with additional input from creatives across Africa. Each song has a distinctly different visual, yet follows the story perfectly. Nothing feels out of place and everything feels familiarly beautiful. It is impossible to watch the emotive story unfold, accompanied by Warsan Shire’s poetry, Yrsa Daley-Ward’s writing and warm images of west Africa, without feeling emotional. Nile (featuring Kendrick Lamar) sees Beyoncé lead a funeral procession across an endless white landscape as she narrates: “No true king ever dies. Our ancestors hold us from within our own bodies, guiding us through our reflections.” Prior to its release, there were fears that this film would fall into the gimmicky trend described by Jade Bentil as “Wakandification”: the idea that western media essentialise an array of African cultures and neatly package them to sell to western audiences. Black Is King does the complete opposite. It is storytelling inspired and led by African creatives, traditions and sounds, while speaking to diaspora and those still searching for an identity. The film draws inspiration across the continent, from Namibia to Lagos: but as The Lion King is set in east Africa, it would have been great to see a deeper inclusion of east African countries and cultures. This soundtrack and film is a love letter to the black diaspora, to remind them that they, too, are part of something bigger. With appearances from Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland, Pharrell and Naomi Campbell, this star-studded film has something for everyone. It is compelling in every sense and takes you on a moving journey: not only through the story of The Lion King, but through a small portion of the beautiful cultures and traditions that exist within black communities globally."
"It’s not clear to me if this is a heartwarming study in young people’s idealism or a Lord of the Flies bloodbath with smug feral demons in white T-shirts. It’s not clear if it’s funny or tragic, if it’s reality TV or reality itself. But Boys State is as exciting and moving as Steve James’s high school basketball epic Hoop Dreams was a generation ago, with its emotional rawness, its guileless patriotism and capacity for hurt and wonder. We watch, in what feels like real time, as a group of ambitious teenage boys – smart, poignantly naive, utterly insufferable – get brutally acquainted with Kipling’s two “impostors”: triumph and disaster. It is the story of Boys State, a kind of annual debate club in the US for 16 and 17-year-olds organised by the American Legion, state by state, a project invented in 1937 – and there is, to put it delicately, a bit of a 1930s vibe about it. But it’s avowedly there to inculcate citizenship and leadership among America’s youth and reintroduce the values of reasoned argument to a generation addled by the social-media screaming match. Some of America’s biggest political legends took part in their youth, and the film shows the famous photo of a teenaged Bill Clinton shaking hands with JFK at his event. There are separate groups for girls and boys. Boys State is a little like the model UN, without the wussy liberal nonsense of pretending to be foreigners. The young people spend a week at the state capitol, run for pretend office, conduct boisterous debates and finally submit to a nerve-shredding election. In 2017, the Texas Boys State voted to secede from the union, causing national soul-searching, much like the Oxford Union’s King and Country debate in Britain in 1933. It was febrile and immature of the Texas boys, maybe, but then so is grownup American politics these days. The following year, documentary film-makers Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss spent time with the Texan debaters, as they once again built America from the ground up in their own beardless image. Had the previous year’s mercurial, quasi-Trumpian mood receded into embarrassment or hardened further still? Is it more than a child’s educational game? By the end of this movie, with its shattering climax, it feels like the most important thing in the world. For Texas Boys State, the participants are asked to join and then decide on candidates and chairmen of the arbitrarily formed parties “Nationalists” and “Federalists”, followed by the overall vote – a convention that reinforces the sense among some of the teen cynics present that US politics is just a game. We see on someone’s phone the inevitable Matrix red pill meme about the corporations running things anyway. But it soon becomes horribly clear that the two parties are divided on left/right lines, and God help anyone who doesn’t love guns. For the Nationalists, the candidate is a Mexican American boy, Steven Garza, with a talent for sincere rhetoric, but whose gun-control views are held against him. His chair, René Otero, is an elegant African American boy originally from Chicago who says he has never seen so many white people before, and who wears half-moon glasses that make him look 40 years older than he is. For the Federalists, the chair, Ben Feinstein, is a gung-ho conservative who is a double amputee and wants to join the CIA; his candidate, Eddy Proietti Conti, is a young man who is described as a Ben Shapiro figure. Soon, the dirty tricks kick off. There is an attempt among some Nationalists to impeach their own chair (for conscious or unconscious reasons that we can only guess at) and the Federalists’ Instagram page mocks this internal row and fanatically attacks their opponent’s membership of the anti-school-shooting Never Again MSD movement. The Nationalists’ chair attempts to limit the Federalists’ debate time on technical grounds; the cry of “rigged” goes up and the acrimony boils over. The gloves and the training wheels come off. The tension is unbearable. And so is the great imponderable question: is the soul-crushing disappointment of defeat the rocket-fuel for future victory – like Nietzsche’s maxim about strength through not being destroyed, or One Direction conquering the world after coming third in The X Factor? Some of these boys are already as hard-faced and cynical as velociraptors. Some are gentle and sweet natured. Some are even shown changing their minds. It’s an amazing spectacle."
"“No one’s stronger than an artist in a crisis”: so sang Tim Minchin in a satirical number to open the 2020 Bafta television awards, which took place on Friday following a 10-week delay due to the coronavirus pandemic. Host Richard Ayoade promised that the event would be “very much showbusiness as usual”, however – as well as a pared-back format, with winners joining Ayoade via video link and the ceremony clocking in at just 90 minutes – it bore other signs of change, with much diversity among the winners, and major accolades for cult series like The End of The F***ng World and Stath Lets Flats. The ceremony rewarded programmes which aired between 1 January and 31 December 2019. Unlike last year when Killing Eve swept the top categories, it was not a particularly big night for Phoebe Waller-Bridge. While her smash hit comedy Fleabag, which ended with its second series last year, won in the female performance in a comedy programme, it was Sian Clifford rather than Waller-Bridge who was awarded for her role as Claire, Fleabag’s chronically uptight sister. The show also lost out in the scripted comedy category to Channel 4’s inept estate agent comedy, Stath Lets Flats, which also beat two other ratings hits in the form of Derry Girls and Catastrophe. Emily Maitlis’s headline-grabbing, wholly memorable interview with Prince Andrew was another surprise loss, with the award for news coverage instead given to Sky News for its reporting on the Hong Kong protests. In a more predictable turn of events, HBO and Sky’s disaster drama Chernobyl won best miniseries, with Jared Harris also named best actor for his role as Soviet scientist Valery Legasov, beating fellow nominees Takehiro Hira (Giri/Haji), Stephen Graham for The Virtues and The Capture’s Callum Turner. The show also became the drama to have received the most British Bafta awards ever, taking into account the other nine awards it received at sister ceremony the Bafta television craft awards. Following the announcement of a more diverse shortlist – which followed complaints in January towards the all-white, male-skewed shortlist at the Bafta film awards – it was a successful night for diversity, with gongs awarded to many nominees from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Comic Mo Gilligan won in the best entertainment performance category for his youth-oriented chat show The Lateish Show with Mo Gilligan on Channel 4. Accepting his award, the Lambeth-born presenter said his win “gives hope to so many people who sound like, look like me and from the same background”. Naomi Ackie also beat nominees including Helena Bonham-Carter in the best supporting actress category for her role in the teen noir The End of The F***king World, while Will Sharpe beat nominees including The Crown’s Josh O’Connor to win for his role in the BBC’s British/Japanese drama Giri/Haji, praising the team behind the show for creating a half-Japanese character. When They See Us, Ava Duvernay’s Netflix drama about the Central Park Five rape case, which explores a miscarriage of justice against young black men, was named best international series in a strong category which included last year’s winner Succession. Idris Elba was awarded the Special Award, with the US actor Taraji P Henson leading a tribute to the actor which included a mention of his production company Green Door pictures, which has worked to widen access to the TV industry. In a pre-show interview, Elba said: “I want to open the door for others to come in … I am positive about the future. The needle has moved significantly.” He added in his speech that he would make “more opportunity for more actors and more writers to tell their stories”. Smaller shows also came out on top, with The Crown losing out in the best drama series category to The End of The F***king World, though thankfully for Netflix, the latter show is also one of its projects, albeit a co-production with Channel 4. Jamie Demteriou won male performance in a comedy programme for Stath Lets Flats, while the BBC’s travel contest Race Across The World triumphed over more established formats like Celebrity Gogglebox and the UK version of RuPaul’s Drag Race in the reality and constructed factual race. Elsewhere, there was a first Bafta TV win, at last, for Glenda Jackson, twice nominated in 1972 for Elizabeth R and 1971 for Howard’s End, for her first TV role in over 25 years. The 84-year-old actor and former MP beat last year’s winner Jodie Comer (Killing Eve), Suranne Jones (Gentleman Jack) and Samantha Morton (I Am Kirsty) to win in the lead actress category for her role in the BBC thriller Elizabeth Is Missing, about a woman with dementia trying to solve the disappearance of a friend. While she kept her acceptance speech brief, save for praising her fellow nominees, in a pre-show Bafta panel, Jackson spoke of the crisis in care for older people, saying that she had found making the programme “intensely moving … [this is] a story which is of national importance”. Accepting the award for factual series for the Michael Jackson expose Leaving Neverland, filmmaker Dan Reed underscored the mood of the evening, imploring TV companies to revisit their hiring processes and to continue “nurturing [the] careers” of those from underrepresented backgrounds."
"In 2013, Alan Parker, who has died aged 76, received the Bafta fellowship award “in recognition of outstanding achievement in the art forms of the moving image”. Parker was praised for his energetic style, his keen visual sense and his storytelling skills, and for resuscitating the movie musical. He was also credited with having broken down the barriers between the American and British film industries and paving the way for fellow Brits – with Adrian Lyne, Hugh Hudson, and Ridley and Tony Scott having come from advertising like himself – to pursue Hollywood careers. Although Parker directed only two bona fide British productions – Bugsy Malone (1976) and Pink Floyd: The Wall (1982) – in 1998 he was appointed chairman of the board of governors of the British Film Institute (BFI) and in 1999 first chairman of the Film Council. And yet, a little more than a decade earlier, Parker had made a television documentary called A Turnip Head’s Guide to the British Film Industry (1985) in which he tackled “the pomposity, stupidity, pretension and avarice of the film industry”.  He believed that British films were too parochial and not commercial enough in concept, recalling that, as a child, whenever he visited his local cinema and the film opened with an image of a red London bus, he knew he was “in for a lousy time”. Parker set out to change all that. Some of his attitudes derived from his working-class upbringing and the battles he had to advance himself. If any theme is to be found in his eclectic oeuvre, it is a sympathy with the underdog. Parker was born during a German wartime air raid, on a housing estate in Islington, north London. His mother, Elsie, was a dressmaker and his father, William, a house painter. He became interested in photography at an early age, which led him, after leaving school at 18, to take a job as an office boy in the post room of an advertising agency. He then got work as a copywriter. “The great thing about advertising, from a British point of view, is that it didn’t have a kind of class distinction as other jobs had,” Parker recalled. “If you were half bright, they gave you a chance. I was very fortunate that they gave me that chance.” One London agency he worked with was Collett Dickenson Pearce, where he first met David Puttnam and Alan Marshall, both of whom would later produce many of his films. In 1970, Puttnam bought the rights to a handful of songs by the Bee Gees, which were incorporated into a story for a feature film, Melody (1971). Parker, who wrote the screenplay, came up with a tale of two children at a south London comprehensive whose friendship is tested when a pretty girl enters their social orbit. It was directed by Waris Hussein, and Parker did some second-unit direction for the film, as well as shooting the montage sequences. But before making his feature film debut as a director, he made two shorts, Our Cissy and Footsteps (both 1974), and a TV drama, The Evacuees (1975), for the BBC. The latter, written by Jack Rosenthal, about the experiences of two young Jewish boys evacuated from Manchester to Blackpool during the blitz, won a Bafta award and an International Emmy. It was also proof of Parker’s expertise in directing children. This was consolidated with his first feature, Bugsy Malone, a slick musical with children playing American gangsters of the 20s, one gang armed with cream cakes, the other with splurge guns. “My script was a cinematic pastiche, with echoes and references to Astaire, Raft, Kelly, Cagney, Brando and Welles,” Parker recalled. “It’s not so much an homage as a collection of fond memories of double bills that I had devoured as a kid at the Blue Hall rerun cinema in Upper Street in north London.” The routines were well staged and the “gangsters” talented and likable. Midnight Express (1978) was loosely based on the true story of Billy Hayes, a young American jailed for drug smuggling in Istanbul. The movie, relentlessly directed by Parker, graphically depicted how Hayes (Brad Davis) was beaten up and tortured in prison. There were sympathetic critics who interpreted the film as less about the Turkish prison system than about a general fear of otherness. Some years later, Oliver Stone, whose screenplay won an Oscar, apologised for “over-dramatising” the story. In contrast, Fame (1980), which again showed what Parker could do with song-and-dance routines, followed eight young people for four years at the High School of Performing Arts in New York. “Something wonderful is happening to me, mama,” says one of the budding stars. “I’m growing up.” For Parker, Shoot the Moon (1982), a divorce drama starring Albert Finney and Diane Keaton, was “the first grown-up film that I’d done”. A robust dissection of modern marriage sympathetic to both sides of the battle, the film was convincing in its depiction of the minutiae of bringing up families. “It was a painful film to make for me because there were echoes of my own life in it. It was about a breakup of a marriage, and the children in the story were quite close to my own children in age.” Parker’s first marriage, to Annie Inglis, whom he had married in 1966, ended in 1992. Although Parker considered the filming of Pink Floyd: The Wall “one of the most miserable experiences of my creative life”, this surreal extended pop promo, starring Bob Geldof as a disintegrating rock star, did well at the box office. The causes of unhappiness were the constant clashes with the Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters, who wrote the screenplay, and the political cartoonist and illustrator Gerald Scarfe, who did the elaborate animation sequences. Birdy (1984) seamlessly transposed the novelist William Wharton’s post-second world war traumas to a post-Vietnam setting. It concerned the devastating effects the war had on two young friends, Al (Nicolas Cage), physically injured, and Birdy (Matthew Modine), psychologically damaged, who believes he is a bird. Treated with sensibility and skill, the film contains some exceptional sequences, such as Birdy’s dream of flying over Pittsburgh.  Angel Heart (1987), a tense thriller, was set in the 50s in New Orleans where a private eye, played by Mickey Rourke, is trying to locate a missing person for a sinister client, played by Robert De Niro. His trail leads to voodoo rites and its link with sexuality, evil and darkness.  Mississippi Burning (1988) was about a couple of contrasting FBI agents (Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe) in a small southern town in 1964, investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers. In Come See the Paradise (1990), the FBI were the bad guys helping to round up and imprison Japanese Americans during the second world war.  Parker returned triumphantly to the musical with The Commitments (1991), based on the novel by the Irish writer Roddy Doyle, on the efforts of a ragtag group of Dublin musicians to launch a successful band. Laced with superb songs sung with passion, and vibrant performances by a cast of unknowns, it won Bafta awards for best film, best director and best adapted screenplay. “I wanted to do this film because I identified with the kids in the film,” Parker claimed. “They came from the north side of Dublin, a working-class area, and I came from the north of London, a very similar working-class area. I suppose deep down that the dreams and aspirations I had when I was a kid are very close to theirs.” Parker’s unbroken run of box-office winners was halted temporarily by The Road to Wellville (1994), a hit-and-miss satire about the health crazes at the turn of the 20th century, mainly perpetrated by Dr John Harvey Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins fitted with large buck teeth), he of cornflakes fame. Parker had another success with Evita (1996), adapted from the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber stage hit. It turned out to be a glitzy entertainment, with wall-to-wall songs (well sung by Madonna in the title role) and sparse dialogue delivered in awkward recitatives. But whatever the quality of the content, the look was impeccable, as with all Parker’s films. In fact, Parker often used the same team – directors of photography (Michael Seresin and Peter Biziou), editor (Gerry Hambling) and production designer (Brian Morris). Parker’s second film shot in Ireland, Angela’s Ashes (1999), based on the true story of Frank McCourt’s poverty-stricken childhood, failed to delve below the surface. Even more at fault for superficiality was The Life of David Gale (2003), which follows a Texas University professor (Kevin Spacey), an advocate for the abolishment of capital punishment, who finds himself on death row after being convicted of the rape and murder of another activist. The overwhelmingly negative critical reaction to the film convinced Parker to leave his filmography at 14 features. He said in 2017: “We have gone through the era of the producer, the director, now we are in the era of the studio executive. None of which bodes well if you’ve always had complete control of your work.” Parker was knighted in 2002. He is survived by his second wife, Lisa (nee Moran), whom he married in 2001, their son, Henry, four children, Lucy, Alexander, Jake and Nathan, from his first marriage, and seven grandchildren.

"You can count the directors who’ve been able to command budgets over $200m (£152m) for original blockbusters on one hand, and still have fingers left over. There’s James Cameron, now apparently intent on spending the rest of his career making sequels to his $237m (£181m) Avatar. There’s Christopher Nolan, whose next movie, Tenet, has soared well over that $200m mark. And, well, that’s it. Every other film coming in north of $200m is an adaptation, sequel, spin-off, reimagining or tie-in. Nolan is now out there on his own as that rarest of things: a mega-budget auteur – the one film-maker permitted to take such huge financial punts with wholly new ideas. Nolan carved this enviable niche in several ways. Firstly, he reliably makes very good films. His lowest-rated on Rotten Tomatoes is Interstellar with 72%, while Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight and Dunkirk are all above 90%. If your worst film is Interstellar, you’re doing something right. Secondly, each of his movies arrives riding a tsunami of anticipation. Ever since he turned the superhero movie on its head in 2005 with Batman Begins, audiences can’t wait to see where Nolan’s going next. Arguably, only Quentin Tarantino and, possibly, Jordan Peele are able to whip up comparable pre-release frenzy for a release that isn’t part of a franchise owned by Disney. Thirdly, Nolan is a very canny businessman. In order to recoup the vast investments pumped into his films, as many bums as possible have to be on seats. This means gaining that all-important PG-13/12A certificate. And he’s done this with every film he’s released post 2002’s Insomnia. It’s an astute strategy that Nolan goes to great lengths to achieve, removing just enough blood or menace to sneak each film past the US’s PG-13 arbiters. So, even with the Joker’s “pencil trick”, Dunkirk’s bowel-churning tension and Inception’s balletic ballistics, you can take your kids along. You possibly shouldn’t, but you can. The results speak for themselves: globally, Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk took $830m (£633m), $699m (£533m) and $527m (£402m), respectively. These are staggering numbers for non-franchise projects. Nolan has made a point of being a great return on investment. At a time when other auteurs tend to operate with self-limiting ratings of 15 and upwards – and the lower viewership and budgets that go along with it – no one does 12A with the same cocktail of artistry and business acumen as he does. Tenet, though, may prove to be a rare failure in Nolan’s filmography. It’s estimated the film will need to make $800m to break even. The pandemic has all-but made that an impossibility. For the first time, Nolan’s financiers are looking at a loss, though surely the best way to recoup is by writing him a blank cheque for his next project, whatever it is – as long as it’s a 12A. "
"This is possibly the most joyous, life-affirming film ever to be made about terminal disease. The Australian director Shannon Murphy’s feature debut, Babyteeth, is a marvel; the kind of skittish, reckless film-making that makes you want to rush headlong into bad decisions and savour every last messy moment of the fallout. Since her cancer diagnosis, 16-year-old Milla (Eliza Scanlen) has become insulated. Her home life is loving, but cushioned by the kind of parental concern that suffocates as much as protects. Then, while she is waiting for the morning train to school, Moses (Toby Wallace) crashes into her life. Rattling and scattershot with pills and chemical energy, he’s any parent’s worst nightmare. But Milla takes one look at his stringy limbs and homemade tattoos and makes her choice. The carriage doors sigh shut, the train leaves without her. And Milla stays on the platform, with this chaotic boy who pinballs into her personal space and peels off his shirt to stem her nosebleed. But there’s an added layer to this sliding doors moment of sexual awakening. Deep down, Milla knows that, for her, the opportunity to grab life and live wild is rapidly closing. And it doesn’t get much wilder than Moses. For Milla, it’s a headlong rush into first love. Like her character, Scanlen makes every moment count – a single loaded look, which sweeps between her parents and Moses, contains a symphony of emotions, starting with adolescent defiance and ending with an ache of uncertainty and longing. But what draws Moses, initially at least, is the realisation that his new friend’s family home is an all-you-can-eat drugs buffet. In addition to Milla’s cancer medication, there are the prescription pills that smooth the edges off her highly strung mother (Essie Davis): rich pickings for an enterprising addict. Meanwhile, Milla’s parents have to balance the urge to chase Moses away for ever against the knowledge that he makes their daughter more alive than she has been for months. The screenplay is adapted by Rita Kalnejais from her own play, but the storytelling here does not feel rooted in the theatre. Murphy grasps every means of cinematic expression available to her. Her use of colour sings, subliminally reinforcing this unlikely bond between a dying girl and a junkie: the way that Milla’s teal wig matches the too-big shorts that engulf Moses’s unsteady twiglet legs; on a stolen night out, their lilac shirts accidentally harmonise, like a shared private joke. The connection between them is real and tangible. The symbiosis of craft and character extends to the dancing, uninhibited camera and to the editing, which has a teenager’s headlong impatience and lurching attention span. But what really elevates the film is the use of music – crucial, given that both Milla and her mother are musicians. Murphy rejects the kind of handholding score that would wring every last drop of sentiment from the material. Instead, she assembles a thrillingly eclectic soundtrack, which embraces everything from a string quartet version of the Stranglers’ Golden Brown, to Vashti Bunyan’s twinkling Diamond Day, to Sudan Archives’ euphoric Come Meh Way, with its whirling harmonics and percussive violins. I particularly loved the use of a children’s choir version of the traditional sea shanty Santianna, which accompanies Moses’s rock-bottom dash to the home of his estranged mother. Crystalline and pure, it’s such an unexpected choice, so utterly right for the scene that plays out. There’s a fearlessness to Murphy’s film-making, a slightly wayward, maverick spirit. I can’t wait to see what she does next.  Babyteeth is on release in cinemas now"
"Whether you’ve managed to briefly get away from home or remained in a state of semi-lockdown, nobody has had exactly the summer they planned in 2020. And while we can all bemoan things we’ve missed out on in this lost season, it’s hard not to feel most for the young: summer, after all, is when kids are supposed to discover themselves and each other in an environment of balmy, untrammelled freedom. Pending the return of that, there are plenty of coming-of-age movies out there to remind us what a youthful summer is supposed to be like. With little fanfare, Netflix is premiering one of the best recent ones this week. Rebecca Zlotowski’s lovely An Easy Girl (2019) sees the talented French film-maker rallying from the disappointment of her murky Natalie Portman-starring misfire The Summoning and returning breezily to basics. A softly sensuous mood piece, positively drenched in twinkly Côte d’Azur sunlight, it follows working-class 16-year-old Naïma (Mina Farid, a winning newcomer) as she spends a Cannes summer vacation in thrall to her older, richer, impossibly glamorous cousin Sofia (Zahia Dehar). This isn’t a glossy wish-fulfilment exercise, as complexities of sexuality, misogyny and class tension drift into our wide-eyed heroine’s idyllic setup. Zlotowski gives her film a keen moral conscience, testing Naïma’s preconceptions of what adult liberation really involves, but that doesn’t impede the film’s ripe, sunburned appreciation of beachy, bodily pleasure. It feels like a 90-minute holiday in itself. The French have form in this genre: over at Mubi, you can find Catherine Corsini’s sweet, earthy Summertime (2015), a rural lesbian romance that also carries an aching autumnal undertow of regret. And Céline Sciamma’s Tomboy (2011) remains my favourite in her formidable filmography, deftly turning the summer’s possibilities for unrestricted self-reinvention toward a compassionate, deeply perceptive study of gender identity. As a 10-year-old girl who experiments with presenting as a boy to new friends over the course of a summer, Zoé Héran gives one of the most astonishing performances by a child in all cinema. Hasten to Amazon Prime or the Mubi Library if you’ve never seen it. Françoise Sagan’s 1954 novel Bonjour Tristesse, of course, represents the ultimate in sun-streaked, Gallic coming-of-age melancholy, though Hollywood beat the French to filming it. Otto Preminger’s 1958 film (available on YouTube) doesn’t quite capture the novel’s pain, but it is so peachily gorgeous, and young Jean Seberg so exquisitely ingenuous as its tragic young heroine, that it’s irresistible all the same. Americans, blessed as they are with impossibly endless summer holidays, know this genre inside out, and it’s yielded any number of perennially repeated audience favourites, from the bubblegum joys of 1987’s Dirty Dancing (on iTunes) to the more solemn boy’s own journey of Stand By Me (1986; via the Microsoft Store) to the doll’s house adorability of Wes Anderson’s pre-teen runaway romp Moonrise Kingdom (2012; on YouTube). Back in the 1970s, Summer of ’42 (on Amazon) was a vastly popular weepie, the sentimental appeal of its seasonal romance between a teenage boy and a young war bride amplified by Michel Legrand’s swooning, Oscar-winning score. You hear little talk of it these days, but it’s a sumptuous relic. Director Robert Mulligan revisited the genre to winsome effect in the 1990s: with its painful adolescent lessons learned over the course of a sweltering midcentury Louisiana summer, The Man in the Moon (Amazon, again) is familiar stuff, but memorable for an absolute heartbreaker of a debut performance by a 15-year-old Reese Witherspoon. If you prefer your deep south summers a little less dewy, Kasi Lemmons’s marvellous Eve’s Bayou (1997; on YouTube) is the modern classic to seek out, with its piquant evocation of messy adult relationships and strong black community through a 10-year-old’s impressionable eyes. Spike Lee’s ever-underrated Crooklyn (1994; on Google Play) is one of his most affecting films, a study of fractious family life in his favoured Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood, against the backdrop of one sticky-hot summer. Brooklyn likewise forms a tough, moody backdrop to Eliza Hittman’s Beach Rats (on Netflix), in which the jobless, shapeless sprawl of the season encourages a possibly closeted teenager into anxious sexual experimentation. It was released at the same time as Call Me By Your Name (2017; on Amazon), in which a 17-year-old has a rather more halcyon gay awakening under the Italian sun, channelling the swooning first love experienced in Florence by Englishwoman abroad Lucy Honeychurch in Merchant-Ivory’s rapturous 1985 A Room With a View (Google Play). If you’re feeling holiday envy, these films won’t exactly cure it, but you can bask in their residual glow. Young Ahmed (Curzon Home Cinema) Critics were divided on the Dardenne brothers’ new film at Cannes last year, though they still won a best director prize. It’s a poised, intelligent study of a 13-year-old Muslim boy drawn into extremism, but it lacks the social conviction of their best work. Locarno film festival 2020 (via their website) The avant-garde Swiss film festival would normally be unrolling its full physical edition this week, but has assembled an impressive on-demand programme, including an international selection of new shorts and past festival classics from the likes of Michael Haneke, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Edward Yang. Story of a Love Affair (Cult Films, PG) Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1950 debut film has been beautifully restored for Blu-ray and digital download. A strikingly modernist blend of James M Cain-style noir and Italian neorealism, it’s more tautly disciplined than many of the director’s later works. Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (StudioCanal, PG) This bodacious teen fantasy was already dated the second it premiered in 1989, but that was always its charm: now, it’s an entirely loopy time capsule, given a 4K restoration ahead of this year’s long-belated new sequel."
"There’s something exciting about a film that immerses you in the life of a creative artist, and so it proves with this documentary about Howard Ashman. He was the fiercely talented lyricist and musical-theatre wizard who ran his own off-off-Broadway producing venue in the 70s, turned Roger Corman’s Little Shop of Horrors into a mainstream stage smash, got signed up by Disney for animations such as The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast and, sadly, became the first person with Aids to get an Oscar (posthumously). It’s moving to see Ashman rehearsing his song Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid, and to see how it relates to his own unforgotten childhood when he yearned to be part of the magical world of show business. Ashman set a standard of flair, invention and Broadway-style showmanship in Disney lyrics that continues to this day. Where I disagree (heretically) with the film is suspecting that Disney wasn’t necessarily a great career move for Ashman. Until he went to California to work in animation, Ashman was a live-theatre guy who had a punky masterpiece with Little Shop of Horrors and a body of very highly regarded, challenging work. But he had a bruising flop with his Broadway musical version of the Miss America pageant movie Smile in 1986, co-written with Marvin Hamlisch, which might have soured him on the live stage. The film quotes Ashman saying that “the last great place to do Broadway musicals is animation”. Maybe. Certainly, Disney offered a comparatively risk-free world, more so than rolling the dice on a Broadway show that could be killed by a single snarky New York Times review. Who could blame Ashman for choosing the bulletproof world of Disney? But what if Smile had worked out? Could Ashman have developed on the path of mature projects on Broadway? Could he maybe have addressed the Aids crisis head-on? And might not that have been more interesting than The Little Mermaid etc? A sacrilegious thought."
"Norwegian filmmaker André Øvredal turned Hollywood heads in 2011 with his local folkloric fantasy Troll Hunter. So it must irk him that the definitive movie franchise about the Old Norse gods has been made by Americans, with an Australian for its star. Reclaiming Thor from the cultural appropriators may be a noble cause, but that’s no guarantee of victory. In the mountains of Norway’s picturesque Odda region, a mysteriously powerful traveller named Eric (Nat Wolff) has been hiding out since his suspected involvement in a fatal arson attack three years ago. He emerges to forage for supplies in town and, after accidentally-on-purpose killing a local teen bully, he’s arrested by police chief Henrik (Per Frisch), an officer far too kindly and sober to ever make it in the mean streets of Nordic noir. Henrik calls in young psychologist Christina (Iben Akerlie) to evaluate the stranger and, as a highly predictable romance develops, she intuits that Eric’s electromagnetic outbursts are rooted in his psychic turmoil. Only when he understands the latter will he be able to master the former – the usual adolescent X-Men neuroses, then. Christina slots in as the all-forgiving woman of bottomless compassion who dedicates herself to helping Eric hold it in and, when he doesn’t quite manage – which is often – cleaning up his mess afterwards. The modest visual effects, which mostly consist of distant lighting bolts and gathering storm clouds, can do little to elevate this potty-training-for-the-patriarchy narrative. Until Thor’s hammer turns up, it’s basically the Weather Channel. All of which goes to show that subtitles and scenery can’t make a formulaic superhero movie any more interesting. The natural wonders of the Odda Valley are just no match for the computer-generated wonders of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"In a German film studio amid a half-built set, documentarian-turned-feature director Vera (Judith Engel) is trying to pull together a remake of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1972 film The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant. This adaptation of Fassbinder’s own play, now considered a queer classic, featured an all-female cast orbiting around the manipulative titular protagonist. However, Vera wants to recast the crucial role of Karin with a male star, which would entirely change the sexual dynamics of the story. Whether she’ll manage to pull it off looks increasingly doubtful as agencies, TV commissioners and producers jostle over the final casting decisions, and a series of moderately known (in Germany) female actors come in to screen test for the role of Petra, each one mildly put out that they’re being asked to audition in the first place instead of being offered the role on her reputation alone. Gradually it emerges that the protagonist of this particular subplot is not one of these grand dames but actor-for-hire Gerwin (Andreas Lust), a gay man hired to read the lines for the Karl/Karin character. Something about the cliquey vibe of the film set, the evenings boozing with the straight tech dudes and the proximity to making art again lures Gerwin back in. Vera is impressed with some of his screen-test performances and there’s a chance she might just hire him instead of the young star they all thought was locked in. Writer-director Nicolas Wackerbarth (with co-screenwriter Hannes Held), best known for his own work as an actor, certainly captures the fetid atmosphere, fragile and bullish egos and comic-tragic gamesmanship of film sets. The choice of this particular Fassbinder story, with its abundant backbiting and bitchiness, is all the more apt. Nevertheless, Wackerbarth is no Fassbinder and the drab, handheld realism here lacks the flair of the film to which it alludes – although Lust gives a complex, layered performance at the centre."
"Patrick Stewart plays a renowned concert pianist named Henry Cole who has become wracked with anxiety about performing in this location-skimming yet curiously inert drama from first-time director Claude Lalonde. Luckily for Henry, an encounter with perfectly coiffed, perpetually soigné music journalist Helen Morrison (Katie Holmes, gamely trying to claw her career back from an early grave) revives his love of life and ability to give back to audiences and acolytes. While a May-December romance chastely blossoms between Henry and Helen, Henry’s flamboyantly fluttery agent-manager Paul (Giancarlo Esposito, playing very much against his Breaking Bad persona) lends further emotional support and mincing line readings from the sidelines. Despite the fact that the characters are perpetually jaunting off to the Swiss Alps and other romantic haut-bourgie locations, this is one of those films where nothing much seems to happen at all. Beethoven’s last piano sonatas play a key role in the story, so it’s fitting that the tempo throughout is a moderately slow adagio: stately but lulling. Indeed, the music is the best thing here and the film does a decent job of convincing us that Stewart himself is really playing, even if we all know he isn’t. Whoever is playing does a bang-up job, and the background of piano-tickling throughout, including many trills and arpeggios, is easy to tune into over the vapid dialogue. Stewart seems to be sleepwalking his way through this, falling back on his sonorous voice to do the heavy dramatic lifting while poor Holmes struggles with a character so beatifically written, I was expecting her to be revealed as a figment of Henry’s imagination."
"A galaxy of major names – including Thierry Henry, Arsène Wenger and Didier Drogba – line up to chip in their two-penn’orth on one of the great footballing enigmas of modern times: Nicolas Anelka, the mercurial boy wonder who burst out of the Parisian banlieues but will probably linger longest in the collective memory for triggering a player strike at the 2010 World Cup and flashing the quenelle salute, widely regarded as an ansemitic gesture, after scoring a goal for West Brom in 2013. But there’s a bit more to this than your standard sporting hagiography: Anelka comes with a lot of baggage, and this film from French director Franck Nataf does its best to get stuck into some comparatively heavy material. We start at the beginning, when Anelka was a fresh-faced young shaver tearing it up in the local park, before being airlifted into the elite Clairefontaine national youth academy, where Henry was one of his peers. As we follow Anelka’s long march through Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal, Real Madrid and so on, the film frequently dodges back to his low-key, apparently idyllic new life in Dubai – though not so low-key that he doesn’t chew out his son for not training hard enough, or not going in for the kill in a family game of footvolley. There are a few glimpses of Anelka’s startling on-pitch talent but everyone knows that’s not the story here. Throughout his career Anelka attracted trouble, and much of the film’s running time is given over to letting him have his say. In a calm, measured voice, he explains why he walked away from PSG as a teenager, how it all went wrong at Real, why he felt stitched up at Liverpool, what it felt like to miss the crucial penalty in the 2008 Champions League final. Anelka doesn’t shy away from the really controversial stuff, either: he hotly refutes any suggestion of antisemitism over the quenelle incident, and repeatedly denies he uttered the words he is alleged to have said to France coach Raymond Domenech in 2010 that saw him excluded from the squad and initiated the player walkout and the team’s on-pitch humiliation at the hands of South Africa. The film very much takes Anelka’s denials at face value – failing, for example, to point out that at the time he was happy to endorse the notorious quenelle populariser and comedian Dieudonné – but even so, this is a subtle, modulated portrait of someone who gives little away. Knuckling down never seemed to be part of the programme; Anelka, you feel, is the kind of short-fuse customer who conceals a basic fragility. He is happy to acknowledge the mistakes he made as a young player; the progress of his football life, however, demonstrated that he never managed to learn enough to prevent it happening again."
"In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all There is a debate that has raged for decades. One that cleaves whole families in two. A conundrum so fundamental to what it is that makes us human that it divides not only nations, but the populace of an entire planet. That planet is Earth – this planet – and the question in question is this question: did Jack really have to die to save Rose at the end of Titanic? Or is Rose a despicable, door-hogging monster? These are murky waters, dear reader.  This isn’t the first time that someone has sought answers. In 2013, pop-science show MythBusters attempted to nix it once and for all, concluding that, yes, Rose could have scooched over a bit, and Jack would have lived dishily ever after. But only if Rose had removed her lifejacket and given it to Jack to tie it beneath the portion of door he would then be occupying. Otherwise, they would have faced the single biggest threat to makeshift, flotsam-based lifeboats: wobbliness. Nevertheless, MythBusters heralded that particular myth Busted, and Rose’s good name was henceforth for ever tarnished. So … Solved? Not exactly. There’s more to life on driftwood in the north Atlantic than simple wobbliness. Firstly, the debris wasn’t actually a door at all, but a chunk of oak door frame, according to comparisons made to actual wreckage recovered from the ship. And it was certainly big enough in terms of surface area to accommodate both bodies: Leo’s height is 183cm, Kate’s is 169cm; the shoulder width of the average man is 39.6cm and a woman’s is 36.7cm, forming a body warmth-sharing total of 76.3cm. According to a deep dive done by Physics Central, Rose’s raft was 183cm x 91cm. Room to spare, then. But what this doesn’t take into account is buoyancy. The boating boffins at Physics Central discovered that a piece of oak of that size and thickness has a weight (volume x density x gravity) of 1,920 newtons. The couple’s weights at the time – which are apparently discoverable if you look hard enough – are 715N for Leo and 549N for Kate. That’s a combined bulk of 3,184N. In ice-cold salt water, oak in those dimensions would give an upward buoyant force of 2,490N. You don’t need a white coat and bushy eyebrows to know that 3,184 is bigger than 2,490, and Jack, Rose and one quite intricately carved piece of wood are therefore sinkier than Armitage Shanks. What about the lifejacket theory, though? What if Rose did the honourable thing and gave hers up? In water that cold (around -2.2 celsius at the time of the boat’s sinking), Jack would be unconscious within 15 minutes of first going in – and he’d already been in there for a fair old while before even getting round to trying to affix a lifejacket to a bobbing piece of wood. More importantly, even modern lifejackets top out at a buoyancy of 275N, which still leaves our pair a full 419N over. In other words, after all that faffing about, they’d sink anyway. So there you have it: for Jack, it was either push Rose in or sacrifice himself. Whether he made the right call there is up to you. "
"Johnny Depp has accused his ex-wife of “building a dossier” from early in their relationship as an “insurance policy for later”. The high court heard details of an email written by Amber Heard to the star, which was never sent, in which she compared him to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The email was read out in court on the second day of Depp’s libel action against the Sun over an article that labelled him a “wife beater” and referred to “overwhelming evidence” that he attacked Heard, 34, during their relationship, which he denies. In response to the email, Depp, giving evidence in the three-week trial, said it appeared that “Ms Heard was building a dossier very early on that appears to be an insurance policy for later”. In the email read out in court by Sasha Wass QC for NGN, Heard wrote, “Half of you I love madly, the other half scares me.” The drinking and drugs assured her she was “dealing with the monster”, she wrote. She added: “Yesterday, I saw you pass out, amongst vomiting 3 times. All 3 times Jerry had to carry you from the floor. On the plane Nathan mentioned how many times he’s had to break into locked doors to wake you up, after passing out in the toilet. You would have embarrassed yourself countless times if someone would be honest enough to tell you. To show you. If someone filmed you while you were in this state, you would be mortified. It’s embarrassing just watching it happen. You can’t know because people (friends?) keep smiling to your face and then turning their heads and rolling their eyes at how ridiculous they feel at picking a grown man up from his own piss and vomit, knowing he’ll never be able to realise how bad he looks.” The email continued: “I have no reason I have to stay with you. And I won’t. You don’t pay me. I don’t have to lie to you for my job, livelihood or kids. I will never want to be locked into you.” She said she had “watched you [Depp] pass out cold on the floor, after drinking yourself sick. One of these times you cut yourself so badly that you needed stitches.” Of those who protected him, she said: “If they left you, on the floor in your own shit, locked in the bathroom while you missed work – then you might have to actually learn. Learn to take care of yourself. You think you’re so tough, big self-destruction – I-don’t-give-a-fuck man?!? Bullshit.” Describing him as a “needy man-child”, she added: “I watch as other grown men have to wipe you, basically. And you get the convenient benefit of never having to remember it. That’s nice. For you.” She concluded: “I feel like the biggest idiot in the world. I have put up with so much. I have cleaned shit, vomit and piss up both literally and figuratively. I have been accused of crazy shit – some of which I deserved – only to never hear an apology for your booze-fuelled zeal. You have hit me repeated. Something you should Never have done. What a fucking man you are. And NONE of this would be possible without the booze and drugs. NONE”"
"Saroj Khan, a top Bollywood choreographer, has died in a Mumbai hospital, her family has announced. She was 71. The three-time National Award winner was hospitalised last Saturday after she complained of breathlessness. She tested negative for Covid-19, the Press Trust of India news agency said, and died early on Friday. Khan choreographed more than 2,000 songs in her career spanning more than 40 years. Leading actresses including Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi danced to some of the most popular songs Khan produced. Bollywood paid tribute to an icon of its industry. Actor Akshay Kumar said Khan made dance look easy, almost like anybody can do it. “A huge loss for the industry,” Kumar tweeted. Khan started her acting career at the age of three in a Bollywood film. In the 1950s, she became a back-up dancer, appearing in films like Bimal Roy’s Madhumati, where she was choreographed by dance director B Sohanlal, whom she later married. She later shifted to choreography and got her break in 1974 in the film Geeta Mera Naam. She never looked back and created some of Bollywood’s most popular film songs. She won acclaim for songs in movies like Mr India – where she choreographed Bollywood star Sridevi in the iconic song Hawa Hawai – as well as Chandni, Beta, Tezaab, and Gulab Gang. In her later years, known popularly as Masterji, she appeared as a judge on reality television dancing shows and helped popularise Bollywood-style dance outside India. Khan was buried in a Mumbai cemetery on Friday, her nephew Manish Jagwani told reporters. She is survived by her second husband Sardar Roshan Khan and three children. "
"Even in the anarchic heyday of the Marx brothers at Paramount Pictures, when they turned out vaudevillian free-for-alls such as Horse Feathers and Duck Soup, or Mel Brooks parodies like Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, audiences had never encountered the sheer volume of gags that hit them in Airplane!, which are so relentless that the bad ones don’t have time to develop an odor. There are puns, pratfalls, provocations, foreground/background dynamics, double entendres, references to film and TV and popular commercials, random acts of silliness and absurdity, and every possible strain of what would later be categorized as a “dad joke”. Even at 40, when a handful of the references and bits have grown whiskers, Airplane! still absolutely kills. Rarely has a film so eager to please been so successful in doing so. And yet, as easy as it might be to tally up 87 minutes of laughs or marvel at the high batting average of its creative team – David and Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams, better known as Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker (ZAZ) – the non-jokes are a key part of what makes it work. That may sound like asking jazz aficionados to listen between the notes, but the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team understood (at the time, anyway) that a good comedy needs a straight man, and they found one in Zero Hour!, a largely forgotten 1957 drama that served as a primary source of inspiration. And not a source like Top Gun would be to the Abrahams solo projects Hot Shots! and Hot Shots! Part Deux, but the entire foundation on which the comedy would rest. Though Airplane! riffs on the Airport series (particularly Airport 1975) and Irwin Allen disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, it’s a straight-up remake of Zero Hour!, with just a little spin on the ball. Key elements are exactly the same: a hero named Ted Stryker, a former second world war fighter pilot still haunted by the six comrades killed because of a decision he made in combat. A flight he catches at the last minute to win back a woman who’s left him a “Dear John” note. An illness that sweeps through the airplane cabin, debilitating all the passengers who ordered fish instead of meat, including the pilot and the co-pilot. Stryker getting called up to steer the plane to safety, guided on the ground by the no-nonsense captain who was his superior during the war. Not only are some of lines repeated verbatim, but tiny details survive, too, like Stryker’s refusal to stay in the air another two hours until the stormy weather clears, or the ridiculous geysers of sweat that pour down his face as he approaches the landing. Much of the fun of Airplane! comes from Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker’s instinct that just the tone of an average 1957 melodrama would sound funny in 1980, when a more naturalistic style of acting and screenwriting had fully taken over the industry. When the Stryker in Airplane!, stewing bitterly about the pilots who died under his command, says a line like, “A lot of people had plans before the war. Like George Zipp,” it’s hilarious in 1980 (and 2020) in a way it might not have been in 1957. The film goes off on crazier tangents, but often it doesn’t need to depart from Zero Hour! much at all. There’s no better example of the ZAZ approach to the spoof than the casting of Leslie Nielsen as Dr Rumack, the onboard physician who tends to the sick passengers while giving Stryker the occasional pep talk. Though Nielsen had appeared briefly in Kentucky Fried Movie, the anthology comedy ZAZ wrote before Airplane!, he spent the first 25 years of his career as a character actor for film and television, with appearances in Forbidden Planet and the Poseidon Adventure, but nothing that made him a name. His gravitas is all that Airplane! needs in that role, as if he were a time traveler ported in from another cinematic era and not told he was in a comedy. As Nielsen became more self-aware in future ZAZ productions and other spoofs, the effect was diminished. Robert Hays and the wonderful Julie Hagerty play it straight, too, as Stryker and his stewardess girlfriend Elaine, whose love story is dreamily recalled in flashbacks that nod to Saturday Night Fever and From Here to Eternity. Watching Airplane! multiple times, the jokes that stand out tend to be the ones where ZAZ have an idea that’s so outrageously labored, it’s funny just to think about how much they were straining for a laugh. There’s the names, for one, like the “Who’s On First?” confusion of populating the cockpit with men named Oveur, Roger, and Victor (“Over, Oveur. Roger, Roger. What’s your vector, Victor?”), or having Oveur carry on separate phone conversations with someone from the Mayo Clinic and another gentlemen with the surname Ham (“Give me Ham on five, hold the Mayo”). But there’s effort beyond all sorts of other bits, too: the escalation of the fight between parking zone announcers (“You want me to have an abortion!”), the stunt-casting of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ethel Merman, the willfully idiotic wordplay (“Surely you can’t be serious?” “I am serious, and don’t call me ‘Shirley’”). Not all of Airplane! is timeless, but the “dated” aspects of the film can cut both ways. From the vantage of 2020, we might cringe at the racial comedy of two black men speaking in subtitled “jive”, or Stryker teaching “the Malombo tribe” to play basketball, but it doesn’t matter that Airplane! parodies airplane disaster movies that few have ever seen or references a coffee commercial from the early 70s or Elaine throwing an era-specific Tupperware party for the Malombo women (“This two-quart Seals-M-Rite container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days”). The same goes for future ZAZ classics like Top Secret! and The Naked Gun: rooting a spoof in genre obscurities from Hollywood past turns the absence of timeliness into a secret virtue. That’s the lesson that later spoof series like Scary Movie or other execrable Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer team-ups like Date Movie or Meet the Spartans never learned. Airplane! does have a few riffs on hits like Jaws and Saturday Night Fever, but it doesn’t give itself over to lazy business of re-staging scenes from the latest blockbusters with the slightest (and often grossest) of twists. It’s weird. It’s unexpected. It’s absurd. And it never pauses for a laugh, because there’s always another one coming."
"There have been film festivals for more than seven decades. In that time, they have been great at telling the story of cinema, but they are everywhere now, and too many of them are similar. They need to innovate a bit, dream a bit. The Palace of Westminster, London. A 100-day film festival, which starts with one 57-second film. Each day, two more are added. No red carpet, no VIP area. Alice Guy-Blaché’s 57-second silent film L’Avenue de l’Opéra is screened on a loop in one of the old parliament’s prestigious rooms. In another room, we hear a 45-minute song by the great Egyptian singer Oum Kalthoum. Somewhere in a third, more distant, room, Billy Fury’s song Halfway to Paradise plays. It’s free, and people simply show up and wander around. From day one, the kitchens are open and free food is available. Or people can bring and make their own. The 57-second film and the music continue to play, but on day two more films are added. They are chosen by the Indian economist Amartya Sen and Dolly Parton. Each sent a bedsheet to the festival, and the films are projected on to them in other rooms. Other elements are added in other rooms: radio interviews with Marlon Brando and Lena Horne, the music of the Scottish band Altered Images and the soundtrack of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. On day three, films chosen by Robert Pattinson and Awkwafina are added. Again, they are projected on to bedsheets they supplied. The songs of the Brazilian musician and philosopher Tigana Santanà begin to play in another room, and we hear a long interview with Bette Davis. On day four, the French thinker and writer Hélène Cixous chooses her favourite north African film, and a film selected by Cher plays. Albert Lamorisse’s The Red Balloon and Jafar Panahi’s Iranian film The White Balloon are also added. The films, songs and interviews repeat and repeat. Films selected by members of the public are also added. In the main debating chamber, Ritwik Ghatak’s The Cloud-Capped Star, about the partition of Bengal and consequential refugees, plays on a huge screen. The daily additions are never announced. Each one is a surprise. The selectors send video messages or are there in person. Hundreds, and then thousands, of people show up every day, to see the place, its transformation, its millefeuille of films, music and sounds. The room that shows Astrid Henning-Jensen’s Palle Alone in the World, about a small boy who has the world to himself, is full of wonder. Next to it, Peter Ramsey, the co-director of Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, has chosen his favourite animations. Judi Dench and Thandie Newton are in conversation, and then serve fish pie. Ryan Coogler and the Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi choose the 49th and 50th films. In one of the rooms, unannounced, is the premiere of a new short film by Steven Soderbergh. Also embedded in the labyrinth are premieres by Pedro Almodóvar and Apichatpong Weerasethakul. People dance in three different rooms. Each day, six roving cameras livestream Halfway to Paradise, capturing its sounds, films, visitors, rooms, adventures. On the 100th day, a team of film fans cleans the kitchen and, one by one, switches off the music, audio and 199 films. The palace goes quiet except for one film, which will play there for ever: Mohammad-Ali Talebi’s Bag of Rice, about a determined little girl’s adventure across a city. Halfway to Paradise moves to another city, another major building."
"The Sydney Daily Telegraph will have to pay the actor Geoffrey Rush a record $2.9m in damages after the tabloid lost its appeal against a historic defamation ruling. The newspaper and its publisher, Nationwide News – part of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire – had challenged an Australian federal court decision from April 2019 that found claims conveyed in two of its news articles from 2017 that the Oscar winner had behaved inappropriately towards a colleague were not credible. On Thursday the full court of the federal court upheld the 2019 ruling that the articles portrayed the actor as a sexual predator and “pervert” in detailing his behaviour towards a co-star during the 2015-16 run of the Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear. One of the Daily Telegraph articles the court found was defamatory included the headline “King Leer” below a picture of Rush. While the original news report did not name the alleged victim, Eryn Jean Norvill, who played the role of Cordelia (the daughter of Rush’s King Lear), later gave evidence during the original defamation trial, telling the court Rush had deliberately touched her breast during a live performance without consent. Rush has denied these claims. Ben English, the editor of the Daily Telegraph, said he was “very disappointed” by Thursday’s decision, warning that the outcome of the original case and the appeal “exposes the inadequacies of Australia’s defamation laws and heightens the need for urgent legislative reform to enable public debate and to encourage women to come forward with their concerns”. In addition to agreeing with the original judgment that all of the defamatory imputations claimed by Rush’s lawyers were conveyed by the news reports, and that the Daily Telegraph had failed to show that the allegations were true, Thursday’s appeal decision also found the damages and interest amount of $2,872,753 to be awarded to Rush had been an “optimistic” calculation, given “the ferocity, and the unrefined responses of the #MeToo movement”. The amount, which considered how Rush’s tarnished reputation would limit future work for him, comprised “non-economic loss including aggravated damages” of $850,000, “past economic loss including pre judgement interest” of $1,060,773, “future economic loss” of $919,678 and “pre judgement interest on the non-economic loss” of $42,302. While the Daily Telegraph had claimed these estimations were “manifestly excessive”, and disagreed that it would take two years after the original judgment of defamation before Rush’s “earning capacity” would be restored, the full court dismissed these claims. Despite rejecting the appeal, justices Jacqueline Gleeson, Richard White and Michael Wheelahan did agree with elements of the Daily Telegraph’s appeal submission, notably that the justice who oversaw the original defamation trial, Michael Wigney, “attached significance to positive statements made” by Norvill about Rush in promotional interviews for King Lear. Wigney had said the positive comments from Norvill, that Rush was “just forever playful” and “very cheeky”, undermined the evidence she gave as testimony of his inappropriate behaviour during the trial. “In that context it would have been natural for Ms Norvill to make positive statements about performing with him, whatever her private feelings,” Thursday’s judgment said. “In our view, Ms Norvill’s conduct in the interviews is equally consistent with the circumstance that the conduct she described had occurred but with her suppressing or subordinating her own personal feelings to the ‘corporate’ interest in promoting the performance of King Lear,” the justices wrote. But they went on to note that “there was a good deal of other evidence ... which indicated that there was a positive relationship between” the two in the lead-up to the production, including from testimonies of other actors who gave evidence during the trial. The justices also said they did not think Wigney had based his ultimate conclusion on Norvill’s comments made during the promotional interviews. The appeal judges also agreed with Wigney’s decision to reject the Daily Telegraph’s request to include evidence from the actor Yael Stone during the original trial, who accused Rush of harassment while working on a different production. English, who was not the editor of the Daily Telegraph when the articles were published in 2017, also said he had hoped the full court would “reverse Justice Wigney’s findings as to the credibility of Eryn Jean Norvill or reverse His Honour’s decision to exclude the testimony of Yael Stone”. “We support both women in their decision to share their complaints,” English said. “We will continue to report on the issues such as these which are of great concern to the Australian public. As stated by High Court Chief Justice Susan Kiefel last week, there is no place for sexual harassment in any workplace.”"
"Netflix’s once heavily guarded vault of secret statistics has slowly opened up over the last couple of years, a gradual juicy reveal of viewer habits with some major caveats. While the streamer still refrains from subscribing to any official, independently measured ratings service, such as Nielsen, tweets and company updates have shared the numbers behind particular success stories and more recently the site added film and TV specific top 10s, updated every day. But the platform still only shares data when it’s positive and the data is based on a viewer now only watching at least two minutes of a title (compared with the previous measurement of 70%). This week after a quarterly earnings call, the site’s 10 biggest ever original film hits were revealed to Bloomberg, an intriguing dump of information that tells us as much about what isn’t included as it does about what is. Two things to note: the following stats refer to the first four weeks of release and while post-reveal, Netflix has now claimed its new graphic novel adaptation The Old Guard will reach 72m households within its first four weeks, it’s only been out for 10 days so it’s not being included here. While the success of the Chris Hemsworth-led Bangladesh-set action thriller Extraction is an impressive win for all involved (a sequel is on the way), it’s one that needs a certain amount of couching. The film, which sees the Thor star play a black market mercenary, was launched on 24 April this year, a date that has theatrically become known as the start of the summer season (last year Avengers: Endgame was released on the 22nd), a prime slot that this year, with cinemas closed, drove blockbuster-seekers online. Over a month into lockdown, with Netflix viewership inevitably soaring, the arrival of a snazzy new release was transformed into a major event. The combination of a star name and an action-heavy premise would surely have made Extraction a hit regardless but the scale of its numbers reflects an audience craving flashy escapism during a difficult time. It remains a huge turning point for Hemsworth, though, who has struggled outside of the Marvel universe (his many flops include Rush, Men in Black: International, Ghostbusters, Bad Times at the El Royale, Blackhat and In the Heart of the Sea) and together with the success of Chris Evans’ Apple drama Defending Jacob (reportedly their second-biggest show to date), it suggests that our more newly crowned A-listers would be wise to stick to streaming. Bird Box, the OG Netflix hit, the platform’s first genuine blockbuster, the film that launched a thousand memes and a head-smashingly stupid viral challenge, should technically be at the top of this list. Back when it was released, in December 2018, a view still required a user to have consumed at least 70% of the title, meaning that however you spin it, more people watched more of Sandra Bullock’s high-concept thriller than they did Extraction. It remains a fascinating case study not just because of the number itself but because of the short-lived pop culture phenomenon that followed and in just a couple of weeks it became the most talked about film of the year, for better or worse. The combination of a snappy premise (easily explained in a quick homepage tease), a smart release date (kids on Christmas holiday, families together needing something to watch) and the long-running star power of Bullock gave the film a propulsion that we’ve still not seen replicated since. Released on 6 March this year, just before we were all forced indoors, the Mark Wahlberg caper Spenser Confidential was a perfectly, if unintentionally, timed hit, a film that seemed on first glance to offer the high-octane, high-budget action we were all starting to miss on the big screen. Its ultimate cheapness (like many Netflix originals, it’s really just a flatly made TV movie) and subpar quality didn’t affect its huge numbers, again undeniably bolstered by an extremely captive audience. Its another case of the right star paired with the right genre and Wahlberg has long nurtured a loyal audience with many of his action-heavy big screen outings. That power has waned in recent years but the substantial number of viewers who turned up for him here show that again, his star has by no means dimmed, it’s just more effective outside of the multiplex. Wahlberg has smartly signed on for a sequel as well as engineered himself another Netflix franchise in the shape of Our Man From New Jersey, described as a blue-collar 007. Continuing what’s now a pretty glaringly winning formula of big stars matched with big action released at a time when audiences are extra eager for something to watch, is a win for Michael Bay’s frenetic franchise-starter 6 Underground. Led by Ryan Reynolds, who post-Deadpool has found himself to be not only a bankable leading man again but a reliably efficient one-man marketing machine, the film was mostly loathed by critics but at-home viewership was considerable, turning it into a major hit last December. His Twitter presence was a definite cause of his satirical superhero success and it also helped push this to big numbers in a month that’s now a desirable slot for the platform’s bigger projects. Last summer, as many of us bemoaned the fall of the movie star, with A-listers flopping on the big screen, Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler showed that their fans hadn’t disappeared, they were just staying home instead. Murder Mystery, a goofy comedy about a couple caught up in a conspiracy while on holiday, quickly became one of the platform’s biggest hits, easily outpacing Sandler’s other Netflix projects. The actor, who has since been met with his best reviews to date for Uncut Gems, signed a considerable deal with Netflix five years ago, arguably the first major big-screen actor to understand the long-term benefits of partnering with a streaming platform. Murder Mystery has been by far his biggest film with the streamer, a sign of the huge fanbase that Aniston carries with her, one that’s only grown since the second life of Friends. While Netflix has successfully spent more time, and a lot more money, expanding its roster of renowned big-name directors making films aimed at creating a splash at the Oscars, viewers have tended not to show quite as much interest as Academy voters. Last October’s big dump of data showed that more people watched shoddy Lifetime-esque thriller Secret Obsession than Roma or any of the streamer’s other big awards bets to that point, none of which made a showing in its annual top 10. Before Martin Scorsese’s extravagant $159m bet The Irishman landed, Netflix conveniently changed how a view was tracked, aware that many might not make it through 70% of a 210-minute film, but it still marked a major milestone for them: a big, starry studio-quality saga that felt like a genuine event last Christmas. It remains the only awards-y title on the list. Another example here of movie star sway matched with action set pieces yet one supported by a tad more prestige than the other examples higher up on the list. JC Chandor, who found acclaim with Margin Call, All is Lost and A Most Violent Year, ironically decided to make his biggest film to date for Netflix, the sturdy Colombia-set heist thriller Triple Frontier, that used Ben Affleck’s A-list credentials to attract an impressive 63 million viewers last spring. Solidly entertaining and made with more panache than the average Netflix original, the film really did feel like a theatrical pic that viewers missed on the big screen but could watch at home instead. It’s also another reminder of how Affleck’s fanbase interacts with his work, coming just two years after his thriller The Accountant surprised pundits by becoming 2017’s most-rented film, both signs that, like many other stars on this list, the small screen might be the safest place for him in the future. The Wrong Missy, a critically loathed comedy devoid of big star names, has managed to scrape its way inside the bottom of the list thanks to the same major event that lifted three other titles: the coronavirus. Released on 13 May, two months into lockdown at a point when new films were starting to feel scarce, its 59 million viewers are less symbolic of the appeal of stars David Spade and Lauren Lapkus and more a sign of the stranglehold Netflix has had on what we’re watching this year. What many critics seem to agree on, though, is that the film works best as a decent showcase for the talents of Lapkus, a comedian known by most for her role in Orange is the New Black. Netflix has a strong track record of nurturing a stable of talent and it’s likely that we’ll see her in more of their upcoming comedies. Another quarantine success here but one that deserves a heartier pat on the back as The Platform is also the only foreign language film on the list, an impressive achievement given the streamer’s growing number of international offerings. So what attracted more people to a grim buzz-free horror than Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning Roma? The gory Spanish-language film arrived on 20 March without fanfare yet its tale of a dystopian future where people must fight over food to survive proved horribly well-timed. As the recent renewed success of Contagion has proved, many of us have been craving fiction that errs close to the reality we’re now faced with and while The Platform is a more extremist vision than most, it still offered enough claustrophobic paranoia to touch a nerve. The streamer’s nifty continuing attempt to resurrect the teen movie, after it mostly disappeared on the big screen, has led to a number of big successes and while on first glance, last April’s The Perfect Date might seem like an odd inclusion here, it’s one that requires some explanation. The previous summer saw Netflix score big with To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, The Kissing Booth and Sierra Burgess is a Loser and while they might have ultimately reached a higher number (To All the Boys allegedly reached 80 million), this was over an extended amount of time. The release of The Perfect Date, starring Noah Centineo who appeared in two of the aforementioned teen hits, the following year came when he was now a Netflix star and when the teen comedy was a popular genre on the platform. The number is then reflective of its first month of release, as the film became part of sleepover movie rotation. It proves yet again that the platform can effectively make and sustain stars (Centineo now has more than 19 million Instagram followers thanks to streaming alone) although their sway outside of Netflix remains questionable."
"In the dog days of the second world war, John Huston travelled to the Mason general hospital in Brentwood, Long Island, to shoot a documentary about a group of wounded soldiers preparing to return to civilian life. Let There Be Light was the third commission in what sounds like an increasingly fraught partnership between the director and the US army signal corps. Huston’s first film (Report From the Aleutians) screened without incident, while his second (The Battle of San Pietro) sparked walk-outs among the military top brass during its Washington preview. But Let There Be Light hit the jackpot. It was immediately yanked and buried, and languished unseen for the next 35 years. The servicemen at Mason general are all suffering from PTSD – what was known at the time as “shellshock” or “psycho-neurosis”. Shuffling down the gangplank of the troop carrier, they are farmed through eight to 10 weeks of intensive therapy before being released into their old communities. The film introduces us to a (presumably representative) cross-section of case studies: “the Man Who Could Not Walk”, “the Man Who Could Not Remember” and “the Man Who Could Not Talk”. Under hypnosis, the last of these patients recalls that he first began stumbling over the letter S because the sound stirred memories of the hiss of incoming German shells. The therapy unblocks him, like a plunger inside a backed-up sink. “Oh listen, I can talk!” he cries again and again in a rush, lying prostrate and near tears on the psychiatrist’s couch. Huston and his crew spent several months at Mason general and shot over 70 hours of footage from the individual counselling sessions. He set up the two cameras as one would frame a traditional dialogue scene so as to give these exchanges a dynamic, performative quality. Huston later suggested that the patients who responded best to the treatment were the ones who agreed to be filmed; who were open to the experience and who learned to love the cameras. “It made me realise that the primary ingredient in psychological health is love,” he said. “The ability to give love and to receive it.” The US army did not love Huston’s film. Intended to reassure prospective employers about the emotional state of America’s homecoming heroes, it was swiftly judged to be too alarming, too distressing to be brought out in polite society and was effectively banned until 1981. The director put its withdrawal down to the army’s rigid adherence to what he called “the warrior myth”: the insistence that men who went to war returned somehow stronger in body and spirit. Let There Be Light exposed the warrior myth for the corrosive lie that it was. Viewed today, the film’s a fascinating timepiece. Treatments that would have looked sensitive and nuanced in the mid-1940s now seem spectacularly blunt, a hurried bodge job of Rorschach blots and drug-induced regressions that combine to cure what the film refers to as “the submerged lesions of the mind”. Tellingly, dubiously, the documentary ends with a bare-chested baseball game in the hospital grounds – the implication being that Huston’s casualties have been fixed up good as new. Possibly the film serves as a timepiece in another way, too. Paul Thomas Anderson has cited it as a crucial touchstone for his 2012 drama The Master, in which Joaquin Phoenix plays a traumatised veteran bouncing around postwar America. But I wonder if – albeit indirectly – its influence stretches back still further. Because it’s not just the camera setups that make this documentary play like a drama. It is also the tics, mannerisms and vocal patterns of its subjects. The way they fidget and chain-smoke and pluck at their clothes. The way their eyes rake the room’s corners as though in search of escape. Their anguish is real and their struggles unfeigned. But they could also be workshopping a scene at the Actors Studio in New York. At the time Huston was shooting Let There Be Light, the 22-year-old Marlon Brando was shaping up for his first lead performance, playing a troubled veteran in the stage production of Truckline Cafe (he’d later made his screen debut playing a similar role in The Men). On the other side of the country, 25-year-old Montgomery Clift was co-starring as the intense, sensitive foil to John Wayne in the western Red River. Both of these actors (along with James Dean, who came later) would go on to embody a new breed of American hero, one that was variously thwarted and vulnerable; at odds with authority and often primed to explode. Who knows? Perhaps this was a protagonist coloured and shaped by the men they had encountered on the streets of their neighbourhoods: the casualties of war, fresh out of Mason general and all the other hospitals, who would eventually find their way back in front of the cameras."
"The Hollywood careers of more than just a couple of film stars are in jeopardy this weekend as the extraordinarily dirty legal battle pitting Johnny Depp against his former wife, Amber Heard, goes into a third dramatic week – a week in which Heard’s team will be in the driving seat. The outcome of the case – a libel action being pressed by Depp – could affect many of those involved. Other big names drawn in, including Winona Ryder, Paul Bettany and Vanessa Paradis, are in danger of tainted reputations, whether they emerge as innocent bystanders or as partisan supporters. And the casts of major family film franchises, such as the Aquaman series, the Fantastic Beasts Harry Potter spin-offs and the Marvel superheroes stable of stars, may change as result. Depp is suing the publisher of the Sun, News Group Newspapers, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, for describing him as a “wife-beater” in an article from April, 2018, which questioned Warner Brothers’ decision to cast him in a Fantastic Beasts film. The 57-year-old actor, a household name after his roles as Edward Scissorhands and as Jack Sparrow in Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean series, had been served a restraining order in Los Angeles in 2016, shortly after their divorce, but he has now made headlines with allegations that it was Heard, not he, with the serious violence and alcohol problem. Notoriously, last week Heard was even accused of defecating on his bed. Heard, 34, is in London to give her version of disturbing events that led to the end of their short, high-profile marriage. Her role in the lucrative Aquaman films might be in doubt if unpleasant accusations made by Depp and his legal team stick. Legal pundits are also questioning whether media law will be permanently altered by the case. “The way the media can write about domestic violence could be changed for ever,” said one legal source. “Journalists would have believed they were clear to talk about someone as a dangerous partner when they were already named in a temporary restraining order in America.” Depp, who has retained a large fortune despite a recent legal action against the business managers he claims defrauded him of $650m, is keen to hang on to the prospect of working on adventure films. Claims and counter-claims of violence and extreme behaviour are unlikely to play well either with family audiences or with Disney and Warner Brothers studios, who own the JK Rowling franchise. In America the actor, who has admitted a history of heavy drug use and drinking, is also suing his ex-wife directly for $50m over a Washington Post article from December 2018 in which she said she was a survivor of domestic abuse. Any reader, Depp argues, would assume he was the abuser. Victory in the UK next month might help with future vindication in America. On Thursday the trial at the high court in London took an unexpected turn when Ryder, Depp’s former fiancee, and the French singing star Paradis, Depp’s former partner and the mother of his two children, did not appear to speak for him. The duo had been scheduled to appear and were not needed, but their witness statements were released to the press by the court. Both said Depp was not a violent man. “The statements from Ryder and Paradis were not part of the trial, as they were not put up for cross-examination,” the legal source added. “They appear to have been used as part of a media campaign without having to stand up in court.” The decision for them not to appear in court disappointed those looking for extra star wattage, but Heard’s legal team would have wanted News Group Newspapers’ lawyers to question these women about the terms of the end of their relationships with Depp. Heard cites 14 incidents of violence during their relationship, all of which Depp denies. Ryder is now being acclaimed for her performance in the new HBO drama The Plot Against America, following her success in the series Stranger Things. Explicit support for Depp might be a hazardous move. Three other Depp witnesses did not appear last week, although there was strong supportive testimony from some of his friends and former employees. Isaac Baruch, an artist and old friend of Depp’s who lives as his guest in a Los Angeles penthouse complex, told the court on Friday he had not seen any evidence of injury to Heard in May 2016 after the couple’s final breakup. Those in court that morning wondered if Depp might also fail to appear. The actor was late to arrive, explaining he had taken a morning film meeting in his hotel room. A court observer said this weekend: “The security team and officials at court were not happy, they have a lot to handle when the stars arrive.” Peripheral damage could also be inflicted on English-born Bettany, who plays Vision in the Marvel superhero franchise. One of Depp’s close friends, his name has come up in court due to crude messages in which Depp complained about his wife and conferred about drug use. This week Heard, appearing as a witness for NGN, is expected to try to reclaim her original accusations about her former husband. During the past week Depp’s lawyers have turned her own claims of mistreatment against her, a strategy steered by Depp’s legal adviser, the US attorney Adam Waldman. Depp’s many fans across the world are supporting his reputation and a group have turned up regularly outside court. Heard’s entourage includes her younger sister Whitney and Amber’s girlfriend Bianca Butti, along with the leading Australian lawyer Jen Robinson, friend of Amal Clooney. This week, Heard, who will speak as a witness, is likely to suggest Waldman and Depp have attempted to muddy the waters in a high stakes example of legal “gaslighting”. The case continues."
"In his first significant film role in more than a decade, Paul Hogan hobbles back on to screens in The Very Excellent Mr Dundee, looking and behaving like a bewildered dinosaur from a distant era – his career forged in a time of yore long before the existence of terms such as “cancel culture” or even “the internet”. This is not a ribbing of the legendary comedian on the basis of his age (Hogan is now 80) but rather something the film – directed by the longtime Hogan collaborator Dean Murphy – constantly leans into. In the tradition of the Crocodile Dundee movies, which plucked a rough-as-guts rube out of rural Australia and dropped him into metropolitan America, this meta-ish sort-of sequel constructs a fish-out-of-water premise, the crux of the comedy resting on temporal rather than locational displacement: Hogan is the aquatic craniate and the passing of time the rocky seas on which he has been tossed and flailed, washing up on the beach of a modern, culturally conscientious world. Skipping cinemas due to the pandemic and landing on Prime Video this week, the film (written by Murphy and Robert Mond) is about Hogan attempting to avoid “getting into trouble” (the writers are caught between viewing him with reverence and treating him like a child) after being awarded a knighthood for outstanding services to comedy. Despite being a decent bloke trying to mind his own business, you see, Hoges accidentally puts his foot in it everywhere he goes. In the film’s mildly amusing opening sequence this involves animal and sight gags – with Hogan, weak-kneed at the sight of a snake, accidentally tossing it into the face of a primary school teacher. But then the comedy gets political. The veteran performer agrees to meet with movie producers on a studio lot, who serve him a large green smoothie with mint, goat’s milk and activated walnuts – not realising the true-blue veteran would prefer something more Hogan-like, such as a Fosters and a durrie. The movie executives – one of them bobbing around on an exercise ball, because trendy – beg him to consider green-lighting another Crocodile Dundee sequel. They say they have the perfect star in mind to play his son: Will Smith. Hoges isn’t keen, the joke being that these modish woke people can’t understand why casting Smith might cause plausibility issues. This agonisingly stretched-out sequence culminates with Hogan exclaiming, “He’s black!” Murphy then cuts to the star walking away while his manager over the phone yells, “You can’t say that!” So there we have it. In a year of surprises, here’s another to add to the tally: the new Dundee is a social and political commentary, with a core message that the modern world can no longer see the forest of good old-fashioned comedy for the trees of political correctness. It took four films and more than three decades but the Crocodile Dundee series now, finally, has something substantial on its mind. Elements of The Very Excellent Mr Dundee feel like a repudiation of an opinion piece I wrote a couple of years ago, savaging aspects of the original movies – such as their blaringly obvious instances of sexism, racism and transphobia. At one point a news announcer in the new film refers to Hogan as a “disgraced racist, nun basher and former Australian legend”. The most interesting thing about it arises from Murphy and Mond’s awareness that the humour in the original movies wouldn’t fly today. Their determination to still in some way “go there” provides a mild kind of edginess, with sometimes embarrassing results (like that clanger of a Will Smith joke). Constantly painting Hogan as a victim of the modern world becomes a drag, though the film has notes of pathos that took me by surprise. Murphy makes the point that fame and fortune do not necessarily lead to happiness, a well-flogged but still salient message manifesting in Hogan’s hangdog visage and Eeyore-like demeanour. The passing of time has made the star softer and more pitiable; his deflated performance is not without its charms. There are occasional, reasonably funny moments, including Hogan accosting a terrible Dundee impersonator (Shane Jacobson) who has butchered his “that’s not a knife” gag. The point is made that time turns legends into distortions, increasingly divorced from their origins: a key theme in the great theatre production Mr Burns: A Post-Electric Play, and explored more frivolously in 1993’s Yahoo Serious comedy Reckless Kelly, which also contemplates celebrity culture and Australian legends. The wobbly pace of The Very Excellent Mr Dundee is peppered up by celebrity cameos from the likes of Chevy Chase, Olivia Newton-John and John Cleese. There’s an ongoing joke about how well-loved Chase is, which seems to be an ironic acknowledgement of his less-than-honourable reputation, though the writers’ intention remains unclear and this thread comes across as toothless. The script eventually gorges on the kind of overblown sentimentality that has haunted Murphy’s previous films, including Strange Bedfellows and Charlie & Boots. Some jokes feel like witnessing a slo-mo train crash but the humour at least has awareness: of itself; of the society to which it belongs; of a world that has (whether Hogan et al like it or not) moved on from the crudeness of its antecedents. Compare that to Hogan inspecting a hotel bidet and grabbing the groin area of a trans woman in the original movie and you get a more interesting (certainly less offensive) perspective. You wouldn’t want to overstate the film’s achievements, given that a lot of it comes across as weird, self-pitying flapdoodle. But this is, as they say, progress of a kind."
"Have an overbite, ears that stick out, small eyes, or a “bulbous or interesting” nose? Hollywood has finally come calling. A New Zealand talent agency is looking for actors to appear in the big-budget Lord of the Rings television adaptation, due to resume filming in the country shortly, and is seeking urgent applications from people they have euphemistically deemed “funky looking” in an unusual job advertisement. The Facebook post by a casting agency in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, lists facial burns, “long skinny” limbs, acne scars, deep cheekbones, facial lines, missing bones, large eyes, and skinny faces as desirable qualities. It does not mention a particular role, and an earlier image has been removed that featured a range of police mugshots to illustrate the look the agency is seeking. The booker who wrote the post said she was not allowed to confirm to the Guardian that she was selecting applicants for the Lord of the Rings television series, which is due for release next year on Amazon Prime. But an earlier version of the Facebook post described her as “lead booker submitting talent for Amazon’s Lord of the Rings” and included the hashtag #lordoftheringsonprime. The mention of Lord of the Rings was later edited out of the post. Pre-production on the television series – for which a second season has already been commissioned – was disrupted in March due to the Covid-19 crisis, the New Zealand Herald reported. It is set to resume next month in Auckland, according to the newspaper. The agency, BGT, has been providing extras for the Lord of the Rings franchise since Peter Jackson’s movies were filmed in New Zealand in the early 2000s. It is not the first time that adapting Tolkien’s fantasy novels for the screen has required a search for unusual-looking actors. An advertisement in October for the television series called for applicants who were particularly tall (over 1.95m), short (below 1.5m), androgynous or hairy. And while work as an film extra can be boring and poorly paid, there are always Tolkien super-fans eager to do it. In 2012, a casting call for the The Hobbit films outside Wellington was shut down and police were called after 3,000 unusual-looking hopefuls thronged to audition. Only those who have the right to work in New Zealand and live in Auckland should apply for the latest roles, the agency said. In response to the post , a number of people jokingly tagged their friends in the comments – most of whom did not fit the bill."
"Cinema is back at last! Less with a big, cannonball splash off the high board than a tentative, slow-motion easing in, as if entering a very cold swimming pool, potentially containing piranhas. But still, it’s back! With lockdowns and restrictions on public venues easing in the UK and the US, the big cinema chains are looking to reopen in early July. And at last, they have some actual new movies to show. For the past few months, Hollywood has been moving its precious blockbusters back to save them from the floodwaters of coronavirus. But now everyone’s ready to wade back in – give or take some last-minute testing of the waters. Two high-profile movies are currently waiting at the water’s edge: Disney’s lavish live-action remake of Mulan and Christopher Nolan’s latest sci-fi brain-melter, Tenet. Nolan, especially, has positioned himself as a champion of cinema this year. In March, he wrote an impassioned opinion piece for the Washington Post, arguing that cinema was “a vital part of social life”, and pleading for support both financial and emotional: “We don’t just owe it to the 150,000 workers of this great American industry to include them in those we help, we owe it to ourselves.” While studios were panicking and pulling imminent releases such as No Time to Die and Fast and Furious 9, Nolan held fast with his intended July release date for Tenet, keen to be the one to revive the industry. Admittedly, Tenet looks like just the kind of movie to get us back into cinemas: stylish, spectacular, expensive, and genuinely new – an original story, rather than a franchise instalment. What’s more, Nolan has become a master at stoking viewer curiosity with a mystifying trailer, withholding the actual substance of the story so that you simply have to go to the cinema to find out what it’s really about (although post-screening coursework might be an additional requirement). From what we know, Tenet’s plot involves John David Washington and Robert Pattinson somehow reversing time in order to avert a major catastrophe, which could also speak to our current moment on a subconscious level. But wait! Tenet was originally slated for a 17 July opening date but its studio, Warner Bros, has pushed it back, first to 31 July, then again to 12 August. A waters-testing reissue of Inception now fills the 17 July slot. Which meant the charge was supposed to be led by Disney’s Mulan – the epic story of a brave Chinese warrior girl who, er, leads the charge. As with Tenet, a lot is riding on Mulan. A $200m remake of the 1998 animation, it is a big play by Disney for the vast Chinese market, although China’s own attempts to revive moviegoing serve as a warning for the rest of the world: cinemas briefly reopened there in March, but were ordered to close again a week later, likely due to fears of a potential second wave of coronavirus infections. Mulan was slated for worldwide release on 24 July but has subsequently been moved back a month to 21 August. No one wants to go first, it seems. There is extreme caution on both sides: the public is uncertain how safe it is to return to cinemas; the industry is uncertain how many of them will come, what to give them, and how much money it can make. The movie business is a gamble at the best of times; right now the odds are unfathomable. “There are just so many factors pushing and pulling, we don’t know,” says David A Gross, head of the Los Angeles-based movie consultancy Franchise Entertainment Research. The balance between factors such as public safety concerns, pent-up demand, limited competition, overall economic conditions, and interest in specific movie titles is simply “not quantifiable”, says Gross. “Whoever goes first is really going to be jumping in.” In ordinary times, both Mulan and Tenet would be potential billion-dollar earners at the global box office. Demand for both titles should be high. Tenet’s prime audience is young adults, who will be less worried about going to the cinema from a health perspective (if the recent outbreak of illegal raves is anything to go by). Mulan’s target audience is families, who might well seize any chance to go out to the cinema after months at home under lockdown with children bouncing off the walls. If they are lucky, both movies could actually score similar box-office numbers to what they would have done pre-pandemic. Being the only new movies in town, they could well open on twice as many screens, with virtually no competition. If the water does look safe, others are queuing up to join them. Already scheduled for late summer or early autumn are Bill & Ted Face the Music, The New Mutants, A Quiet Place Part II and Wonder Woman 1984. Never in history have there been so many finished movies ready and waiting for a release. But total box office will still be way down. Until a vaccine is found and life returns to normal, Gross doesn’t see how cinemas can operate at more than two-thirds normal capacity. Cases are still high and/or rising in some areas of the US, including the Los Angeles area – the No 1 American market. Elsewhere, there is the constant risk of a second outbreak. It will only take one story about a cinema-borne infection to turn punters away again. We are at least getting some idea of what to expect when we get back into cinemas. Some things will have visibly changed: hand sanitiser stations, one-way queuing systems, face masks, contactless payment, Perspex screens round ticket booths and food and drink concessions (popcorn should be permitted, but definitely not pick ‘n’ mix). “There’s an absolute understanding among the cinema sector that we need to reassure customers they are coming back into an environment where their safety is paramount,” says Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. All of this translates into extra costs, however. As do requirements for deep cleaning between screenings, fewer daily screenings, and extra staff to help audiences. Most significant of all are the government’s guidelines on social distancing, says Clapp. The recently announced change in distancing rules from two metres to one is the difference between cinemas being able to fill 25% of seats (with every other row empty and gaps of two or three seats between each group) and 50% of them. But the appetite is there. According to a public survey by the Film Distributors Association, 75% of Britons said they were keen to return to cinemas post-lockdown, although only 55% said they would do so at pre-lockdown levels (32% said they would be going to the cinema more). Even with a successful reopening, the movie industry will be feeling the effects of the pandemic for a long time to come. Industry earnings worldwide will be down an estimated 60% to 70% compared to last year, which means $20bn to $30bn in lost revenues. Some changes could be permanent. While cinemas were shuttered, streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ saw subscriber numbers rocket. Movies intended for cinema release went digital instead, including Trolls World Tour and Artemis Fowl. Trolls World Tour made more than $100m in on-demand takings – comparable to what the first Trolls movie did in cinemas. By cutting out the cinemas, the studio, Universal, got a bigger cut. If on-demand digital releases became a permanent state of affairs, the whole Hollywood business model would be upended, which is why it probably won’t happen. Let’s not kid ourselves, Trolls World Tour only did so well because of the lack of alternatives, and while $100m sounds like a lot, it barely covered the movie’s costs. It pales in comparison to the $1.2bn Universal’s The Fate of the Furious made in cinemas. It is not an either/or, says David A Gross: “When a movie is successful theatrically, its value is greater in streaming. Either it’s going to sell for more money or it’s going to be worth more to a Netflix or a Disney+. If there’s any movement at all, it’s going to be a sharper definition between what belongs on the big screen and what belongs on the small screen.” Increasingly, what belongs on the big screen is big-budget, effects-driven, globally marketed franchise movies. In 2019, franchise movies took 83% of the worldwide box office. Serious dramas, comedies, indie movies, foreign-language films, lower-budget movies, old classics, and more experimental fare are all being pushed to streaming services and the small screen. This is a trend that was already developing, but the shutdown could have accelerated it. That could have consequences for smaller and independent cinemas – the places where non-mainstream movies get a chance to flourish. A startling survey by the Independent Cinema Office (ICO) found that out of 497 UK operators of all sizes (including the larger chains), 41% do not think they will be able to open with social distancing measures. Only 28% thought they would be reopening in July or August, and a significant number don’t expect to reopen until next year. Smaller venues, where social distancing is difficult or impossible, and venues whose clientele skew older will find reopening especially difficult. Without government support, many are in perilous economic straits. “A lot of independent cinemas are run by trusts or charities. They don’t necessarily have investors or backers like commercial cinemas might to raise funds to carry them over,” says Catharine des Forges, director of the ICO. A few, such as the Bromsgrove Artrix, have already shut for good. “It’s not just about watching the film; it’s also about being in that communal environment and being able to experience that artform. People like me who work at this end of it see ourselves as more aligned with culture and arts, but obviously there’s a whole commercial side to it which is more aligned to the leisure industry.” So while Mulan and Tenet could be seen as “saving cinema” in one regard, that is not the whole picture. But assuming things return to some kind of normal, there is still much to look forward to, at least in the medium term. For one thing, the backlog of postponed blockbusters means late 2020 and 2021 are shaping up to be great times: No Time to Die, The Batman, West Side Story, The Eternals, In the Heights, The French Dispatch, Fast and Furious 9, Mission: Impossible 7, Jurassic World: Dominion, perhaps even James Cameron’s Avatar sequel. The decision to move the 2021 Academy Awards back two months, to 25 April, means February and March could be a smörgåsbord of prestige dramas, rather than the post-awards season dumping ground it usually is. Raised stakes and limited screens could make the industry think twice about what it puts out. So altogether, it could just mean less crap cinema. Then again, it is also possible that post-pandemic audience tastes will have moved on and the films won’t have. Perhaps we won’t be quite so excited about superhero showdowns and implausible car chases, and more in the mood for tales of dystopian disaster (witness the popularity of Contagion on Netflix), or real-world drama, or just escapist silliness. Who knows? But after months of small-screen captivity, a fair few of us will be grateful for any kind of cinema."
"The interest of this garrulous, convivial documentary creeps up on you by degrees: a study of secondhand and antiquarian booksellers in New York City. This was once a clubbable – and very male – profession that hardly changed for centuries, run by a mole-tribe of eccentric, tweed-wearing guys who were irritated to be beckoned from their chaotic shelves of old books by someone cheeky enough to want to buy one. (I myself find something necrophiliac and stifling about used-book shops like this, but this film sold me on them, a bit.) The business was upended by the internet, which brought unexpected calamities and benefits. The market for mid-range 20th-century first editions – ie a mint-condition copy of Ian Fleming’s From Russia With Love – collapsed because their rarity value plummeted: you could just type in any title online and find it. (The film doesn’t mention it but there were once firms akin to private detective agencies advertising “out-of-print book searches”, who were allowed to charge you even if they didn’t find the book.) But this upset has caused an upsurge of interest in manuscripts, annotated editions and ephemera collections, conferring archival and financial value on items that had previously been disregarded, and which has been a boost to studies of the cultural lives of women and people of colour, helping to bring these subjects in from the margins. Now the business is not just men only, it is younger and more diverse (though no one uses the hip word “curators” – it’s “collectors”) and they are convinced that reading hasn’t been killed off by Netflix. The sharpest interviewee is the bibliophile and collector Fran Lebowitz, who supplies a couple of insights. “You know what they used to call independent bookstores? Bookstores!” And also: “When I first came to New York it was called the ‘art world’. Now it’s the ‘art market.’”"
"‘If you are a rape survivor, you are a crime scene. Your life is a crime scene.” The speaker is the remarkable Drew Dixon, the supremely articulate and charismatic woman whose story is the keynote of this powerful documentary, from Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, about sexual violence and misogyny in the music business – and also about the way the experiences of women of colour have tended to be marginalised and erased from the #MeToo conversation. In the 90s, Dixon became a top executive at Def Jam records in New York, reporting to the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons. Her flair for spotting and nurturing talent meant that Dixon played a major but unacknowledged part in shaping the hip-hop scene at that time. But she tells how one night in 1995, Russell Simmons invited her up to his apartment, on the pretext that he was going to play her a demo, and raped her. From that moment, says Dixon, she shut down emotionally. But her ordeal was to continue: she was later sexually harassed at Arista Records by its CEO, LA Reid, who impeded her career because she refused to submit to his demands. After years of silence, Dixon spoke out about Simmons to the New York Times in 2017, and other African-American women recounted sickeningly similar experiences, including writer Sil Lai Abrams and movie producer Jenny Lumet, both interviewed here. (Simmons denies these claims – which would make his solemn pronouncements on veganism and yoga look entirely grotesque – and has moved to Bali, Indonesia where there is spiritual balm and no extradition treaty with the United States. Reid responded to Dixon’s accusations by saying: “If I have ever said anything capable of being misinterpreted, I apologise unreservedly.”) The film is forthright and intelligent on the difficulties and complexities involved in the discussion. It notes that despite the flagrant sexist imagery in the hip-hop music videos of the time, the genre did not invent sexism – illustrated by some wince-inducing clips of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Tom Jones. And the survivors felt an almost tragic loyalty to a scene that was under the shadow of white condescension. Dixon – with some courage – says this was partly why she stayed quiet for so long: “For 22 years, I took it for the team. I didn’t want to let the culture down.” There is a chilling resonance with the Harvey Weinstein case: not simply the recognisable details that emerge from the women’s testimonies but the way Simmons encouraged a gratitude-stricken cult of personality to grow around him. But there is also a chilling non-resonance with Weinstein: no legal action was brought, and the women did not get their day in court, without which there might not be complete closure. Yet speaking out goes a long way."
"This extraordinarily pleasant, restful film is essentially the digital equivalent of hanging out in the Manhattan shop of the title, a Greenwich Village institution of sorts where master craftsman Rick Kelly and his young apprentice Cindy Hulej make and sell guitars. At one point early on, Hulej puts down her blowtorch and brushes and steps back to photograph her latest creation for Instagram, assigning the label “#guitarporn” – really, that could just as easily been a title for the whole film. It is 80 minutes of pure woodwork-musicianship-upcycling erotica for a very specialist but passionate market. If, like me, you love watching video footage of people making stuff, the you’ll probably swoon most over the bits where Hulej and her sensei Kelly saw and chisel or just talk about the objects they create: electric guitars carved from wood recovered from New York’s oldest buildings. They’ve been known to scrounge joists from burnt-down churches, reclaiming timber from the 19th century that Kelly describes as “the bones of old New York City”. Thanks to partly their craftsmanship and partly the crystallised resin in the material (impossible to replicate for guitars made from fresh-cut wood), the instruments have a uniquely beautiful tone. It also helps to hear them played by the various friends of the store who walk through the door for a jam, a natter, maybe even a purchase (this is shopping porn too). Musicians featured include Christine Bougie of Bahamas, the Fiery Furnaces’ Eleanor Friedberger, jazz greats Bill Frisell and Marc Ribot, Jamie Hince from the Kills, Lou Reed’s guitar tech Stewart Hurwood (who put on an installation in Brighton with guitars built by Kelly for Reed), Patti Smith’s guitarist Lenny Kaye, and longtime Bob Dylan collaborator Charlie Sexton. And there’s a visit from film-maker/musician Jim Jarmusch, who is also described in the credits as the film’s “instigator”; his involvement seems inevitable, even though it’s a very self-effacing appearance given over mostly to a discussion of types of wood. If a film had a smell, this one would be of sawdust, varnish and pure love."
"This essential documentary from Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering offers a much needed recalibration of #MeToo, taking into account race and the additional weight shouldered by black women who decide to come forward with their experiences of rape and sexual abuse. The central story here is that of Drew Dixon, an eloquent, intelligent and talented woman who gave up a stellar career in A&R as a result of the systemic culture of sexual abuse within the hip-hop music industry. The stories of her treatment at the hands of Def Jam Recordings head Russell Simmons and others are harrowing; the film lays bare the great personal cost she wrestles with in her decision to go public 20 years later. “I do not want to be radioactive,” she observes, adding that by naming her abusers, she would be inviting back into her life the very chaos that she has managed to leave behind. The film’s empathetic approach allows Dixon to explore her decision, peeling back the layers of complexity that racism brings to the burden of sexual abuse. A must watch."
"In the before times, when films were still being released in cinemas, The Invisible Man staked an early claim as the year’s best mainstream blockbuster. A steely, sharp-witted reimagination of a dusty old Universal fantasy franchise, Leigh Whannell’s film succeeded by flipping audience expectations of whose story to tell from its far-fetched premise: not the millionaire playboy scientist who discovers ingenious means of invisibility, but the ordinary, unassuming woman – played with frenzied commitment by Elisabeth Moss – he chooses to torment with these powers, in ways only she can see and feel. Now out on streaming and DVD, it’s a horror film that assumes the victim’s perspective in ways both bracing and classical: there may be a rich tradition of imperilled horror heroines pursued by violent, insistent men, but The Invisible Man builds her plight as a thoroughly era-attuned meditation on toxic masculinity and the difficulty that victimised women often have in being believed. Among its many virtues, Whannell’s film offers a perfect metaphorical primer on the concept of “gaslighting” – a buzzword often thrown about these days to refer to any form of lying. Its true meaning, that of undermining someone’s trust in their own sanity, is a rather more subtle, insidious process, presented here to maximum claustrophobic effect. Cinema, of course, has a rich tradition of gaslighting thrillers, beginning with the one that popularised the term in the first place. The Invisible Man carries no small amount of DNA from Gaslight, the 1940s psychodrama based on a Patrick Hamilton play, with its Victorian story of a dastardly husband manipulating his new bride’s psyche, beginning with the simple hiding and moving of objects in the home. It was filmed twice in four years: the original British version from 1940 (available on Amazon) is tighter and a little more ghoulish, but the 1944 Hollywood remake (on Chili) benefits from swoonily lush production values and the Oscar-winning emotional turbulence of Ingrid Bergman’s performance: gaslighting has certainly never been more beautiful than it is here. The gaslit woman has subsequently become a regular trope in Hollywood suspense and horror cinema. In 1964, Bette Davis’s doddery heiress was cunningly tilted toward madness by her wily, money-grubbing cousin Olivia de Havilland in Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (on iTunes), a shadowy, slow-burning slab of Southern gothic that has aged rather elegantly. It was intended as a follow-up to Whatever Happened to Baby Jane until Joan Crawford declined to work with Davis again: instead, Crawford opted to play the hysterically gaslit, axe-murdering protagonist of Strait-Jacket (on Amazon), an unabashed B-movie that exploits the most lurid (not to mention ableist) possibilities of the premise: “Warning! Strait-Jacket vividly depicts axe murders!” screamed the poster, so you know where you are with this one. But it’s a high-camp hoot. Gaslighting stories aren’t limited to the thriller genre, of course. Humidly expanded by Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal from a one-act play by the former, Suddenly, Last Summer (on Amazon) proved it could be the foundation of full-blown melodrama. Wealthy dowager Katharine Hepburn is so desperate to refute the mental stability of her psychologically fragile niece Elizabeth Taylor – and thus suppress a supposedly unsavoury family secret – that she pushes for a lobotomy. It’s deliciously overheated stuff, but the performances give it cruel emotional weight. Fast-forwarding to the 1980s, Overboard (on iTunes) attempted the unlikely balancing act of a gaslighting romcom, as snooty rich girl Goldie Hawn is afflicted with the kind of convenient movie amnesia that makes it a cinch for opportunistic carpenter Kurt Russell to swan in and claim he was her husband all along. The film relies on the couple’s sparky chemistry to make it seem cuter than it is: perhaps it should have been a thriller after all. Recently, the gaslighting trope has returned to its more familiar context. Angelina Jolie in Clint Eastwood’s handsome, mournful Changeling (on Netflix) and Emily Blunt in the glossy trash diversion The Girl on the Train (on Amazon) both get put through the ringer, encouraged by patriarchal authorities to disbelieve their own eyes. In Steven Soderbergh’s grimy, gripping Unsane (free on Amazon Prime), Claire Foy is scammed into entering an institution, made to wonder if she belongs there or not. The fast-progressing conversation around mental health is taking this subgenre into new, more nuanced territory – though as The Invisible Man shows tensely, movie gaslighters will thrive as long as women aren’t believed. Also new on streaming and DVD Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (Netflix) Since coronavirus put paid to this year’s Eurovision song contest, superfans of the annual kitsch extravaganza will have to make do with Will Ferrell’s all-star sendup. But is it possible to parody Eurovision better than it does itself? Fanny Lye Deliver’d (Vertigo, 18) Long-delayed, this dreamy, eccentric throwback to 1970s folk-horror was shot in 2016: you can see why a peculiar 17th-century tale of religious puritanism gone awry was a tough sell, and it’s stronger on buildup than payoff, but its atmosphere lingers. Greed (Sony, 15) Michael Winterbottom is so prolific, and seems to come by ideas so easily, that many of his films aren’t as richly conceived as they could be. This thinly veiled, half-hearted Philip Green satire is no exception: it’s all lurid, shiny mock-doc posturing with no real bite. Scorsese Shorts (Sony, 15) Something rare and special from the Criterion Collection: a compilation of five early, digitally restored short films by Martin Scorsese, taking us from his 1960s student days to later 1970s polish, and ranging from intimate documentary to aggressive experimentation. Ema (Mubi, 15) Chilean auteur Pablo Larraín is never predictable, but even fans like me were thrown for a loop by this restless, hypnotic novelty, fusing a toxic marital drama with untamed reggaeton dance spectacle – out now on physical media, for the benefit of non-Mubi subscribers."
"My relationship with Alan Parker was the most important and seminal experience of my youth. He understood me in a way that very few people had the ability to ascertain at that time. Working together as we did was difficult, it was tumultuous; our personalities often clashed or were brutally misaligned. But he fundamentally knew what he could extract out of my aspirations for myself. And he alone enabled me to rise to a level of critical acclaim that changed the entire course of my career, almost instantaneously. Alan was a major film-maker, who consistently sought to make movies that were in the tradition of his legendary mentor Fred Zinnemann, the Oscar-winning Austrian director who gave revolutionary actors such as Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift their first leading roles in motion pictures in the early 1950s. He was also one of the last of the truly epic British stylists and auteurs who managed to combine serious subject matter with wide commercial appeal in a Hollywood that harboured him in the years before corporate takeovers sullied any future opportunities for a strong individual voice, such as Alan’s, to create a potent and culture-changing combination of the two. Art and commerce were never at odds in his work. A singular thread runs throughout the fabric of the constantly oppressive and decaying worlds that he created on screen; a vividly-coloured strand of passionate rebellion and opposition set against the dull and entrenched banalities of everyday life. This was often manifested through an actor’s most uncompromising and ferocious emotions. Below is an excerpt from his final film, 2003’s The Life of David Gale, in which a university professor discusses French philosopher Jacques Lacan’s Objet petit a; his 1957 treatise on dreams, desires and fame itself. It’s no coincidence to me that this scene was set in a school classroom, with young students at their most formative and impressionable stage of intellectual, moral, and spiritual development. Perhaps this is not only his own homage to Fame, 23 years on, but to the explicit struggle and confrontation with the trappings of overnight success that my character experiences. It may even be his personal homage to the performance I was allowed to give under his tutelage."
"Forty years ago, Alan Parker’s musical about a group of teenagers at the New York High School for the Performing Arts was released. Originally titled Hot Lunch after one of the composer Michael Gore’s key numbers, the film is a crowd-pleaser with a heart of ice. For all the fun and legwarmers, this isn’t some starry-eyed fantasy. Rather, its edge and pessimism make it a remarkably responsible piece of film-making, with a conclusion about the wisdom of pursuing a career in the arts that is ambivalent at best. But the legacy of the movie, spawning countless official and unofficial spin-offs, means such scepticism can come as a surprise to a generation accustomed to more upbeat takes on “making it”. Parker was 34 when he shot the film, having established himself as an ad director in his native UK, before winning acclaim with the pre-teen gangster romp Bugsy Malone (1976) and the drug-smuggling drama Midnight Express (1978). Three weeks after his death, we look back at the production, reception and afterlife of a film that became his most enduring hit – Parker’s biggest box office success save for Evita – and for many defined not only his career, but also what stardom, success and failure look like. Auditions for the main roles took place during spring 1979, mostly in New York, where Parker had moved for the duration. Lee Curreri (Bruno): The casting person hated everything I did. But someone else said: “Show him to Alan anyway.” At the end, he put his arm around me and said: “Really, really excellent.” I thought: “Oh, I have this!” I was 18 and I had no idea how difficult it was to even get called back. By the sixth time I read, they’d narrowed it down to me and someone else. Antonia Franceschi (Hilary): They handed me the crying scene. I did it for one of the casting people and she put me directly into Alan’s office. I did the same for him while he filmed me. And that was it. He was just: “Can you come?” Joanna Merlin (Ms Berg, the dance teacher): They couldn’t find a dancer who could act. So they decided to audition actors who didn’t dance. I made them promise that I wouldn’t have to. Jim Moody (Mr Farrell, the drama teacher): I was a teacher at Performing Arts and one day Alan came into my drama class and watched me teach. Then he said: “I’ve got a project you might be interested in,” and asked me to play the drama teacher. I thought: well, I’m doing it anyway … Maureen Teefy (Doris): I was in Los Angeles and I met Alan and he just talked to me and filmed it. There was no script. I didn’t have to act. Two months later, we had dinner. I remember he commented that I had a vulnerability, but it was all kinda mysterious. Meg Tilly (principal dancer): I was at ballet school and movies to dancers were big money because you got paid. It seemed like untold riches. They auditioned around 6,000 dancers and I was one of around 56 they kept. Isaac Mizrahi (Touchstone): I was in the graduating class of the real Performing Arts school in New York. Two people I knew got big parts: Laura Dean (Lisa) and Gene Anthony Ray (Leroy). I read for Montgomery. I walked in and said to Alan: “OK, so Montgomery is a skinny, awkward redhead – that’s none for three. Why am I here?” And he laughed. I felt so happy he was so engaged. Years later, he told that story in an interview. It was so thrilling he remembered that moment. Paul McCrane (Montgomery): My audition was very pleasant. I played the song Is It OK If I Call You Mine?, which I’d written for my girlfriend at the time. Next thing I knew, I got an offer and very flatteringly my lyrics were in the script. And that was it. We were off to the races! Lee Curreri: The cast met in a van when Alan drove us round the locations. Antonia was exactly like her character: quiet and in her own world; a great person, but back then this really serious ballet dancer. Paul was this super-affable, beautiful guy, sweet and gentle. Gene was absolutely out-of-his-mind funny, smart and crazy. Irene [Cara, who played Coco] had already been a child star. She was singing her brains out. She was a triple threat – could dance, could act, could play music. And she would let you know. Antonia Franceschi: Alan turned to us and said: “Can you think of another title? We’ve got to come up with something else in two days.” It turned out there was a porno movie on release also called Hot Lunch [the term is New York slang for oral sex]. Production on the movie, now titled Fame, began in July 1979. The first scenes shot were the opening scenes of the film: auditions for entry to the school. Paul McCrane: I remember so vividly the camera being very close. It was one of the most terrifying days of my life and I imagine this was entirely intentional. Jim Moody: At the end of the first day, I thought I was gonna die. The lights were so hot and Alan made me say a line about a hundred different times. I thought: this guy is trying to kill me. I said: “Wait a minute. The camera’s not on. Why am I saying this line?” Alan said: “Jim, you just gave us a hundred different readings of one line. You’re going to be OK.” Then his sound man came up; he was Italian, couldn’t speak English. And he just said: “Very formidable. You do good.” Maureen Teefy: Doris was originally supposed to be a Barbra Streisand-like character: a great singer and Jewish and from Brooklyn. The very first thing we taped was the vocals for The Way We Were [Doris’s audition] in a recording studio on Broadway. Alan came up to me and said: “Maureen, she’d never get in the school singing like that. Just talk it.” Suddenly that whole scene became very different. Lee Curreri: His choice of actors was really very intuitive and instinctive. I don’t think there was any talk of motivation. Jim Moody: I was myself. My students would go: “Yeah, that’s the way he is in class. He could be mean. Mr Moody doesn’t play, you know?” Paul McCrane: Alan knew what he wanted and he didn’t fool around. The primary direction I remember was: “Feel your pain, Paul, feel your pain.” He wasn’t what you’d call an actor’s director and I don’t mean that as a slam. Antonia Franceschi: I really liked Alan. I thought he was really deep and perceptive. Even when you’re young, you immediately know when you meet someone amazing. I was really non-verbal back then; Alan just got the layers and his way was really non-invasive. He made you really comfortable and let you be yourself. He just gently nuzzled you in the right direction.  Lee Curreri: He was a very product-oriented director. In the scene in which I’m playing the violin badly and the teacher tells me to hold the bow with respect, “like my dick”, there’s a girl next to me who giggles. Alan read off 15 different words for “penis” to get a reaction out of her and used the best take. Maureen Teefy: He definitely knew what he wanted and he was going to get it from you. I didn’t mind it because I was used to taking direction and I was 25. But if you were a person who maybe wanted a little more autonomy, it could have been challenging. He could be abrupt. One time, it was the end of the day and they had to do a closeup in which I was supposed to be laughing. I might have been tired. He was like: “You’re a fucking actress! Laugh.” Parker’s crew included two people working on their first major movie: the costume designer Kristi Zea and the second assistant director Ray Greenfield. Kristi Zea: Just after Alan hired me, he said: “Just don’t fuck up.” That was his typical style. But he was very courageous to take me on. I was not a member of any NY union, so there was a wildcat strike. Ray Greenfield: I think Alan was really an angry person, very much aware of class. He was very condescending to people; somewhat a misanthrope. I liked him a lot to begin with. And he was hands-down the best technical craftsman of film I’d ever worked with. Kristi Zea: He was very superstitious. When we’d watch the dailies, he wanted everyone to sit in the exact same seats each time. He had four lucky shirts which were very, very important. We would keep repairing them with different pieces of material that had to do with that particular film. They looked like patchwork quilts. He hated primary colours. All the costumes had to be washed to death and look kind of dusty. Every dancer had to keep their clothes in a bag. Nothing could be hung up. At that time, dancewear wasn’t sexy or exciting. Dancers would cut through the seams so that they had more legs showing. So we did that, too: made legwarmers, used safety pins, cut the collars out of shirts and holes in the crotch of a pair of tights and then you’d put it over your head like a cropped shirt. We just made these really fabulous combinations. Also on board was Michael Seresin, Parker’s long-time cinematographer. Michael Seresin: Alan and I were a constant in each other’s lives. We had nicknames for one another: Chucky and Bucky, then Fred and Ginger. We had a shared aesthetic and sense of fun. I’m a year and a half older. We had wives and kids and a social life together, too. Ray Greenfield: I was a smaller, newer planet orbiting the sun king and I didn’t particularly bond with Michael. He also had a certain arrogance to him, but I really came to appreciate how good a DP [director of photography] he was. Meg Tilly: They were older than us, but there was this energy to them, this kind of excitement and freshness, like: the world’s wide open. I remember them like that, frozen in time. Michael Seresin: We were a maximum of 15 years older. We were all in it together, but we were the bosses. Meg Tilly: They were both very, very sweet. Once I was in the lunchroom and Alan came in and we were all like: “Oh, the director’s here.” He said to me: “Come with me,” and I didn’t know why; I wondered if I was in trouble. We went down these halls and up this stairway and there was a classroom where Michael was asleep on a desk. Alan whispered to me: “Wake him up.” I was like: “What?” I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t want to touch him and so I nudged his shoulder. And I remember seeing Michael’s eyes open and they were sleepy and they looked confused … then he looked embarrassed and he sat up. He said: “Hello.” And I said: “Hello.” And then I said to Alan: “Is that all?” and he said: “Yeah,” and I went back. It was a hot summer. Joanna Merlin: There was no air conditioning. They brought in these big fans between takes, but the makeup would melt. These poor dancers were wearing woollen tights because it was supposed to be the fall. Lee Curreri: Costume people like layers. Everyone had their coat on. It was definitely too much. Maureen Teefy: Paul and I shot one scene where we’re rehearsing Chekhov and it was supposed to be winter but it was about 90 degrees. Paul McCrane: It was 102 [38C]. We were constantly running indoors to try and wipe down the sweat. Ray Greenfield: I remember the plastic bank card in my pocket melted. Isaac Mizrahi: We were all entranced that they had to smoke the set before every interior shoot. Michael Seresin: We’d use those things for smoking out beehives. You put in charcoal burners, sprinkle incense on top and puff it round the room. It was a similar weight to air, so it just hung. The woman who played the schoolteacher [Anne Meara] was going round with a jam jar trying to capture it to send it off to be analysed. And if it was carcinogenic, she said: “I’ll sue the shit out of you guys.” The funny thing was she was a chain-smoker. We looked at her and said: “Really? What about the ciggies?” and she said: ‘Well, that’s what I do to myself.” She had an answer for everything. The atmosphere on set could get heated, too. Joanna Merlin: Fifty kids in a room dancing and watching each other. In between takes it was pretty wild. Lee Curreri: It was just like the movie all the time. Constant music and dancing and having fun. Antonia Franceschi: It was insane. Tons of kids doing what they do: messing around, maybe flirting and maybe people slept with other people. Isaac Mizrahi: I know there was a lot of sex going on. I wasn’t having sex, because I was afraid of sex because I was gay and I was trying to navigate all of that. Michael Seresin: I don’t think I’ve ever before or since had such incredible energy: physical, mental, emotional. Just working with those kids was phenomenal. They had a drive we’d never seen before. Ray Greenfield: Fame was the most fun I’ve ever had on a set. It was electric. It was unavoidable. I’m an introvert, but I enjoyed it totally. Lee Curreri: It got really competitive once the camera was on. In the Hot Lunch scene, there was a big element of the dancers trying to get in the lens for real. Meg Tilly: Sometimes it was really scary. One time somebody was pulled out and I was put into a scene and it made me a target for a group of dancers. The sequence in which the students stream out of school to the title song and dance all over 46th Street took three days to shoot. On the first day, Seresin turned cameraman after an operator went awol, to the displeasure of the union. Michael Seresin: All of a sudden, this agent turns up and says: “Hey, you can’t operate.” We were like: “We can’t stall. We got half of central Manhattan closed up.” He said: “Well, I’ll give you two hours.” Of course there’s a lot of effing and blinding, Alan saying: “I’m not going to fucking be told what to do by some fucking business rep.” Lee Curreri: Filming in NY with the very powerful unions was like octopus-wrestling. It was a real work of determination to get it done. Kristi Zea: Alan saw what Louis Falco had choreographed for that scene and said: “Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is way too considered. I just want these kids to burst out of there. I don’t want to use anything that you’ve done.” Poor, poor Falco. So I said: “Just tell the kids to get out there as fast as possible and take over the street.” Ray Greenfield: Everyone danced to Hot Stuff, because we didn’t have the actual music at that point. Lee Curreri: The dancers unionised because they were just getting paid as extras, despite doing Louis’s amazing choreography and very physical stuff, dancing on the top of cars. Meg Tilly: And then the cars started driving and we all hit the roof! No way! They said they thought it would be cool if they were trying to drive through traffic. I remember how dented the tops of the cars got. The script, which Parker re-wrote with the original writer, Christopher Gore, doesn’t shy away from showing the seedier side for those hoping to break into showbiz. Antonia Franceschi: Alan was not into bullshit. He could read what was real and not real in a second. Isaac Mizrahi: As graduates of the school we were like: “Yeah? Really? Oh, come on.” And then years later you look back on it, it’s like: “Oh my God, it’s exactly what it was like. He really did capture the kind of gritty, slummy aspect of New York at that time.  Antonia Franceschi: The scene with Coco and the pornographer; that shit went on all the time. You got followed home, you got bothered. Day in and day out, because the school was right by the red light district. Isaac Mizrahi: Everybody is much more protected now from reality, much more medicated and balanced and considered. Parenting was just a different thing. I don’t exactly think of my parents as having been neglectful, but they didn’t really pay attention too much. We were in very big trouble a lot of the time; we were dancing on the edge of something really dangerous. The area itself was the epicentre of porn and filth and somehow we were dancing on cars. And some of us succumbed. Girls got pregnant and didn’t know what to do. People were on drugs. That was the dark side. And that really wasn’t in the movie. Jim Moody: The dark side is growing up. That’s just a piece of the pie. One of the ingredients – that’s all.  The shoot had its hiccups. The relationship between Parker and Barry Miller, who played Ralph, became fractious. Lee Curreri: Barry is a pretty damn good actor. But he has his own ideas about how he gets there, while Alan would just say: “Cut the bullshit, get on with it, say your lines, in the right order, keep your mark, stop screwing around.” Maureen Teefy: We were both young and scared. I do remember some kind of definite power struggle between Alan and Barry shooting the scene in Montgomery’s apartment where Barry breaks down and then I go and comfort him. We were there like a few nights all night long. Lee Curreri: There were a few monumental moments where Barry was crying in a scene, and that was after Alan smacked him. Barry and he were having a real conflict. Maureen Teefy: I don’t remember Alan doing that. Meg Tilly:  It’s hard when young people get a first taste of fame – it can mess you up sometimes. Michael Seresin: He just had to go through this whole method thing. He thought he was Pacino or De Niro. He made our life a bit tough. But in the end, I quite like that, too. It makes you think harder about stuff and accommodate them a little bit.  Gene Anthony Ray, who died aged 41 in 2003, also presented challenges. Joanna Merlin: In Leroy’s audition scene, the two people to my left were actual teachers at Performing Arts who were horrified when Gene got this big part, as he’d been expelled. They couldn’t bear to watch, they were so furious. I didn’t know at the time, but I believe he’d slapped a teacher. Jim Moody: I didn’t know that. Hey, well, that’ll get you out. You don’t take the passion that far. But I’m glad Gene was able to do the film because it was really rough in the city back then, especially for African Americans. And today the same stuff is going on. We still have a lot of work to do. I hope we can do more singing and dancing and less throwing firebombs. Antonia Franceschi: Gene was raw, baby. He was the real thing. Alan was, if I’m honest, a tiny bit afraid of him. With good reason. He’s a street kid from Harlem. That shit was real. He would go off. I was close to him. Sometimes Alan was like: “Can you talk to him?” And I’m like: “Yeah, not a problem.” Lee Curreri: Between takes, Gene would walk in with a tutu and umbrella and do a complete Shirley Temple number for everyone. Debbie Allen (Lydia): I remember putting ice packs on his neck. He was such a diamond in the rough. I said: “You’re going to have to do this all day. You need to calm down between takes.” Meg Tilly: Gene wanted everybody to come to his birthday party in Harlem because nobody in his neighbourhood believed he was in this movie. I was like: “Oh, we gotta go.” But the people I was kind of hanging with said: “No, you can’t, it’s too scary.” I felt bad. He wanted to show everybody and people didn’t show up. Shooting finally wrapped after 91 days, but not before there were other upsets. Debbie Allen: I had a big song I was supposed to do, but Alan called me in one day and told me: “Debbie, I’ve got a 10-hour movie already and I’m not sure where I’m going to put all of it. I love you, but we’re not gonna shoot your number. I’m like: “I’m OK. Can I keep the dress?” It was a red dress that was really nice. Michael Seresin: Meg was hired as a minor dancer, but she had a really bad fall. I think a guy was meant to catch her in ballet rehearsals. She was beautiful. She was very, very naive. I remember that. Meg Tilly: I fractured my back, so I had to quit dancing. I didn’t know what I was going to do. But they had me come back and loop a few lines, which gave me my Equity card. That was your golden ticket: I didn’t know until I got to LA with my sister that you needed one in order to be able to audition as an actor. So that was an enormous kindness and I wasn’t even aware of how valuable it was. The film opened in May 1980, taking $42m from a production budget of $8.5m. Antonia Franceschi: I did my graduating performance at the American Ballet Theatre School then went to the film’s premiere. It was insane. I got offered Hollywood contracts. But I had my dream job already [at the New York City Ballet]. Plus, I was a teenager. I had pimples, I didn’t have big tits. I had no confidence. When I’d get recognised I’d just say: “It’s not me.” I just didn’t want the attention. There’s no guidebook on how to manage that. Once this woman got in my face and she was like: “I hated your ass.” And I was like: “Oh, man, that’s a compliment.” Maureen Teefy: Oh my God, it was so different than what I thought it would be. I’d wanted to be an actress since I was a teenager. I was very committed and dedicated. But then when I was in something that was a huge success, I felt completely scared to death and exposed. I wanted to run away and hide. I went and lived in the maid’s room of my agent friend’s apartment. I was supposed to have a lead in this Amy Heckerling film and then the actors’ strike happened. It did interfere with my career and I didn’t even care. Debbie Allen: We won the Oscar for best music, and I think Fame was the first movie when score sales outdistanced takings for the film. Kristi Zea: In production, the executives said they wanted us to recreate the success of Saturday Night Fever, after which JCPenney sold that white suit 100,000 times over. They said: “We want people to go into stores and buy the clothing from Fame.” And we did all this spectacular, cut-up dance wear. But, at the end, they said: “There’s no stars in this film, so we’re not going to make a line of clothes.” I said: “Are you guys crazy? People are going to want this stuff.” They’d have made a lot of money, but they were way too conservative. Then Jane Fonda took the idea and ran with it with her line of exercise wear. And, a few years later, Dirty Dancing did the same thing. Paul McCrane: Reaction in the gay community was primarily very positive. Sometimes people still come up and say: “I was really young and very uncomfortable with my sexuality and it helped me to see a character who was gay in a film.” But it’s not like there’s a gay romance. You never see anything. I think some folks would like to have seen someone who more fully championed his own sexuality. When I was 18, someone in an interview told me it angered him that, given there were so few gay characters in film, Montgomery was presented as so fragile. He took great offence to a line about how never being happy doesn’t mean being unhappy, and the inference being gay meant one would never be happy. I’m not at all sure that that was the intent, but he has every right to have been angered. The gay community was very protective, and they should have been. There are still plenty of people who are homophobic. Before I unlisted my phone number, I got some very strange calls: death threats, homophobic slurs. Enough times to scare me. Isaac Mizrahi: It’s a pretty classic gay character: not really knowing where to turn or what to do and kind of descending deeper and deeper into depression. But also now we look back and go like: “Well, all Montgomery needed was a little Prozac.” In 1982, a spin-off TV show started production in LA featuring some of the same cast, including Allen, Curreri and Ray as Lydia, Bruno and Leroy. It ran until 1987. A 2009 remake of the film earned poor reviews. Debbie Allen: There were enough of the same characters to make it feel seamless. You couldn’t be as edgy as film – some of the topics in the movie made some people shudder: homosexuality, suicide, a young girl being potentially molested by a shyster. But we told some incredible stories. Lee Curreri: I walked into a Hallmark card. I was sort of a problem, because I was always trying to make it grittier. All the clothes were pressed and fresh off the peg and I used to drag my jacket through the dirt before shooting. For the film, they’d ended up dressing me in the clothes I had in my apartment: flannel shirts my mother had bought me years before from the discount store. They were also used on the TV show. So for many years I was wearing the same clothes I wore when I was 13. Antonia Franceschi: The TV show got so packaged. I think Alan was really uncomfortable with that. Ray Greenfield: I did the last year of Fame on TV, which was much more pedestrian and kind of formulaic. Maureen Teefy: I saw the movie remake, but it was so bad that me and my daughter left at half-time. I never really watched the TV series. The film is a very different entity. Debbie Allen: Making the TV show, I didn’t ever have a day off. The young ’uns were a wild bunch, finding their way in Hollywood. I was their mother, their father, their psychiatrist, their choreographer, their teacher. I was rehearsing every day. We went to London and Japan and to the Middle East and Israel and people loved us. I directed and choreographed the world tour. I’ll never forget Princess Di coming to see us at the Royal Albert Hall. My greatest fan is a woman named Carolyn who lives in the UK. I get a card from her every birthday or any event in my life. I feel like I know her. It’s one of the most loving relationships anyone could ask for. Some feel the cautionary nature of the film has been forgotten. Lee Curreri: The moment you hear those lyrics [”Fame! I’m gonna live for ever / I’m gonna learn how to fly”] you know they’re set up to be disappointed. As energetic as the song is, you know it’s tongue in cheek. Paul McCrane: The film does emphasise the struggle. You don’t walk out the door and become famous. It’s not about the Kardashians or the Paris Hiltons. Nothing against them, they’re cultural phenomenons, but it’s not in any sense earned. We could use a little bit more grounding in the idea that productive, hard work is how one achieves success. Isaac Mizrahi: The way you make it now is on Instagram or reality television. Same with design; it’s not about deep artistic merit so much as social media. In those days, it was raw. Every other day we would go to school and they would tell us: “The odds are really terrible that you people are going to make it. You might want to consider not doing this.” I was not a beautiful child and many of my classmates were gorgeous. So I thought: “Better throw in the towel.” Debbie Allen: Now you can get famous eating a frog on a game show or losing weight or doing a sex tape. But there are still those who’ve worked hard to become who they are: the Misty Copelands of the world, the Denzel Washingtons. Joanna Merlin: You can’t turn a young person away from acting if they really want to do it; it’s impossible. You say: “You’re going to have to work in day jobs for years,” but they each think that they’re different.  The legacy of the film, including for those who made it, remains immense. Meg Tilly: Sometimes these experiences change the trajectory of your life. And that movie is part of my DNA. I remember being on the freeway in LA a few years after making it and I heard this voice yelling: “Meg!” There was this guy standing up in a car and waving, and it was Gene and he was like: “Hiiiiii!” The wind was blowing and I was thrown back for a moment into the hot summer days in the studio, flinging our bodies about, the best and the worst of times. Jim Moody: After Fame, I was making a film almost every year for a while. I have less hair now. But people recognise me. They say: “You’re that actor guy.” For me, that’s a better accolade than being recognised for one performance. Paul McCrane: I’m recognised for Fame shockingly often. I’m 59 and haven’t had a full head of hair for 35 years. Isaac Mizrahi: For my generation at the school, it was as if Alan had immortalised us. It was like destiny. It meant it wasn’t all just a pipe dream. And for a lot of my classmates, the film was enough. That was living for ever. Like: “I went to that school and now I could be, like, a computer programmer for the rest of my life and I’m really happy to do so because I touched greatness.” Lee Curreri: I was really lucky to be have been in such a cool thing. I could have played a murderer or rapist; instead I was a synth player. As an electronics geek, I was an outcast as a kid. After the film, I had fathers coming up to me asking advice about what kind of keyboard to get their kid. Wow! I wish I had that when I was growing up. Maureen Teefy: I feel very proud to have it in my history, because it was part of the zeitgeist. People tell me what a deep experience it was for them, and they feel an intense connection. And I like that; I’m not a chit-chat person. I’m now in a master’s programme for clinical psychology and planning on becoming a marriage and family therapist. Making Fame was a very potent time in my life, but there were many potent times and there’s probably more to come. Isaac Mizrahi: For me, the film was a nice bang to go out on, because being at that school was the greatest experience so far. I have never enjoyed myself in the way I did then. I just went mad with happiness. But when I watch the film now, I think about laying down my dreams of showbusiness and how sad that was for me at the time. One of the main objectives of my early life was making enough money to get far away, and to be able to be an artist and to be gay. So I did the mercenary thing, which was going into fashion. I thought it was going to be easier and I wasn’t wrong. It’s funny that you would think of fashion as a more friendly way to make a buck – and it’s all a nightmare – but for some reason it was more tangible. Plus, I wasn’t being told I was fat or ugly or that I’d always be one of the friends or Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Because everybody wants to be Hamlet. Barry Miller’s tribute to Alan Parker"
"Sharon Stone has condemned “non-mask wearers” for the fate of her younger sister, who is hospitalised with coronavirus and “fighting for her life”. The actor, 62, shared photographs on Instagram of the equipment in her sister’s room, as well as a medical worker in full PPE. She wrote in the caption: “My sister Kelly, who already has lupus, now has Covid-19. This is her hospital room. One of the Non-Mask wearers did this,” Stone wrote. “She does not have an immune system. The only place she went was the pharmacy.” Stone added: “Can YOU FACE THIS ROOM ALONE? Wear a mask! For yourself and others. Please.” In an Instagram video, Stone expanded on her sister’s condition, saying that Kelly’s husband, Bruce Singer, is also “fighting for his life” in a coronavirus ward. The family live in Montana, where testing is confined only to those with symptoms. Stone said her mother, who has had two heart attacks, five stents and a pacemaker fitted since lockdown, has been unable to get tested. Stone said she had tried unsuccessfully to contact the governor of Montana and the health department. “My grandmother died of Covid and my godmother died of Covid,” said Stone. “My sister and her husband are fighting for their lives and my sister is not doing well.” Stone ended her video by urging viewers to vote, expressing support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in their campaign for the US presidency. Last week, Stone spoke publicly about three of her own near-death experiences. As well as the stroke she suffered in 2001, leading to a two-year break from acting, she said a clothesline came within “a 16th of an inch from my jugular vein” when she was 14. In addition, she was hit by lightning as a child, conducted through water after the family well was struck. “I got picked up and thrown across the kitchen and hit the refrigerator. Thankfully, my mum belted me round the face and brought me to.”"
"Here is an engaging if somewhat demure animation, bordering occasionally on a kind of gentle sentimentality that is inimical to the subject: it’s about the great director Luis Buñuel, though I suspect it’s more inspired by Pedro Almódovar. Based on a graphic novel by Spanish artist Fermín Solís, this imaginatively reconstructs a great moment in Buñuel’s life. In 1933, as surrealism was considered by many artists an essential riposte to the bourgeois conformity that was enabling fascism, Buñuel boldly began work on a new film, entitled Land Without Bread – a supposed documentary about the desperately poor region of Las Hurdes in western Spain, whose wretchedness was blandly ignored by the central government. Buñuel was able to make it because his friend, the anarchist Ramón Acín, had won the lottery and offered to put up the cash – an irresistible surrealist omen. The animation shows how Buñuel (voiced by Jorge Usón) and his colleagues journeyed into Las Hurdes villages, whose rooftops looked like turtle shells, and how Buñuel himself, with the ruthlessness (or unscrupulousness) of the born artist, started faking or staging the kind of spectacular moments he needed: goats falling off cliffs, donkeys attacked by bees. Was he making a documentary with the earnest intention of helping the inhabitants? Or creating an amoral, self-serving spectacle of bizarreness, which would be of no help to the people of Las Hurdes? This is interspersed with clips from the black-and-white film itself (sound effects discreetly added), which inevitably looks fiercer, denser and punchier than the animation. This film shows Buñuel offending the villagers by dressing as a nun, but gives no sense of the pure performative strangeness that must have emboldened him to behave like this. There are dreamy-surreal memory scenes of Buñuel’s childhood and his mother. These are very Almódovar. An interesting introduction to the original film."
"Here in Britain we like to think our journalism is free from control by those with power and money. Sadly that’s not always the case. I have spent years trying to release a film about Donald Trump and have witnessed the corrosive power his money has over freedom of expression – both in the UK and the US. In 2016, when the Mail Online reported on a “92-year-old Scotswoman taking on Trump”, readers were appalled to learn Molly Forbes had to collect water from a nearby stream in a bucket because, she claims, Trump’s construction workers had cut off her supply. The article was accompanied by a disturbing picture of an exhausted Molly, taken from my new documentary You’ve Been Trumped Too, which was due to be released ahead of the US election. But shortly after its publication, the article vanished, along with another like it in the Sun. Next, our film’s American cinema release was cancelled and a US TV network pulled the plug on screening it. This was after Trump International had issued a legal threat to anyone who showed the film or repeated Molly’s allegation about her water supply. The threats were enough to undermine our film’s release. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw wrote of You’ve Been Trumped Too: “There could hardly be a more relevant or urgent film than this.” But to understand why the film was seen mainly by critics and not more widely by the general public, you have to understand that Trump and I have history. Rewind to before he was US president: in 2010, after a phone call from Donald Trump Jr’s team, Aberdeenshire’s police arrested me and my colleague and threw us in jail. This was after we first learned Mr Trump’s workers had cut off the water supply of Molly, then aged 86, while building his luxury golf course. Footage of my arrest and the Forbes family’s desperate plight appeared in my earlier film You’ve Been Trumped, which was ultimately broadcast on BBC2 in 2012 despite Donald Trump and his lawyers’ attempts to block it on the grounds of “defamation”. In 2016 and more than half a decade after her water was cut off, Molly was still without a reliable supply. Other residents who opposed Trump’s golf course found huge Mexico border-style walls surrounding their homes. After returning from the Republican convention in 2016, Molly’s son Michael found that the water was still not working properly and fixed it himself. Ahead of the US elections in November that year we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund You’ve Been Trumped Too, in order to inform voters about the person running for president. While editing the film, we were simultaneously working to secure a form of liability insurance (called “errors and omissions” in the film industry), which all distributors and broadcasters require, and which gives protection from legal action from the rich and powerful. Normally this is a routine matter, costing about £2,000, and two sets of lawyers had given the film a clean bill of health. However, with Trump the focus of our film, the quotes we received were astronomical. There was no time to run another crowdfunding campaign. We had just sent the film off for review and I was heading to New York for the world premiere. On learning of Trump’s legal threats and the absence of E&O, our US distributor (widely seen as a supporter of independent film) got cold feet and abruptly cancelled our US release. The company asked us to remove its logo from the start of our film. Even the leftwing American news network Now This scrapped plans for a primetime preview screening. We were left with one theatre in New York and a festival premiere at IDFA in Amsterdam. Although we streamed the film on Facebook for free it reached only a fraction of the available audience. Our US publicist said they could no longer work on the film. The day before Trump’s election victory, Mail Online published a “correction” to their original story about Forbes (who Trump says reminds him of his mother) which said: “Trump International Golf Links has assured us the headline and related article are incorrect in various respects.” The Sun issued a similar statement, in which Trump International denied that the initial disruption was deliberate or that their contractors carried out further work in 2014 and 2015. Neither myself nor the Forbes family were approached for comment. With further legal help we have now been able to secure E&O insurance at a standard price. And although Trump has in the past taken to Twitter to threaten me with legal action, it is time to stand firm. The British distributor Journeyman Pictures agrees. The company has a proven track record of distributing powerful and controversial factual content and will be releasing You’ve Been Trumped Too worldwide next month. It may be nearly half a decade late, but it is reassuring to know that freedom of speech in Britain has, in certain quarters, won the day. "
"I must have been six or seven when I first saw Buster Keaton. We were living in New York, and my father took me to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where I saw some Keaton and some Chaplin pictures. I was just a kid, but I loved him right away, and that was the start of the great affection I have for silent comedy. Somebody once said to Chaplin: “Your camerawork is not very interesting,” and he replied: “It doesn’t have to be. I’m interesting.” But Keaton was great with the camera, and great with the acting as well. While directing the documentary The Great Buster: A Celebration, I came to care for him even more because he is so precise and the timing of the jokes is just flawless. I don’t have a favourite Keaton movie. I think Steamboat Bill, Jr (1928) is probably the funniest, just in terms of laughs. The gag in that film when the house falls on him, and he ends up in the window … oh my God, to have the balls to do it at all, just to take that chance, is amazing. Sherlock, Jr (1924) is the most brilliant, and Our Hospitality (1923) is an underrated masterpiece: the stunt in which he swings on a rope into a waterfall is just mind-boggling. The General (1927) is probably the best-directed one – it’s very daring in terms of getting laughs about people getting killed. Keaton didn’t make a bad feature. I think the weakest one is Seven Chances (1925), but even that has some great stuff in, such as the chase with the women at the end. Sound in pictures didn’t arrive until my father was 30, so he grew up with silent film, and I came to feel that the centre of the art of cinema was silent pictures: telling stories visually. That’s the key, I think, to making a good picture. One of the best films that came out last year in that sense was Knives Out – very visual and very funny. The main influence of Keaton on my work was in What’s Up, Doc? We had a chase sequence that went on for 12 minutes and I kept saying: “This is my Buster Keaton chase.” That was probably a bit presumptuous of me – I don’t think it’s as good as Keaton, but I was thinking of him when I filmed it. Keaton said: “You have to always see a comedy actor’s feet and legs,” meaning you have to see the full figure when he’s in action. I kept that in mind when Ryan O’Neal was running alongside Barbra Streisand on the grocery cart. There was a joke in the sequence that Cybill Shepherd came up with, which is the one where the garbage cans start chasing a guy on the street, and he jumps over the fence. That was based on Cybill’s joke, which she stole from Keaton. It all goes back to Buster. The silent era has, sadly, been forgotten by younger people. They think of it like Sanskrit or something. I put as many clips into the documentary as possible because there’s no other way to explain the extraordinary physicality of Keaton and his perfect timing. You can talk about it, but you can’t really feel it unless you see it. I tried to include members of the audience who didn’t know anything about him to begin with, and the people who have seen it tell me that it made them want to see more Keaton. Which was the intention! His films are the most modern of the silent comedies because Harold Lloyd’s essential character, the college square, has pretty much disappeared, and Chaplin was always idiosyncratic and kind of Victorian. You look at any of the features Keaton made, though, and they seem as if they were conceived in the present time. Keaton used to say that he was too busy working to smile. But you can see plenty of nuanced expressions on his face. Orson Welles loved him, and we talked about Keaton quite often. He would always say: “Look at that beautiful face.” It’s a regret of mine that I never met Keaton. In around 1965, I started trying to track him down and it turned out he was living just a few blocks from where we were living. But then he died suddenly. I would have liked to tell him I thought he was a genius. In 1928, Keaton signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and he always said that this was a big mistake: the change in his work was immediate. You can see it in The Cameraman (1928), which is the best of the MGM pictures, but it’s not nearly as good as the earlier features. There’s a long baseball sequence in there with Keaton running around the bases, and it’s unbearably boring. He never would have left that in the picture if he had had the control. Later, he appeared in a supporting role in In the Good Old Summertime (1949) – which is a remake of Ernst Lubitsch’s The Shop Around the Corner (1940) – and it’s pretty poor; nothing like Lubitsch. It’s depressing to see Keaton in such a small part. They didn’t know what to do with him. He’s the only one who knew what to do with himself. I guess I am quite protective of his memory, which is why in my narration I wait to discuss his great features until the end of the documentary, rather than end on his sad decline and the alcoholism. Some people weren’t sure about that, but I think it makes the picture work. There’s an old showbiz adage: “Always leave ’em laughing.” The Great Buster: A Celebration is released in the UK on 20 March with a Q&A screening with Paul Merton at Picturehouse Central in London on 11 March"
"Rose McGowan has described Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction as a watershed moment and claimed that he “could be one of the biggest serial rapists in history”. McGowan, who emerged as one of the most high-profile figures in efforts to expose Weinstein after the New York Times reported in 2017 that she had received $100,000 from Weinstein as a settlement over an alleged rape in 1997. It is one of a string of instances in which women are believed to have received payments. Speaking to Good Morning Britain, McGowan said she would not pursue a case against Weinstein because her allegations had passed the statute of limitations. She called his conviction this week an “unbelievable achievement” and said the testimony of her near contemporary Annabella Sciorra was “really vital in giving context that this is a longstanding pattern and not something that happened out of the blue”. Weinstein was not convicted of any offence against Sciorra. McGowan added: “If we do the math … [Weinstein] could be one of the biggest serial rapists in history, because he had a full machine set up only to rape … there was a rape factory, that was [his] business behind the scenes.” She also described how isolated she became after she went public with her claims. “[Weinstein] very much came after me, he and his giant machine of other monsters, people that he paid to do dastardly things … I would go to events and sit next to people in Hollywood … and they would turn their face away, like I had something they didn’t want to catch.”"
"The much-delayed Academy Museum of Motion Pictures has gone $100m over budget. The museum, which was supposed to open three years ago, will finally open its doors in December, as revealed during Sunday night’s Oscars. It was originally set to cost $388m but the number has now ballooned to $482m, an increase of 24%. The museum’s director, Bill Kramer, said that the project was more difficult than originally anticipated. He replaced the original director, Kerry Brougher, last year, who stepped down after internal disagreements with staff over his leadership. The Academy is now in a “silent phase” of a fundraising campaign to cover the money to finish the museum. The money will initially be covered by a $100m bond and then fundraising will officially launch once the museum opens later this year. “I think it’s very safe to say we have a grip on the budget,” Kramer said to Variety. “We have a strong sense of schedule and timeline.” The space, designed by the renowned architect Renzo Piano, will include the 1,000-seat Geffen Theatre, which will be housed within a raised concrete orb covered with glass and rented out for premieres, as well as another 288-seat theatre in the basement, a restaurant and galleries. One confirmed exhibition will be curated by Spike Lee. “Spike is an incredible collector,” Kramer said to the Hollywood Reporter. “He’s been collecting film memorabilia since he started his career. So his personal collection is spectacular and unexpected and a lot of that will be shown in the gallery.” Kramer also confirmed that the museum will not shy away from featuring darker aspects of Hollywood history, including figures involved in any #MeToo controversy. “This will be a museum that celebrates movies and movie artists, but it will also tell a lot of complicated stories,” he said. “It’s our obligation to do that and it’s our pledge to do that.”"
"“I never do the killing myself. I don’t like killing,” insists ivory poacher “X” in Jon Kasbe’s visually striking documentary about Kenya’s illegal ivory trade. X is a self-righteous and swaggering young man, with a self-described “sweet tongue and strong brain”, who claims to have killed 16 elephants on his own and at least 40 with a team. He and his business partner, Lukas, fire poisoned arrows to paralyse the endangered animals before harvesting their tusks for ivory. It’s risky work, and led to his own father’s death – by law, those caught shooting an animal receive a bullet on the spot. “You look like a gangster,” he says to Lukas, whose sunglasses and cigarette are fashioned after Robert De Niro. Kasbe also follows X’s cousin, Asan, once a poacher and now a ranger and family man who knows how hunters think. Later, ivory worth $150m is piled high and burned (a political statement arranged by the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta). Kasbe makes the most of his extraordinary access by presenting the film vérité style, preferring to immerse the audience in his characters’ lives to better make the case for each of their choices. Of course X’s crimes are despicable, never more so than in one breathless scene in which he and Lukas hit an elephant, which cries out in pain off camera. Yet Kasbe’s gaze remains empathetic, portraying X as an antihero with few better options, contrasting his business mind with Asan’s noble heart. It’s no surprise to hear that it has been months since Asan has been paid. Drone footage of a lumbering family of elephants is contrasted with Asan’s heavily pregnant wife; Kasbe films Asan’s young son, then shows a blue bow tied around the neck of a gorgeous, orphaned days-old zebra. Kasbe creates a sense of the ecosystem at stake."
"The British Film Institute has been accused of “erasing” a popular podcast series after the launch of a forthcoming film season that shares part of its title, covers the same themes and has similar artwork. Thirst: Female Desire on Screen was announced last week, with the BFI being accused of stealing the concept of Thirst Aid Kit, which was launched by the former Guardian columnist Bim Adewunmi and the US writer Nichole Perkins in October 2017. Thirst Aid Kit promises to “dig deep into the various ways women express their thirst”, while the BFI season is billed as a series that will “flip the switch on a century of the male gaze and find space for women’s own lust and sexual expression in film”. The BFI, which says it is trying to get in touch with the Thirst Aid Kit team, was accused of erasing the impact of the podcast by its hosts, who said it was “disappointing to see a lack of acknowledgment”. A spokesperson for the BFI said: “We are giving this our full attention and taking it very seriously. We have approached Thirst Aid Kit and would like to speak with them before we comment more fully on this matter.” The author and journalist Musa Okwonga called the “omission” of Adewunmi and Perkins awful, while others said the BFI was appropriating culture and “stealing concepts” from black women. The hosts of Thirst Aid Kit, which has been praised for its normalising of female desire, said they had been called “deluded narcissists” for pointing out the similarities between the season and the podcast. “If people prefer to be obtuse and accuse us of claiming we are the first people in the history of the world to discuss female desire, if that makes them feel better about denying our place in this discourse, have at it,” they tweeted. “We deserve more than a footnote.” Christina Newland, who programmed the BFI season and has edited a new book of essays about female desire and cinema called She Found It at the Movies, said she began writing about the subject in October 2017 and did not become aware of the podcast until early 2019, after she had started work on the book. “I always admired what they’ve done but it was something that has existed side by side,” Newland told the Guardian. “We are people who have likeminded interests, but I’m in no way inspired by them. Female desire is such a wide-ranging subject and we were having different conversations about it at the same time.” She said she had approached Perkins twice last year about being involved in the book. Newland said she thought there was “something going on with the optics” when asked about aesthetic similarities but that as a freelancer she had no say on the final design. She also tweeted that the design of the season was partly inspired by a 1977 issue of Playgirl. Similar accusations of plagiarism were levelled against the BBC last year when the Guardian columnist Yomi Adegoke said the corporation had “ripped off” the phrase “slay in your lane”, which featured in an ad campaign and was also the title of a book she co-authored. Adegoke wrote about the experience for the Guardian, saying: “White men and women co-opting a phrase trademarked by two black women for a campaign, then fronting it with a black woman to feign some form of affiliation is shocking.” In July 2019, the publisher of a book about racism in the UK was accused of plagiarising Reni Eddo-Lodge’s bestselling polemic Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race after releasing a book with a similar cover design and title. Ben Lindsay, the author of We Need To Talk About Race, and its publisher, SPCK, said the book’s design was inspired by the posters used in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, adding: “Reni’s book, along with numerous other titles, focused on race relations, share this same inspiration.” Writing at the time, Adegoke said the approach taken by SPCK showed the “copy and paste” attitude publishers had towards minority authors."
"If there is another terrorist attack in Britain, one of the interviewees suggests in this documentary by Scottish director Stephen Bennett, then the UK is only a step away from using the kind of torture techniques linked to Guantánamo. Globally, torture is happening in a regular cycle: every time it gets exposed and condemned, no one is ever really held to account. That may be a depressing fact, but as citizens the least we can do is make ourselves aware it’s going on and keep the history alive through retelling. Eminent Monsters’ highly competent contribution is to connect some of the dots and craft a narrative that mostly implicates complicit professionals from the world of psychology and psychiatry, starting first and foremost with Dr Ewen Cameron. After this son of Stirlingshire helped to prosecute Nazis at the Nuremberg trials, he developed mind-control techniques – including sensory deprivation, drug use and prolonged exposure to audio loops, known as “psychic driving” – that were used on harmless patients under his care in Canada. A programme was sponsored by the CIA, known as the MKUltra, which gets mentioned a lot in conspiracy-driven fiction and docudrama. Basically, it’s torture, and the British used it on suspected IRA members, particularly a group whose survivors interviewed here are still struggling to have their treatment described as torture. From there, it’s easy to draw a line to Moazzam Begg and Mohmaedou Ould Slahi, both interviewed here, who suffered similar treatment in Guantánamo in the wake of 9/11. None of this is new information, but Bennett crafts the narrative effectively, using the straight-to-camera interview setups favoured by documentarian Errol Morris, and lots of graphics that highlight words in documents shown to drive the point home. At times, the aesthetic veers a little too close to the kind of true-crime exposés that are all over Netflix, but maybe that’s intentional. Kudos to the team all the same for throwing a bit of shade on TV’s 24 and its propagandistic apologias for torture.  Eminent Monsters: A Manual For Modern Torture is released in the UK on 16 February."
"Activist and actor Rose McGowan has labelled Natalie Portman a “fraud” for wearing a dress to the Oscars embroidered with the names of female film-makers including Greta Gerwig and Lulu Wang who were passed over for best director nominations. In a post on Facebook, McGowan said Portman had made “the kind of protest that gets rave reviews from the mainstream media” but was “more like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.” McGowan added: “I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work.” The Oscar-winner responded to McGowan’s criticism in a statement. She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it. Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testifying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks, under incredible pressure.” McGowan accused Portman of failing to support female film-makers either by working with them or hiring them through her production company. She said Portman had only been directed twice by women (including her self-directed film A Tale of Love and Darkness). In fact, Portman has worked with Mira Nair on the short film compilation New York, I Love You, as well as on the Rebecca Zlotowski-directed Planetarium. Portman said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times … Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.” Portman’s company, Handsomecharlie Films, has participated in seven completed films to date, including the romcom No Strings Attached and the thriller Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Portman’s A Tale of Love and Darkness is the only female-directed film on its list, while Lynne Ramsay left Jane Got a Gun and was replaced by Gavin O’Connor. “I have had the experience a few times of helping get female directors hired on projects which they were then forced out of because of the conditions they faced at work,” Portman said. “After they are made, female-directed films face difficulty getting into festivals, getting distribution and getting accolades because of the gatekeepers at every level. So I want to say, I have tried, and I will keep trying. While I have not yet been successful, I am hopeful that we are stepping into a new day.” McGowan, who published a memoir, Brave, about her alleged experience with Harvey Weinstein in 2018, wrote about Portman: “You are the problem. Lip service is the problem … I am singling you out because you are the latest in a long line of actresses who are acting the part of a woman who cares about other women. Actresses who supposedly stand for women, but in reality do not do much at all.”"
"Jon Kasbe’s documentary When Lambs Become Lions has been much praised on the festival circuit, and it is cleverly and effectively made, seeking to grip you the way a thriller would. Yet I’m not sure that I was completely on board with this film, which appears to have smoothly carpentered its narrative in the edit. Is it almost too good to be true? The film gives us a coolly even-handed study of some ivory hunters in Kenya – and also the rangers, the hunters of the hunters, who have to roam through the landscape, in their camouflage gear and assault rifles, on the lookout for those who are illegally killing elephants for their tusks. On the one side, there is a poacher, whom Kasbe has agreed simply to call “X” – an understandable consideration, but one that in journalistic terms obstructs any attempt at independent verification of the story being told. He is working with an assistant called Lukas, who does the dirty work by killing the animals with poison-tipped arrows. (There is also talk of poaching with larger teams, but this film concentrates on X and Lukas.) On the other side there is a ranger, Asan, who like his comrades hasn’t been paid for months and has the pressures of a new family. He is also a cousin to X, and knows all too well how richly rewarded poaching can be, compared to being honest. As someone says: “Ivory money and ranger money – there’s no comparison.” Are the temptations going to be too great? Kasbe appears to have spent time “embedded” with both sides, evidently without telling the good guys what he knew about the bad guys’ plans. Or has the film been teased out of the existing back channel between X and Asan? There is a persistent and slightly exasperating obtuseness here, common to many documentaries about poaching. How about investigating (or mentioning) the customer? X talks about “the buyer”, but that’s as far as it goes. Is it someone in the far east? Without the demand, there is no poaching and no illicit trade. Well, this is certainly a taut and well-filmed atmospheric piece.  When Lambs Become Lions is released in the UK on 14 February."
"Japan’s maestro of pulp Takashi Miike is approaching his 60th birthday (this August) and, far from slowing down, remains fanatically prolific. Here is his 103rd feature credit, a violent yakuza caper that hits the ground sprinting from the opening credits, bringing in the gruesome decapitations pretty much from the word go. Leo (Masakata Kobota) is a young boxer who is told he has an inoperable brain tumour, with little time to live – and a fortune-teller informs him that he should be fighting for someone, not just for the selfish pleasure of victory. Emboldened by these medical and supernatural prophecies, Leo steps in to help a terrified young woman, Monica (Sakurako Konishi), who has been forced into prostitution by yakuza gangsters. She is also tormented by visions of the abusive dead dad whose mob debts got her into this mess in the first place, and the former classmate she once persuaded to kill him. One of the yakuzas, Kase (Shôta Sometani) is in league with a corrupt cop (Sansei Shiomi), planning to steal the gang’s drugs and blame it on Monica: a rash plan whose chaotic series of further killings they must further blame on a rival Chinese gang. It all hangs together, and Miike brings his own mad, punk-rock energy to the whole thing, breaking out a bizarre animated sequence near the climax, just for the pure hell of it, and incidentally giving us an uproarious image of dozens of cop cars chasing a fugitive gangster driving across a bridge. “Morning light does not suit the wicked,” is this villain’s musing comment on his own situation after a hard night of chaotic ultra-violence. As ever with Miike, the sheer profusion of material, the torrent of wacky creativity, means that there is always something to hold the attention. It’s bizarre and very unwholesome. But weirdly inspired.  First Love is released in the UK on 14 February and in Australia on 14 March."
"Netflix’s latest awards-film cycle finally wrapped up last week, having yielded an Oscar apiece for Marriage Story and the exceptional documentary American Factory, and a disappointing shutout for The Irishman, which will nonetheless live on in streaming eternity. The next round will start up soon enough, as the glitzier big-name titles on its 2020 roster pop up at various festivals. For now, however, a brief off-season ensues, as the streaming giant renews its focus on the cheaper, more televisually scaled films that the term “Netflix movie” initially connoted. Which is not to say they can’t be a big deal. In streaming terms, the arrival of the somewhat awkwardly titled To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You on the Netflix menu last week was a blockbuster-scale event. Cannily timed for Valentine’s Day, it’s been as eagerly awaited by legions of young women, in particular, as any big-screen young adult franchise film. Rarely has Netflix yielded a sequel by such popular demand. When Susan Johnson’s sweetly, imaginatively styled teenage romcom To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before landed in summer 2018, it became a genuine word-of-mouth phenomenon: Netflix, always cagily selective about revealing its viewing figures, claimed it was one of the most-streamed original films they’d ever produced. Expect the new film to break that somewhat invisible record. As sequels go, To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You delivers on the necessary promises. Most of the original cast has returned, with the hugely appealing Lana Condor again leading proceedings as wholesome, lovelorn high-schooler Lara Jean, now dealing with a second crush after having secured the boy of her dreams. The mild, kind-hearted humour and well-cushioned heartache of the first film are also more or less replicated. It just has the problem shared by many a romantic comedy sequel: that untying a previous happy ending is never quite as satisfying as knotting it to begin with. The first film’s director, Susan Johnson, has departed; in her place, Michael Fimognari, cinematographer on both films, has taken the reins. He once more gives the material the kind of distinctive visual style, in sharp boiled-sweet colours, that rarely gets lavished on teen comedies, though his touch is a little less tender than Johnson’s. It’s a markedly less cheery female-centred Netflix film that has been in my thoughts more this week, however: Horse Girl, one of the first titles from this year’s Sundance festival crop to go directly to streaming, and one that deserves a higher profile. Reviews were mixed when this brittle psychological study premiered in snowy Utah last month, unsurprisingly so for a film that begins as one thing and curdles strangely and solemnly into another; I tuned in with modest expectations, only to have them excitingly challenged. It’s a startling, image-changing showcase for Alison Brie, the vibrant star of Netflix’s superb wrestling series Glow. Together with director Jeff Baena, she’s written herself an unnerving, against-type character in Sarah, a lonely, geeky young woman who loves horses, works in an art supply shop, and in the film’s opening stages seems like a slightly washed-out spin on the “manic pixie dreamgirl”: that generic stereotype that tends to populate cutesier Sundance indies than this one. The longer Horse Girl probes its protagonist’s ostensibly unremarkable life, however, the more complex and fragile her mental state is revealed to be. As she hovers on the brink of a successful relationship, she falls prey to increasingly feverish paranoid delusions: with skin-prickling delicacy, Brie plays an introvert being eaten from the inside by her psyche. It’s one of the best, bravest performances of the year so far, in a Netflix film to which few will be clamouring for a sequel. But it shouldn’t be passed over. Monos(Spirit, 15)Unfairly overlooked throughout awards season, Colombian director Alejandro Landes’s tense study of an unravelling band of child soldiers is an electrifying synthesis of sound, image and fury. Gemini Man (Paramount, 12) The bizarre wayward trajectory of Ang Lee’s restless career continues with this technologically ambitious but garbled, ugly sci-fi clone battle — which borrows ideas far more stylishly explored in Rian Johnson’s Looper. Countdown (STX, 15) I don’t believe in guilty pleasures, but this delightfully schlocky techno-occult horror isn’t exactly one to be proud of. The story of a (literal) killer phone app is as dumb as it sounds, but the film breezes through it with knowing wit. The Essential Jacques Demy(Sony, 15) An exquisite Criterion Collection box set gathering six of the late French auteur’s radiantly stylised works, the melancholy whimsy of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, of course, among them."
"The Berlin film festival has achieved gender parity in some of its most senior positions a year after signing a pledge that commits film festivals to improve representation in relation to diversity. The Berlin festival, which opened on Thursday, is one of the major events to sign up to 5050x2020, which requires organisations to release information about the gender and race of their directors, members of selection committees and executive boards, and to record similar data about the directors, casts and crews of submitted films. The release of Berlin’s diversity data showed that its festival directorships were shared equally between men and women, and that its executive board was similarly balanced, but that the majority of films shown at the competition were still made by male directors. At this year’s festival, 37.9% of films were directed by women, and six of the 18 films in competition were directed by women, which is down from seven last year. This follows Sundance in January, when the festival presented its most diverse lineup ever. The Berlin data is released as the chair of Time’s Up UK called for more transparency on gender from film festivals and awards bodies. Dame Heather Rabbatts welcomed the progress at Berlin but recalled the dismay at last year’s Venice festival, where there were only two films in competition by female directors. “Progress is bound to be lumpy, it’s not going to be a wonderfully even curve on a graph that shows it’s all going in the same direction,” she said. “Venice was disappointing in that regard.” “5050x2020 was designed to galvanise action. I didn’t think any of us would achieve gender parity across all of the festivals but there has been significant progress,” she added. The pledge, which was signed by all major film festivals, including Cannes and Venice, has three main requirements. Participants must compile statistics about the gender and race of the directors for all the films submitted to selection, as well as, when applicable, of cast and crew. They must release information on the gender and race of members of selection committees, programmers and programming consultants, and of participants. And they must release data on the makeup of executive boards – while committing “to a schedule to achieve parity in these bodies”. Berlin’s data is the first release by a big European festival, with the next two festivals the most important in the film calendar: Cannes in May and Venice in September. Both have served as the launchpad for Oscar-winners in recent years, and both have been criticised for their handling of diversity. Rabbatts said the potential for progress was evidenced by Spike Lee’s appointment as the jury chair at Cannes this year, as well as the mass resignation of the César awards board after the director Roman Polanski received 12 nominations. “We’re seeing the repercussions of 5050 and Time’s Up playing out across festivals and awards,” she said. “The collective resignation at the Césars shows that transparency around voting and membership has become one of the main issues.” Polly Kemp, actor and founder of the gender equality campaign group Era 50:50, said the focus on senior positions was crucial. “If you’ve got parity on your board, you get much more balanced programming,” she said. “I would never say you have to have 50/50 on screen, but you should be transparent as a festival.” Rabbatts said the push for diversity needed to include awards bodies as well as festivals, and that the argument that a lack of diversity can stem from “industry-wide” issues was misleading. “The festivals are part of the industry,” she said. “You can’t opt out of your own responsibility.” Rabbatts also dismissed the idea of introducing a women-only directing award at next year’s Baftas after the seventh consecutive year of all-male directing nominees. “That feels to me [as if] you are ghettoising women and people of colour,” she said of an idea that has also been suggested for non-white directors. “You’re saying that our films are somehow not considered to be within the main competition – that’s how it will feel and that’s how it will be translated.” She said introducing quotas would also be misguided because people would feel they were there because of their identity rather than merit. Instead of quotas, said Rabbatts, there should be targets to provide a “sense of a journey” and a simple way to see whether progress had been made. “Five years ago, nobody asked the question of diversity at Bafta, or if they did it was an adjunct to something,” she said. “Now it is centre stage. Once you open that box there’s no going back.”"
"You can’t hide from smell in Parasite. It’s oppressive. It clings to you, seeping into your skin. It is omnipresent and sinister. Beyond being a mere symbol of social status, the smell threatens to expose one’s identity and the dark secrets lurking beneath. How did Bong Joon-ho make undetectable scents so indispensable to his film? The film, set in modern-day Seoul, depicts the down-on-their-luck, basement-dwelling Kim family as they inveigle their way into becoming servants for the affluent Park family. As the Kims begin ascending the social ladder, the lies they have engineered are threatened with exposure. Smell is central to this twist of fate. In Parasite, social inequalities are explored not through money or codes of conduct. The word “poor” is never uttered. Instead, the Kims’ social standing is revealed through body odours and scents. A pivotal moment comes when the Parks’ young son, Da-song, comments quizzically to his parents that the new driver and housekeeper “smell the same”.  In Parasite, smell shifts its note. In an earlier scene, the Kims’ apartment is inadvertently fumigated by street cleaners. The stench is welcomed as a cleanser by Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). But it becomes a barrier to the Kims’ social climbing, driving tension and posing a silent threat that could expose them. As Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyn) begins to notice these unsettling aromas, the audience also become hypersensitive to their presence. The Parks’ privileged position leaves them feeling entitled to dictate which smells “cross a line”. The audience is left stuck in the middle. Smell ultimately shatters the Parks’ universe, while reminding the Kims that their new clothes and more generous earnings will somehow never be enough. Both families demonstrate how social standing and smell interact. Without hesitation the Kims wade through sewage water, impervious to the stench, to retrieve their few belongings in a flood. Conversely Mr Park is decisively hampered by a smell he finds distasteful, during his own life-threatening family emergency. “These [are the] moments where the basic respect you have for another human being is being shattered,” Bong says. “Smell really reflects your life. It shows if you’re struggling. what kind of work you do. Even when you sense the smell of someone else, you don’t talk about it in the open, because it can be rude.” In another interview, he expanded: “By talking about different smells, the film puts the class issue under the microscope. Through smells, the film’s tension and suspense mount, which eventually makes a multi-layered foundation for the upcoming tragedy.” We are more accustomed to sultry representations of smell. In Park Chan-wook’s The Handmaiden, scents are spine-tinglingly sensual, driving the erotic film’s narrative. Conversely, the attempt to mesh smells and visuals in Perfume: The Story of a Murderer is so heavy handed it becomes one stale mess. Viewers are assaulted with visuals of the film’s serial killer rubbing his nose against objects or the camera laboriously lingering on rotting fish. More recently, Sam Mendes’ Bafta-winning 1917, set in the fetid trenches, should be redolent but ignores the issue. As Lance-Corporal Schofield’s (George MacKay) hand plunges into a corpse’s guts or he clambers over bloated dead bodies in the water, smell is of little interest. In Parasite smell rouses rawer emotions: anger, distrust, discomfort and a dark sense of foreboding. Something closer to the raw truth. Bong layers rich visuals, but smell remains the film’s emotive core. He is well aware of how smell can evoke memories. While researching his previous film Okja, he spent time at a large slaughterhouse and said the smell was the hardest thing to forget; it prompted him to temporarily become a vegan. In The Host, a machine spraying a chemical substance to disperse protesters recalls the director’s time at campus, when riot police shot tear gas at students. Bong remembers: “It was a very traumatic smell. It’s impossible to describe: nauseating, stinging, hot … It’s strange, sometimes I smell it in my dreams.” The vividness and potency of smell in Parasite is a key part of what makes the film’s so arresting. Bong notes how this might contribute to its overall appeal: “Its substance smells pungent and cruel. But in terms of style, it is sweet and enticing. Perhaps this is a very unusual and appealing bouquet.” Oscar would agree."
"Giorgio Diritti has directed a lovely-looking and fervent film about the life of the 20th-century naive artist Antonio Ligabue, who suffered poverty and mental illness throughout his life but whose fierce, primitive, impassioned studies and sculptures of animals and human portraits made him celebrated in his own day as an authentic unschooled genius, and an object of cult fascination from the metropolitan elite who perhaps regarded him as comparable to Van Gogh. (There was another biopic in 1978, with Suspiria star Flavio Bucci in the lead.) The Italian actor Elio Germano stars as Ligabue here, with a performance that has something of both Daniel Auteuil and Daniel Day Lewis — and also, maybe, a little of Sacha Baron Cohen. He plays him with the stoop, the shuffle, the fierce glare, the occasional equine twitch of the head and teeth-baring and drooping lower lip. This is a congenital dysfunction but also the natural brusqueness of the creative spirit and someone who does not suffer fools gladly (despite or because of being dismissed as a fool all his life). And for all that Ligabue once lived an almost feral existence, he is someone with some sense of the good things in life, particularly a decent meal in a restaurant. The film shows how Ligabue was born in Italy, entrusted to Swiss foster parents after the death of his mother, bullied and tormented as a child, confined to a psychiatric hospital; heartlessly expelled from Switzerland and found himself living in grinding poverty as a farm labourer in northern Italy. A chance meeting with the painter Renato Marino Mazzacurati (Pietro Traldi) unlocks Ligabue’s extraordinary talent. Germano conveys the inner agony and loneliness of someone who has had to contend with boiling emotions all his life, removed from both his country and his mother’s love, and is then vouchsafed the miracle of artistic talent — a safety valve for his feelings and the means to make a living, if not exactly a fortune. Watching Hidden Away is like eating a rich and heavy meal, which is delicious a lot of the time. It is visually very strong, and does not fall into the trap of tying to look in some way like Ligabue’s paintings themselves. But many of the wide shots are certainly (and justifiably) presented as spacious, beautiful canvases and there is a wonderful and quite surreal shot of a cornfield with Ligabue’s stone statue of a lion floating across it. In fact, a closeup shows that it is being transported by a tractor which soon runs out of petrol. Germano is utterly, strenuously committed; and he is very good at conveying the pure discontent of a true artist: the simmering, demanding fury that everything should measure up to his vision. It is a mighty performance, and Germano must surely be in line for the festival’s Silver Bear for best actor."
"The short films nominated for this year’s Oscars in the live action, animated and documentary categories feel very different from the Bafta shorts – there is a bit less offbeat wit and singularity on show. The Academy Awards contenders are generally sleeker, glitzier, more sentimental and more deferential to the Hollywood mainstream, although there is one nominee for both: Carol Dysinger’s Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You’re a Girl), which won the Bafta. Among the live-action shorts, my vote goes to Delphine Girard’s Une Soeur (A Sister), in which a terrified woman who is in the passenger seat of a car driven by a rapist has been given permission by him to call her sister from her mobile, but is actually calling the emergency services, and alerting them to the situation in code. Edge-of-the-seat stuff. Brotherhood, by director Meryam Joobeur, is about a Tunisian sheep farmer whose errant son returns from a jihadist stint fighting in Syria. It’s a competent, plausible microdrama, but a little worthy. The same goes for Bryan Buckley’s Saria, based on the agonising true story of girls abused and then left to die in an orphanage in Guatemala. Perhaps the silliest short is Marshall Curry’s The Neighbors’ Window, a kind of Rear-Window-meets-Friends lark about an exhausted, grumpy couple with young children who form an unwholesome obsession with the attractive young couple in the apartment opposite, visibly having joyous carefree sex. The twist ending is almost outrageously solemn and sentimental. In the documentary list, the best short is the staggering story told in Yi Seung-jun’s In the Absence, about South Korea’s 2014 Sewol ferry disaster, which killed 304 passengers, including 250 schoolchildren. It is an extraordinary portrait of the grotesque official incompetence involved, as everyone, including the subsequently disgraced president Park Geun-hye, entered an almost catatonic state of indecisiveness and buck-passing as the catastrophe unfolded. I also admired Sami Khan and Smriti Mundhra’s St Louis Superman, about the activist and battle rapper Bruce Franks Jr, who was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. It is a good film, although it mentioned Franks’ eventual resignation only briefly, in a few lines in the closing credits. Unexpectedly, the most powerful and emotional shorts were the animations, which can so often be self-conscious and twee. Bruno Collet’s Mémorable from France is a moving study of an artist’s dementia, as his world unravels into a swirl of brushstrokes. Siqi Song’s Sister gently but powerfully shows the human cost of China’s one-child policy. There are gems among these short films."
"An exotic new film accent has arrived, to be treasured alongside Dick Van Dyke’s Beverly Hills cockney in Mary Poppins, Michael Keaton’s lockjaw Mummersetshire in Much Ado About Nothing and Russell Crowe’s Geordie-Cornish-Glasgow in Robin Hood. Robert Downey Jr has had a crack at being Welsh (or has suffered a minor stroke) in Dolittle, a new version of Hugh Lofting’s novels about the eccentric Victorian gent who talks to the animals. This is the family movie we didn’t know we needed. Because we really didn’t. The only justification of Dr Dolittle is to facilitate rude jokes in a Viz comic, but he has nonetheless made it to the screen with Eddie Murphy in 1998 and in the 1967 musical with stately Rex Harrison – a movie featured in Mark Harris’s brilliant book Scenes from a Revolution for being the hilariously out-of-touch best picture Oscar nominee alongside The Graduate, In the Heat of the Night, Chinatown and Bonnie and Clyde. As played by Downey, Dr Dolittle has retreated into a hermit existence since the death of his wife, surrounded by GCI-mouthed animals, voiced by stars taking the easy paycheck; but he is summoned to the bedside of Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley), who is gravely ill and surrounded by malign courtiers such as Lord Badgely (Jim Broadbent). Dolittle decrees that the cure comes from the fruit of the Eden tree on a remote island and so must voyage there with his animal pals in a Pirates-of the-Caribbean-y way and then voyage back, hoping against desperate hope that he is not too late. Ranged against him is his dastardly brigand father-in-law, Rassouli (Antonio Banderas). There is also a spiteful and envious rival physician named Dr Blair Mudfly – Michael Sheen, playing someone called Blair for the second time in his career. What Sheen, born in Gwent, makes of Downey’s accent can only be imagined. It really is horribly inert, and every time Downey opens his mouth to say something unintelligible, the film dies a bit more. After just a few minutes, it is clear. He has done quite enough.  Dolittle is released in the UK on 7 February."
"South Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho has become the second director of a foreign-language film to win the best director Oscar at the 92nd Academy Awards. Bong follows Alfonso Cuarón (who won for Roma in 2018) as a foreign-language winner with Parasite, seeing off competition from the likes of Quentin Tarantino (for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Todd Phillips for Joker and the pre-ceremony favourite Sam Mendes (for 1917). Bong paid tribute to Scorsese in his speech, saying that when he was young he “carved deep into my heart” a quote by Scorsese: “The most personal is the most creative.” He also thanked Tarantino for championing his work: “Quentin, I love you.” Parasite, which won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival in May, is a satirical thriller about a hard-up family who manage to infiltrate the lives of a much richer one. It follows two successful (mostly) English-language films directed by Bong: the train-set sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer and the giant-pig eco fable Okja. Since Cannes, Parasite has won a string of awards, including best foreign language film at the Baftas and Golden Globes, with Bong winning a number of critics awards for the film’s direction."
"Handsome, muscular, noble – not words that would automatically have been associated with a Yiddish-speaking schmutter-seller’s son whose family were not long off the boat from what is now Belarus. But we know better: in these nativist times, it is worth remembering that Izzy Demsky was the beneficiary of the ultimate Hollywood makeover: the scrawny, hustling scion of immigrants who evolved into Kirk Douglas, the acme of all-American manhood, and evolved once again into a sensitive, politically conscious standard-bearer for liberalism. Douglas, who has died aged 103, became an unrecognisable figure from that of his childhood. His story follows a near-mythic immigrant arc that the US has chosen to ignore in the Trump era. In this he was aided by physiognomy: like Bernie Schwartz (AKA Tony Curtis), his smooth good looks opened doors closed to the likes of Manny Goldenberg (AKA Edward G Robinson). Douglas became an authentic star in 1949 with the brawling boxing picture Champion, only two years after Hollywood nervously tackled the subject of antisemitism in Gentleman’s Agreement and Crossfire, and fully two decades before ethnic minority-looking actors such as Dustin Hoffman were able to play romantic leads. But Douglas was always an actor of intelligence as well as charm: he quickly latched on to roles that demanded ambiguity and venality alongside raffishness, with the likes of Ace in the Hole and The Bad and the Beautiful. In the former, he allied himself with Billy Wilder, Hollywood’s master of comic bad taste, to carve a portrait of a vicious, unprincipled reporter trying to get back in the big time; in the latter he played a by-any-means-necessary backstabber of a film producer in a film that exposed the industry’s complex morality to an unprecedented degree. Both films widened Douglas’s acting palette, and opened up the range of what a commercially powerful male lead could do on screen. Douglas also had the sense to know which way the wind was blowing and was one of the first big-name actors to follow Burt Lancaster’s lead to start producing his own films: some of his best-known titles, including Paths of Glory, Lust for Life and Spartacus were made under his own banner. His production company, which he named Bryna after his mother, was about more than escaping the industry grind, or Hollywood’s intellectual paralysis as the studio system began to break down: he could use his status to get politically charged material through the Hollywood system in a way that seems conventional now, but in the McCarthy era was a career-risking struggle. The gladiator picture Spartacus, most obviously, contributed to the breaking of the Hollywood blacklist in 1960 by naming Dalton Trumbo in its credits – until then persona non grata after falling victim to the anti-communist witch-hunts over a decade earlier. But what tends to be overlooked is that the film is as much about the civil rights movement as intolerance: it is an unambiguous statement that any society founded on slavery is rotten at heart and creates its own downfall. In what was then still the Jim Crow era, it was a powerful document. Douglas’s nose for a great story never deserted him: in a prescient move he acquired the rights to Ken Kesey’s 1962 counterculture novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and produced a stage version of it in which he starred opposite Gene Wilder. Kesey’s study of individual rebellion in the face of institutional authoritarianism would appear to be in perfect sync with Douglas’s liberal instincts; but, as history records, he was unable to get a film version off the ground and it was left to his son Michael to manage it in the mid-70s, by which time the elder Douglas was – to put it politely – no longer the best fit for Randle McMurphy. In any case, by the time the Hollywood New Wave had got going in the late-60s, Douglas was somewhat surplus to requirements as a movie star: his overt machismo was no longer a fashionable accessory. In truth, the ensuing decades were not a parade of glory: the Brian De Palma ESP-thriller The Fury, from 1978, is arguably the most memorable of his later films. He did do one lingering oddity: the Martin Amis-scripted 1980 sci-fi film Saturn 3, with Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel, thereby presumably becoming the model for the past-it star Lorne Guyland in Amis’s novel Money four years later. This was Douglas’s public face; behind the scenes, it had been apparent for some time he could never be regarded as some sort of film-industry saint. He was notorious for his aggressive personality as his career took off, and he has been dogged by Harvey Weinstein-style allegations of sexual harassment – with persistent but unverified suggestions of a serious sexual assault on a teenage Natalie Wood in the mid-1950s. Wood’s heartbreaking history has been well attested to, including by her immediate family, but Douglas’s connection to it – unlike, say, the allegations against Roman Polanski, or indeed Weinstein – has never been tested in court. Now Douglas is beyond the scope of defamation lawsuits, and amplified by social media, it has swiftly become part of his immediate legacy. Can we reconcile this with Douglas’s heroic status? Well, it certainly takes off some of the shine with which the actor glowed in his glory days. Like many a powerful Hollywood figure in the spotlight of the #MeToo movement, Douglas is caught in a pincer movement: on the one hand, the loyalty and admiration earned from years of the highest creative achievement, and on the other the desire to give voice to generations of victims, female and male, that were once considered so much meat for the grinder. It is perhaps significant that, of all his roles, Douglas himself most identified with Vincent van Gogh: the 1956 biopic Lust for Life may look a little overblown for modern tastes, but it is a study of a man tormented by his own failings and crippled by self-doubt. So where does this leave him? Douglas was an undeniably vital figure in the history of American cinema, and a seemingly irrepressible force for good in film-making terms; but any established connection to Wood is likely to derail a considerable amount of this stored-up goodwill. Is it possible to, at the same time, admire Douglas’s creative achievements while retaining outrage over Wood’s sufferings? However cautiously we treat the claim that Douglas was the man involved, it’s a stain that won’t wash away any time soon."
"When Joaquin Phoenix used his Bafta acceptance speech to call out the “systemic racism” of the film industry last week, the uncomfortable silence that fell upon his A-list audience was reflective of a particularly confusing awards season. Phoenix was praised for his stance later, but in the moment, stars seemed unsure what face they should be wearing for the inevitable on-camera reaction shots. Immediately after the election of Donald Trump, awards ceremonies were dominated by jabs at him and his agenda. But three years on, stars have been digging deeper. Michelle Williams used her Emmy and Golden Globe speeches to stress the importance of equal pay and the right to choose, respectively, while Patricia Arquette spoke about transgender rights while accepting her Emmy. “The warmed-over political speech of even just a few years ago won’t do; winners need to be direct, forceful and correct,” Richard Lawson, the chief critic for Vanity Fair, told the Guardian. While Phoenix has used his time on stage this season to make more pointed critiques, other acting front-runners – Renée Zellweger, Laura Dern and Brad Pitt – have opted for a more traditional combination of humour and gratitude. Speaking in anticipation of Sunday night’s speeches, Lawson added: “I hope for some (good) surprises.” This year’s ceremony will be host-less for the second year in a row, which puts more pressure to provide memorable moments on not only the winners but on a starry roll-call of presenters. This year’s crop will include Steve Martin, Spike Lee, Kristen Wiig, Salma Hayek, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Olivia Colman, Will Ferrell and Gal Gadot. But previous years have also shown the impact that personal, rather than political, speeches can have. In 2019, when she became the first woman of colour to win the best production design Oscar, for Black Panther, Hannah Beachler tearfully read from her phone, giving professional and personal thanks while highlighting how those around her had helped strengthen who she is. “What I wrote, I wrote from my heart, and I spoke true words,” she now remembers. “The sheer magnitude of that moment was heavy, overwhelming, joyful, bittersweet, all the things. It’s nothing you can ever truly articulate.” When JK Simmons won the best supporting actor Oscar in 2015, for his role in Whiplash, it was the umpteenth speech he’d given that season. “I was in the fortunate position where everybody I knew told me I was a slam-dunk all the way along,” he told the Guardian. It allowed him to focus on something different for each occasion and, at the Oscars, he chose to pay tribute to his family and urged everyone watching to call their mothers – a plea that ended up having a greater impact than he anticipated. “There were stories, both from people that I knew and from all over the world, of people who connected as a result of that; of people who had been at odds with their parents, or people who had just been distant,” he said. “I felt like I had a positive effect.” When asked about the increased pressure actors now face to be more political in their speeches, he admitted that it’s a development he has mixed feelings about. “I’m not a particularly political person, so that doesn’t occur to me,” he said. “I could certainly see both points of view. If someone feels passionately about something, as I did about my wife and my kids and my parents, then you’re never gonna have that big a captive audience again, so you should speak about what’s most important to you and dear to your heart. And if that’s making a political statement, then I think that’s what you need to do. Then, of course, there are other people who say: ‘Eh, come on, this is not rocket science or brain surgery, we’re not gonna solve world peace here on the stage at the Kodak theater so let’s keep it about showbusiness.’ I don’t think there’s a wrong answer.”"
"Wedding season has staked its claim over the summer months of newly single Alice (Maya Erskine) and perennial bachelor Ben (Jack Quaid). And in order to weather the cringey speeches and mass-catering slop – and to avoid the dreaded singles table – the college buddies decide to team up and attend together. No surprises in how this chipper on/off romance plays out, but the sharp writing by first-time directing duo Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer, and the kind of chemistry between the leads that could fuel space travel, makes for a fresh and forthright take on the rom com. Quaid (the son of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid) teeters on the brink between smooth and smarmy as entitled Ben, whose impossibly high standards see him cooling on each new relationship within a matter of weeks. But Erskine, with her earthy chuckle and precision-tooled comic timing, is the real discovery here. She’s a smutty, sniggering joy in the role and I can’t wait to see what she does next."
"On the cusp of the second world war, with Hitler stirring his power base and Stalin selling the idea of a communist utopia to the west, a young Welsh journalist takes the unfashionable stance that there is only one “truth”. Gareth Jones (James Norton), former adviser to prime minister Lloyd George, hustles a trip to Moscow with the intention of interviewing Stalin, but instead stumbles on the story of a man-made famine in Ukraine. Twenty minutes have been cut from Agnieszka Holland’s fact-based drama since its premiere last year and the result is a stirring, at times vividly inventive piece of film-making that strikes a note of warning about the risks of fake news. Holland fills the Moscow cityscape with colour – skies of Soviet red and interiors decorated in a decadent palette of bourbon and naked flesh – then evokes icebound Ukraine in a stripped-down monochrome. A subplot about George Orwell is perhaps surplus to requirements, but otherwise the film is a striking, efficient political thriller."
"Federico Fellini’s 1960 masterpiece La Dolce Vita premiered in his native Italy 60 years ago today, eventually trickling into American theaters just as they were getting hospitable to foreign films. Stateside moviegoers in the 60s looked at the latest releases from the big-name masters – Bergman, Kurosawa, Godard – as two-hour passports to far-off lands, and the ineffable Italian-ness of Fellini’s cinema played a significant role in its US reception. As world-weary gossip columnist Marcello Rubini, the great Marcello Mastroianni embodied the image of Euro-cool, resplendent in his jet-black sunglasses and slickly tailored suits. The film’s rear-projection driving scenes are, simply put, the greatest in the history of the medium; Americans were instantly smitten with Marcello’s sporty little hot rod, his disaffected scowl, and the seductive artifice of the filmed nighttime splayed across the background. With over a half-century of perspective, it makes perfect sense that that exotic quality would’ve been a major draw for domestic viewers at the time, considering how alien Marcello’s inner struggle is to the American way of life. He’s tormented by his own conscience, caught between the promise of the sacred (marriage, family, religion) and the temptations of the profane (sex, wealth, luxury). He makes his entry literally straying from the path of Christ, peeling off from the trail of a helicopter transporting a Jesus statue to flirt with some sunbathing beauties who can’t hear him over the chopper. Throughout the film, he navigates a tony milieu of nobles and socialites unfamiliar to and incompatible with American terrain. The passage of time has double-underscored the disconnect between the alluring sleekness of Italian high society and its gauche equivalent in the States, where all money is new money. Fellini dazzled with visions of indulgence so intoxicating that they could conceal the moral rot festering within, but our one-percenters could never quite get the hang of that, and they’ve only gotten worse. At this point, it’s nearly nostalgic to revisit a time when being rich was so damn tasteful. Marcello stumbles through the episodic plot as he stumbles through his own existence, fundamentally passive about his cushy lifestyle. He makes a good salary paying off waiters to let slip which Duke had the snails, and when he gets tired of the mistress that he goes to when he gets tired of his wife, he can cavort about with a buxom Swedish movie star. He has access to the uppermost slice of the upper crust, welcome at their parties and an eligible sexual prospect. His trouble is that he has just enough moral fiber to feel shame about their excesses, and yet not quite enough to commit himself to a more principled path. La Dolce Vita remains the ravishing, existentially punishing experience that it’s always been because Fellini does a bang-up job selling us on sin. He gives in to his urges to cue up the film’s most famed sequence, the frolic in the Trevi fountain with the Swedish starlet portrayed by Anita Ekberg. At first, he resists her invitations to join her in the water, joining her in a symbolic concession to the flesh. His internal plight is understandable; it would take a titanium will to resist the dizzying mix of rushing water and blonde hair and black fabric. Glamour on that level seeps out of everything, from the chic costuming to the slinky dance moves and the gorgeous interior production design. With corrosion of the soul like this, who needs virtues? For every decade since its original gutting at Fellini’s hands, the ideal of extreme wealth has lost a little bit of its luster. The 1960s were really the final years before the upper class would be subsumed by the soul-deep tackiness that came to define the moneyed elite in the second half of the 20th century. New York’s new It Attraction is the TWA Hotel, a retro-aesthetic novelty harkening back to the Mad Men era, and its paradigm of haute style. The 70s and 80s, with the surge of new millionaires minted in the wake of Reaganomics, introduced the image of the over-tanned, proudly garish moneybags as the new standard of class. The purest avatar of that movement now sits in the White House, providing new living proof on a daily basis that money can’t buy you class. (To quote a woman who successfully infiltrated the glitterati, and then went to work dragging the Count-and-Countess set down to her brow level.) Shifting sociological tides have turned capital into a mark of shame, and completely reoriented ideas of status. The emerging generation of young people aspire to more meaningful things than a hefty bank account, and find only distaste in the exclusive and rarefied nature that made Marcello’s subjects a topic of interest. Marcello may have been influential enough to coin the term paparazzi, but the gossip columnist is on his way out as a fixture, supplanted by the everywhere-at-once panopticon of social media. Royalty itself has come to feel passé, as the two most outward-facing members of the Crown family step down from their stations. The oldest families in America are no longer objects of envy, but emblems of decline. Marcello’s crisis is one of creative integrity, a concept increasingly remote in the anything-goes scrum between art and commerce that makes up today’s entertainment industry. Marcello toys with the notion of going into literature, and adopting a more intellectually nourishing life to go with it. He eventually ends up as a publicity agent, a devolution that critic Ty Burr described in his book on the essential cinema canon as “a Pilgrim’s Regress”. The anxiety over that personal compromise scans as downright quaint in 2020; our version can’t possibly be Lizzo gladly snapping a selfie with Jeff Bezos in a private box at the Super Bowl, can it? Marcello ends the film unmoored, shouting unheard words, just as in his first appearance. He has no idea what to do with all of the ugliness he perceives in his beautiful world, symbolized by the ghastly mutant fish that washes up on the pristine Italian beach in this final scene. The viewer may share in his despair, as he’s caught once again between the sacred and profane. But there’s also penumbra of envy to it, that at least he had plenty of the sacred to go around."
"There are touches of M Night Shyamalan and Donnie Darko in this enjoyably ludicrous low-budget psychological horror, directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer, about an imaginary friend who turns nasty. It’s full of plot holes but compulsively watchable for the first hour, before the whole thing falls to pieces as Mortimer chucks in a load of well-worn horror-movie tropes. Miles Robbins plays Luke, an unconfident arty law student who as a kid had an imaginary friend called Daniel – a coping mechanism to help him deal with his dad walking out, or so everyone believed. Now Luke is in college and Daniel is back, charming and sinister, and played by Arnie’s son Patrick Schwarzenegger, giving a show-offy performance like an evil Ferris Bueller. At first Luke blossoms with Daniel, invisible by his side, boosting his confidence, encouraging him to ditch stuffy law and follow his dream of becoming a photographer. A pep talk from Daniel gets him the number of gorgeous party girl Sophie (Hannah Marks). But when Luke is more interested in hippy artist Cassie (Sasha Lane), Daniel gets mean. Is Luke suffering from delusions, a raging id or has he actually got an imaginary frenemy? The problem with Daniel Isn’t Real is that it wants it both ways in terms of mental health. You get the sense that Mortimer and his co-writer Brian DeLeeuw, adapting his own novel, would like to say some semi-serious things about mental illness (and perhaps even about the incel community). But the film lost me at the point when Mortimer unleashed a hell-fury of special effects as Daniel literally gets under Luke’s skin. Still, Sasha Lane, so brilliant in Andrea Arnold’s American Honey, is no one’s idea of a horror-movie damsel, feistily fighting back rather than running and screaming when the time comes.  Daniel Isn’t Real is released in the UK on 7 February."
"This year could have been simply wunderbar for the Berlin film festival, but it didn’t quite work that way. The festival organisers, including new artistic director Carlo Chatrian, found themselves with more on their plate than expected, including controversy over jury president Jeremy Irons, because of his previous comments on gender politics; the dropping of the prize commemorating the Berlinale’s founding director, Alfred Bauer, following revelations about his Nazi involvement; and the closure of a key venue, the multiscreen CineStar. Worse still, most of the eateries in the mall on Postdamer Platz were closed for renovation, leaving this soulless architectural complex more desolate than ever. It wasn’t the ideal mood for the festival’s 70th edition, so perhaps we’ll have to wait for 2021 to provide the fireworks that this year needed. Things weren’t entirely sparkle-free, though: the Berlinale can still attract big names, including Hillary Clinton, here to launch a four-part TV documentary about herself. And the competition was as mixed as ever, but had its joys. For me, the big discovery was Bad Tales, by young Italian duo the D’Innocenzo brothers. An ensemble piece about fraught families in a suburb of Rome, it’s oddly American in feel, with echoes of diverse Texan or Californian long-hot-summer stories. But the milieu and the stylistic invention are authentically Italian, and the brothers handle their emotionally delicate material with crisp control and a sharp feel for everyday madness. Another highlight was First Cow by US stalwart Kelly Reichardt, a downbeat but tender comic parable about male friendship and the birth of entrepreneurship in the old west – a charming film that wears its depth and its social insight lightly. Undine, by the brilliant German director Christian Petzold, was a thinly veiled modern retelling of the siren myth, with Paula Beer superb as a woman who finds herself embroiled in quasi-supernatural occurrences around a Berlin lake. Slyly mixing modern realism with old-school German Romanticism, it confirms Petzold as one of the canniest storytellers in cinema today. More quality German acting came from Nina Hoss and Lars Eidinger as siblings – a blocked playwright and an actor with cancer – in Swiss title My Little Sister by Stéphanie Chuat and Véronique Reymond. Essentially a traditional middle-class crisis drama, it’s mature, seriously moving, and the two leads have mesmerising authority. More demanding but utterly sublime, was Days, by Taiwanese master of slow cinema Tsai Ming-liang. Pushing his minimalism to new limits, this was a pensive, dialogue-free study of a gay brief encounter between a man with neck problems (the perennially impassive Lee Kang-sheng) and a Thai masseur. On the screen, almost nothing happens; on an almost emotional, subliminal level, everything happens, with the barely audible tinkle of Charlie Chaplin’s Limelight theme on a music box adding a wonderfully laconic end note. Controversy came in the form of DAU.Natasha, the first feature to emerge from the notoriously ambitious art project by Russian director Ilya Khrzhanovsky, which involved its non-professional cast living for extended periods in simulated Soviet-era conditions. DAU is about a canteen worker who undergoes brutal KGB interrogation; grimly claustrophobic and full of unruly drunkenness and graphic sex (both seem to be real), it’s a gruelling rather than edifying experience. But it could well bag an acting award for lead Natasha Berezhnaya, not least for holding her nerve beyond the call of duty. It wasn’t the strangest competition entry: that was Siberia, by wild-man auteur Abel Ferrara. Some admired the chutzpah of this spiritual quest, in which Willem Dafoe treks with a team of huskies across the windblown expanses of his psyche in search of redemption and his dead dad (also played by Dafoe). I’ll refrain from a full verdict, as I lost patience and left after an hour, which means I missed the talking fish. But one talking fish per festival is plenty, and the tuna in Pinocchio – by Gomorra director Matteo Garrone – was more than unnerving. Roberto Benigni, who once directed himself as the puppet, now plays woodcarver Geppetto in a version that’s extravagantly kitsch yet true to the spirit of Carlo Collodi’s original story and Italian folk culture. With its grotesque talking animals and grislier humans, this Pinocchio is a baroque confection that could traumatise a child for life. Among the earnest prestige titles that Berlin invariably offers, there was opener My Salinger Year, with ascendant Margaret Qualley as an aspiring poet who gets a job in the literary agency that handles JD Salinger, and receives life lessons from her boss, a consummately lofty Sigourney Weaver. Palatable but predictable, it’s essentially a literary The Devil Wears Prada (or should that be The Devil Reads Kafka?). And Minamata was about W Eugene Smith, the photographer who exposed a shocking case of industrial pollution in Japan; the solemnly urgent narrative was nowhere near as intriguing as the beret and beard combination donned by Johnny Depp, in a performance that honourably dialled down his usual eccentricities. I wasn’t convinced by some of the festival’s more full-on performances, actorly or directorial. Sally Potter’s The Roads Not Taken starred Javier Bardem as a writer with dementia, and Elle Fanning as his daughter. The light touch that marked Potter’s 2017 Berlin success The Party was replaced by a sombre portentousness that Odyssey references did nothing to leaven. Elisabeth Moss played writer Shirley Jackson in Shirley, less a biopic than an imaginative psychodrama, but with Moss’s more histrionic tendencies boosted uncomfortably by the hothouse stylistics of director Josephine Decker. More successfully nervy was Bassam Tariq’s Mogul Mowgli, with Riz Ahmed co-writing and playing a British rapper forced to come to terms with his Pakistani identity. Ahmed’s turbocharged raps combine with nightmare sequences to make an emotionally intense, culturally provocative, very political drama. Finally, there was a magnificently improbable surprise hit – a wordless black-and-white documentary about pigs. Gunda – by Victor Kossakovsky, the Russian director behind recent eco-doc Aquarela – simply follows the daily existence of a sow and her squealing, squabbling litter. There are some cows too, and some scrawnily charismatic chickens, but it’s mainly the pigs’ film, and the lyrical camerawork and vividly oinky sound design make this seemingly banal topic yield revelatory insights into what it might mean to be an animal – and therefore, indirectly, into the human condition. Joaquin Phoenix has attached himself as executive producer, and Paul Thomas Anderson has been raving about Gunda too – although there’s no truth in the rumour that he’s planning to remake it under the title There Will Be Mud."
"The 19th-century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly is given a rock’n’roll makeover in Justin Kurzel’s swaggering, defiantly ahistorical drama. Based on Peter Carey’s 2001 Booker prize-winning novel, it splits Kelly’s story into three parts: “Boy”, “Man” and “Monitor”, the third chapter referring to his time as a self-appointed bush ranger. Orlando Schwerdt plays the young Kelly, innocence soured having seen too much, while British actor George MacKay is his unruly adult counterpart. Kurzel begins the film with an image of Kelly writing a letter to his unborn child (it was a myth that Kelly was illiterate). “Every man should be the author of his own history,” instructs his mentor, Harry Power (Russell Crowe). And so the Adelaide-born Kurzel playfully rewrites one of his country’s most persistent cultural figures, adding a homoerotic subtext that undermines the idea of Kelly as a macho folk hero. This Kelly is motivated by an oedipal complex and wears dresses to distract his opponents; The Babadook’s Essie Davis is equal parts fearsome and magnetic as his enterprising sex worker mother. More enjoyable still are the film’s corrupt policemen; the louche, stockinged, pipe-smoking Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult) and virile cartoon villain Sergeant O’Neil (Charlie Hunnam)."
"After an awards season marked by its predictability, the Oscars delivered a spectacular final-reel twist on Sunday evening, naming capitalist satire Parasite best picture. Bong Joon-ho’s comedy-drama about an impoverished family who infiltrate the household of a wealthier one is the first film not in the English language to take the top prize. It also took best director, best original screenplay and best international film. Sam Mendes’s 1917 had been tipped to rule triumphant at this year’s Academy Awards, following its key victories at the Baftas, Golden Globes and crucial bellwethers such as the Producers Guild Awards. In the event, the harrowing first world war drama took three awards: for Roger Deakins’ cinematography and for its visual effects and sound mixing. Bong’s film also defeated Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Jojo Rabbit and The Irishman to best picture. It marks the first time in 65 years – since Marty in 1955 – that the winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes has progressed to a best picture Oscar.  Bong paid tribute to Scorsese in his best director speech, saying that, when he was young, he “carved deep into my heart” a quote by Scorsese: “The most personal is the most creative.” He also thanked Tarantino for championing his work: “Quentin, I love you.” When the film won best picture, Bong gave the microphone to the film’s producers Kwak Sin-ae and Miky Lee. Kwak said she felt “a very opportune moment in history is happening right now”, and Lee paid tribute to Bong, praising his “crazy hair, the way he talks, the way he walks … and especially the way he directs”. She then thanked the Korean cinemagoing public for “never hesitating to give us straightforward opinions that made us never about to be complacent, and to keep pushing the envelope.” Only 10 foreign-language films have previously been nominated for best picture – including Amour and Life Is Beautiful – but none of them won. Last year, many thought Alfonso Cuaron’s autobiographical drama Roma might take best picture as well as director, but it was pipped to the post by Green Book. That result was not well received, with many people feeling the Academy’s strenuous attempts to diversify were undermined by the celebration of a film whose approach to race relations seems more suited to its 60s setting than to 2019. Such fallout – coupled with the backlash to the fact only one person of colour (Harriet’s Cynthia Erivo) was nominated for an acting award – could help explain Parasite’s unprecedented win. Voters are eager to prove their inclusivity, and that they don’t fear what Bong called at the Golden Globes “the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles”. Almost every person who took to the stage during the ceremony alluded to this year’s dominant controversy, with Janelle Monáe’s opening musical medley seeking to highlight ethnically diverse films, and rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar giving an earnest midway recap of the evening’s inclusivity credentials. Opening presenter Chris Rock made blunt reference to what was missing from this year’s director nominees: “vaginas”. Lead actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a string of politically charged acceptance speeches – including his attack on the “systemic racism” of the film industry at last Sunday’s Baftas – with an impassioned call to arms, imploring people to stop fighting and to stop exploiting one another, the planet and the other species living on it. “I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world,” he said. “Many of us are guilty of an egocentric worldview, and we believe that we’re the centre of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.” He closed his emotional address by quoting a lyric written aged 17 by his late brother, River: “Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.” Phoenix was a much-anticipated victor in the best actor category, for his role as a mentally ill aspirant comedian in Joker; likewise Renée Zellweger being named best actress for her performance in the Judy Garland biopic raised few eyebrows. The supporting actor races also unfolded as expected, with Brad Pitt and Laura Dern winning for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story, respectively. Both thanked their parents and their children, with Pitt straying into politics to mention that his 45-second speech was 45 seconds more than the time afforded to John Bolton by the senate in Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. Elsewhere, Taika Waititi proved a popular presence both on stage – where he dedicated his trophy for best adapted screenplay for Jojo Rabbit to “all the Indigenous kids all over the world” – and backstage. It was there he offered a commentary on contemporary far-right extremism, saying that, at the end of the second world war: “if you were at Nazi, you would go to jail. Now you’re a Nazi, feel free to have a rally down in the square with your mates.”"
"When the Oscar-winning British costume designer Sandy Powell found herself with a Bafta nomination for The Irishman, she thought: “What on earth am I going to wear?” What she ended up creating was not just a unique walking work of art, but also a way of helping preserve the former home of her mentor and close friend, Derek Jarman, the late film-maker, artist and LGBTQ+ activist. In keeping with the Bafta theme of sustainable fashion, Powell chose to hit the red carpet in a cream suit toile – a calico template from an earlier designer suit. Powell, a three-time Oscars and Baftas winner, said: “Then I thought: ‘It’s like a blank canvas. I could go armed with a pen, and get signatures. And maybe we could auction it.” And so it was that she dreamed up a way to help save Prospect Cottage, Jarman’s home on the windswept shore of Dungeness, Kent, which he had transformed from a Victorian fisherman’s hut and from where he created some of his best work. Powell strode forth among A-list celebrities at the London Critics’ Circle and Bafta awards to secure the signatures of more than 100 Hollywood stars and luminaries from the film and theatre industry. “I think I’ve done pretty well. I’ve got Robert de Niro, Al Pacino, Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, Renée Zellweger, Laura Dern … I’ve got all the winners, so far,” she said. “But I need to get Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. There are a few big names missing.” So this weekend, she and the suit will head across the Atlantic to the Oscars. “I won’t wear it to the ceremony itself, but maybe to one of the parties. But I definitely want to get Martin Scorsese, who has agreed to do it,” she said. Some parts of the anatomy are less signature-friendly than others. Richard E Grant had to kneel down on the red carpet to add his name, while Gwendoline Christie found herself signing Powell’s inner leg. “I was quite choosy about who signed where,” said Powell, who has won Oscars for Shakespeare in Love, The Aviator and The Young Victoria. The result is a unique piece to be auctioned through the Art Fund charity, which is trying to raise £3.5m in 10 weeks to save Prospect Cottage and its stunning garden. Expressions of interest can be registered at development@artfund.org with details of the auction still to be announced. “It’s not just important as a piece of history, but also to preserve his legacy,” said Powell, who became close friends with Jarman after he hired her to work on Caravaggio. “It is so important Derek doesn’t get forgotten, and that he can continue to inspire young film-makers, artists and writers.” Jarman moved to the cottage in 1986, turning it into an artwork in its own right, filling the garden with sculptures made from flotsam and jetsam. After his death in 1994, it was cared for and maintained by his long-time companion Keith Collins, who died in 2018. The artist Tacita Dean and actor Tilda Swinton approached the Art Fund to come to the rescue. The £3.5m is needed to purchase, preserve and maintain the property as a place for artist residencies and public access. Creative Folkestone, an arts charity, will manage and maintain it. Jarman’s archive of documents and artefacts will also be available to the public at Tate Britain. Art Fund spokeswoman Rachel Mapplebeck said: “Derek Jarman’s Prospect Cottage is really a work of art in its entirety. The cottage is full of works of art by him and his friends. There are props from film sets. It’s surrounded by this incredible garden, which he created from the shingle beach.” Half of the £3.5m has been raised by private donors. The remainder is being crowdfunded through the Art Fund website, with many artists offering rewards in exchange for donations. Powell “hasn’t the faintest idea” how much her suit could raise. But she said: “It would be nice if it ended up in a museum, or somewhere where other people could see it.”"
"Here’s a deeply uncool, almost embarrassingly un-rock’n’roll Doors documentary; it’s unlikely to get toes a-tapping let alone light a fire. It’s essentially a filmed gig, reuniting the two surviving Doors, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore, on stage with assorted members of Foo Fighters, Jane’s Addiction, Stone Temple Pilots and more filling in for Jim Morrison and keyboardist Ray Manzarek. The hits comes thick and fast, tightly arranged and slickly performed, but this lineup of well-preserved mostly male musicians gives the show the bland atmosphere of a celebrity tribute band. The gig is dedicated to Manzarek, who died in 2013, and director Justin Kreutzmann pads out the gig footage with an interview the keyboardist gave and fresh input from Krieger and Densmore. The pair genially repeat anecdotes for the 1,000th time: how they met Manzarek at a transcendental meditation course and how they were initially underwhelmed by Morrison, then an insecure, shy kid. Still, some of the stories deserve repeating, such as the one about the time Morrison dropped acid before going on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, and spent the first few minutes picking at the AstroTurf. In archive footage, the sound on mute, we see him later at that same gig, whirling and howling, beautiful and unhinged. That energy is not matched at the tribute gig, though guest singer Andrew Watt, with a preening performance of LA Woman, does a fair imitation of Morrison’s messiah complex, if not his appeal. Speaking to camera, Densmore glosses over his longrunning feud with Krieger over touring as the Doors without Morrison. At the time he is on record as saying: “It can’t be the Doors without Jim. It could be the Windows, the Hinges, I don’t care, as long as it’s not the Doors.” Watching this film, you might agree.  The Doors Break on Thru: A Celebration of Ray Manzarek is released in the UK on 7 February and in Australia on 12 February."
"Not so long ago, I made plans to attend the Oscars. Whenever I mentioned this to people, you could measure their excitement in decibels. They’d scream. They’d shake. They’d generally behave like the extended family of an X Factor contestant who’d just been informed that they had qualified for bootcamp. It was terrifying. I never made it to the Oscars in the end. But this year I got another chance to experience the same sort of starstruck hysteria by attending the Baftas. Except things didn’t quite work out that way. “I’m going to the Baftas,” I’d tell people, and without fail they’d sort of screw up their nose in disappointment. If you’ve ever seen a child open a birthday card to discover that there isn’t any money in it, you’ll understand. It doesn’t make sense, because on paper the Baftas and the Oscars are basically the same thing. The same films are nominated. The same films win. The same people attend, for crying out loud. Attend the Baftas and you’re mixing with the same mix of A-list talent that attends the Oscars, albeit here they’re scared and freezing because they didn’t do a good job of figuring out what to wear in London in February. But still, in the eyes of many, the Baftas still feel a little bit like a booby prize. The reason for this, I think, is a simple one. The Baftas are a little bit rubbish. They’re dismal to watch on television. They’re slung out half-arsed on BBC One without any sort of televised red carpet coverage. And because they’re not shown live, the ceremony ends up occupying an unpleasant hinterland. If you care about awards season, you won’t watch the Baftas because you’ve already got the winners off Twitter. And if you don’t care about awards season, you won’t watch the Baftas because you don’t care about awards season. The ceremony itself can be hard to love, too. Last year’s show, for instance, was preposterously stupid. Whatever enthusiasm anyone had remaining after the bizarre Nasa-themed interpretive dance opener – presumably booked back when people thought First Man would be a contender – was roundly kicked to death by Joanna Lumley’s aggressively terrible rapid fire anti-joke rat-a-tat. (Of BlacKkKlansman she said: “I’m surprised that it did so well at the Klan film festival.”) As a result, viewers are shedding the Baftas like fleas from a dead dog. Last year’s show was watched by half a million fewer people than the year before, which would have been a shock had it not tracked against an overall longterm decline. But maybe we’ve all been missing something. Maybe the televised Baftas only tell half the story. Maybe there’s a whole world of excitement happening offscreen. Maybe you really have to be there in the flesh, in your best clothes, absorbing all the star wattage, to truly understand what they’re about. From my visit on Sunday, I’d argue that you do. Sort of. Going to the Baftas reveals an awful lot about the Baftas that you don’t get from the television coverage. The red carpet, for instance, looks incredibly glamorous on TV; a long, slow procession of the most beautiful people on Earth at their most beautiful, being adored by a legion of screaming fans. And in reality there really is lots of screaming on the red carpet. It just doesn’t necessarily come from the fans. Because here’s what happens as soon as anyone sets foot on any red carpet in 2020. They stop walking. They turn around. They grab their phones. And they take, conservatively, several billion selfies. Everyone does this. An entire Albert Hall’s worth of people, all stopping and turning around and taking selfies for the internet. The entire Baftas red carpet is now just a weaponised hell-run of constant selfie-taking. And the people who bear the brunt of this narcissism are the security guards, who spend their entire evenings yelling things like “That’s enough selfies now ladies and gentlemen”, and “If we could all just start to make our way up the red carpet”, and “PLEASE STOP TAKING SELFIES” to tuxedo duckface adult humans who have chosen to become their own paparazzi. “Try this at Cannes and you’d be rugby tackled to the ground,” a friend whispered as we attempted to navigate the mess. Inside the Albert Hall, though, things are different. When it starts to fill up, and when the stars take their seats in little clusters by the aisles, it’s hard to deny that there’s an energy you cannot hope to replicate on TV. You see little glimpses of personality sneak out from behind the personas. While on television you only got to see cutaway shots of dour-faced Quentin Tarantino, in the flesh you saw him happily chatting to friends before the show started. You could see nervous gulps, stifled yawns, distracted phone-checking. When Bombshell won for best makeup, and Anne Morgan’s dress briefly became tangled up in her chair, the first person in the entire auditorium to offer help was Laura Dern. That’s the glimpse of personality that I got from Laura Dern, the sense that Laura Dern is a saint among us and deserves nothing but good things from the world. But god, in their unedited form the Baftas are long. And god, your bottom really does start to get numb. The two standing ovations given to talent on Sunday – one for Andy Serkis and one for Kathleen Kennedy – felt to me less like spontaneous demonstrations of professional respect and more like a strategic opportunity for people to allow blood back into the lower half of their bodies for the first time in 90 minutes. Also, I couldn’t help but feel that the royal family came out of it especially badly. After three hours of being presented with beautiful, funny, talented winners and presenters, it felt like a horrible thud when Prince William charisma-sponged all the air out of the room by repeating a toothless version of Joaquin Phoenix’s speech in a flat monotone. Now that Harry has bolted for a lifetime of conventional celebrity, it’s probably time to start asking what the royals are actually for. On the basis of the Baftas, that question might not have an answer. Once the ceremony ended, and the winners were invited back on stage for one final photograph, the best part of the entire evening happened. Everyone was shoved outside to be bundled into a standing row of gussied-up National Express-style coaches, waiting to transport us all to the aftershow dinner. Seriously: take that, the Oscars. You might have glitz and glamour and perfect weather and global attention, but ask yourself this: do you have a rail replacement bus service for the nominees? No, you do not. One-nil to the Baftas. Also, I don’t know if this was standard across the entire Bafta fleet, but our bus driver treated us to a 20-minute deadpan standup set during our trip, that bordered on outright abuse. One joke he told was this: “Are you stars? You’re not stars. Whoever told you that you were stars was lying.” If that wasn’t the case – if I was on the only bus to actively heckle its passengers – then I would strongly suggest rolling it out as standard next year. And then it was dinner, which I have chosen to interpret as a reminder on behalf of the universe that I am not nearly as special as I think I am. Imagine, if you will, a table plan that resembles the solar system. In the middle you have the sun, a cluster of all the biggest names whose gravitational pull holds the whole thing together. Then, orbiting that, you have the supplementary players; the presenters and winners and guests whose appearance was counted as a highlight by the powers that be. And then on the outskirts of that, you have sponsors and their guests, along with other monied well-wishers. And then there’s a flight of stairs, and more tables, and then another bunch of stairs that mark the frozen outer edges of the solar system. And then, beyond that, there was me. On table 177. In short, I was Pluto. Yes, I was wearing a bow-tie. Yes, I was technically eating food in the same room as Charlize Theron. But nevertheless, scientists will spend decades arguing whether or not I qualified as actually taking part in the Baftas dinner. Genuinely, the only people sitting further away from the action than me were the people who wrote Graham Norton’s monologue. “Someone hates you,” a friend told me when she saw where I was sitting. She had been sitting on table 47. Imagine. By the time our food was served, the stars had already upped and left for the afterparty. By the time I got to the afterparty, the stars had bounced on to the Netflix party, because that’s where Rihanna was. And, quite honestly, who could blame them? If the Baftas taught me one thing above anything else, it’s that being famous looks quite pants. Not only were the stars screamed at and scrutinised for the entire duration of the evening, but it’s easy to forget that the Baftas were just another stop-off on a rolling thunder revue of an awards season for them. Sunday was the Baftas. Saturday was the WGA awards. Thursday was the Artios awards, Wednesday the visual effects awards, Tuesday the Costume Designers Guild awards, Monday the Oscars luncheon. All these events come with their own set of expectations; red carpets, monologues, polite applause, dinners that have been designed to feed a thousand people at once. It looks exhausting, and not in the least bit fun. And the feeding frenzy that follows them around is absurd. As I left the dinner, all the selfie-takers from earlier were tearing apart the table displays so that they could go home with a trinket. One man almost lost his balance yanking a plastic peach from a table that Scarlett Johansson may or may not have touched. It was like watching people trying to rescue their loved ones from a burning house. It looked like looting. And that’s the moral I’m taking from the Baftas. Make something good and you have to dedicate three months of your life to this sort of idiocy. Here’s to a lifetime of mediocrity."
"A funny thing happened on the way to my eighth screening at this year’s Sundance film festival. Like many major lineups, it’s front-loaded with most of the biggest premieres taking place within the first weekend and almost three full days in, I’d seen some of the buzziest titles to be unveiled. I was walking with a fellow critic, recounting what I’d seen and I figured out that thus far, I’d only seen one film directed by a man. This might not seem to the casual observer to be an earth-shaking realisation but having attended film festivals for the last six years while also reporting on the lack of behind-camera diversity shown by schedulers, this felt like the sea change many had been waiting for. By the end of the festival, having seen 19 films, only four were directed by white men while 12 were from women. To put it in perspective, when I attended Toronto film festival in 2019, out of the 20 films I saw, only five were from female film-makers. What made the shift feel even more notable is that the films I’d selected to see, out of a migraine-giving 188 titles, were all top-tier, mostly playing within competition. In previous festivals, women had often been relegated to the outskirts, making smaller films for smaller audiences. But this year, just months after the directors of the Venice film festival came under fire for including only two films directed by women in the main competition strand, they’d been deservedly and belatedly allowed into the spotlight and the films they carried with them showcased a wide variety of genres, experiences and themes. I’d seen Elisabeth Moss in Shirley, a feverish semi-fictional portrait of the author Shirley Jackson from Madeline’s Madeline director Josephine Decker, a weighty and emotionally impactful fact-based drama called Worth starring Michael Keaton as the lawyer tasked with divvying out the 9/11 compensation fund from The Kindergarten Teacher’s Sara Colangelo, Carey Mulligan’s deliriously entertaining turn as a woman fighting back against rape culture in Killing Eve showrunner Emerald Fennell’s dark comedy Promising Young Woman and first-time Japanese-Australian writer-director Natalie Erika James’s effective Jake Gyllenhaal-produced horror Relic. Arguably the most talked-about film going into the festival was Zola, based on the viral tweet chain from 2015 about a stripper pulled into a lurid web of sex and crime in Florida. It was originally set to be directed by James Franco but after accusations of sexual misconduct, the project found itself in the hands of Lemon director Janicza Bravo, a woman of colour, whose ownership of the film felt fitting given the circumstances, as did her decision to use a female editor, cinematographer and production designer. The strong showing for women at this year’s Sundance also felt fitting, given recent happenings. Just last month the Academy had been criticised for yet again nominating an entirely male set of film-makers for the best director Oscar despite the awards conversation including more female-directed films than ever, including Hustlers, The Farewell, Honey Boy, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Clemency and Little Women. It was especially galling given the results of a just-released study that showed that in the last 12 months there was a record-breaking number of films directed by women making it into the top-grossing titles of the year, including two of 2019’s 10 most successful global releases. The lineup has jump-started the year with a bold statement to the industry with 44% of the 188 films directed by one or more women, 34% directed by one or more film-maker of colour and 15% from one or more director from the LGBTQ+ community. Looking ahead, it’s a sign of things to come. This month sees the Berlin film festival kick off with six of its 18 competition films boasting a credited female director, representing a 33% proportion, compared with Cannes last year with 19% and Venice with 9%. “Six films … is not 50/50, but it’s a good path to reach 50/50,” said the artistic director, Carlo Chatrian. Further into the mainstream and it’s looking like the biggest year to date for women at the multiplex as well. For the first time, a woman will bring a live-action Disney remake to the screen in the shape of Mulan and there will also be a record four superhero films directed by women, including this month’s Birds of Prey and Marvel’s hopeful franchise-starter The Eternals. The last week also saw producer Kathleen Kennedy state that the Star Wars franchise will “absolutely” be hiring a woman to take the reins of a future chapter. The landscape appears more encouraging than usual but it remains an industry that closes doors on women faster than men. “I think that people look at male directors and say, ‘Oh, he did that – let’s throw him into a bigger ring and see what happens,’” said documentarian Liz Garbus at Sundance, premiering her first narrative film Lost Girls. “With a woman, it’s like, ‘Oh, she did this – maybe she can do this kind of thing again.’ I think there’s the belief of possibility in a male director that is still circumscribed when that person is a woman.” We’re mere days away from this year’s Oscars, a race dominated by male narratives written and directed by men, from 1917 to The Irishman to Joker to Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. But if this year’s Sundance lineup and a look ahead at the year’s biggest releases shows us anything, it’s that this might not be the case in 2021 because for now, the future is looking just a little bit more female."
"The documentary about several women who have accused Russell Simmons of sexual abuse, has found a distributor after Oprah Winfrey’s exit from the film left it in the lurch. HBO Max on Monday said it acquired Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering’s film, On the Record, following its premiere last week at the Sundance Film Festival. Along with other stories, On the Record tracks the decision of music executive Drew Dixon to publicly state that her then-boss Simmons raped her at his New York home in 1995. Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, has denied all accusations of sexual abuse. Dixon first went public about her accusations in 2017, alleging the mogul raped her in 1995. Two women later came forward with similar experiences. On the Record had been set to be released by Apple TV Plus, with Winfrey as an executive producer. But in the weeks ahead of the film’s Sundance premiere, Winfrey departed the film because she said she that while she believed Dixon, she felt more reporting was needed on her story. Winfrey has publicly defended her decision to drop out of the documentary. She admitted Simmons had previously tried to influence her decision to act as executive producer, saying, “He did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me.” In a January CBS Morning News interview, Winfrey passionately argued Simmons’ pleas had not influenced her ultimate decision. “This is not a victory for Russell,” she said. “I unequivocally say that I did not pull out because of Russell. This is not a victory lap for him. I cannot be silenced by a Russell Simmons after all I’ve been through.” Yet On the Record made a strong impression at Sundance, where standing ovations greeted Dixon and other accusers, including Sil Lai Abrams and Sheri Hines. Critics called the film a powerful documentary that brings issues of race into #MeToo discussions. On the Record comes only a year after HBO aired Leaving Neverland. That documentary saw two men share allegations of childhood sexual abuse against the late musician Michael Jackson. The documentary sparked a cultural reckoning over the pop star’s legacy. The singer’s estate sued HBO and the documentary’s producers in an ongoing court case. “The fierce determination of Drew Dixon and all the women who bravely chose to share their stories in On the Record moved us profoundly,” said Sarah Aubrey, head of original content at HBO Max, in a statement."
"Joaquin Phoenix’s powerful broadside against the body that awarded him the best actor prize on Sunday night has met with a chorus of praise across the film industry. In his speech, Phoenix said he felt conflicted by his victory “because so many of my fellow actors who are deserving don’t have that same privilege”. He added: “We send a very clear message to people of colour that ‘you’re not welcome here.’” The all-white acting nominees announced by Bafta last month provoked uproar, with the hashtag #BaftasSoWhite once more trending and some fearing this year’s ceremony might face a boycott. “I don’t think anybody wants a handout or preferential treatment,” continued Phoenix. “People just want to be acknowledged and appreciated and respected for their work. “I’m ashamed to say that I’m part of the problem, because I’ve not ensured that the sets I’ve worked on are inclusive. He added: “We have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. It is the obligation of the people who have created and benefit from the system of oppression to be the ones to dismantle it. So that’s on us.” Phoenix’s words were met by what Lulu Wang – the director of Chinese-American drama The Farewell, which was nominated for best original screenplay – called “an uncomfortable silence … for a long noticeable moment”. The Great Hack’s Carole Cadwalladr, the Observer reporter, also expressed admiration for Phoenix’s use of the podium to put forward uncomfortable views. Across Twitter, the actor’s speech was hailed variously as pertinent, essential and the most important moment of the evening. Phoenix, 45, who is the frontrunner to take the best actor Oscar next Sunday, spent the morning of the Baftas campaigning for a meat-free world with protesters on Tower Bridge. Earlier in the evening, both host Graham Norton and awards presenter Rebel Wilson took aim at the lack of diversity being celebrated. Norton called 2019 “the year when white men finally broke through”, and referred to Phoenix’s film Joker – which led the pack with 11 nominations – as “the story of a white man who makes himself even whiter”. In his closing remarks, Prince William, Bafta’s president, alluded to the controversy, saying that, not for the first time, “we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and the awards process. That simply cannot be right in this day and age.” One of the evening’s most popular winners was Micheal Ward, the Top Boy and Blue Story actor who won the rising star award. Meanwhile, Korea’s Bong Joon-ho took two gongs, including best original screenplay, while adapted screenplay went to Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi, who is of Maori descent."
"Sam Mendes’s nerve-shredding war drama 1917 was the big winner at the 2020 Bafta film awards, on an evening when the movie industry’s diversity problem hovered ominously in the background. 1917, which tells the story of two young soldiers sent on a perilous, near-impossible mission to prevent an otherwise certain massacre, won seven Baftas including best film and outstanding British film, best director for Mendes, sound, production design, special visual effects and, for Roger Deakins, best cinematography – his fifth Bafta. In the lead acting categories, Joaquin Phoenix won for Joker and Renée Zellweger was given her third career Bafta for Judy. The preamble to this year’s ceremony was dominated by complaints about the the lack of diversity. Bafta itself expressed “disappointment” and “frustration” after the nominations were made without any actors of colour in the main acting categories, and no women up for best director. But more than words are needed, many in the film industry believe. Steve McQueen told the Guardian that the awards risked becoming “irrelevant, redundant and of no interest or importance” unless action were taken. Cynthia Erivo, a glaring omission in many eyes, after her much-praised performance in Harriet, was asked to perform her song Stand Up from the film at the ceremony. She said no, speaking of her disappointment at the lack of representation. The #BaftasSoWhite outcry was tackled directly by Phoenix in his acceptance speech. He said he was appreciative but conflicted, “because so many of my fellow actors that are deserving don’t have that same privilege”. He added: “I think we send a very clear message to people of colour that you are not welcome here, people who have contributed so much to our medium and our industry.” Prince William, Bafta’s president, also alluded to the controversy in his closing remarks, saying that, not for the first time, “we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and the awards process. That simply cannot be right in this day and age.” He said Bafta officials shared his frustration and continue to work “tirelessly” to make sure creative talent is discovered and supported. He added that a full review of the awards process would take place. Before that, the closest anyone got to anything approaching controversy was Taika Waititi, accepting the best adapted screenplay award for Jojo Rabbit. “Coming from the colonies,” it was good, he said, to “take a little bit of your gold back home where it belongs.” Rebel Wilson, presenting the best director award, acidly remarked she could just not do what the nominees did. “Honestly, I just don’t have the balls.” The awards by and large went to the people predicted by pundits and bookies. 1917 was the biggest winner, but the Bafta record of nine, for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1971, remains intact. Phoenix was a shoo-in for best actor, with William Hill offering unappealing odds of 1/25 on. Bafta voters obliged, choosing him from the all-white shortlist that also contained Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Taron Egerton and Jonathan Pryce. Joker, a supervillain origins story, had led the pack going in to the ceremony, with 11 nominations. That delighted many but left some baffled, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw describing it as “a mediocre and overrated film… which has less interest than the viral video of the Portsmouth kebab shop fight.” In the end, Joker came away with three awards, including best original score and the first ever Bafta for casting. Zellweger, who returned to acting in 2016 after a six-year break, was also odds-on favourite to win for Judy. Her portrayal of Judy Garland, in the final, calamitous year of her life, had been widely praised. Brad Pitt continued his awards season success, winning best supporting actor for his role in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood – although he was unable to continue his run of well-scripted, funny and modest acceptance speeches, as “family obligations” kept him away from the London ceremony. Instead, Margot Robbie read his speech: “Hey Britain, heard you just became single … welcome to the club. Wishing you the best with the divorce settlement.” Pitt, she said, would name the Bafta “Harry … because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.” The Netflix film Marriage Story won one Bafta: best supporting actress for Laura Dern, who plays the tough-talking and brilliant divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw. The Irishman, also backed by Netflix, had been nominated for 10 prizes but left empty-handed. The ceremony was presented for the first time by Graham Norton, a safe pair of hands enlisted after Joanna Lumley’s much criticised spell in the role. He went down well on the whole – though he was not to all tastes. Norton said he was proof that there was more than one Irishman there who “seems to go on and on”. Cut to a stony-faced Al Pacino. As part of Bafta’s efforts to be a more sustainable organisation, single-use plastic was banned and guests were asked to think harder about what they wore. That could mean wearing something they had worn before, going down the clothes-hire route, or choosing a designer with green credentials. Andy Serkis received an award for outstanding British contribution to cinema for his pioneering performance motion-capture work creating characters such as Gollum in Lord of the Rings, Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboots and the big gorilla in King Kong. Bafta’s highest award, the fellowship, went to the producer Kathleen Kennedy whose stellar roster of films spans from ET to last year’s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker."
"Bafta likes to think of itself as a cut above its American counterparts, in terms of classiness at least, if not actual importance. Our world-beating film industry might have blurred into Hollywood more than we would like to admit, but I think you’ll find we Brits invented the “black tie” dress code. And the president of our esteemed institution is the second in line to the throne, no less. And we’ve got the Royal Albert Hall. Beat that, “Hollywood royalty”. But when Bafta’s royal figurehead is giving the institution a royal ticking off, you know they’ve got problems. At Sunday’s ceremony, Prince William addressed the elephant in the hall: the overwhelming whiteness and maleness of this year’s nominees. His speech was surprisingly direct: “In 2020, and not for the first time in the last few years, we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and in the awards process – that simply cannot be right in this day and age.” Considering the house of Windsor’s own issues embracing diversity lately, Prince William’s comments could put him in contention for the “biggest stone thrown from glassiest house” award. More than one presenter slipped in a gag about “Megxit”. Meanwhile, Rebel Wilson’s line about the “Royal Andrew Hall” had Wills and Kate squirming in their seats. Like the royal family, and perhaps post-Brexit Britain itself, the words and the deeds aren’t quite aligning for Bafta. While it seeks to project the image of a modern, global, inclusive institution, the reality suggests something altogether more insular, guided by outdated traditions and prejudices. Ironic that the trophy itself is shaped like a mask. No disrespect to Sam Mendes’s 1917, which won best film, best British film and best director, but it is exactly the kind of movie that pushes Bafta’s buttons: well-trodden British history done with a twist, filled with familiar faces (predominantly of the white male variety), cursory nod to representation with the inclusion of a Sikh character. Arguably, it has not been a vintage year for performances by actors of colour, especially in British cinema, although this a bit of a Catch-22 argument – diverse talent won’t flourish if Bafta doesn’t recognise it; Bafta can’t recognise diverse talent if it isn’t there. But how to account for the lack of love for Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir, a quintessentially British drama of the highest order and Sight & Sound magazine’s best film of 2019. It received not a single nomination, not even in the outstanding British film category, which raises serious questions about how cine-literate the membership of this esteemed institution really is. Even the introduction of a Bafta for casting this year backfired somewhat. Casting is one area of the industry where women traditionally dominate – which could go some way to explaining why it never had an award of its own before. Bafta had an opportunity to really make a statement here, since the boldest nominee on the list was The Personal History of David Copperfield, a movie whose radical colour-blind casting both reinvigorated a familiar old story and reflected the very modern, multicultural Britain Bafta is always banging on about. Instead, the winner on the night was … Joker. Once again, hands will be wrung and fingers pointed. In response to this year’s debacle, Prince William announced, Bafta had launched “a full and thorough review of the entire awards process”. It has done this before. In 2016, Bafta set new diversity criteria for its British film and writer categories, intended to encourage inclusion on screen and off. Clearly they’re not working yet. And certainly there are deeper structural problems behind British cinema’s lack of diversity than just the awards.  Modernising doesn’t happen overnight. But in today’s Britain it’s becoming less a question of rates of progress as how much we really want it at all."
"A US movie studio group behind blockbusters including Venom, Jumanji and Godzilla is to build a £150m Hollywood-style production complex in Reading, creating as many as 3,000 jobs. Atlanta-based Blackhall Studios is to build and run the studio, which it says will be the third-largest in the UK. It will be located in the Thames Valley Science Park, which is owned by the University of Reading. The construction of a new state-of-the-art film studio, which aims to be up and running by 2022 subject to planning consent being granted this year, comes as the UK struggles to keep up with the demand for studio space as TV companies, film studios and the streaming giants such as Netflix pour billions into making content. There has been a rush by commercial companies to build more studio space in recent years but this one is unusual in that the British government has been working with Blackhall Studios over the last year to help secure a site. “The UK and the US are each other’s largest investors and this announcement demonstrates the strength of our trading relationship,” said Liz Truss, the international trade secretary. Truss used the deal as evidence that the UK is capable of striking a wider trade agreement with the US post Brexit. “I look forward to negotiating and signing a new ambitious free trade agreement with the US, to ensure we can continue to deepen our trading relationship and grow our creative industries,” she said. Last month, the British Film Institute revealed that a record £3.6bn was spent making the likes of the next James Bond film, No Time To Die, and Sam Mendes’s 1917, and high-end TV programmes such as the BBC’s His Dark Materials and Netflix’s The Crown, in the UK. In December, the US TV giant Comcast, which owns Sky and NBCUniversal, the company behind The Fast and The Furious maker Universal Studios, announced plans to build a European production base in Elstree, north London. Last year, Netflix struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton, home to films including Alien and Mary Poppins Returns. Netflix is spending about $500m (£385m) on making shows and films in the UK this year. Disney, which recently launched its Disney+ streaming service in a number of international markets, has secured space at Pinewood Studios, home to Star Wars and James Bond."
"Were it not for the real-life tragedy and horror involved, this documentary could almost be a bleak and often hilarious black comedy. Film-maker Luke Lorentzen follows the crew of one of Mexico City’s dozens of private ambulances, guys who zoom recklessly through the streets to the site of an emergency, either directly called via the private medical insurance firm with whom the unfortunate person is insured, or after they have checked the police scanner alerting them to a likely disaster. One such crew is the Ochoa family, dad Fer at the wheel, teenage son Juan in overall charge and his kid brother Josué somewhat pointlessly along for the ride, confidently handling their dodgily maintained equipment. (Whether he should be in school is a moot point.) Often the guys will challenge a rival ambulance to a race to a possible job, almost screaming with excitement, with Juan shouting at cyclists and pedestrians to get out of their way through a loudhailer. And then ruthless Juan has to tell the sobbing victims and their friends how desperately serious it all is, how they need to take the patient to a certain superior private hospital (which might not be the closest) and how they should just “sign everything” when they arrive. Sometimes they don’t, which means Juan has to beg for the “emergency ride” fee of 3,800 pesos (£160) and he has no legal means of enforcing that without a signature. Incredibly, when a mother brings in her desperately injured daughter who dies en route, the Ochoas find themselves wheedling some money out of her. Yet somehow Lorentzen shows that it is not the Ochoa family who are the bad guys, but the whole rotten system; and the private-ambulance cowboys are themselves desperate for cash, having to spend a good deal on bribing the cops. This is what we could have to look forward to with a privatised NHS.  Midnight Family is released in the UK on 21 February."
"The further it recedes in the rearview mirror, the more last year’s Cannes competition looks like an exceptionally good vintage. This week, British cinema audiences can finally see the rapturous beauty of Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire for themselves, while Parasite, now with a history-making Oscar win to match its Palme d’Or, keeps racking up the numbers. That’s in addition to such standouts released last year as Atlantics, Pain and Glory and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, with plenty yet to come: only half of last year’s competition has yet been released at all. Mubi, of course, is helping out with some lower-profile treasures. They have ferocious Brazilian provocation Bacurau coming in cinemas and on streaming later in March. Better yet, however, they’ve just added Diao Yinan’s dazzling The Wild Goose Lake to their 30-day streaming menu. The best film at Cannes last year not to win any kind of prize at all, it’s also been sold a bit short by not getting a cinema release. Don’t let it pass you by, however: this Chinese film noir is an eye-popping, screen-filling vision that deserves wider attention. If the English-language title of Diao’s film sounds like a play of “wild goose chase”, that’s probably accidental, but also not inappropriate. In this pileup of double- and triple-crossings in the ganglands of a fictional, seedy Chinese town, the looping, labyrinthine plot often feels like an exceptionally ornate bluff. Gradually you realise that all the neon-lit beauty you take in while running Diao’s elegant, breathless obstacle course is the real point. It begins, like many a great noir, with a shadowed meeting between a hardened criminal and an aloof femme fatale. Zhou (the superbly stoic Hu Ge) is on the run from the law after killing a cop; prostitute Liu Aiai (Gwei Lun Mei) has come to deliver a message from his wife, but perhaps also has interest in the substantial price on his head. Further complexities unfold in flashback, as we learn how things unravelled for Zhou in a heist labelled “the Olympic Games of theft”: a madcap plan to steal a town’s worth of motorbikes in two hours. Diao’s film thrives on such demented details. Mistakes are made, spectacularly, and things get more and more tangled: if you lose the thread at some point and simply wallow in the film’s seamy, rain-soaked visual splendour and athletically choreographed action, that’s probably the idea, and you certainly won’t feel shortchanged. Though there’s a rich tradition of Asian thrillers that find lavish atmosphere in late-night noodle shops, bleak urban beaches and, perhaps more unusually, an after-hours zoo, they’re rarely presented with quite gravity-defying cinematic imagination. Revelling in hot pinks and sulphurous yellows, Diao and his ingenious cinematographer Dong Jinsong make a brilliant new world of this much-crossed terrain. This won’t be a revelation to anyone who’s seen Diao’s previous film, the 2014 Berlin Golden Bear winner Black Coal, Thin Ice, though any newly converted fans should make haste to it. It brings the same knotty storytelling and rich, blanketing atmosphere to the film-noir genre, but in a more sombre, charred visual register, with its wintry tale of a disgraced ex-cop pursuing the unsolved murder case that ended his career. The film is widely available to stream on such outlets as Amazon. More surprising is that Diao’s little-seen 2003 debut, Uniform, can be found streaming on Chili for a mere 90p. It’s a dark fable about a young factory worker who swipes a cop’s uniform from a laundrette and discovers the unearned power it wields when he slips it on. A simpler, scruffier study of inverted law and order than its successors, it’s a taut, witty treat in its own right – ripe for rediscovery as Diao’s luminous new film spreads its wings. Black and Blue (Sony, 15) A rookie cop goes on the run after witnessing a murder committed by corrupt boys in blue. Carried by a soulfully committed Naomie Harris, Deon Taylor’s old-school police thriller is spikier than generic outward appearances might suggest. Chained for Life (Anti-Worlds, 15) Ableism in Hollywood goes under the microscope in Aaron Schimberg’s pointed, cleverly metatextual satire, in which a conventionally beautiful movie star – playing the role of a blind person in a dubious disability drama – falls for her facially disfigured co-star. Terminator: Dark Fate (Fox, 15) After a run of desperate extensions to a mutated franchise, this back-to-basics return is a marked improvement, thanks largely to a front-and-centre role for 63-year-old Linda Hamilton’s resurgent Sarah Connor. But let’s leave things there, shall we? First Love (Signature, 15) Japanese genre workhorse Takashi Miike is so prolific that you can afford to skip several of his films in a row, but this cheerfully grisly Tokyo underworld caper is one of his keepers, stringing one beautifully staged knockabout action set piece after another. Studio Ghibli (Netflix) I discussed Netflix’s bonanza of films from the Japanese anime masters last month: a reminder that the second batch, including the essential Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, hits the service on Sunday."
"Our latest Guardian Documentary is an unusual collaboration. Three independent Belarusian film-makers reacted to the country-wide protests by turning their cameras on themselves and their communities. Taken together, these three portraits offer a rare glimpse into life in a country in the throes of political upheaval. Belarus has only ever had one president, and Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the position since 1994, declared victory again in elections on 9 August with a contested 80% of the vote. The widespread protests that followed have been ruthlessly suppressed by security forces. Filmed in the first 10 days after the disputed election, we see both pain and hope in the story of a film-maker, a psychologist and a broadcast journalist forced to retire. Here we talk to the three film-makers about making the documentary: How do you see your role as a film-maker at a time like this? Maksim Shved: I would call the situation in my country a time of breakthrough transformations or even revolution. It’s an interesting, albeit cruel moment, which as a film-maker I felt compelled to capture. Ekaterina Markavets: When I was waiting for my fellow film-maker, director Maksim Shved, to come out of prison after being arrested filming the protests, I met a psychologist there who came to the prison to offer people psychological help. It was 2am and there were many other volunteers there on the street near the prison. It really impressed me how people rallied around a common grief. Later I found out that Belarusian psychologists had united and opened a hotline to help people to receive psychological help for free. So I decided to make a film about empathy because when we empathise with each other, it becomes easier for us to overcome these difficult moments. I was also very interested to know how psychologists themselves feel, how do they cope with all the dramatic stories they hear during the day. Andrei Kutsila: I wasn’t planning to shoot a film about the events during the elections in Belarus – I don’t like political topics in films – but the violence by the authorities against civilians forced me to pick up my camera. And more personally, my sister and her husband were driving along in Minsk on 11 August when the car was suddenly shot at and rammed. They were detained and spent several days in a prison with about 11,000 other peaceful people. What else could I do but pick up my camera? Maksim, we see in your film (part 1) that you were arrested and held in prison. What was that experience like? MS: In the five days I was in prison it was an informational vacuum and I could not have imagined what I’d see when I got out. Hundreds of happy people welcomed our car with national flags. It was unbelievable. I was shocked and presumed the protesters had won, that the dictatorship was broken. However, I came to realise that it’s not that easy and Lukashenko is not going to renounce his power. Now after seven weeks of confrontation, the emotional rollercoaster for most people has ended. We understand that changes will not be quick, but that we need to preserve our energy for local everyday activities and the big Sunday marches. There is still a lot of energising creativity and solidarity. Andrei, in your film (part 3) we meet Ksenia Baharava, a grandmother and broadcast journalist who worked for state TV for nearly 40 years. We meet her in hospital, where she is recovering from significant injuries sustained at a protest. And yet she seems hopeful for the future? AK: Most people’s mood is going up and down, like mine. But more and more people understand that it is impossible to live with this president. His contract with society is broken, and yet he is still holding on to power. Violence has become his only tool. We all try to believe in the best and our hopes are heightened when more countries do not recognise Lukashenko as a legitimate president. Ekaterina, in your film (part 2) we see the results of this climate of fear and trauma through these conversations with psychologist Alexei Zarybov. EK: The heroes of my film reflect the general mood of Belarusians: we all seem to be standing above a thundercloud. Everyone has paranoia and many people have an irresistible desire to leave the country because our rights are violated as if they do not exist at all. I feel that Belarusians have become fearless because we understand that if we remain silent they will simply grind us to dust. The only thing that we have and that helps us survive now is an empathy for each other. People almost immediately agreed to let me film their therapy sessions. And it was important for me to show different stories: to film the mother of the beaten man as well as the man who was beaten; and the mother of two children who despite not being physically affected by the protests was preparing herself for emigration, which puts her in a moral dilemma but she feels unable to continue to live in Belarus. What is your hope for the future?  EK: It seems to me that the Belarusian authorities are trying to do everything to intimidate people. I hope that everything will change, the power will change, and people will be able to heal their traumas, survive all this stress ... and once again visit a psychologist to talk about the usual trials and tribulations of life, like falling in love or getting angry with their boss. I hope that soon we can get back to normal life. What impact do you hope this film will have? MS: I’ve shared my story to ask questions that I’m also putting to myself right now and to show there are no simple answers. I’m pleased that people in the world can hear a more inspiring story about Belarus than just it’s “the last dictatorship in Europe”. More about the film-makers: Maksim Shved was born in 1979 in Minsk, Belarus. After graduating from Law Department of the Belarusian State University he decided to study directing. He graduated from St Petersburg high school of directors and dcreenwriters in 2013 and Wajda school (documentary programme) in 2016. Now he directs documentary series for television. Ekaterina Markavets was born in 1986 in Minsk, Belarus. She studied at Audio-Visual Journalism at the Belarusian State University. She began her career in documentary film with television journalism and has participated in many international workshops on documentary film directing. Andrei Kutsila was born in Baranovichi, Belarus in 1983. In 2007 he earned his degree in international journalism from the Belarusian State University and two years later he graduated from the Belarusian Academy of Fine Arts in Minsk. Since then he has collaborated with various producers and TV stations as a freelance filmmaker and participated in many international education programmes (including IDFAcademy and Berlinale Talents). In 2018 he won the IDFA award in the best medium-length documentary film category for Summa. You can read more of the Guardian’s coverage of Belaurs here. Watch more Guardian Documentaries here.

"‘Nudity seldom looks good, even on the young” was a maxim of the late Clive James that came into my mind while watching this enjoyable if self-consciously quirky black comedy, the debut feature from Tim Mielants, who so far has been directing TV, including episodes of Peaky Blinders. In a Belgian naturist campsite, deep in the woods, Patrick (Kevin Janssens) is a middle-aged man with learning difficulties who lives with his elderly parents. They own the site but must cooperate with a management board made up of the regular nudist campers. Poor Patrick lumbers sleepily around doing odd jobs; he is also having a borderline-abusive sexual relationship with a blasé woman whose husband is plotting to take over the camp. When Patrick’s father dies, his sense of shock and loss is transferred to the fact that one of his hammers is missing and he begins obsessively to ask all the residents if they know where it is. This bizarre displacement activity of quasi-grief opens up secrets in the group. The only person who seems to like Patrick is Nathalie (Hanna Hoekstra), the girlfriend of preening rock star Dustin (Jemaine Clement): they are the two non-nudist or nudist-refusenik campers. The simple spectacle of nakedness is startling here: it looks like a kind of costume or fancy dress, a parody of the sexiness that most movies invite us to associate with having no clothes on. And it is extraordinary how many of the men here are so out of shape. There is an extraordinary scene when two very large, unattractive men have a fight in a caravan with cataclysmic results, their tiny, shrivelled penises as vulnerable as baby birds."
"John Lewis, the civil rights leader turned 17-term congressman from Georgia, has seen plenty in his 80 years that would test one’s faith in the long fight. As a young man, Lewis, the third of 10 children from a sharecropping family in Alabama, led sit-ins to integrate lunch counters in Nashville, marched with Martin Luther King, and was beaten by the Klan as part of the Freedom Riders in the South Carolina; he’s been arrested over 40 times, five as a legislator, and spent months in jail. As congressman, he repeatedly defended the necessity of his signature civil rights achievement – the Voting Rights Act of 1965, for which he had his skull fractured by police crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Selma’s Bloody Sunday – only to see it stripped of its enforcement power by the supreme court in 2013, and further gutted as Republican legislatures enacted voter suppression laws in the last decade. He’s witnessed the election of Donald Trump, whom he has called “without a doubt” the “worst president for civil rights since the 1960s”. Now, as America convulses with the largest and most widespread protests for racial justice since the 1960s civil rights movement, as corporate America and cultural institutions reckon with their roles in systemic racism and segregation, as Black Lives Matter activists direct attention to how much has not changed since the days of Jim Crow legislation, a new film revisits and celebrates Lewis’s long fight. John Lewis: Good Trouble, directed by Dawn Porter in partnership with CNN films, a by-the-books documentary on a storied and heroic subject, ties Lewis’s oft-romanticized civil rights activism in the 1960s with his role as the “conscience of Congress” in over 30 years in the House. The film’s title derives form Lewis’s slogan (and, in recent years, hashtag) of getting in “good trouble” – non-violent agitation to direct attention to injustice, or to the shoddy foundation of the rules. Good Trouble toggles between Lewis’s work in the cauldron of the civil rights movement of the early 1960s and on the road in 2018, as he campaigned for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. Odes to Lewis often immediately reach back to his work in the 1960s, but footage from the campaign trail – Lewis bonding with an older black woman in Georgia about picking cotton as children, or invoking a crowd in Texas to get in good trouble with the steady passion of a seasoned preacher – demonstrate how “he’s still doing the work,” Porter told the Guardian. “That is not ancient history. It’s very much our present.” Lewis’s present, at least before his diagnosis with stage four pancreatic cancer in December 2019, is as a senior leader in the House of Representatives, and a role model and mentor for members of a diverse, progressive freshman class including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, all of whom testify to Lewis’s influence in the film (along with such veterans as Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and the late Elijah Cummings). “If John Lewis at 19, 20 wasn’t doing what he did, I wouldn’t be here today,” says Ocasio-Cortez. Lewis’s roots are not as a legislator so much as an agitator steeped in the principles of non-violence as a philosophy preached by the Rev James Lawson, whom Lewis discovered as a young man at Fisk University in Nashville. Good Trouble traces Lewis’s bone-deep commitment to non-violence as a practice – as a student activist in the Nashville sit-ins, as one of the 13 original Freedom Riders crisscrossing the south to expose the federal government’s passivity in enforcing desegregation of buses, as co-founder and chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) – from the early 1960s to the present, such as his leading role in a 26-hour sit-in at the Capitol to demand gun control legislation after the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando. In an echo of renewed commentary on the necessity of violence to command attention for change, Good Trouble revisits conflict within the fracturing 1960s civil rights movement, as Lewis was hesitant to cheer Black Power and ceded leadership of the SNCC to Stokely Carmichael, who considered non-violence a tactic rather than principle. In the film, Lewis recalls solidifying his desire to run for office upon the assassination of Robert F Kennedy, after which he experienced a depression, and “worried about what was happening in America”, according to Porter. “And I think when he came out of that, he took a long, hard look at himself,” what he has called an “executive session”, “and he decided that he had seen horrific things but he had also seen amazing power and strength in the collective humanity, and so that was the path he was going to follow and be guided. And I think he has not looked back from that.” Throughout Good Trouble, and in an interview this month with New York magazine in the wake of nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Lewis displays an unflappable optimism in the path forward, an unwavering belief in non-violence as principle, faith in “the conscience of the American people” when confronted and the ballot as “the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democratic society. The steadiness never wavered behind the scenes, either, according to Porter. Over the course of filming in 2018 and early 2019 – years in which a good, oh, 50 or so dispiriting, democracy death-spiral news cycles one-upped themselves – Lewis guided her “away from being reactive back to a proactive, ‘What do you want to accomplish? What do we need to do?’” she recalled. “After a while, I started to get the message, which is that if a John Lewis at 80 years old is optimistic and still believes in the goodness of people, that we ultimately will get to a place where there’s more members of a beloved community, that means something,” Porter said. “He’s seen so much in his life that could make him bitter. And that is just not who he is.” “He really focuses on a legislative opportunity, but he also thinks there’s a morality in government that should be part of the conversation,” Porter said. But she hoped the film, in which her camera finds Lewis joking with his sisters, talking with too many people in the airport and showing off a collection of ceramic chickens, shows Lewis’s “very subtle, wry humor”. “He is a very peaceful person. He is a person who has seen horrific things, but he can also appreciate life in its fullness.” Lewis frequently makes the call for Good Trouble but admits, in the film, to a deep fear: that one day he will wake up, and American democracy will be gone. It’s a fair question, given the flagrant transgressions and dog-whistling of the current administration, if that point is nearing, or gone. How would we know? “We’ve come too far, we’ve made too much progress, to slow down or to go back,” Lewis told New York in response to the fear. “So we must go forward.” Lewis’s public appearances have waned in the wake of his cancer diagnosis. But as he told Porter, staring unbowed at the camera: “As long as I have breath in my body, I will do what I can.”"
"Delroy Lindo has waited 25 years to work with Spike Lee again and Da 5 Bloods gives him one of the best roles of his career. But when he first read the script, the actor had a few questions about his character. Chiefly: “Does he have to be a Trump supporter?”  He says: “I remember saying to Spike, ‘I’ve got a 17-year-old son, man. I don’t want him seeing me representing this person.’” Like Lee, who routinely refers to Donald Trump as Agent Orange, Lindo can barely bring himself to identify the president by name. “It had to do with my values, as a parent and as a being on the planet, feeling that I would be representing an individual who is ... I don’t have the words to discuss this individual.” Couldn’t the character, he pleaded, just be an arch-conservative? “Spike thought about it for a few days, then said, ‘Yeah, I really need him to be a Trump supporter.’”  All the same, the role was just too good to pass up. Lindo plays Paul, one of four African American Vietnam veterans returning, in the modern day, to the country where they fought. Their stated aim is to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, played in flashbacks by Chadwick Boseman, but they have an ulterior motive, another plan that makes their mission much less laudable. As with Lee’s previous film, BlacKkKlansman, Da 5 Bloods is a combustible mix of tones and genres that only he could pull off, combining black history, crime thriller, war movie, character drama, even gory comedy. “Fundamentally,” says Lindo, “it’s a love story between these men.” Lee’s work is always relevant when it comes to African American issues, but arriving at this moment – with the US rocked by protests and riots over the killing of George Floyd – Da 5 Bloods resonates in ways even he could not have anticipated. The film highlights the disproportionate nature of the African American sacrifice in Vietnam: black people, it claims, made up 11% of the US population but 32% of troops. But it also feeds into issues of black patriotism, inequality and justice. In one flashback, in the Vietnamese jungle, the five comrades learn of the death of Dr Martin Luther King via Hanoi Hannah, the Vietcong propaganda radio broadcaster. She informs them of the widespread rioting back home, and the brutal government response. “Why you fight against us so far away from where you are needed?” she asks. Lee overlays her speech with archive clips of the 1968 riots. It looks a lot like this week’s news footage. Lindo agrees. He recently attended a rally and has been meeting with young people and sympathetic law enforcement in Oakland, where he lives, on the east side of San Francisco Bay. The rally was peaceful and diverse, he says, which at least gives him some hope that things have progressed since 1968. “The events of the last few days are brilliant examples of taking the hurt, fear, anxiety and rage – and focusing those things constructively, creatively and humanely, although I am not naive enough to think that things will change, even in the next six months. But I want to believe that the seeds have been planted.” Lindo, now 67, has a calm, authoritative bearing that tends to make everyone quieten down and listen. Over his 45-year career, he has had mostly smaller roles in big movies (Get Shorty, The Cider House Rules, Gone in 60 Seconds, Ransom) and bigger roles in smaller movies (baseball hero Satchel Paige in Soul of the Game, explorer Matthew Henson in Glory & Honour). But whatever it is that defines actorly “presence”, Lindo has got it. In real life, he is not so different - at least not in the context of a Zoom conversation from his home. He is serious and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. Most of the lighter-hearted questions I had prepared go unasked. High points on Lindo’s CV undoubtedly include the three films he made with Lee in the 90s: Malcolm X (in which he played the activist’s criminal mentor), Crooklyn (a struggling father), and Clockers (drug boss). Which poses the question: why did it take so long for them to work together again? “Ask Spike, god doggit!” Lindo says. “We’ve bumped into each other over the years, and I always say, ‘Spike, we really need to do something.’ And he says, ‘Yeah, yeah. We need to do something.’ But if I had to wait 25 years to work with Spike, this is a good one to have waited for.” Lindo plays the most complex and conflicted character of the piece. While his comrades, and Vietnam itself, have moved on from the war, Paul is still living with the trauma and anger, his red MAGA cap a symbol of his bitterness. He gets a striking straight-to-camera monologue towards the end that you can already see fitting into montages at awards ceremonies. Politics aside, Lindo had a great time making the film. Shooting in Thailand and Vietnam was a proper adventure: battle scenes, river journeys (cue Apocalypse Now reference), snakes, landmines, and literally hacking through the jungle with a machete. “Oh man. That’s gold for an actor! Getting that machete and – swish! It’s drama, it’s what we went to acting school for, absolutely.” Lindo doesn’t know any actual black Trump supporters, but he did manage to get his head around the concept. “I have a cousin who was in ’Nam and it still rankles him that he was reviled as a ‘baby-killer’. So if one extrapolates that kind of rejection, one can end up at a place where you say, ‘OK, here’s a man, Trump, who’s saying I’m going to make things right for Americans. I like what he’s saying.’” Lee, for his part, has justified the character on the grounds of both dramatic interest and political diversity. “All black people do not think alike,” he said recently. “We’re not one monolithic group.”  Lindo’s own identity is not straightforward. He was actually born in Lewisham, London, to parents of Jamaican origin (his ability to do a perfect accent helped land him the role of West Indian Archie in Malcolm X). He spent the first 12 years of his life in the UK before his mother, a nurse, emigrated to Canada then to San Francisco, where he studied acting. He still has an affection for Britain and returns often. In 2003’s Wondrous Oblivion, he played a cricket-loving Jamaican father in 1960s London. He asks about the gentrification of Peckham, worrying it will go the same way as Brixton. But he does not really feel British any longer. “Everything I have achieved in my life has come as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career in England. Never.” But he would love to work in the UK again. “There are many components of the black British experience that have not been explored. Is that an accurate thing for me to say?” He’s choosing his words carefully again. “I’m curious to unpack those stories. I have an intense interest in the Windrush period, because my mom was part of that.” Of course, he is familiar with the recent Windrush scandal, in which black British citizens were wrongfully detained and deported to Jamaica by the UK Home Office. “It felt very, very British,” he says. “It was disgusting and enraging. For me, it went right to the centre of the British relationship with people of colour and the historical violations that have been visited on them. They manifest slightly differently but British racism is every bit as virulent and violent as American racism. Even with second and third generation black people who were born British citizens, there is still this element of, ‘You don’t belong here’ and ‘You are an immigrant.’” Even given what’s happening right now in the US? He cites the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993. “When I heard it had happened in Eltham – where I lived as a child – it did not surprise me, given incidents that happened to me there.” He also remembers working with playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah in London the early 2000s. Kwei-Armah drove Lindo back to his hotel one evening. “We were parked outside, talking, and all of a sudden cops descended on us: 20 or 30 cops. They told us to get out and put our hands on the hood and they went through everything in the car. I remember the smirks on their faces. They said they were acting legitimately and I said, ‘Bullshit. You did this cos there were two black men sitting in a car in a neighbourhood where we didn’t belong.’” He laughs and the mood in the room brightens again. “So y’all have your own problems!” he says."
"The release of this documentary coincides with #MeAt20, a heart-twisting craze on social media for posting pictures of yourself at 20 years old. Middle-aged people’s timelines are speckled with funny, sweet and sometimes unbearably sad images of themselves in unlined, unformed youth, doing goofy things in milky analogue pictures from back when you had 12 or 24 exposures on your roll-film camera and getting them developed at Boots was a pricey business. That’s what I thought of while watching this engaging, oddly moving film from Spike Jonze: a record of the live stage show he devised at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, in tribute to white hip-hop stars and tongue-in-cheek party-libertarian activists the Beastie Boys. It is presented by the two surviving members, Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond, in tribute to the third member, Adam Yauch, who died of cancer in 2012. Jonze is reuniting with the band after having directed a string of their music videos, including the crime-TV spoof for their single Sabotage in 1994. Horovitz and Diamond amble on stage, apparently dressed head-to-toe in Gap, and appear for all the world to be about to unveil the iPhone 4S, although actually their jokey anecdotalism makes the show in some ways like the regional tours once presented by George Best and Rodney Marsh. With amiably rehearsed back-and-forth banter, they introduce the embarrassing photos and excruciating TV clips that are shown on a big screen. And the effect of seeing them juxtaposed with the plump-faced frizzy-haired imps of 1986 is startling and bizarre. In the present day, the advancing years seem to have boiled away the badass attitude, leaving behind the quirky humour. They started out in their teens as post-punk enthusiasts for the Clash, and the photos of them at this stage are starkly black-and-white. But then the archive images turn into the garish colour of MTV. The Beastie Boys got very excited by rap, were picked up for management by the (now notorious) Russell Simmons, brother of Run DMC’s Reverend Run, and soon they were opening for Madonna. In 1986, their album Licensed to Ill happened, along with its fascinating and deplorable and horribly brilliant single (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!) – an anthem for blearily defiant Reagan-years hedonism. I remember hearing it around the time I read PJ O’Rourke’s Republican Party Reptile. The Beastie Boys sold truckloads of records all over the world, and their puppyishly zany image co-existed with limitlessly energetic anarchy. They were, as they fondly recall, expected to be very dangerous on their foreign tours: particularly the British tour. Surreally, a full page of the Sun is flashed up on stage, and the band appear next to a giant picture of former Tory education secretary Kenneth Baker. The band’s live show featured a giant penis emerging from a box. Horovitz and Diamond explain they were intending to satirise the frat-boy image and it took over – though they have the grace to say that they didn’t really care at the time about an alleged misunderstanding that was making them globally famous and rich. However, they also appear genuinely mortified at the fact that, in the early days, they fired the only woman in their original lineup: Kate Schellenbach (now the TV producer of The Late Late Show with James Corden). They repudiate their early reputation for sexism, but nobody in the film mentions these lyrics from the early single Paul Revere: “I did it like this / I did it like that / I did it with a whiffle ball bat.” Inevitably, the Beasties spiralled financially over the top, relocating to LA where they rented a gigantic house featuring a swimming pool with a bridge over it, and went broke. Their accountant phoned to announce this event and heartlessly signed off with: “I’ve gotta go; I’ve got Donny Osmond on the other line.” A relocation back to New York, a chastened existence playing smaller clubs, and continued musical experimentation proved to be their path back up to the big league, and Yauch became a campaigner for Tibet. This film is a time capsule of the 1980s: an era that was crass and excessive in so many ways, but now seems weirdly exotic. Beastie Boys Story is available on Apple TV+ from 24 April."
"Maybe you’re the kind of person who buys a new outfit on Saturday afternoon and then wears it the very same evening. That’s not me. Dresses hang unworn in my wardrobe for weeks while they go ever so slightly out of fashion, because I am very comfortable with deferred pleasures. It’s worth waiting for the right occasion to debut a new pair of shoes or to see a movie for the first time. So it’s not that I never wanted to see Federico Fellini’s 8½. I knew I would get around to it one day, preferably on a large cinema screen, but that date never presented itself. Some people have attempted gently to dissuade me from watching it, but I assumed that they overestimated my sensitivity. Although clearly no Felliniphile, I have no aversion to the director, having admired some of the films he made before this: the seven and a half that fed into its title. This viewing is overdue for another reason: it’s probably the only film in the Sight & Sound Top 10 list to feature an actor from my hometown. Lockdown and a TV screen don’t seem to add up to the right time and platform for any movie lauded as a masterpiece, but what finer hour for a film about inaction and self-absorption? The prospect remains both daunting and a little dutiful, despite all that. A little like Marcello Mastroianni shuffling forward to receive his tumbler of holy water, I wondered whether I was expecting a dose of medicine or a miracle. It’s an easy film to admire from the off. The opening sequence scorches my brain, with Mastroianni as the Fellini-esque film director Guido suffocating in a locked car in a traffic jam, then floating above a beach, tethered by a rope that suddenly yanks him down to earth. These are hefty metaphors for a lack of control and direction, because this a story of creative block – Guido is struggling to make his latest movie, a science-fiction epic, and so he retreats into his memories of childhood and fantasies of a muse, played by Claudia Cardinale. It’s the most attractive nervous breakdown I have ever seen. Apparently, Fellini was having the same creative trouble himself, though it’s hard to believe. Rather a sly trick on his part to make a film about the difficulties of film-making that’s so breathtakingly gorgeous, that dances so nimbly between timelines, between fantasy and reality, that reflects on and even chastises itself for its own confused ambition. Guido’s world is seductively glamorous, relentlessly so, from the marble halls where he talks shop to his dreamy reminiscences of childhood and the Freudian floor-shows in his psyche. The black-and-white cinematography by Gianni Di Venanzo is stunning, and, of course, there’s the added pleasure of recognising already-familiar images in their proper place in the film. The circus parade finale, for one, or the compellingly cool Mastroianni either peering over his sunglasses or leaning back in a cafe chair, heels on the table, clapping. Each one prompts a little tingle. The sight of the giant scaffolding for the set of Guido’s as-yet-unrealised movie, the skeleton of a spaceship, knocks me out: a reminder of pre-digital processes, but with an extra poignancy as film production is halted across the world. It’s not just the film that worries Guido, though. He is beset by a plague of women, mostly buxom and/or bothersome: his mistress, his wife, his star, etc. When Birkenhead’s own Barbara Steele appears as his friend’s bewitching trophy girlfriend, I cheered. Eventually Guido fantasises about hosting a harem of the women he has known, of how they will bathe him like a baby and he will attack them with a whip. Which is precisely where we find the reason people had warned me away from 8½. This sexist fantasy creates a shuddering hard-stop in an otherwise fluid and dreamlike movie. It’s not an unexpected development (do any of us go into these classic films entirely blind?) but a deeply unpleasant one. Sgulp! There’s no law that says I have to admire Fellini’s hero, and now may not be the time to pick a fight with a film that was made more than half a century ago, not least one that contains its own critical commentary. Guido is repeatedly reminded that he treats women badly, just as he is told that his film is disjointed, indulgent, incoherent – although that’s largely, and mostly enjoyably, the point. It’s a dazzling film with all its sheen and puzzling digressions: beautiful and, in its own way, passionate, if offputtingly introspective. I enjoyed it most when it was funny, and there is a lot here that recalls my beloved silent cinema – wouldn’t you love to see it in a double-bill with Sherlock Jr? It’s a film I’d happily watch again, and surely find more in each time, even if not as much as others do. Not that it matters. The critical consensus that hurtled it to the top of the canon will continue without my qualms. Sometimes those dresses hang in the wardrobe for so long because, however cleverly they’re cut, they’ll never really suit you."
"It’s a tale as old as time, or at least as old as Hollywood: a hotshot young director scores on their first outing and, awash with accolades and flattering box-office receipts, goes out to make their big follow-up. Then … nothing. The curse of the sophomore slump strikes, leaving a once-promising talent on the skids, their initial flickers of greatness now called into question. The latest retelling of this narrative also happens to be one of the most stark, in terms of the distance between a hit’s point A and a bellyflop’s point B. This week, the new film Wendy becomes the latest spurned by that fickle mistress show business. Back in the heady days of 2012, rookie film-maker Benh Zeitlin (born Ben H Zeitlin) was enjoying the kind of rarefied success that most fresh-faced film school grads can only fantasize about. He had completed his debut feature Beasts of the Southern Wild and landed a plum premiere slot at the Sundance film festival, where he took Park City, Utah, by storm. His film quickly emerged as a can’t-miss breakout, and to cement his reputation as revelation, he won the Grand Jury prize. Fox Searchlight took notice and snapped up the distribution rights in a low-seven-figures deal, then brought the film to Cannes, where Zeitlin picked up the Camera d’Or award for the best first film. More festival appearances and mounting word-of-mouth led to a handsome payday upon the release that summer, with a $23.3m haul dwarfing his $1.8m budget. By the end of the year, he was a fixture on critics’ best-of lists, and the Oscars were to be his victory lap. He landed four nominations, including best director and best picture (The film’s nine-year-old star, Quvenzhané Wallis, claimed the title of youngest ever performer nominated for best actress.) Though he didn’t win any, his presence at the Dolby Theatre that night was victory enough. There was his name, right next to Steven Spielberg’s. He had made it. He sure seemed to be on the fast track to the top as he detailed plans for his second project, a fable about a girl whisked away to a remote island, in early 2013. But the following years elapsed without a peep until 2015, when the film industry sounded a collective “Oh, yeah, that guy!” upon hearing news that Zeitlin was finally prepared to start production on Wendy. For those with a loose grasp of mathematics or time, that was five years ago, practically an eternity by showbiz metrics. Delay after delay left those invested in his career wondering whether maybe this would be the year he would return to Sundance, and this past January, it was. If he was feeling any deja vu, the premiere’s frosty reception would have cured him of that straight away. He went from darling to also-ran, and judging by Searchlight’s pre-assigned release date a couple of short weeks after the festival, the studio didn’t have too much faith in him to start with. In New York, Wendy has now been shuffled into two measly theaters, one of which this critic visited last night. The opening showing was, to put it charitably, sparsely attended. What could have possibly happened? A tell-all feature in IndieWire running shortly before Wendy’s bow at Sundance dispelled any notion of behind-the-scenes calamity, with Zeitlin claiming that he simply likes to take his time with preliminary research and post-production. At the end of the day, he made the movie he wanted to make – the only trouble was that after so much of the time afforded to him, he wasn’t really making the movie that America wanted any more. The DOA release speaks as much to changing tastes in the public as it does to Zeitlin’s slipping abilities. Wendy does illustrate how essential Beasts’ stabilizing parent-child dynamic was to its functioning, preferable to a gaggle of screaming kids all playing off of one another. And it appears that the mediating influence of Beasts’ screenwriter, Lucy Alibar (who also penned the play on which the film was based), counts for a bit, judging by the decline in the latest script ginned up by Zeitlin and his sister, Eliza. But Zeitlin’s real bugaboo extends beyond his control – his cinema has fallen out of vogue. A big component of Beasts’ initial success was the conversation surrounding it, which conferred its reputation as a raw transmission from the Louisiana heartland. Zeitlin drew much attention for hiring non-professional actors, most notable among them an area donut shop proprietor named Dwight Henry, who wowed audiences with his innate skill as the film’s second lead. He had fresh memories of starting over after Hurricane Katrina, the other part of Beasts’ winning formula. The social resonance of displaced rural populations and ramshackle government recovery centers lent the film an air of relevance and maturity that has not aged quite so well. Much of the reflection on Beasts places the focus on Zeitlin’s gifts as a formalist, whether that’s the radiant glow of the golden-hour cinematography or the rousing, oft-imitated score. The American public’s slightly refined sense of racial politics hasn’t shone quite so kindly on the film’s subtext, which sees a white director positioning his black characters as the magical half of a tale of magical realism. Wendy runs along similar lines, retelling the Peter Pan myth as a story of white youngsters taking refuge on an enchanted island people by little black children living happy and uncivilized. Rejecting the bondage of grownup society to be untamed and anarchic represents a central tenet of the philosophy Zeitlin’s conveying here, and the noticeable divisions in the cast suggest an unfortunate subtext. The director tells stories about black life from the outside-in, and the critical establishment has at least partially wised up. An increased presence of black voices and a heightened awareness from the white ones both converged to remove Zeitlin from the zeitgeist. Barring some triumphant comeback with his next major work, by no means an impossibility, the director will occupy the outskirts of the field he once stood poised to conquer. Though for all we know, that will sit just fine with him. Zeitlin’s a proud New Orleanian, and has spent a goodly amount of time producing work for up-and-coming film-makers in the region. (Phillip Youmans’ indie gem Burning Cane wouldn’t have been possible without Zeitlin’s help.) He’s not nearly out of the game, but he’s never really conferred the impression of a game-player. Like the rambunctious kids on which he trains his camera, he seems content to luxuriate in the splendor of nature and run around releasing primal yawps. In other words, he makes his movies for himself. For some, it’s a strategy that guarantees they never lose their singular touch as an artist. For Zeitlin, it ensures that he’ll never evolve."
"Snow rushes down a mountain at top speed; Pete (Will Ferrell) bolts, grabbing his phone and leaving his wife Billie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and their two children to fend for themselves. The powder settles; no one is hurt, but something’s shifted. Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus are misused in this tonally unsteady comedy drama inspired by Ruben Östlund’s 2014 Swedish-language film Force Majeure. Both films set out to send up a bourgeois couple on a skiing holiday in the Alps as an avalanche disrupts the fragile equilibrium of their marriage. The performances, especially the brittle Louis-Dreyfus, are admirably grounded, but the script’s comedy wastes time with lazy barbs about European brusqueness and American exceptionalism abroad. Instead of grappling with the consequences of Pete’s feeble masculinity, Billie is simply told by a friend she has “a right to be angry”. The closest the film gets to meaningfully criticising the emotionally absent Pete is with a tossed-off one-liner about a sea-cucumber who “evacuates its organs through its rectum” when it perceives a threat."
