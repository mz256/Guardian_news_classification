"A consortium that includes high street giant Next is thought to be in pole position to buy Sir Philip Green’s Topshop empire out of administration. Arcadia, which employed 13,000 people across 500 outlets at the time of last year’s collapse, is being auctioned, with Monday being the deadline for final bids. Next, which has partnered with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, is pitted against Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, which has been linked to a joint bid with JD Sports. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group and online retailer Boohoo have also been circling. Administrators from Deloitte hope to complete the sale by the end of this month. Arcadia, which Green bought for £850m in 2002, is home to a stable of household names including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, has already been hived off and sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m. Arcadia has been the biggest corporate casualty of the pandemic, which has hammered high-street retailers. The high-street closures proved to be the final straw for the group, which had suffered years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. It only narrowly avoided administration in 2019 after landlords agreed rent reductions and store closures.  Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, has confirmed its interest in Arcadia, but said it was “only interested in the brands that we think are very, very good” and would be a minority shareholder in any new venture. If victorious, the Next consortium is expected to work with Arcadia’s existing management. Stores could be saved if landlords were willing to link rents to sales, according to the Sunday Times. The Evans deal resulted in the closure of all its outlets as the new owners plan to sell its clothing online only. Wolfson said its involvement in Arcadia would be in similar vein to its Victoria’s Secret joint venture, where Next operates the stores and website but has no part in developing the ranges. The FTSE 100 retailer has been expanding its portfolio of brands over the past year, including through licensing deals with Ted Baker and the new owners of Laura Ashley, which also went into administration in 2020. In the wake of the BHS scandal, which saw Green eventually agreeing to pay £363m into the company’s depleted pension pot, the failure of Arcadia has thrown the spotlight on its own scheme, which has an estimated £350m deficit. The family is making a promised £50m payment a year early and has also signed over some Arcadia property assets – but it is not yet clear whether it will be enough to fill the hole. ",business
"Connells has struck an agreed offer for Countryside, the owner of Hamptons International, after raising its bid to £130m, bringing together two of Britain’s biggest estate agency groups. The boards of Connells, which is part of Skipton building society, and Countrywide, the UK’s biggest listed estate agency group, said they had agreed terms of a recommended cash offer at 395p a share. Connells made an initial offer of 250p a share in early November and raised this to 325p a share a month later. The shares traded at 145p before the initial bid was made. The deal will bring together Countrywide’s 60 well-known high street brands, including Gascoigne-Pees, Bairstow Eves and King & Chasemore, with Connells’ 25 brands – Allen & Harris, Bagshaws Residential, Fox & Sons, and Barnard Marcus in London. Countrywide has 651 branches, while the Connells group has 581. The takeover is backed by the majority of Countrywide’s shareholders and is a lifeline for the business, which has struggled under debts of £91.9m and has been closing branches after years of mounting losses. The deal is expected to complete in the first three months of 2021. It scuppers a rival move made by the UK private equity firm Alchemy, a Countrywide shareholder which proposed a £90m cash injection into the firm in October in return for a controlling stake, and had the support of Peter Long, Countrywide’s executive chairman. Long quit in late November after opposition from shareholders to the plan, and the former William Hill boss Philip Bowcock was appointed chief executive. Before Alchemy’s move, LSL Property Services, which owns Your Move, abandoned a planned all-share merger with Countrywide in March. All of Countrywide’s lenders will be repaid in full, said Connells, pledging to invest in the group’s technology and branch network to turn the business around. It said there would be some job losses as the two head offices in Leighton Buzzard and Milton Keynes were merged, but vowed to retain staff in the branches. The offer is far below Countrywide’s £750m valuation when it floated on the stock market in March 2013 amid a buoyant property market. The company amassed debts when it went on an acquisition spree in 2014 and 2015, buying up high street brands at a time when others invested in online estate agency services. Long blamed its woes on the “completely wrong” strategy pursued by the former chief executive Alison Platt, who sought to run the estate agent like a retailer from a central base, triggering an exodus of middle management. David Livesey, Connells’ chief executive, said: “We have the right management team, strategy and investment firepower to work with the talented teams at Countrywide and lead Countrywide into a bright future.” David Watson, the acting chairman of Countrywide, said: “Following a thorough evaluation of options and extensive consultation with the company’s major shareholders, we have been encouraged by their recognition of the need to put in place a sustainable capital structure and a willingness to support the company, which is a great business that has been constrained by too much debt.” The UK housing market has been surprisingly buoyant this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. It ground to a halt for a few weeks during the first national lockdown but bounced back in the summer, helped by a stamp duty cut. Demand from buyers looking for bigger homes in leafy locations has surged as many office workers switched to working from home. But forecasters expect the market to cool next year, when the stamp duty cut expires, with unemployment expected to rise sharply.",business
"UK mortgage approvals have risen to the highest level in 13 years, driven by the government’s stamp duty holiday and buyers reassessing their living situation during the coronavirus pandemic. Figures from the Bank of England showed the number of mortgages approved by banks and building societies for home purchases had leapt to 105,000 in November – the highest figure since August 2007, the month immediately before queues formed outside branches of Northern Rock at the start of the financial crisis. Threadneedle Street said the number of monthly approvals had increased by 7,700 on October’s level, reflecting a boom in the mortgage market during the month when rapid growth in Covid infections led the government to impose a second national lockdown in England. Mortgage borrowing plunged during the first Covid lockdown as the crisis sank Britain’s economy into the deepest recession for 300 years, hitting a trough of just £200m in April 2020. Borrowing soared to £5.7bn in November, up £1.2bn on the level in October. The number of new mortgage approvals – which provide an early indicator for borrowing levels in future months when buyers take up their mortgage offers – have increased more than tenfold, after hitting a low point of 9,400 in May. Figures from the Bank also showed households repaid £1.5bn of credit card debt, personal loans and car finance in November, in a reflection of weaker consumer spending during the second national lockdown and some households in which people work from home being able to save money. Since the start of the pandemic in March, households have repaid £17.3bn of consumer credit, according to the Bank, bucking a trend in recent years for rapid growth in credit-card borrowing. While many low-income workers have suffered a financial hit during the pandemic, total household deposits increased by almost £5bn on the month to reach £17.6bn, as people saved money while much of the high street was closed. Despite the boom in mortgage approvals – equivalent to the last days of the mid-2000s property bubble when zero-deposit mortgages were still widely available – analysts warn that a sharp drop in activity is looming. The UK housing market boomed in 2020, with property prices soaring to a six-year high as people rushed to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and re-evaluated their living arrangements during lockdown. However, mortgage lenders and economists warn the end of the stamp duty holiday in March and rising unemployment could trigger a collapse in house prices in 2021. Halifax, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, estimates an annual drop of between 2% and 5%, while the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economic forecaster, is more pessimistic, predicting an 8% fall. Faced with the potential downturn, lenders have made it tougher for buyers with smaller deposits to purchase a home – hitting first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said demanded looked set to remain strong right up until the starting threshold for paying stamp duty – the tax paid on property purchases – returns to £125,000, from £500,000 at present. “The mortgage market is heading for a hard landing,” he said. House price growth is, however, expected to return in 2022, according to analysts, despite the cost of a home rising out of reach for increasing numbers of people in recent years. Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “While the end of the stamp duty holiday in March will clearly have an impact on transaction numbers, the effect will be reduced if the pandemic has entered the endgame. Some buyers and sellers may hesitate in coming weeks, but sentiment will ultimately improve over the course of the year.”",business
"Another 787,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week before Christmas, the last snapshot of 2020’s appalling jobs market before the New Year. Unemployment claims have been rising again in recent weeks to their highest levels since the autumn as surging coronavirus rates have slowed hiring and led to more layoffs. At current levels the weekly claims figures are almost four times their pre-pandemic average. The latest weekly figure from the Department of Labor was 19,000 lower than the previous week’s 803,000 claims but the average number of claims over the last four weeks is now 836,750, more than the population of the city of Seattle. The national unemployment rate started the year at 3.6% in January and hit a record high of 14.7% in April as the coronavirus shut down much of the US economy. The unemployment rate has since declined dramatically, it was 6.7% in November, but the recovery has been uneven with women and black, Hispanic and young people still experiencing high levels of unemployment. The numbers of long-term unemployed are rising. The recent increases in weekly unemployment claims signal more trouble ahead. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 25.7 million workers in the US remain officially unemployed, otherwise out of work due to the pandemic, or have experienced a reduction in work hours or pay. After months of wrangling Congress has finally brokered a deal to extend unemployment assistance to the millions laid off during the pandemic. The $900bn Covid-19 relief bill will give those receiving unemployment benefits an extra $300 a week and extends two pandemic-specific programs used by about 14 million people. But the delay in the agreement means many across the country face delays in payments and more hardship. Fernando Comas of Secaucus, New Jersey, worked as a video engineer in the entertainment industry before the pandemic and has been furloughed since March until at least 2021. Six weeks ago, his benefits were exhausted. He has been unable to receive answers from his state unemployment agency to try to resolve the issue. “I have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, a car payment, and I’m a single father of two small girls who rely on me to provide for them,” said Comas, who cannot afford to find other work because his family’s health coverage is still being covered by his employer. “I’m going to lose everything, probably going to be evicted and will start to go to the food banks for food for my family.”",business
"Primark has said it will lose an additional £220m in sales as more stores are forced to close under new restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 in the UK. The cut-price fashion chain’s owner, Associated British Foods, said it expected to lose £650m in sales in the year to September, up from the £430m it had announced on 4 December, after the government said major cities including Manchester and Birmingham must join London and the south-east of England in closing non-essential shops. Primark said 253 of its stores would now be temporarily closed from 1 January, just over two-thirds of its outlets globally. The update comes as retailers brace for further pain after the government announced that all of the north-east of England, Greater Manchester, large parts of the Midlands and the south-west would fall under the strictest tier 4 restrictions from Thursday morning. All of mainland Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already under the tightest restrictions which involve the closure of hospitality and non-essential retail, which includes shops that sell clothing, toys, books and electrical goods. The restrictions have been widened in response to a new variant of Covid-19 that has contributed to a record rise in infections across the country. The number of shoppers out and about last week slumped by 46%, compared to the same period in 2019, according to the advisory firm BDO’s high street tracker. Online sales rose by 50% but that was not enough to offset the in-store decline. Total sales for established retailers fell 23%. Fashion sales were down just over a third. Primark takes a heavier hit from store closures than some rivals because it does not sell goods online. When the chain reopened in England earlier this month, however, after a month-long high street lockdown, the group said it saw “phenomenal” sales growth. Eleven stores stayed open overnight, resulting in a 40-hour trading marathon, and shoppers queued to get into the stores in the small hours of the morning.",business
"The fashion and homewares chain Next is considering teaming up with the US owner of Oak Furnitureland to buy the parent company of Topshop. Davidson Kempner Capital Management has held detailed talks with Next about a potential bid for Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which fell into administration last month, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Next is understood to be interested in Topshop and Topman while Davidson Kempner, which gave a £180m emergency loan to Poundland in 2018 and has previously been linked with a potential rescue of the Peacocks fashion chain, would take on Arcadia’s smaller brands such as Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans and Wallis. Sources said there was no certainty that a deal would be put forward on Monday, when a flurry of bids are now expected to be filed for Arcadia if Next chooses Davidson Kempner as its partner. Next has also held talks with other finance houses, including Alteri and Carlyle, about a bid, according to Sky News, which first reported the potential tie up with Davidson Kempner. The retailer has been expanding its portfolio of brands in the past year with a joint venture to operate 18 Victoria’s Secret standalone lingerie stores in the UK, as well as sell the brand in its own stores and online. It has also become a licence partner licence for Ted Baker lingerie, and has taken on parts of several former Debenhams stores to create a new beauty outlet. Other parties interested in Arcadia are thought to include Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, online specialist Boohoo, Marks & Spencer and Authentic Brands, the owner of US department store Barneys. Primark has also asked for bidders information but is not expected to place a formal offer. While Boohoo is seen as frontrunner for Topshop, Arcadia’s prime asset from which administrators at Deloitte expect to raise about half the £400m guide price for the group, Next and some other bidders may win an advantage by pledging to keep a substantial number of stores open. Arcadia’s interlinked head office systems, including IT and sourcing, make it difficult for a purely financial player to break up so a willingness to take on the whole group will also be attractive to administrators. The sale is further complicated by Arcadia’s close links to Debenhams, which is set to close all its stores by March if a buyer cannot be found. The department store chain is in talks with Frasers about a potential rescue deal. Davidson Kempner bought Oak Furnitureland out of administration in June and has since been touted as a potential rescuer for several failed UK businesses including Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, the owner of Peacocks and Jaeger, which is also being sold off by administrators.",business
"Tougher coronavirus restrictions have dealt a fresh setback to struggling city centres, with Christmas shoppers staying away as doubts increase about whether the Boxing Day sales – the next big event in the retail calendar – will be allowed to go ahead. The prime minister this week urged shoppers to “think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales”. Billions of pounds are usually spent on what is one of the biggest shopping days of the year, although shops in Wales and Northern Ireland have already been told to close. Diane Wehrle, the insights director at the research firm Springboard, which tracks shopper numbers, said the number of shoppers visiting UK stores and shopping centres was about a third less than this time last year, despite the proximity to Christmas. The decline in central London, however, has been far greater, with numbers down nearly 70% on 2019 after the capital was placed in the toughest tier 3 restrictions. That compares with the decline of about 50% recorded by Springboard in regional cities. “Central London has undoubtedly been harder hit than smaller towns and regional cities due to the reliance on public transport and loss of office workers,” said Wehrle. “It is clear that there has been an immediate impact on activity levels following the introduction of tier 3 restrictions.” If the sales are allowed to go ahead, they may be disappointing for retailers anyway as families use their “freedom pass” to spend time together, rather than shop, Wehrle suggested. Some big high street names such as Marks & Spencer are closing this year anyway but rivals such as Next and Selfridges are still set to open. “Footfall has been falling on Boxing Day for some time but it is going to be even harder hit this year because of the five-day pass that we have,” said Wehrle. “People are not going to be thinking about going out shopping so much.” Stores in the West End are heavily reliant on local office workers and overseas tourists who are missing in large numbers. The high-end stores on key shopping thoroughfares such as Oxford Street usually rake in more than £2.5bn in November and December but this year that figure will be less than £900m. Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of the New West End Company, which represents 600 of the area’s retailer, said the weekends since stores reopened on 2 December had been stronger, with footfall “only 30% down”. It remained to be seen what Londoners’ appetite to shop would be on the last weekend before Christmas now that the city is tier 3. The tough conditions mean worried retailers have already started to cut prices to shift unsold winter fashion and gifts. “Half the West End has probably gone into sale already,” said Tyrell. “There is a lot of stock to clear and I think the worry is we might not have Boxing Day.” Harrods, which last year entertained queueing shoppers on Boxing Day with a Motown band, has abandoned its traditional hoopla. Instead the Knightsbridge store is already selling designer clothing and homeware at half-price. The Watches of Switzerland chief executive, Brian Duffy, said shopper numbers had struggled to recover in London but the picture was better in other cities, such as Birmingham and Glasgow, where shoppers arrived by car. “The only bright spots we’ve seen have been the last two weekends,” he added. “I think there will be an even greater reluctance to go shopping [in London] with the increased alert level.” The Treasury’s decision to end tax-free shopping on 31 December would also “whack” the West End, Duffy said, casting doubt on the future of some of the luxury stores trading in Regent Street and Bond Street. “This whole VAT thing is really alarming for London overall,” he said.",business
"Lloyds Banking Group has cancelled staff bonuses for 2020 after missing financial targets and recording a sharp drop in profits during the Covid crisis. The bank told staff across its Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland brands on Thursday that it was making an early announcement on bonuses in light of the challenging economic outlook, and with profits already down 85% to £434m in the first nine months of the year. Last year Lloyds cut its bonus pool for the first time in four years to £310m, down from £465m in 2018. The bank told staff in a memo: “Despite the good news about the vaccine rollout, like most of our peers, our year-to-date business performance continues to be challenging.” Despite reporting a third-quarter profit, Lloyds told employees: “We are not where we expected to be and are short of the commitments we made to ourselves and our shareholders – which I know also includes many of you.” The decision has not changed fortunes for the chief executive, António Horta-Osório, who is set to leave in June 2021 and confirmed earlier this year that he would waive his 2020 bonus, worth as much as £1.8m. William Chalmers, the finance chief, also ruled himself out of a payout worth up to approximately £800,000. The decision to cancel bonuses means Lloyds will avoid uncomfortable questions from UK regulators, which said last week they would be scrutinising cash bonuses for bankers in light of the continued economic uncertainty. But the cancellation could prove controversial, if the bank decides to pay shareholders dividends in the new year. The Bank of England last week lifted its temporary ban on dividend payouts to investors, but told lenders a cap would be imposed until at least mid-2021. The coronavirus pandemic has put pressure on bank earnings. Record low interest rates have squeezed net interest income, which measures the difference between interest earned on loans v that paid on deposits. The deteriorating economic outlook has also forced Lloyds to put aside £4.1bn so far to cover potential defaults on loans and credit cards. Lloyds has also announced almost 2,000 job losses since September as part its restructuring plans. Accord, a specialist union for staff in financial services, said: “Bad news is bad news and the lack of any group performance share [bonus] will give some individuals real problems next year when many family budgets are already stretched.” However, unions have reached a tentative agreement to increase salaries by at least 1% for about 80% of Lloyds Banking Group staff. The lowest-paid workers will be guaranteed a pay rise of at least £400. Lloyds is also considering distributing shares to employees in the new year in lieu of a bonus, and earlier this year paid one-off bonuses worth £250 to frontline staff who had worked through the pandemic. The group said: “This decision on bonuses in no way reflects the hard work and commitment our people have made throughout this extraordinary year to keep our businesses operating strongly and to provide support and help to our consumer and business customers.”",business
"Boeing is hiring its own team of up to 160 pilots to work with airlines on its relaunch of its bestselling 737 Max as the plane returns to service around the world. The manufacturer is seeking pilots with instructor experience to observe and help airline pilots once flights of the 737 Max restart in the new year. The pilots will be given 35-day assignments at an equivalent annual salary that could reach $200,000 (£148,000), with a potential total cost of $32m, Reuters first reported. Most airlines plan to start flying the 737 Max in the early months of 2021. American Airlines will start its first commercial flights on 29 December. A smooth return to service for the 737 Max is crucial for the fortunes of Boeing, after the model was grounded from March 2019 after two crashes that killed a total of 346 people. The crisis rocked the US manufacturer, forcing the resignation of a chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, and costing more than $20bn in compensation to customers and victims’ families and extra production costs. The 737 Max crisis meant Boeing fell much further behind its bitter European rival, Airbus, in the battle to be the world’s largest aeroplane manufacturer, and left it in a weak financial position when the coronavirus pandemic caused a dramatic decline in global air traffic. Boeing said in October it would make 30,000 of its 160,000 workers redundant by the end of 2021 as it tried to retrench. The twin challenges of the crashes and the pandemic have meant orders for the 737 Max have slumped, although Ryanair this month ordered 75 of the jets, probably at a steep discount. Boeing has made a number of changes to the way the 737 Max flies in order to prevent any recurrence of the issues that contributed to the fatal crashes, namely the repeated triggering of an anti-stall system that forced the nose of the plane to dip. As well as the extra pilots, Boeing has set up a 24-hour monitoring facility in California to respond immediately in case of emergency. It is also working with airlines on talking points for discussing the 737 Max with passengers. Reuters reported that an Isle of Man-based company, CCL Aviation, was carrying out pilot recruitment. CCL Aviation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, its website advertised job opportunities for captains of Boeing 737, 777 and 787 models with instructing experience.  The advert said the pilots must have more than 1,000 hours of documented aircraft instructor experience for airlines, and have “no incidents, accidents, losses or violations” on their record. A Boeing spokeswoman said: “We continue to work closely with global regulators and customers to safely return the 737-8 and 737-9 to service worldwide.”",business
"The outsourcing company Serco has announced it will repay government furlough scheme support and give staff £100 bonuses each in recognition of their work during the pandemic. Serco has been running much of the UK government’s contact-tracing operation. The furlough scheme repayment will cost about £3m, while about 50,000 frontline staff will receive the one-off bonus payments, at a cost of £5m. The company said the combined cost was equivalent to 5% of 2020 underlying trading profits of £160m-£165m. It said the overall effect of the pandemic before the payouts would be to increase its annual profits by about £14m. Serco’s profits have been boosted by lucrative contracts to run some contact tracing as part of the UK government’s heavily criticised test-and-trace programme. The company is also contracted to run some test centres. Serco said its work on test and trace was still growing and it was operating 200 test sites, up from about 125 in October. The company said it had again delayed a decision as to whether to pay a dividend to shareholders or bonuses to executives until it reported its final results for 2020, which is likely to occur in early 2021. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, raised concerns in October, saying Serco and its executives may benefit from government spending that would be better directed towards the NHS. In September the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the test-and-trace programme had had only a “marginal impact” in reducing transmission of Covid-19. Serco’s work has also been criticised for tracing fewer people than contact tracers working in the public sector. Serco’s chief executive, Rupert Soames, has rejected criticism of his company’s work, saying it hit all targets set by the government. However, those targets do not include the number of people successfully reached by contact tracers, according to key performance indicators listed in documents first reported by Private Eye. Soames said Serco workers had been “resilient, flexible and dedicated to ensuring the delivery of public services”. He added that although Serco and other companies still faced “unprecedented levels of uncertainty”, he expected to make similar revenues and profits in 2021. The company said it expected to report revenue growth of 19% to £3.9bn for 2020.",business
"Supermarket sales figures have captured the way Covid has caused big changes in the way we live, from lager-fuelled barbecues and home-cooked roasts replacing nights in the pub and ready meals, to lower sales of makeup, deodorant and even toothbrushes pointing to people letting themselves go a bit. With coronavirus restrictions often forbidding meals and nights out with friends, Britons put an extra £2.5bn of beer, wine, spirits and meat in their trolleys as the pandemic “shifted consumer shopping habits to the extreme”, according to The Grocer magazine’s annual Top Products Survey. After years when similar exercises have turned up more wholesome lifestyle trends such as the rise of the plant-based diet, the star performer of 2020 was lager, with sales soaring by more than a fifth, or more than £800m. Supermarkets also rang up an extra £1bn of cigarettes and rolling tobacco at the checkout. The survey, in conjunction with the market research firm Nielsen, underlined the “impact of the coronavirus on the nation’s shopping habits and the nation’s health,” said The Grocer’s editor, Adam Leyland. “A surprising trend we’ve seen this year is the rise in tobacco sales, and while some of those extra sales reflect the lack of foreign travel and duty-free purchases, it’s a step change from previous years.” The flipside of the crisis in the UK’s pub and restaurant trade has been booming supermarket sales. November was the biggest month ever for grocery sales, with shoppers spending almost £11bn as the autumn lockdowns forced people to stay home. The surprise winner of the supermarket lager boom of 2020 was San Miguel, with sales up more than 60%. Wine and spirits also had massive gains, of £717m and £567m, in the 52 weeks to 5 September tracked by the survey. The Mexican lager brand Corona managed to defy the odds, with sales jumping 40%. The curtailing of social lives and shift to homeworking led to an extra £440m spent on sausages, burgers and chicken to cook up at home. This was in contrast to 2019 when fresh meat sales, particularly of beef, were suffering. The figures reflect pub, restaurant and school closures, but as Britons found themselves with no excuses not to cook, there was a £74m hole in ready-meal sales. Rachel White, Nielsen’s retail intelligence leader for the UK and Ireland, said the pandemic had “shifted consumer shopping habits to the extreme. With more free time at home, consumers moved away from chilled ready-meal options and focused instead on creating their own dining experience at home, cooking with fresh ingredients and enjoying a drink at home rather than at the pub.” At the same time, with no one to impress at work or when out socialising, personal care regimes took a back seat. Sales of cosmetics, hairstyling products, toothbrushes and deodorant all slumped, cumulatively shedding nearly £300m in sales. The biggest loser was the cosmetics aisle, with £180m knocked off sales as remote working coupled with face mask regulations meant people dropped their usual routines. Sales of deodorants and toothbrushes were down 10%. Similarly sales of products that consumers tend to pick up on the go, such as bottled water and chewing gum, were also down sharply, because buyers were going nowhere this year.",business
"The Wall Street bank Citigroup will offer employees 12-week sabbaticals as part of a benefits package prompted by a review of bankers’ work-life balance after the coronavirus crisis proved staff were working productively – and happily – from home. Employees will also be allowed to volunteer with a charity for up to four weeks full-time while Citi covers 100% of their regular salary. It is understood the new work setup will be offered to the bank’s US staff first, but will eventually being extended to Citi’s 8,000 UK bankers as part of a global rollout. A recent Citi survey showed the bank’s employee satisfaction increased during the pandemic and that many staff preferred home working, which can offer greater flexibility to bankers usually trapped in offices during long work days. Citi is now planning to review all of its global roles at the beginning of 2021 to help determine which staff may benefit from home working regularly in the long term. That is on top of the new scheme that will allow staff to take up to two sabbaticals during their tenure, lasting 12 weeks each, while receiving 25% of their regular pay. Separate to the sabbaticals, staff will also be allowed two stints of charity volunteering on full pay. They must work for the bank for at least five years before being allowed to use either scheme. The perks, which were first reported by Bloomberg, will also include the ability to buy up to five extra days of annual holiday, which is already available to UK staff. Citi is just the latest firm to review its approach to work and staff benefits during the pandemic. The London-headquartered banking group Standard Chartered announced last month it was permanently shifting to flexible working by letting staff apply for their ideal mix of home and office work from early 2021. That will apply to the bank’s 2,000 employees in London, where about 10% of staff have been going into the office since coronavirus hit. The US banking company JP Morgan is also expecting up to 30% of its almost 257,000 global employees to work remotely in future, at least part of the time. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, said: “I’d be very surprised if anybody, particularly in the services sector, really needs to be in the office five days a week, physically, as a future model. But we need to be quite adaptive, quite flexible and quite specific, job role by job role.” Lloyd’s is opening its doors three days a week only, and welcoming up to 250 workers a day, compared with 6,000 pre-pandemic. Brokers and underwriters have been working largely remotely since coronavirus restrictions came into force.",business
"The world’s first gin in a paper-based bottle is set to go on sale in the UK early next year as packaging specialists jostle to step up production of eco-friendly alternatives to the traditional glass container. The UK manufacturer of the so-called “frugal” bottle – made from predominantly recycled paperboard with a food-grade liner inside – has received orders from around the world to make containers for sake and spirits in Japan, whiskey in the US and wine in Spain, Australia, Italy and France. Frugalpac, based in Suffolk, has recently partnered with Silent Pool Distillers in Surrey to produce the world’s first commercial gin in a paper bottle in early 2021, opening a new factory to increase production capacity. The new eco-friendly bottles – which can be recycled along with household waste – are a novel alternative to the carbon-intensive glass model devised by the Romans but which has remained largely unchanged since the 19th century. Although glass can be recycled, it is very carbon-intensive to make. The frugal bottle, made from recycled paperboard, is five times lighter than a glass one and has a carbon footprint up to six times (84%) lower than a glass bottle. New research shows that nearly two-thirds of wine drinkers in the UK said they would buy wine in a paper bottle, according to Frugalpac’s independent research. The survey by Survation found that 63% would buy it in a new-style container, while only 14% said they would not. Malcolm Waugh, chief executive of Frugalpac, said: “Our bottle seems to have really captured the imagination of drinks brands and customers. It’s clear that people want to drink more sustainably, and paper bottles are here to stay. Wine experts used to say people would turn their noses up at screw caps. But they’ve become the norm and we believe the paper bottle will prove just as popular.” The new product is based on the model for “bag in box” wines – dubbed “cardbordeaux” and “bagnums” – which enjoyed a sales surge in the UK during lockdown as Britons opted for better value for money and fewer trips to the supermarket. Frugalpac, which devised what it claimed was the world’s first fully recyclable coffee cup, was recently singled out by the UK Department for International Trade’s Great Britain campaign as “doing incredible things to help build a global sustainable future” in the run-up to next year’s COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow.",business
"The government has named 72 high streets across England that have been selected to receive £831m of investment to help fund their recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and to protect jobs. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said the money would “help our much-loved town centres get through this and prosper into the future”. However, the Labour party said the government had originally promised £1bn when it launched the Future High Streets Fund. “The year ahead will be a big one for the high street as it seeks to recover, adapt and evolve as a result of the pandemic,” Jenrick said. “Today’s £830m investment from the Future High Streets Fund is one of many ways the government is working to help our much-loved town centres get through this and prosper into the future. “The role of the high street has always evolved. We want to support that change and make sure that they are the beating heart of their local community – with high quality housing and leisure in addition to shops and restaurants.” Jenrick said the money – which was first promised in 2018 to help high streets struggling long before the coronavirus pandemic – would “help us build back better and make town centres a more attractive place to live, work and visit”. The government said the injection of cash was a “key milestone for the government’s levelling-up agenda”. “The funding will help these areas transform their high streets into vibrant hubs for future generations and to protect and create thousands of jobs,” the Department for Communities and Local Government said. Swindon and Sunderland are to get the most money – £25m each – to fund a “bus boulevard” in the Wiltshire town and to improve Sunderland’s 1960s railway station. A total of 15 towns and cities are to receive all the money they had bid for, totalling £255m. Another 57 areas have received provisional funding offers worth a combined £576m. The £831m total is £169m short of the £1bn Boris Johnson promised in August 2019 would “re-energise and transform” more than 100 high streets across the country. Johnson had said the Future High Streets Fund would support more than 100 high streets. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said £107m of the missing money had been transferred to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to fund the regeneration of heritage high streets. She said a further £15.1m had been spent on helping 101 local authorities make their bids for the cash. Some of the remaining money was spent on “developing a new parking code”, she said. Some high streets that were shortlisted by the prime minister in August 2019 were not selected to receive any funds. They include Barrow, Blackpool, Bideford and Runcorn. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “We are supporting our high streets to get through this pandemic through business grants, paying people’s wages and tax deferrals. “The Future High Streets Fund will help areas bounce back through regeneration projects that level up opportunities and create jobs right across the country.” Among the projects selected for the funding were £17.9m for the renovation of the Scala Theatre and Corn Exchange in Worcester, a scheme to build 186 homes in Birkenhead and a plan to convert empty retail units in Tamworth, Staffordshire, into community spaces. Jeremy Oates, Tamworth borough council’s cabinet member for heritage and growth, said: ““The projects couldn’t just be a case of smartening up an outdoor space or adding hanging baskets, the government is looking for change on a large and transformative scale, in a way that recognises the changing role of the town centre and enables it to survive and thrive on the basis of what people want. Our bid includes a number of very exciting projects which are focused on creating the right foundations for a town centre that is at the heart of the community.” The government was encouraged to launch the scheme by Sir John Timpson, the owner of the shoe repair chain that carries his name. He had called for councils to be given more money to turn town centres into communities and meeting places, highlighting that high streets were not just about shopping. “By helping our towns create their own individual community hub,” Timpson said at the time, “I believe we will have vibrant town centres to provide a much-needed place for face to face contact in the digital age.” 15 places have been selected to receive all the money they asked for 1.

"The toy-train maker Hornby has temporarily stopped all orders to customers outside the UK, blaming delays caused by uncertainty over Brexit and disruption at UK ports. The company, which also makes Scalextric car racing sets and Corgi cars, said it would not accept any non-UK orders until 4 January, after the transition period ends and EU-UK trade switches to a new relationship under rules that have not yet been agreed. Hornby’s toys exported from the UK to the EU could face tariffs of up to 4.7% of their cost if no deal is agreed. If tariffs are imposed while goods from the UK are delayed in transit, an EU customer could be forced to pay the duty themselves before receiving the goods, a complication Hornby is keen to avoid. Lyndon Davies, Hornby’s chief executive, said: “I’ve seen the Gulf war, Falklands war, three-day week, crashes on the stock market – after all these things there are issues.  “All we’re asking is, tell us what is going on. We’re forced into a position of saying, what is the point of going through the pain of all these orders? “What the world of business has to do is sort out the mess and the carnage of what’s left.” Importers to the UK have been struggling with increased demand for goods before the 1 January Brexit deadline, adding to global problems in the shipping industry that have already caused significant delays for imports from east Asia. Davies said Hornby had taken delivery of one shipment of Batman vs Joker Scalextric sets, which had been “going up and down the strait of Dover for three weeks”, as a result of port delays. However, the company has stockpiled enough toys to ensure there is no danger of running out of some of its key items, such as train sets, for as long as a year. “We will not be running out of Spitfires,” Davies added, referring to models of second world war fighter aircraft. Hornby head office tweeted the decision to pause orders on Tuesday. It said it was pausing all non-UK orders until 4 January 2021, adding: “We hope you can understand the difficult position we are in & remain patient with us until we can find a solution.” Davies said the company should be able to cope in the longer term, in part because of its surprise lockdown sales boom. Hornby enjoyed a 33% jump in sales in the six months to September as families stuck at home bought more toys. “You can sit there whilst the world is falling apart creating your fantasy train set,” Davies said.",business
"Dixons Carphone has indicated it has no plan to pay back business rates relief despite reporting a rise in profits after online sales made up for closures enforced during the coronavirus pandemic. Online sales more than doubled to £1.8bn in the half year to 31 October, and overall sales in the UK and Ireland electricals business rose by 15%. The group made a profit before interest and tax of £100m in the six-month period. The company said “the impact of temporary store closures was more than offset by strong online sales growth” as consumers and workers confined to their homes bought laptops and computer games to get them through lockdowns. Dixons Carphone, which also runs the Currys and PC World brands, said it received business rates tax relief worth £34m in the UK from the start of the pandemic up to 31 October. The business rates relief was introduced by the government to help retailers through what was feared to be a difficult period. However, many retailers have now repaid the relief after sales performed better than expected. These include most of the UK’s large supermarket chains and other essential retailers who remained open through the lockdowns, who collectively repaid more than £1.8bn after criticism of their retention of the money. Alex Baldock, Dixons Carphone’s chief executive, repeatedly stressed that the company was “winning” in spite of “fighting with one hand tied behind our back” during the pandemic with store closures. He said the company had been “responsible”. “We can look at ourselves in the mirror,” he said. Dixons Carphone was not classed as an essential retailer, meaning its stores were closed through each lockdown. Overall, the company said the cost of the disruption, including the store closures and extra spending on safety measures, was £155m. After government support the negative impact was £10m. That support also included £54m under the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, which paid 80% of furloughed workers’ wages up to £2,500 per month. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax, a measure of profitability, in the main UK operation nearly tripled to £95m in the half year. Shares in the company jumped by 13% on Wednesday morning, hitting their highest level since early February when the pandemic’s effects on Europe were starting to become clear. However, the company is still in the middle of a turnaround effort that has included 2,900 redundancies and 531 store closures announced in March. Baldock said Dixons had been affected by disruption at ports in recent weeks, although he did not expect major problems in the event of no EU trade deal being struck before the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January. Dixons Carphone has stockpiles of two days’ worth of goods, which Baldock said was enough to see it through any disruption. He renewed calls for reform of the business rates system to reflect more recent rental values, a move that would result in online retailers paying more. “It would get people like Amazon to pay some more tax,” Baldock said.",business
"Unions have described companies who pay their chief executives huge multiples of their workers average salary as obscene, and called on ministers and shareholders to act to end the “runaway train” of inequality in corporate Britain. A report by the High Pay Centre thinktank on Tuesday revealed that Ocado, the online supermarket, had the biggest pay gap between those at the top and those on the shop floor. Its chief executive, Tim Steiner, was paid £58.7m last year – which works out at 2,605 times the £22,500 paid to the online grocery delivery company’s staff on average. It means Steiner was paid about 10 times as much as the average Ocado worker’s annual salary for just one day’s work. In second place was JD Sports, which paid its chief executive, Peter Cowgill, £5.6m, but paid staff an average of only £18,300. That means Cowgill’s pay was 310 times the median average. Tesco took third place for paying its outgoing chief executive 305 times the median pay. Laurence Turner, head of research and policy at the GMB union, said: “This shocking and important report provides a vivid snapshot of the staggering inequalities and exploitation in the world of work on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “There is no business or moral justification for paying an executive an obscene ratio of more than 2,000 times the average worker. “Action is needed, especially at a time when hundreds of thousands of jobs are under threat and households are struggling to make ends meet. Ministers, employers, and shareholders must all put an end to this runaway train.” The report showed that across the UK’s 100 biggest stock market listed companies, chief executives collect 73 times the amount paid to workers on average. Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said the report provided “valuable new insight into the corporate cultures and working practices of some of the UK’s biggest employers”. He added: “These findings show that quite low levels of pay are commonplace for large numbers of workers at many of our major companies. Hopefully the disclosures can help investors, policymakers and of course the companies themselves think more deeply about how to improve fairness at work, and pay for low-paid workers in particular.” A spokesperson for Ocado said: “The pay ratio is particularly high for 2019 due to the inclusion of the growth incentive plan (GIP), which was a five-year award granted in 2014 and vested in 2019. The level of the GIP payment recognises the extraordinary performance of Ocado during this period when the business grew from a circa £1.5bn business to the multibillion pound technology-led global business we are today.” The High Pay Centre figures shows that the biggest pay gaps are in the retail sector, where on average bosses are paid 140 times that collected by employees. The smallest gap was in financial services with a ratio of 35:1. The company with the smallest gap was identified as the asset management firm Sanne Group, where the chief executive collected eight times the median pay. UK companies have been forced to publish chief executive pay ratios in their annual reports following widespread anger over excessive executive pay. The new figures show the relationship of the chief executive’s pay relative to the median and 75th and 25th percentile of the company’s UK employees. Mubin Haq, chief executive of the Standard Life Foundation, said: “There is great potential for rethinking pay, benefiting those on lower incomes. Nowhere is this more stark than in the retail sector, which has the highest levels of inequality. During the pandemic the industry either relied heavily on government support or made significant profits. Rewards are not being fairly shared, but companies can begin to make plans to reduce the gaps that exist.”",business
"The Bank of England has written to UK bank bosses telling them to review their exposure to losses that could emerge from businesses hardest-hit by Covid-19, as part of efforts to head off potential risks to the financial system. The review is likely to cover the accommodation, food, retail, leisure and construction sectors, which have been battered by travel restrictions and strict social distancing measures, as well as regional and nationwide-lockdowns imposed since March. The Bank outlined its plans in a letter to the chief executives of UK banks on Tuesday, saying it was expecting an increase in customers facing financial difficulty, as well as borrowers falling into arrears and default, next year. The central bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is already conducting three reviews looking at the risks linked to small and medium-sized businesses, the buy-to-let market and the way banks collect the debts of ordinary customers. The new review of the sectors hardest hit by the Covid crisis will cover companies included in the lenders’ wholesale portfolios, which deal with some of the biggest corporate clients on their books. “We anticipate further thematic work on wholesale portfolios in potentially Covid-19-vulnerable sectors, plus some international portfolios subject to challenging economic and credit risk conditions,” the letter said. The PRA added it would continue monitoring banks’ financial health throughout the crisis, including their ability and willingness to continue lending to businesses and households. In a separate letter to insurance bosses, the central bank said insurance firms would have to prove that they could collapse without damaging the UK economy, setting out how they could wind down in an orderly fashion. It will be the first time insurers are required to submit so-called living wills to the regulator. The central bank warned insurers: “We have very low tolerance for disorderly failure and its costs for policyholders and the wider economy. “We will expect firms to demonstrate that they have a suitable structure and business model, and adequate contingency plans to be able to exit the market smoothly without detriment to policyholders or spill-overs to other firms.” Banks are already required to submit living wills to the PRA to show that they could afford to foot the bill for their own failures. However, while banks’ living wills will eventually be made public, the PRA is not currently planning to release insurers’ blueprints in the same way.",business
"LoveHolidays, one of the UK’s biggest online travel agents, has been ordered to refund £18m to more than 40,000 customers after their trips were cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Competition and Markets Authority started investigating the firm after receiving hundreds of complaints from people waiting to get their money back. When customers asked LoveHolidays for a refund, they were told they would only get money back for their flights once the firm had received refunds from the airlines. However, online travel agents are legally bound to refund customers for package holidays cancelled due to coronavirus, regardless of whether or not the agent has received money back from suppliers, such as airlines. LoveHolidays has now signed formal commitments that ensure customers get a full refund. More than £18m will be refunded to 44,000 customers. Of this, so far £7m has been returned to 20,000 customers. The company and another large online agent, On the Beach, left the Association of British Travel Agents in September following disputes over customer refunds. LoveHolidays, which is licensed to carry 1.1 million passengers a year, said then that the package holiday regulations, which oblige companies to issue a refund within 14 days, had not been designed to deal with disruption on the scale since March. The watchdog has accepted LoveHolidays’ commitment to repay customers in full by the end of March at the latest, after reviewing the firm’s financial information.  Refunds will be made in two parts. Refunds for the cost of hotel accommodation and transfers must be made by 31 December for holidays cancelled before 1 November. From January, customers will receive refunds for accommodation and transfers within 14 days of a holiday being cancelled. Customers will have to wait longer to have their flights refunded, until the end of February or March depending on when their holidays were cancelled. If the firm fails to repay customers by the dates set, the CMA is prepared to take the company to court. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: “Travel agents have a legal responsibility to make prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus. “Our action today means that LoveHolidays’ customers now have certainty over when they will receive their money back and they will receive this without undue delay. “We are continuing to investigate package travel firms and where we find evidence that businesses are breaching consumer law, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action to protect consumers.” The watchdog has written to more than 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations under consumer protection laws, and has secured refund commitments from Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, Tui UK, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals.",business
"British American Tobacco has moved a step closer to producing a vaccine for coronavirus using tobacco plants, as it won approval in the US to begin testing on humans. The company behind cigarette brands including Lucky Strike, Rothmans and Benson & Hedges said the US Food & Drug Administration had given it clearance to begin a clinical study with adult volunteers. While large pharmaceutical companies are already producing vaccines, BAT believes its own can be produced in six weeks, compared with the several months it takes using conventional methods. This, the company claims, is because of proprietary technology that allows elements of the vaccine to gather quickly on tobacco plants. BAT also says its vaccine is stable at room temperature, unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech jab being administered in the UK, which must be stored and transported at about -70C. The vaccine has been developed by BAT’s biotechnology division, Kentucky BioProcessing (KBP), which has previously worked on a treatment for Ebola and is also developing a seasonal flu vaccine. BAT said KBP had cloned a portion of the genetic sequence of coronavirus and developed a potential antigen, which is then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction. KBP, which is based in Owensboro, Kentucky, says it can turn tobacco plants into “bio-manufacturing factories” capable of producing proteins they would not otherwise produce. Up to 3m can be grown, harvested and processed within six weeks, meaning the relevant proteins are produced faster than traditional methods, which KBP said could take months. The company, which was bought by BAT in 2014, says it can also temporarily encode tobacco plants with the genetic instructions to produce specific target proteins. Dr David O’Reilly, BAT’s director of scientific research, said: “Moving into human trials with both our Covid-19 and seasonal flu vaccine candidates is a significant milestone and reflects our considerable efforts to accelerate the development of our emerging biologicals portfolio. “It is our unique plant-based vaccine technology, which acts as a fast, efficient host for the production of antigens for a variety of diseases, that has enabled us to make this progress and respond to the urgent global need for safe and effective treatments and vaccines.” BAT’s vaccine remains some way behind those being produced by large drug companies such as Pfizer, which is administering doses in the UK and US, with AstraZeneca and Moderna not far behind. But if it can produce doses quickly and in a stable format, it could aid a global vaccination process likely to last years, as well as burnishing the reputation of a company more used to fielding criticism for damaging people’s health.",business
"Steep discounting by clothing retailers pushed down UK inflation in November as the second national coronavirus lockdown in England and tough restrictions across the country kept consumers away from the high street. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer prices index fell to 0.3% in November from 0.7% a month earlier. City economists had forecast an inflation rate of 0.6% Retailers are under renewed pressure as the rapid growth in infections discourages consumers from heading to the shops and amid fresh restrictions imposed in England, alongside tough measures in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Consumers increased their spending during England’s four-week lockdown, but did so online, according to figures from the British Retail Consortium. The ONS said clothes prices would usually go up in November in the run-up to Christmas. However, the pandemic has drastically altered usual spending trends and the British economy has been struggling to escape the deepest recession for more than 300 years. Falling food and drink prices also dragged down the inflation rate by the most since 2017, driven by goods such as vegetables and confectionery. These were partially offset by rising prices for games, toys and hobbies. The drop in inflation comes as the second national lockdown in England forced the closure of many non-essential shops, making it harder for retailers to sell clothing at normal prices. Analysts said the extension of Black Friday discounts by some retailers for the whole month of November – in a bid to boost consumer spending during lockdown – also influenced the drop in inflation. In additional to steep discounts, reminiscent of the first lockdown in March and April, analysts said the failure of several big high street clothing chains in recent weeks may have also contributed to falling prices, as companies liquidate their stocks. Economists said inflation was likely to remain below the 2% target set for the Bank of England’s interest rate setting committee, as higher levels of unemployment and tough coronavirus restrictions drag down demand for goods and services. However, Threadneedle Street is not expected to inject further stimulus into the economy when its monetary policy committee (MPC) next sets interest rates on Thursday, after pumping an extra £150bn into its quantitative easing bond-buying programme last month. Despite the weak economic recovery weighing on inflation, analysts said a disruptive Brexit at the end of the month could lead to a fall in the pound and chaos at the ports, which would drive up the cost of imported goods – fuelling a rise in inflation. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: “Early discounting in clothing and footwear lowered inflation, as retailers cut prices to try to boost consumer spend. Working from home has changed people’s needs and households exercised more caution, reining in some non-essential spending in November. “Despite the weak economic background, inflation could accelerate in coming months, with border frictions as a result of Brexit causing some prices to rise more than usual.”",business
"Royal Mail has ended a two-year dispute with workers in a settlement that gives staff an above-inflation pay rise and enables the company to transition to a parcels-led business to cash in on the online shopping boom. The Communications Workers Union (CWU) hailed the “landmark” deal, which it said was an “excellent agreement” for postal workers which offered job security, a reduction in work hours and a pay rise. Workers will get a 3.7% pay rise, backdated to April this year, plus a one-hour reduction in the working week, which the union said equated to a 6.5% increase over the two-year deal. In addition, Royal Mail has agreed there will be no compulsory redundancies – it employs 143,000 workers in the UK – and in return the union has promised to support an ambitious modernisation of the business. “This is a landmark agreement that means that even in these incredibly difficult times, when members stand in solidarity with their union, it is entirely possible to plan a future that can still benefit workers, customers and the company.” Royal Mail has been at loggerheads with the CWU over a five-year £1.8bn turnaround plan launched by the former chief executive Rico Back, which has been held up by the threat of strikes. A walkout last Christmas was only averted after Royal Mail won a high court injunction. Workers have been concerned about job security and employment conditions as Royal Mail looks to introduce new technology and automation to enable the development of a 24/7 parcel delivery service. “We have a window of opportunity to focus Royal Mail on what our customers want today,” said Keith Williams, Royal Mail’s chief executive. “An ever-growing need for more parcels, whilst providing a sustainable letter service. This agreement provides a framework to do just that. We have been far too slow to adapt in the past and now need to deliver change much more quickly.” Royal Mail’s traditional letter business is in long-term decline, with volumes falling about 5% each year since 2015 as people move to digital communications. The trend has accelerated during the pandemic, with Royal Mail reporting that it delivered 1.1bn fewer letters in the five months to the end of August compared with the same period last year.  Last month, research from the postal regulator, Ofcom, found that scrapping Saturday letter deliveries would have no significant impact on consumers, but would save the business up to £225m a year. In contrast, Royal Mail’s parcel delivery operation is booming, thanks to the online shopping revolution, with the company reporting a 31% increase in volumes between April and September as home deliveries surge during the pandemic. Ofcom recently reported that 2.8bn parcels were sent and received via Royal Mail in the year to the end of March – 1bn more than in 2013.",business
"About 4,000 lorries, and thousands more small vans, are now waiting to cross the Channel after a two-day French ban on freight arriving from the UK, with food transport firms warning that potential disruption levels now range between “a shambles and a catastrophe” just as January and the end of Brexit transition looms . Representatives of the Food and Drink Federation and the Road Haulage Association (RHA) told MPs on Tuesday that the hundreds of lorries queued on the M20 into the port of Dover, and at a temporary parking facility at Manston airport in Kent, were only a part of the problem. Many more vehicles, they said, were parked elsewhere in Kent, or waiting to depart from factories and warehouses. Roger Gough, the leader of Kent council, told the BBC that nearly 3,000 vehicles were being held – 632 on the M20 and a further 2,220 at Manston. If vehicles were unable to return to France, the hauliers warned, there would be a shortage of transport to pick up fresh goods from the continent and return to the UK in time to refill shelves after Christmas. Queues could reach 7,000 vehicles, they added. The UK government was on Tuesday evening still trying to unlock the ban, which was imposed by Paris in an effort to contain the spread of a new variant of coronavirus, as talks about a post-Brexit trade deal go down to the wire. Industry insiders said the government was preparing to set up a Covid testing facility at Manston in an attempt to unlock the blockade. Retailers warned on Tuesday that vehicles would need to begin moving within 24 hours or there would be shortages of fresh produce including lettuces, tomatoes, citrus, soft fruit and cauliflowers in stores from 27 December. The British Retail Consortium trade body said it had told the government there was “no alternative to reopening the Channel ports, given that it is a key supply route for fresh produce at this time of year”. While some fresh food shelves could look bare in coming days, retailers urged shoppers not to panic buy. They said there would still be plenty of food as traditional Christmas fare such as potatoes, carrots, brussels sprouts and parnsips were largely grown in the UK and there were plenty of supplies of long-life goods such as tinned and packet foods. However, food industry representatives said that if the French ban continued it would affect preparations for the end of the Brexit transition set for 31 December. The industry had planned to use the week between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day to build stocks of fresh food and other goods in case of any disruption caused by changes to the terms of trade with the EU. Speaking at a special hearing of the business select committee, Duncan Buchanan, director of policy at the RHA, warned the government was being complacent about the growing problems and was making “big assumptions about readiness” for Brexit. He said the government’s suggestion that only a small proportion of goods were being imported via France was “dismissing the scale of the problem”. The haulage industry says a large proportion of fresh food is brought in by lorries from Calais at this time of year. “This problem is going to be significant,” Buchanan said. “Somewhere between a shambles and a catastrophe is coming in January, and everything I’ve seen in the last 24, 48 hours leads me to believe we are going to be in a bad position. “The problem is we do not know what goods exactly will be in short supply and exactly what’s not going to happen properly and what factories are not going to be able to make what they make.” Ian Wright, the chief executive of the FDF, said the disruption at Dover was a “tiny peek at what could happen in the first few days and weeks of the transition period ending and it would be compounded by tariffs and no deal.” He added “this kind of chaos” would be “entirely possible” at a number of ports around the UK exporting and importing from the EU next year. Concerns about imports of fresh food were matched by concerns about exports, particularly Scottish seafood destined for festive feasts in Spain. Wright said companies’ insurance policies would not cover the lost stock and called on the government to compensate firms affected by the delays to deliveries, which could lead to millions of pounds worth of salmon, langoustine and shellfish spoiling. The chief executive of Scotland Food & Drink, James Withers, said that even if a protocol for freight movements was agreed on Tuesday it would already be too late for most Christmas orders. “For some of our shellfish exporters, the pre-Christmas sales have now been ruined. It looks like mission impossible to get products to the big markets in Spain which are held tomorrow. That is an irrecoverable loss of income and I fear about this being a fatal blow to some of the smaller businesses after the horrendous year they have already had,” Withers said.",business
"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”",business
"The telecoms sector has “no genuine belief” the government will be able to meet its broadband targets, a parliamentary inquiry has found, despite those targets having been cut just weeks ago. In its national infrastructure strategy, published in late November, the government announced plans to connect 85% of the country with ultrafast gigabit broadband, which usually requires a fibre-to-the-home connection, by 2025. That target was a downgrade from a previous goal, affirmed as recently as October, to connect 100% of the country by that date. “There is no genuine belief that it is achievable,” one witness told the DMCS select committee about the nationwide goal. But despite the reduced ambitions, the committee has warned that the government still risks missing the new target unless it improves management of the infrastructure plan. “It would not be acceptable having abandoned one unrealistic target, for the government to fail to meet a second, less ambitious, target through lack of effective planning or inadequate investment,” the committee writes in the final report from its inquiry into the UK’s broadband infrastructure. “The government should outline … how it settled on the new gigabit-capable broadband target of 85% coverage by 2025, a full assessment of how likely it considers it to be met, and the detail of how it plans to deliver it,” the report adds. The committee was also doubtful that the government’s belated shift to a “technology-neutral” approach would help achieve the target. Whereas the initial focus had been on securing full-fibre connections, running fibre-optic cables to the doorstep of every home in the UK, the new strategy takes into account other modes of delivering ultrafast broadband, including the latest technology underpinning Virgin Media’s cable TV network, and the fastest varieties of 5G. While the shift makes sense, the committee reported, “the government must not let it come with a trade-off in performance or longevity: any technologies used to deliver gigabit connectivity must be future-proof. “Moreover, fibre will be a significant component of other gigabit-capable technologies, such as 5G, and therefore the challenges of rolling out a truly nationwide full-fibre network must not be underestimated.” The committee also warned that the funding from the government, a £5bn pledge to bring broadband to the hardest to reach fifth of the country, was not enough. “It is difficult to see how £5bn will be enough to meet the government’s aim [and] it is therefore disappointing that over the next four years, the government will make available only 25% of the £5bn it had committed,” the report finds. On Tuesday, the Government set out how it intended to spend that tranche of funding, releasing a procurement strategy that prioritised upgrades to homes that do not yet have access to super-fast broadband. “Today we’ve set out our bold programme of national infrastructure projects to future-proof the UK’s internet networks so we can build back better from coronavirus and create new jobs and economic opportunities,” said Matt Warman, the minister for digital infrastructure. “We will begin these procurements rapidly so broadband providers big and small can move quickly to get the job done and level up communities with this much faster, next generation broadband.”",business
"Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than scheduled before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19 border closures. The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions.",business
"The operator of the Olympic aquatic centre and hundreds of other leisure centres across the UK is being bailed out by cash-strapped local authorities in every area it operates as it struggles with the latest lockdown, the Guardian can reveal. GLL, which trades under the name Better, runs 230 pools, gyms and sports halls in areas including Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Cardiff, Bath, Cumbria and Cornwall and several London boroughs. Its chief executive, Mark Sesnan, warns that the lockdown has come at the worst time possible for a business built on new year’s fitness resolutions. He also fears the government help will not be enough to stop pools and sport centres closing for good. Various local bailouts have been secured in more than 40 of these areas, involving either direct grants, or deferred payments or loans, he said. And negotiations are still underway in the remaining areas, including Croydon council, which declared itself effectively bankrupt last month. Despite these bailouts and the importance of personal fitness highlighted by the pandemic, the business faces “disaster” because the third lockdown was imposed at its most lucrative time of year. It has been forced to close all of its leisure services including outdoor pools despite evidence to suggest swimming in chlorinated pools is safe from Covid infection. GLL was formed in 1993 to run Greenwich council’s leisure service and has since grown to become the biggest social enterprise leisure provider in the country. But it has revealed that the pandemic has cost it £170m in lost revenue, forcing it to spend £20m in reserves. It has also had to take out a £20m loan, cut more than 500 jobs with more under threat, and become dependent on local bailouts and the government’s furlough scheme. Its predicament has led to questions about its business model and calls for the services it runs to be brought back under council control in some areas including Belfast and Swindon. Chief executive, Mark Sesnan, has defended the company’s record and insists it does have a bright future once the latest lockdown is eased. He said: “We’ve moved from being a relatively strong financial business to one that now does rely on support for local authorities. The biggest issue is that some councils are very cash strapped themselves and have more pressing priorities.” He admitted that its business planning is predicated on the furlough scheme, which has helped 10,500 GLL employees, continuing at least until Easter. The government’s promise of £9,000 for each leisure centre won’t be enough, he warned. He pointed out its largest generate £1,000-a-day income, but are currently bringing in nothing. He said: “GLL welcomes and needs any and all financial support, but to be meaningful the amount needs to be based on real business losses, not arbitrary handouts.” Unite the union which represents many of GLL’s staff, says the pandemic has “exposed” GLL’s over reliance on public money and staff on casual contracts. Regional officer, Onay Kasab, said: “The pandemic has exposed GLL in several ways. Their business model relies on local government funding and with austerity it is not a model that can continue. It is not cheaper to outsource, because it ends up costing more money in the long term. The company is clearly in danger of going down, yet council taxpayers money continues to be thrown at it.” Sesnan, a former union shop steward, admitted that more than half the staff are on “flexible” contracts. But he insisted the company is trying to help as many staff as possible. He admitted that GLL’s 50 most inefficient pools and gyms could be forced to close, but these do not include the former Olympic facilities in east London. The most vulnerable pools and sports centres are the ones that did not open after relaxations of lockdown rules, including some in Cornwall, Cumbria, Newcastle, Preston, and a number of London boroughs. The government has insisted its leisure rescue package will not pay for services that remained closed. Sesnan said: “Swimming pools are not easy buildings to hibernate, you can’t just lock the doors and walk away.” And even with paying customers, some subsidy is required. He said. “A swim costs £10 to put on, but nobody pays any more than £5 for it. So whichever way you stack it up someone has to pay for that other fiver.” But despite the difficulties he insists the organisation can survive. “GLL isn’t going down. People who have kept themselves fit have had a much better chance of surviving the virus, than people who haven’t. It’s a low-cost way of preventing things like this in the future. There needs to be a new partnership between the health and fitness going forward. So the future is good.”",business
"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets.  Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips & Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective. “From modern fashion to casual apparel, intimates and footwear, designing fashion for the curvy woman that fits and flatters, is all we do.”",business
"Labor will try to compel the government to release a review into Australia Post’s expenses culture under former chief executive Christine Holgate after the communications minister backtracked on a suggestion it would be made public. On Monday a spokesman for Paul Fletcher confirmed the government had “received and considered” the report triggered by Holgate’s decision to spend $20,000 on Cartier watches for four executives, but refused to release it. The Australian Financial Review has reported that Holgate was cleared of any wrongdoing, with a specific finding she had not breached any rule, policy, procedure or governance requirement – a conclusion that was not disputed by Fletcher’s office. In October Holgate stood down after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, denounced the corporate gifts as “disgraceful” – comments she later labelled “humiliating”. Despite warning the government that the “optics” of the situation were not sufficient to make her stand down, Holgate resigned early in November, expressing regret over the gifts. In November Fletcher told ABC TV he expected the report would be released “in due course” and with appropriate redactions to respect individual privacy, but that the final decision would be one for cabinet. On Monday Fletcher’s spokesman said only that departments would “apply the lessons learned from the investigation to ensure that Australia Post and other government business enterprises comply with their legislative obligations, reflect community expectations, and have appropriate internal systems in place in their use of public resources”. The shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the decision to keep the report secret “is pathetic and, just like the purchase of Cartier watches, does not pass the pub test”.“If there is nothing to see here, why is the government burying the report? “If no breaches were found, why was the former CEO seemingly pressured into quitting without pay?” Rowland accused the government of an “abuse of process” by using cabinet consideration of the document to shield it from freedom of information requests. “If the government does not think taxpayers deserve to know whether their money has been wasted by senior Australia Post executives, then the Senate will need to take up the task.” Labor has criticised Morrison’s handling of the episode as a “panicked” response aimed at securing a photo opportunity. Morrison’s denouncement of Holgate followed cuts to the Australian National Audit Office and mild criticism of its discovery taxpayers had stumped up $26.7m too much for land owned by a donor to the Liberal party.",business
"December was the biggest month on record for British supermarkets as shoppers spent nearly £12bn stocking up on cheese, fresh fish and pork for a very unusual Christmas. Consumers spent £11.7bn on take-home groceries in the four weeks to 27 December, up from the previous record of just under £11bn in November, according to analysts at Kantar, as many pubs and restaurants were forced to close during the key trading period. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail at Kantar, said: “December is always an incredibly busy time for supermarkets, but take-home grocery shopping is usually supplemented by celebrations in restaurants, pubs and bars – with £4bn spent on food and drink, excluding alcohol, out of the home during the normal festive month. This year, almost all those meals were eaten at home and retailers stepped up monumentally to meet the surge in demand.” However, sales of whole turkeys slid 5% and Christmas pudding sales were flat year on year as most large family celebrations were called off under strict rules to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus. McKevitt said: “Without guests to host, it seems many families decided to pare things back slightly and the performance of traditional dinner items reflects this.” While total grocery sales rose 11.4% in the three months to 27 December, spending on Christmas staples was up just 4%, despite fewer opportunities to dine out. Sprouts remained popular with sales up more than 11% but other winners were cheese, with sales up 17%, fresh fish up 20% and pork roasting joints up 19%. Alcohol sales were up by £310m – as the closure of pubs and bars led to a switch to drinking at home. Monday 21 December was the busiest shopping day – earlier than the expected surge on 23 December – as households secured festive supplies amid the uncertainties of tiered lockdowns and problems at the Channel ports which disrupted deliveries of fruit and vegetables. However, Morrisons was the only one of the big four supermarkets to gain market share as local independent stores, discounters Lidl and Iceland and online specialist Ocado all outperformed the major chains. Sales at independent stores rose by 17.4% while Iceland was by far the fastest growing chain among those with high street outlets with sales up by more than a fifth. Ocado’s sales rose 36.5% according to Kantar, more than three times the pace of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda. That reflected a market-wide shift towards online shopping with 12.6% of grocery sales made via the internet in December compared with just 7.4% a year before. Aldi continued to lose market share with sales up 6.3% as it lost out to businesses with the capability to deliver online orders.",business
"China’s stock market has soared to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis as the world’s second-largest economy mounts a rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the value of the biggest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, closed up 1.9% on Tuesday at 5,368 points – the highest level since January 2008. Narrowly surpassing a level of 5,353 reached in 2015, when fears over a hard landing for China’s economy after years of blockbuster growth led to a sell-off in shares, the fresh landmark stands as the latest dramatic turnaround in global financial markets since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as China’s economy stages a faster recovery than expected at a time when other nations around the world are still grappling with rising infections and severe disruption to business and social life caused by the pandemic. As the nation at the centre of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, Chinese GDP fell for the first time in four decades in the opening months of 2020. However, many analysts believe harsh controls to contain the spread of the disease helped to lay the ground for a faster return to relative normality. China avoided the technical definition of a recession last year – two consecutive quarters of falling GDP – with a return to growth in the three months to June as it rolled back lockdown restrictions. After recording growth of just 1.9% for 2020 as a whole – the lowest level for 30 years – the International Monetary Fund expects China’s economy to grow by more than 8% in 2021, dramatically outpacing the recovery in many other countries. Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, an investment management firm, said the gains on the Chinese stock market reflected its rapid recovery. “China’s rebound is quite remarkable, compared to other major economies, many of which are once again rolling out stricter restrictions to stop the spread of Covid amid a tsunami of new cases.” “China’s already impressive economic recovery is likely to pick up momentum and this will be extremely attractive. But as 2020 showed us with perhaps too much clarity, things can change quickly and so-called ‘certainties’ can shift overnight,” he said. The fresh landmark for the Chinese stock market came on a day of choppy trading on the London stock market, with the FTSE 100 closing up 0.6% at 6,612, after recording modest losses earlier in the day amid concerns over the economic impact of the third Covid lockdown in England. There are however hopes for a stronger economic recovery in Britain once more people receive vaccinations, which could propel the blue-chip index higher. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading firm IG, said: “The swift nature of the vaccination process should ensure that any lockdown-fuelled weakness will be greeted by buying pressure as we look towards a March reopening.”",business
"When the UK first went into lockdown last March, many supermarket workers said they had never felt so appreciated. Customers would thank them for their service, leave chocolates for the staff room and applaud delivery vans as if they were carrying royalty rather than groceries. Not any more, according to numerous store employees who contacted the Guardian to express their fears and frustrations about working through the second wave. From debit card refuseniks pulling down their masks to lick their fingers and separate their twenties, to families treating a trip to the supermarket as a social outing, many felt they were now the “forgotten key workers”. Others feel taken for granted, suffering anxiety and panic attacks as a result of their work environment. “In lockdown one it felt a little embarrassing at times – people would wave, even stop and applaud as you went past as if you were a NHS worker. Now, it’s back to normal. Block a cul-de-sac for five minutes and you can expect abuse,” said Ben Harvey, who started delivering groceries for a supermarket in April after losing his job as a sales executive. “You want to tell them that you’re delivering essential supplies during a global pandemic and they shouldn’t even be out, but in your employer’s van and uniform you obviously just have to bite your tongue and suck it up.” Conspiracy theorists are making the job harder, said one worker from a small supermarket in the home counties. “The maskless hordes and the QAnon conspiracy spouters seem to grow by the day. Many don’t care, some are just ignorant; but the most dangerous are those that think they’re following the rules. Customers who keep their distance from others, but crawl over shop staff to get their ‘essential’ Red Bull and loo roll, thanking them for everything they are doing from a mask pulled down to their chin to ‘help’ convey their message with sincerity and microdroplets of Covid-19.” The media seemed to have forgotten supermarket workers, he said: “Doctors and nurses are continually featured in the news (and rightly so), but there is very little mentioned about those who have worked throughout the pandemic and the toll this year has taken on them. “My mental health has been battered beyond belief and no matter what my behemoth employer says – there has been no consideration shown to the wellbeing and mental health of their staff. It has gone unchecked and unconsidered while we ring endless products through the non-socially distanced checkouts and stuff dirty cash into the ever expanding pockets of the shareholders and directors.” Social distancing had gone out of the window, he complained: “My little village shop is tiny, it has three aisles and (literally) no room to swing a cat on the shop floor. The company have told us that the customer limit is 22 people. I cannot express how crazy the notion of cramming 22 customers, plus five or so staff, into the shop is. [My employer] decided towards the end of the first lockdown to remove the one-way system in its stores. We appealed against that decision, and still do, but are told that ‘people weren’t following it’.” One home shopper working in Sussex said there had been an increase in people treating a trip to the supermarket as a day out or an excuse to socialise. “There are just far too many people who come in and wander around the shop because they don’t have anything else to do”, or whole families of six or more people,” she said. As a home shopper, she spends long shifts packing six bags at a time for online customers. “It may sound a bit dramatic, but we feel like we are literally putting our lives on the line, like any frontline worker, so that people can eat. If delivery and home shopping didn’t exist, people would have to go out.” A till worker in a supermarket in Scotland said mask etiquette was poor. “People get to my till, puffing away and moaning about ‘not being able to breathe’ even though they haven’t turned blue yet and are speaking clearly to me. They believe so much that they can’t breathe they pull the mask away from their mouths and down to their chin as if being at the till suddenly makes it safe to do this and Covid only goes as far as the till belt. Oh and let’s not forget the amount of old people and middle aged people who all pull their masks down, lick their fingers to give me cash because the ‘notes all stick together’.” The manager of one store in south-east England said several members of their team were suffering from anxiety and panic attacks as a result of customer behaviour. Mental health problems were being exacerbated by staff shortages, she said. “Most staff members are exhausted because colleagues are shielding/self isolating and so everyone else takes the strain because there is still a lot of work to do. On New Year’s Eve I overheard lots of customers talking about the secret party/gatherings they were having and laughing about breaking the rules. It’s really hard to hear stuff like that, especially when they are not just putting their friends lives at risk, but ours too. It makes you feel so angry, actually and I often want to say something to them.” There was a bigger sense of comradeship before, she said. “People were doing their neighbours shopping and learning how to bake and cook etc. We were the only people that customers were seeing and we got to know them better. People would send us letters of thanks and care packages etc as key workers and we felt valued. All of the goodwill towards key workers seems to have vanished now. We feel exhausted, stressed and abused most of the time. It’s really hard to switch off too. But still we go back each day and keep filling the shelves to feed the nation.” ",business
"The cards and stationery retailer Paperchase is on the brink of administration after pre-Christmas store closures put an “unbearable strain” on the high street, putting 1,500 jobs at risk. The company, which has 173 stores and concessions, has filed a notice to appoint administrators as it tries to put together a rescue. The legal document provides protection from creditors for 10 days. Paperchase was particularly vulnerable to the sales disruption caused by lockdowns in the run-up to Christmas as 40% of the chain’s annual sales are rung up in November and December. New restrictions mean all its UK stores are once again closed, in line with other non-essential retail outlets. A spokesman for Paperchase said the cumulative effect of multiple lockdowns, including the loss of crucial Christmas trade in November, had put “unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country”. Paperchase, he said, was not immune to the tough backdrop, despite strong online sales. “Out of lockdown we’ve traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase.” The spokesman added that the company was “working hard to find that solution” with the administration notice a “necessary part of this work”. The accountancy firm PwC has been lined up to handle the process. “This is not the situation we wanted to be in,” the Paperchase spokesman added. “Our team has been fantastic throughout this year and we cannot thank them enough for their support.” The company was founded in 1968 by art students Judith Cash and Eddie Pond, who opened a store in London’s Kensington. The company has changed hands numerous times, with high street rival WH Smith and now defunct US books giant Borders among the chain’s previous owners. In 2010 the private equity firm Primary Capital backed a £20m management buyout from Borders. Primary Capital, which had also owned Yo Sushi and Coffee Nation, tried to sell Paperchase in 2014 and considered a stock market flotation two years later. In 2019 Paperchase used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable stores and cut rents. It blamed its financial problems on a decline in customer numbers coupled with rising costs. The CVA switched some of its stores to turnover-based rents, meaning the firm is not as burdened with property costs as some retail chains.  The last set of accounts show the retailer making a loss of £11m on sales of £125m in the year to February 2019.",business
"Pubs, restaurants and breweries in England have given a lukewarm reception to Rishi Sunak’s offer of grants of up to £9,000 to help them survive until the spring, warning the financial “sticking plaster” will not stave off closures in the long term. On the morning after the prime minister imposed a seven-week lockdown that will force hundreds of thousands of businesses across England to close, the chancellor announced a £4.6bn package of support for the retail, hospitality and leisure industries. But with the hospitality sector on its knees, having been singled out for tough restrictions, industry figures called for a more comprehensive long-term plan, while craft breweries decried a lack of support for their previously thriving industry. “While this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills,” said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality. “It is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector.” More than half a million businesses across England will have to close due to the third lockdown, according to the real estate adviser Altus Group. Most are non-essential retailers that were previously able to trade but the number also includes 27,022 restaurants and 37,515 pubs, many of which have already been shut for extended periods, including the lucrative Christmas weeks. Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey, whose company leases premises to 1,000 publicans, said most would still be unable to cover their costs, with smaller venues particularly vulnerable. “It won’t be sufficient to stave off a lot of difficulties and closures,” he said. The grants, worth £277m across England’s pubs sector, are based on the “rateable value” of a premises, effectively the rent the site could command on the open market. Those with a rateable value above £51,000 – typically larger pubs such as big chain venues – can get the maximum £9,000 grant. Smaller venues with a rateable value of less than £15,000 – often community pubs that largely serve alcohol – are only eligible for £4,000. Jowsey said this amounted to about £1,000 a month if restrictions on opening stay in place until the end of March. Together with existing support worth £1,334 a month for smaller pubs, the combined package falls well short of the £3,000 he said smaller pubs needed just to keep their heads above water. “That’s got to cover everything, including living expenses and feeding their family,” said Jowsey. “It doesn’t leave anything for rent.” About two thirds of Admiral’s 1,000 pubs fall into the smaller venues category in terms of rateable value – less than £15,000 - and the company is charging them a maximum of £500 per month, about a third of what they would usually pay. Pub and beer trade bodies said extra support from the government provided a lifeline but would only bring short-term respite, with far more comprehensive measures needed in the long-term. British Beer and Pubs Association chief executive Emma McClarkin said: “Without this support, pubs across England were at real risk of being lost for good at the beginning of this year. “We had been anticipating permanent closures in the very short term without it.” She said their longer-term survival would required an extension of business rates relief and the cut to VAT on hospitality to 5%, which is due to expire at the end of March. She also called for a cut in beer duty. The real ale group Camra called for a long-term sector-specific support package to help pubs survive. “While one-off grant support is welcome, it is nowhere near enough to cover the haemorrhaging costs for pubs and breweries that don’t see any end in sight,” its chair, Nik Antona, said. Camra also backed the anger expressed by small breweries’ trade body Siba that pubs will not be allowed to serve takeaway beers during the lockdown. Siba’s chief executive, James Calder, said craft breweries, which have not been eligible for much of the support available to the hospitality sector, had already lost 80% of their route to market due to the closure of pubs. “Sales through takeaway, click-and-collect and drive-through have enabled many to just about survive up to now,” he said. “This reversal in policy directly discriminates against small businesses while allowing supermarkets to continue to sell beer from global breweries.”",business
"The Swiss insurance firm Zurich has introduced fully paid “lockdown leave” for parents and other carers in its UK offices. The company’s UK division said it would offer two weeks’ paid leave for parents facing childcare emergencies because of the closure of primary and secondary schools across the country. Zurich estimates this will benefit more than one in five of its 4,500 UK employees who have children. The 10 days’ additional leave can be taken individually or consecutively. Employees who are struggling to juggle work and caring for elderly parents or other vulnerable family members are also entitled to take 10 days’ lockdown leave. Zurich said it was the first insurance firm in the UK to announce such a move, and could be the first company overall to do so. Steve Collinson, Zurich’s head of HR, said: “With schools closed, working parents will be frantically trying to juggle their jobs and childcare responsibilities. We already offer flexibility for employees who want to change their working hours or structure some days differently. “But for parents trying to balance work, childcare and home schooling, this may not be enough. We’re helping our employees get through this crisis by offering mums and dads paid time-off so they can look after their health and their family. This is also available for anyone with other caring commitments.” Matt Potter, who works in IT for Zurich, said he was “very impressed with the offer”. He will ask his manager for the next five Fridays off to enable him to look after his two daughters, aged seven and nine, whose school closed on Tuesday. He and his wife work full-time and have been working from home near Southampton since the first lockdown in March. “We’ve got quite an issue here with trying to be teachers and looking after the children,” he said. Schools are closed until at least mid-February in England as part of its third Covid-19 lockdown, with pupils moving to online learning. Scotland has also embarked on another lockdown this week, and schools will remain shut until 1 February, while those in Wales are closed until at least 18 January. Schools in Northern Ireland have been told to remain shut for an unspecified period. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson said schools in England would be first to reopen when the lockdown lifts – but stressed he would be “extremely cautious” about when that could happen.",business
"A former manager with Royal Mail has been awarded nearly £230,000 after a tribunal concluded he had been subjected to harassment and discrimination at work. Mathan Shunmugaraja, who is a Hindu, was called a “sly dog” by one colleague and was embroiled in a dispute with another over the use of a room in which he was mistaken for a Muslim. The tribunal also heard that after Shunmugaraja took time off work because of anxiety, one of his bosses threatened to stop his sick pay. Shunmugaraja, a maths graduate, was eventually dismissed. He unsuccessfully applied for dozens of other jobs but could not find work and has split his time between sofa-surfing in the UK and living in a rural part of India with his mother. The tribunal was told that Shunmugaraja described himself as being of British Indian origin, and as a Hindu. He began working for Royal Mail in Cardiff in August 2007 and by 2017 was earning £32,000 a year. The worker who in June 2017 called Shunmugaraja “a sly dog” claimed the slur did not have racial connotations but the tribunal accepted the term “dog” and the phrase “sly dog” would be perceived as an insult in many cultures and could have racial connotations. It said: “The tribunal finds it was reasonable for the claimant to be so offended, given that the term is regarded as being highly offensive in many cultures.” In his evidence, Shunmugaraja said what particularly upset him was that the comment had been made in front of his line manager but no further action was taken against the colleague. One of Shunmugaraja’s roles was to hold weekly training and planning meetings. He began using a space known as the “quiet room” that a Christian colleague used for praying. In August 2017 the colleague reacted angrily when he realised that Shunmugaraja was using it as a meeting room. He got Shunmugaraja’s religion wrong, saying he would not have used a Muslim prayer room for the meeting. The tribunal concluded this amounted to religious discrimination. Shunmugaraja described his dismissal in January 2018 as a “fall from grace”. He said he had considered his colleagues at Royal Mail as family. The tribunal said: “The claimant loved his job, was clearly performing at a very good level and had every expectation that he would continue to progress his career at Royal Mail until his retirement.” Royal Mail was ordered to pay £229,000, which includes compensation for lost and future earnings and for injury to feelings. A spokesperson said: “Royal Mail is disappointed by this decision. We are now carefully reviewing the findings. Royal Mail takes its equality and diversity obligations very seriously and is committed to a workplace free of discrimination and harassment, where our colleagues feel respected and able to thrive.”",business
"It is a festive season like no other – particularly for beleaguered retailers. In a normal trading year, stores would have concentrated on selling as much full-price stock as possible in their peak pre-Christmas trade. Yet months of stop-start restrictions have taken their toll, leading many British retailers to slash prices earlier than in previous years, even before Christmas Day. Some are also offering deeper discounts, rising to as much as 70% off, in an effort to lure shoppers online or into those branches that remained open. There have been higher levels of promotional activity than usual this year, peaking around Black Friday, according to data from PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC tracked the daily promotional activity of 206 online retailers and found that 90% offered some kind of sale around Black Friday, before reining in discounts from the start of December. Overall, retailers have offered shoppers more targeted discounts than in previous years, to encourage them to spend, according to PwC, as opposed to blanket discounts that are valid for all products. “Retailers are learning to use their approach to promotions more effectively, and this year it’s important that they hold on to as much margin as possible,” said Lisa Hooker, the consumer markets lead at PwC. Lockdowns and the temporary closure of non-essential stores in all home nations of the UK may be responsible for some discounting, according to Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics. “Lots of retailers had all of their stock and inventory in a number of stores which were closed, they missed out on these precious, vital weeks running up to Christmas,” Lim said. “At such short notice, many of them couldn’t suddenly start shipping out online orders from stores. A lot of retailers were heading into the December period with a lot more stock than they would usually have at this time of year.” The pandemic has created winners and losers within the retail industry, and led to diverging approaches to pre-Christmas discounting. Furniture retailers have struggled to keep up with demand for homeware, allowing them to be more sparing with their reductions. The UK market leader, DFS Furniture, which trades from stores branded DFS, Sofa Workshop, Dwell and Sofology, told investors in mid-December that soaring sales had led to longer lead times for its made-to-order sofas. It has been a different story for fashion retailers, however, who have faced a toxic cocktail of challenges during 2020 – the widespread cancellation of events and special occasions, the months-long closure of stores, and the continued closure of changing rooms. With nowhere to go, shoppers never bothered to get dressed up. They spurned suits and stilettos in favour of slippers and sweatpants. As a result, clothing stores have been the clear outlier in the run-up to Christmas, offering promotions on all items to try to clear their stock. Some of the biggest reductions are available at shops that are in administration – including the collapsed department store Debenhams and the Arcadia brands such as Topshop – as the firms’ administrators look to swiftly raise cash. The Debenhams website promises shoppers reductions of up to 70% on women’s clothing in its “closing down sale”, while discounts of 60% are highlighted at Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. Such swingeing discounting creates problems for competitors who might have hoped to hold off reductions until after Christmas. John Lewis, which still has its “never knowingly unsold” promise to match prices at its direct competitors, has been obliged to follow some of Debenhams’s discounts. House of Fraser, owned by Mike Ashley, tried to tempt shoppers with 20% off all full-price items to encourage a final spend before Christmas Day, while the fast fashion retailer Zara launched its Christmas sale earlier than retail analysts anticipated. This Christmas may turn out to be a “last gasp” for large-scale retail purchases, according to Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of the retail marketing agency Savvy. “This year is the year of things,” she said. “If everything has returned to normal next year thanks to a vaccine, next Christmas will be more about experiences and spending time with people.” Retail analysts also caution that consumers should not necessarily expect this most unusual year to set a trend for future pre-Christmas reductions. With difficult trading conditions set to continue along with a squeeze on consumer spending, some of the retailers desperately slashing prices may not be around to see next Christmas.",business
"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain & Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure.  Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain & Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales. The 1,300 employees in Brains pubs will transfer to Marston’s, which employs a further 14,000 people across the UK. Ralph Findlay, the Marston’s chief executive, said the deal would be mutually beneficial and that it “strengthens our representation in south and west Wales, while protecting the heritage and independence of an iconic Welsh business”.",business
"“If you have wealth, you have to share it,” was the watchword of the former president of the World Bank James Wolfensohn, a larger than life, egotistical, supremely confident, inveterate networker, but fundamentally a good and witty man. Wolfensohn, who has died aged 86, made a great deal of money and gave a great deal away. The zenith of his career was his two-term presidency of the World Bank, between 1995 and 2005, where his zest and passion for poverty alleviation left an indelible mark. Unafraid to confront the reality that too much of the World Bank’s lending found itself in anonymous offshore bank accounts held by recipients, he set up an anti-corruption task force, unthinkable before he arrived for fear of legitimising the bank’s critics while potentially smearing some innocent borrowers. Yet he pressed ahead, while simultaneously reconfiguring the bank’s lending programme to recognise another reality: too many less developed countries were just too poor ever to repay what they had been lent – and their loans had to be forgiven. Prefiguring today’s concerns, he broadened the bank’s lending programmes away from the sole support of the hard infrastructure of dams, power generation and ports, towards the social infrastructure of education, particularly of women. To cement the new emphasis he launched the Comprehensive Development Framework to provide recipient countries with rounded metrics to assess their economic and social progress. This apporach took account of educational and health standards as much as per capita income growth. His presidency of the bank was a key moment. Education, public health and the enfranchisement of women were and are as essential to economic development as power, railways and roads. Wolfensohn was always on the move – when in Washington “walking the floor” of the bank’s offices teasing and joking, or just as likely on a plane, his beloved cello often on the seat beside him, touring World Bank clients – he visited 120 countries in all – where he would unfailingly call a spade a spade, however embarrassing the remark. “What’s the difference between God and James Wolfensohn?” ran a joke in Washington. “God is everywhere – so is Wolfensohn, but never here!” He said his passion to contest inequality, to alleviate poverty and give money away as a philanthropist had its roots in his modest upbringing in a two-bedroom flat in a Sydney suburb – which may also have given him his lifelong driving ambition. His parents, Hyman Wolfensohn and Dora Weinbaum, had emigrated to Australia in 1928 after his father’s career in banking at Rothschild fizzled out, never to take off again, although he retained an affection for the Rothschilds. James was clever and hyper-ambitious: at school he would sing the young women’s roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas to get himself noticed and as a natural sportsman represented Australia in the 1956 Olympics as a valued member of the fencing team. He would say that witnessing his Jewish parents, despite their relative poverty, taking in refugees from Nazi Germany fired him up with lifelong sympathy for the dispossessed – and being an Olympian gave him the inner confidence to match his ambition. He really was good enough to climb the heights. After Sydney University he talked himself into Harvard Business School, recognising that a Harvard MBA would be a passport into the City of London that a law degree from Sydney alone would not deliver. So it proved. After a couple of false starts he landed a job at the boutique and fast growing merchant bank Darling and Co. Harvard was also where he met Elaine Botwinick. They married in 1961 and went on to have three children. Darling and Co proved to be a springboard into Schroders, where his affability and cold eye for what was and what not a good deal won him a growing client list. In 1970 he was earmarked for higher things if he could capitalise on the chance to expand Schroders’ operations in New York, where he succeeded spectacularly – courtesy of a contact book, and love of entertaining, already becoming something of a legend. But Schroders in 1976 was unprepared to offer the managing director of its New York operations the top job in the bank, preferring the British aristocrat Lord Airlie to Wolfensohn. Reading the runes, he left to join Salomon Brothers, rising to the top, confirmation of his meteoric impact on Wall Street investment banking. It was the rescheduling of Chrysler’s debts in 1979, saving the car company from bankruptcy, in particular persuading Japanese banks to continue lending, that caught the attention of the titans of Wall Street and the Democratic party establishment. This was a man who could marry high finance, good values and high politics – and put the alchemy to constructive purpose. He was tipped to become president of the World Bank – but the Republicans won the presidency, and even though he took American nationality to secure his chances (only Americans are nominated to the World Bank presidency), the opportunity was lost. Once again he reinvented himself, but as the founder of his own investment firm, Wolfensohn Inc. In the 14 years that followed he was to amass his fortune, and doubled up as a major New York and Washington philanthropist. He chaired Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts in Washington. In a typical combination of self-aggrandisement, genuine affection for music and generosity to Jacqueline de Pré, coping with multiple sclerosis, who wanted renewed purpose in her life, he took lessons from her on the cello. They were given on the condition he performed publicly, which he did on his 50th, 60th and 70th birthdays. Bill Clinton’s presidency – inevitably they were friends – was to give him the chance he craved at the World Bank, and in 1995 he assumed the presidency. Garlanded in honours by Britain, the US, Germany and his native Australia, he lived out a happy semi-retirement from 2005 that combined philanthropy and consultancy – giving up the role of peace envoy in the Middle East after 11 months because, he said, there was nothing he could usefully do. Elaine died in August. He is survived by a son and two daughters.   James David Wolfensohn, banker, born 1 December 1933; died 25 November 2020",business
" Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year. Furniture retailers reported a 5.3% rise, as consumers invested in big ticket items. Britons treated themselves – as well as friends and family they could not see – to flowers throughout the year, with spending at florists rising 22.7%. Crafts and hobby spending increased 9.8%, and pets were given extra attention with vet and pet retail increasing 10.7%. But the report also shows how much restaurants suffered despite Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” initiative over the summer. Restrictions throughout the rest of the year contributed to a 47% drop in restaurant spending, while bars and pubs took a 36.7% hit. However, Covid restrictions contributed to a 49.1% rise in spending on online takeaway orders, while meal subscription services jumped 62.4%. Demand for at-home entertainment pushed spending on digital subscriptions up 31.5%, while money spent on electronics including game consoles rose 10.8%. Meanwhile, general online retailers benefited from a 52.5% hike in spending. Raheel Ahmed, Barclaycard’s head of consumer products, said: “2020 has accelerated many trends. E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally, and experiences within the home, such as virtual workouts, have become the norm.” Travel spending, including on airlines and travel agents, tumbled 61.1% in August and 63.1% in September, as coronavirus restrictions and quarantine rules took their toll. “Hopefully with a vaccine being rolled out in 2021 we will see green shoots for the most severely impacted sectors,” Ahmed said. “Having said that, some of the trends and changes we have seen in customer habits may be here to stay.”",business
"The UK’s high streets were largely deserted on Boxing Day, with shopper numbers down more than 60% on last year as people remained at home amid tighter coronavirus restrictions. Data from the retail consultancy Springboard showed footfall on high streets, in retail parks and shopping centres on Boxing Day collapsed by nearly 76% in areas with tier 4 restrictions, where all non-essential shops selling things such as clothes, toys, furniture and electrical items were shut. Even in tiers 2 and 3, where all shops were allowed to open, footfall was down by 33.1% and 38.5% respectively, as many people opted to stay home. The UK’s high streets posted a 63.3% fall in shopping numbers compared with Boxing Day 2019; shopping centres were down 65.4%, and retail parks recorded a 45% decline. Marks & Spencer and John Lewis decided to remain closed on Boxing Day this year. The tougher coronavirus restrictions have compounded what has been a disastrous year for shops. Even the larger retailers are struggling; for example, the department-store chain Debenhams and the Arcadia Group, which owns brands such as Topshop, Burton, Evans and Dorothy Perkins, have called in administrators. Large parts of England, comprising 43% of the population, are under strict tier 4 restrictions, while Scotland and Northern Ireland imposed fresh lockdowns on Boxing Day and Wales reintroduced restrictions that had been eased for Christmas Day. Regional cities suffered a 72.2% fall in shopper numbers, while central London posted an 84.1% drop on Boxing Day, Springboard found. This compares with declines of 40.2% in coastal towns and 52.2% in market towns, showing people prefer to shop local. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: “Boxing Day has been attracting less retail footfall each year in five of the past seven years, as shoppers turn online to grab the best bargains. “Interestingly, Boxing Day has been evolving into more of a leisure-based day, with shoppers starting their trips later on in the day, and combining shopping trips with eating out and catching up with family and friends. The closure of hospitality in tier 3 and above means shoppers have remained at home and footfall has declined significantly.”",business
"For Jim Portus, who has represented Devon and Cornish fishing interests for 33 years, the Brexit trade deal offered a sobering lesson in broken promises. Having volunteered to delay his retirement as chief executive of the South West Fish Producers Organisation to see the Brexit deal through, Portus questioned the wisdom of his decision on Saturday. “I thought we were going to get a wonderful victory, but many of the promises that were made have not been delivered,” said the 66-year-old. Not only had the sector secured the opportunity to fish far less than they had expected, Downing Street’s claims of safeguarding the sovereignty of the fishing industry – regaining control over UK waters was a central message of the leave campaign in 2016 – appeared wide of the mark. “The deal means we’re still tied to the apron strings of the EU, we’re not an independent coastal state,” said Portus, whose organisation represents almost a third of the 300 or so large trawlers operating out of ports such as Newlyn in south-west Cornwall and Brixham, south Devon. “We should have been deciding the rules and regulations on how to manage those stocks so that we took control of access arrangements for other countries.” Fishing rights were one of the final sticking points in the post-Brexit trade talks, largely due to their political weight, but Portus feels that ultimately Boris Johnson caved in. On Saturday, Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation, accused the prime minister of having “bottled it” on fishing quotas. Portus added: “I’m at the end of my working life but he [Johnson] made promises directly to fishermen and I am very disappointed for them. We should be rebuilding our fleet, encouraging our youngsters. We should be planning for a resurgence instead of being sold down the river again.” Before joining the SWFPO, Portus worked as a fisheries inspector and saw first hand what he felt were the negative impacts of the common fisheries policy, signed in 1970 and which dictated every EU fishing fleet had equal access to European waters. “I’ve witnessed the despondency of the fishing industry for so long. We thought that after the referendum, when we were out of the common fisheries policy, [we would be] free from the influence from Brussels but we are harnessed to their regulations. “Really annoyingly embodied in the deal is a reference to penalties and compensation which must be paid to foreign fishermen if we decide to deny them access to our 12-mile limit in five years’ time. It is disgraceful that he [Johnson] has allowed himself to be dictated to by Brussels.” Elsewhere, UK Fisheries chief executive Jane Sandell said Johnson’s promise that the deal would allow the UK to “catch and eat quite prodigious quantities of extra fish” appeared hollow. “We’re still looking for the ‘prodigious amounts of fish’ we were promised and for us it changes nothing,” she said. A senior member of the UK’s negotiating team defended the agreement, and described fish as “one of the areas where we had to compromise somewhat”, but said this had been done by “both sides”. The official said: “Although there is a transition, at the end of the transition it returns to normal arrangements, and we have full control over our waters.There’s a transition to that point and ideally we would’ve got out of it a bit faster, but where we’ve got to is acceptable and offers gains for the fisheries industry in the short run and a huge right to control everything and work within that after this five-and-a-half-year transition.”",business
"The Hut Group, the online retail company run by the billionaire Matthew Moulding, has spent more than £300m on acquisitions as it continues aggressive expansion plans after listing on the stock market. It is buying Dermstore.com, an online skincare retailer, from the US retail chain Target for $350m (£259m). It is also spending almost £60m on the purchase of two UK-based nutrition suppliers, Claremont Ingredients and David Berryman. The Hut Group (THG) floated its shares on the London Stock Exchange in September in the biggest initial public offering in the UK since 2013. The company was valued at £6.8bn on Christmas Eve, a valuation that would make it part of the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s largest listed companies but for THG’s heavily criticised governance arrangements, which give Moulding tight control of the company. Moulding serves as both chairman and chief executive, while retaining a US-style “founder’s share” which prevents other investors from taking over the company for at least three years. Moulding, who has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party, has also this year received one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history. He is already entitled to shares worth £830m after THG’s share price hit targets set at the initial public offering, but if the company’s value reaches £7.25bn before 31 December 2022 the award could break the £1bn mark. Moulding and the finance boss, John Gallemore, both former Phones4U executives, founded THG in 2004, using a tax loophole to dodge VAT on sales of cheap CDs and DVDs. It then moved into niche retail areas, and used its IT and logistics abilities to expand rapidly. THG plans to expand its existing online retail brands, such as the makeup site Lookfantastic and protein shake brand MyProtein, as well as selling its online retail technology to other companies that want to sell directly to customers. Moulding said: “A key driver behind the decision to list THG on the London Stock Exchange just over three months ago was to enable the group to make major global investments, such as Dermstore.com. “Accessing capital through a London listing has enabled us to accelerate our growth plans and build out a global leadership position within the exciting beauty industry.”",business
"The fast fashion brand Boohoo is selling clothes made by Pakistani factory workers who say they face appalling conditions and earn as little as 29p an hour, an investigation by the Guardian has found. In interviews in the industrial city of Faisalabad, workers at two factories claimed they were paid 10,000PKR (£47) a month, well below the legal monthly minimum wage for unskilled labour of 17,500PKR, while making clothes to be sold by Boohoo. Documentary, video and photographic evidence also appears to support claims of potential safety issues, including motorbikes being parked indoors next to flammable materials. In the rush to produce clothes for the western market, insiders claimed workers would sometimes do 24-hour shifts. One of more than a dozen workers interviewed said: “I know we are exploited and paid less than the legal minimum, but we can’t do anything … if I leave the job another person will be ready to replace me.” After the Guardian approached Boohoo about the findings, the company suspended a supplier, JD Fashion Ltd, and a factory, AH Fashion, from its supply chain while it investigated the claims. Another factory, Madina Gloves, denied workers’ claims that it had recently been making clothes for Boohoo. AH Fashion, which is closed for construction work, acknowledged it had fulfilled an order for the brand as recently as October. Boohoo said a third-party audit at AH Fasion on 2 November had found the factory working with no problems. It later said its own auditors had paid a separate visit in response to the allegations and said the factory was a “building site”. The auditors said they were told by the owner it had been closed throughout November for significant construction – a claim disputed by workers who said they were there more recently. The Guardian was able to buy a £30 tracksuit on Boohoo’s website this month that appeared to match fabrics and identifying labels seen in video footage filmed at AH Fashion. A week after Boohoo was alerted to allegations that the item was made by workers paid less than the minimum wage, it remained on sale. The news comes months after Boohoo, one of Britain’s best-known fast fashion brands, faced the damaging fallout from the discovery of poor conditions in factories in Leicester. Since then its share price has started to recover, and in September investors saw a 51% year-on-year surge in profits. While the firm’s code of conduct for suppliers sets out a list of minimum standards that must be met by manufacturers of its clothes anywhere in the world, workers in two factories based in the Samanabad area of Faisalabad allege that: Video footage seen by the Guardian appeared to show: The factories, which each employ more than 100 people, denied any wrongdoing and said workers were paid in accordance with local laws. Madina Gloves said claims of low pay and mistreatment of workers were “totally wrong”, while AH Fashion said workers were always paid and treated fairly. JD Fashion, a Preston-based intermediary that has supplied Boohoo with items produced at AH Fashion, said its last order there was in October and there was no Boohoo order currently in place, while AH and Madina denied they were currently supplying Boohoo. JD Fashion has no connection to the retailer JD Sports. Boohoo said it “will not tolerate any instance of mistreatment or underpayment of garment workers”. It said it was unaware of its clothes being made at Madina Gloves, and that AH Fashion was not on its approved supplier list for JD for an order delivered to the UK on 11 December. The £30 colour-block tracksuit bought by the Guardian from that consignment matched a design visible in one of the videos recorded at AH Fashion – and featured a distinctive “JD” label similar to one seen being sewn into an item in another clip. Other videos and pictures taken at the two factories also appear to corroborate workers’ claims that they have been making clothes for Boohoo recently, with the brand’s labels and logos visible. Auditing professionals, who asked to remain anonymous because of their position in the industry, watched the videos showing piled-up fabrics, motorbikes indoors and poles on bricks at AH Fashion, and said they considered the footage raised questions over fire risks and general safety. One auditor who viewed the videos said they presented potential issues but not conclusive evidence of the level of risk. Another called them a possible “recipe for disaster”, and added: “If I [was asked] to do an audit, I would refuse and ask [the] brand to pull goods out of the factory immediately … I would run out of the factory if I saw this.” AH said construction work and a lack of space were responsible. In July, Boohoo’s stock market value fell by £1.5bn in two days over allegations that its Leicester suppliers forced workers to continue in cramped conditions during the first Covid lockdown and paid below minimum wage. The company accepted the recommendations of a report from Allison Levitt QC, which described its attitude to the plight of workers in the city as “inexcusable”.  Speaking to MPs last week, its billionaire co-founder Mahmud Kamani acknowledged that Boohoo’s model of continuous expansion came with risks, saying: “In a business like ours that’s fast-growing globally, there will be things that are breaking, and all the time we are fixing them and making them better.” He also warned he could take more business overseas, saying: “For us to move out of Leicester, it’s very easy for us to take all our production offshore.” Boohoo pointed to what it said was “immediate action” to remedy the issues found in Leicester and suggested it would take a similar approach in Faisalabad. “As part of our international compliance programme, AH Fashion received a SMETA [Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit] audit in November 2020, where no issues of this nature were found, so these allegations are extremely concerning,” it said. “Independent compliance and auditing specialists Bureau Veritas are on the ground in Faisalabad and we have instructed them to immediately investigate these claims … Any supplier who does not treat their workers with the respect they deserve has no place in the Boohoo supply chain.”",business
"The Gym Group, one of Britain’s largest operators of low-cost gyms, has opened talks with lenders after reporting that revenues almost halved last year and member numbers plunged by more than 200,000 due to the pandemic. The company, which runs 184 gyms across the UK, said revenues fell by 48% year on year from £153m to £80.5m as pandemic restrictions across the UK cost it 45% of trading days last year. The company, which on Friday announced that former footballer and TV pundit Rio Ferdinand was to join its board as a non-executive director, has opened talks with its lenders as the latest national lockdown stretches its finances. The company said that while its has “significant liquidity” with its £100m banking facility, it needed to extend the financial covenants. Net debt stood at £47m at the end of last year. “Given the ongoing impact from the latest lockdown and its implications for the operational reopening of our gyms, we have started discussions with our lending banks, who continue to be supportive, to review the future covenant tests relating to this facility,” the company said. The Gym Group said that as of the end of 2020 membership numbers had fallen by more than a quarter year on year, from 794,000 to 578,000. The company, which froze gym subscriptions during the national lockdown so members don’t pay while sites are closed, added that it had no students members remaining from its 2019 sign ups. The average monthly headline price for a membership was £18.81 in December. “2020 has been a challenging year for our business, our members and our colleagues,” said Richard Darwin, the chief executive. “Our cash management during the pandemic has ensured we ended 2020 with manageable levels of debt and significant liquidity. At a time when health and fitness has never been more important to the nation, we are ready to emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of the many opportunities available to us.” The company said the monthly cash burn during the current lockdown was running at £5m, lower than the £6m during the November lockdown due to the recent government grant support. Despite the pandemic the company recently opened its 184th site, and a total eight new venues last year and is progressing on three more. The group said the pandemic had also provided opportunities to snap up locations with cheap rentals as the pressure mounted on high street landlords. “The company continues to see an opportunity to access excellent new sites at attractive rents,” it said. “We are building a strong pipeline for 2021 and beyond, and we will continue to progress new leases during this current period of lockdown. We will determine the timing of the rollout programme once there is greater visibility about a reopening date for gyms.”",business
"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November, as a second national lockdown in England and tough restrictions across the rest of the UK hit growth. The Guardian has spoken to three company bosses about the pressure they and their employees are facing as the second wave of the pandemic threatens to tip the British economy into a double-dip recession. Business planning has become almost impossible for Ian Grundy, the founder of Urban Village Pubs, as the November lockdown and rapid changes to the government’s coronavirus restrictions have cost his business more than £1.5m in the past year alone. “As we got to autumn and the tier system raised its head, effectively life became quite difficult. Not least because the rules changed every week as the government spun the bottle and decided what restrictions came out that week. It’s just become impossible to plan,” said Grundy. The second English lockdown meant his latest venture, the Rookwood Village in Leytonstone, east London, opened for 72 days only in 2020, after his firm bought the derelict Victorian pub and invested thousands of pounds to reopen it in July for the first time since 2013. This was at least a little better than the first lockdown, just after Grundy bought it, when builders had just four hours on-site before it was boarded up again. With eight pubs dotted across London’s suburbs and the south of England, Urban Village started operating takeaways to help maintain its presence. The money has helped, but does not cover fixed costs, despite support from the furlough jobs scheme and government-backed loans. Grundy feels hospitality is being unfairly targeted by lockdowns and needs urgent state support to prevent pubs closing for good this year. “Rishi [Sunak] is saying: ‘Oh well I’ll make another announcement at budget in March,’ but you can’t run a business like that. We have no idea what we’re looking at and have possibly no income for the next three to five months. What we need now is the government to step up and enable us to plan for what happens.” The November lockdown was tough for the Regent hotel in Doncaster after a year when 38 weddings had to be moved or refunded and crowds were banned from the final days of the town’s St Leger horse racing festival. “No one is travelling, there are no salesmen on the road, and no one to visit, so everyone’s more or less on lockdown,” said the hotel’s owner, Simon Longworth. But unlike the spring of last year, when activity stopped entirely amid a rash of cancellations, the family firm started selling takeaway meals from its a la carte restaurant to help it survive. “We said we’re not going to let this beat us, we need to be on the front foot.” With fewer travellers during the pandemic, Longworth, whose family has run the business since 1935, has now converted 20 rooms into rental apartments to maintain a steadier flow of income. But although selling takeaways has helped, it barely makes up for the loss of the hotel’s usual trade in the run-up to Christmas. Far from the 200 usual restaurant covers on Christmas Day, the hotel sold 78 meals at a third of the price, delivered to homes across Doncaster. “Obviously we were looking forward to Christmas. And come the second lockdown, certainly in Doncaster we were hoping we’d get some kind of reprieve to allow us to open in December to keep us going. If we could’ve had a week or so of that, that would’ve been great. But it was not to be,” said Longworth. “It’s a balancing act of how many more lockdowns can we go through and walking away from a business that’s been in the family for 85 years?” Crow Wood health spa on the outskirts of Burnley has been losing £250,000 for every month it is forced to close by the government. With tough restrictions in place for longer in east Lancashire than most other places in the UK, the November lockdown only added to the challenge of staying afloat for Andy Brown, whose family has run the business for 20 years. “We were under tier 3 and London was in tier 1, everyone all carrying on going to the pub and restaurants, we were locked down. It’s been horrendous. The whole levelling up agenda is, I’m afraid, just not there at all,” he said. “We’ve lost about £7m in revenue. But it could be more – we’re not through it are we? We’ve still no indication of when we can open for business, when we might be able to open a bit, or at all.” With almost 300 employees, and not operating takeaways from its three restaurants, the only revenue source is football, when top-flight football teams stay at Crow Wood’s 78-bedroom hotel when they have fixtures against Premier League Burnley or Championship Blackburn or Preston. “Otherwise we’re dead; we’re shut,” said Brown. Brown, who has questioned Sunak on calls arranged for local business leaders by the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government needed to be clearer with its lockdown plans and provide more help for companies. “I’m not sure we can prepare for reopening yet to be honest, as we’ve been in this situation so many times over the last 10 months. You can’t trust anything Boris [Johnson] says.”",business
"When the UK first went into lockdown last spring the impact on the economy was swift and profound. National output dropped by almost a fifth in April. There was an echo of that decline in activity in the November figures for gross domestic product released by the Office for National Statistics but a relatively faint one. The 2.6% monthly contraction was bad – especially for consumer-facing businesses – but not nearly as bad as it might have been. Britain’s economy was 8.9% smaller in November than in the same month of 2019, but analysts were braced for an annual decline of more than 12%. Why was the drop smaller than expected? For a start, more of the economy remained open in November than it did during the first lockdown. Factories kept turning out goods, construction work was allowed, children continued to go to school. In addition, a couple of one-off factors supported activity. One was that the knife-edge state of trade negotiations between the UK and the EU encouraged firms to stockpile as insurance against a no-deal outcome. A second was that there was a delay between England’s lockdown being announced and the restrictions coming into force, which allowed people to do some early Christmas shopping or have a meal out. But as Paul Dales, the UK economist at Capital Economics has noted, the UK has built up some immunity to lockdowns. Firms have found ways of doing business despite the restrictions, such as providing click-and-collect services. Consumers don’t stop spending when the shops are shut: they simply shop online. The current lockdown will cause more damage to the economy than that in November because the restrictions are tougher and will be in place for longer. As Rishi Sunak noted, the news will get worse before it gets better, but the vaccination programme means the likelihood is that restrictions will be gradually eased from next month onwards. The expectation in the financial markets is that a solid recovery will be under way by the spring. In the meantime, there is the question of whether the UK will have a double-dip recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output. GDP will almost certainly contract in the current quarter, but the better than feared figures for November suggest growth might just have remained positive in the fourth quarter of 2020. According to Dales, GDP would need to fall by 1% in December for the economy to shrink in the fourth quarter as a whole. It is touch and go, but a double dip might just be avoided.",business
"Eurostar has said it is facing an existential threat, as business leaders pleaded with the government to step in and save the “vital link” with Europe. A 95% drop in passenger numbers has brought the cross-Channel train service to its knees, and the company reiterated on Sunday that while government loans had been extended to aviation, international high-speed rail had also been severely affected by the pandemic. “Without additional funding from government, there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar … the current situation is very serious,” it said in a statement. Business leaders, including Brian Bickell, chief executive of the London landlord Shaftesbury, have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urging them to save the service. Their letter repeated the warning that Eurostar could run out of funds to operate the service in and out of London St Pancras. The 28 executives said that, with the number of international tourists likely to remain low until at least the spring, the loss of the route would be a blow to the capital’s economy and the UK as a whole. Nearly four in every five passengers use the train to travel between London and Paris or Brussels. Eurostar was “not asking for special treatment” they said, but access to the same help as companies in similar positions had received, such as business rates relief and loans. “Safeguarding the future of this connection to the continent should be a symbol of both our desire to build back better and our new cooperative relationship with our European neighbours,” the letter continued, adding: “If this viable business is allowed to fall between the cracks of support – our recovery could be damaged.” Eurostar is majority-owned by the French state railway, SNCF, but is thought to have exhausted options for governmental assistance from Paris. The franchised UK train operators that have been bailed out under emergency agreements since the coronavirus pandemic began – at a cost of £8bn this financial year – are also largely owned or co-owned by foreign state rail operators. In 2019, Eurostar carried 11 million passengers and was preparing to expand services with the introduction of direct trains to Amsterdam. It employs 1,200 people in the UK, with a further 1,500 jobs supported by its supply chain.",business
"January is a month when Britons turn to salads after the Christmas blowout. But now, on top of the disruption caused by Brexit and Covid, even the weather is conspiring against dieters by causing shortages in UK supermarkets. The supply of salad staples such as lettuce and tomatoes has been hit by Storm Filomena, the worst snowstorm to hit Spain in 50 years. It blanketed Madrid and the surrounding area and sent temperatures plummeting to record lows in Almería and Granada, two important vegetable growing regions. The bad weather has piled extra pressure on UK food retailers and suppliers at a time when they are navigating complex new post-Brexit border controls as well as coronavirus restrictions. Tesco has reported some Brexit-related “teething problems” at the main Channel crossing, through which a tenth of the food consumed in the UK is transported. However, a shortage of some salad lines in its stores is down to the recent bad weather in Spain. In January, with British produce out of season, 90% of the lettuce we eat is imported. That figure is even higher – 95% – for tomatoes and soft fruit, with Spain the primary European producer. Four years ago, the UK was gripped by a “courgette crisis” after Spanish farmers in Murcia and Valencia were badly affected by flooding, frost and snow. The disruption, which also affected tomato, lettuce and aubergine crops, resulted in soaring prices. “When it’s cold the crop effectively stops growing, so you are seeing smaller crops across Spain,” one major supermarket supplier told the Guardian. “It is a difficult time of year anyway, and then you have got to layer on Covid and Brexit.” The situation is exacerbated by the closure of restaurants and cafes, which means a record amount of food is being funnelled through supermarkets. “Demand is up again for supermarket fresh produce because food service, which has a different supply chain, is closed,” the supplier said. “So we are trying to meet increased demand against a backdrop of supply chain challenges.” Fepex, Spain’s fresh produce export association, said the cold weather would reduce crop yields in Almería and Granada, meaning lower volumes of tomatoes, cucumbers, courgettes, eggplant and peppers. January is one of the important months of the year, when Spanish farmers export between 1.2m and 1.3m tonnes of fruit and vegetables. The intense cold could have caused irreparable damage, Fepex said in update on its website. “In the field, farmers do not have enough kilos to collect, and not enough product enters the warehouses to supply all orders.” A fall in production usually pushes up prices but there may not be enough supply to satisfy even existing commercial agreements. However, growers in other Spanish regions have fared better, said Luke King, the commercial director at organic vegetable box company Riverford, which sources from farmers in Murcia and Andalusia.  “Don’t get me wrong, the weather has been horrible, it’s been cold, it’s been wet … which is not good growing conditions and logistics can get compromised but we’ve not had any issues.”",business
"Rishi Sunak is coming under renewed pressure to provide more financial support to businesses across the UK, as official figures confirmed the UK is heading for a double-dip recession. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the chancellor needed to launch a new package of cash grants, and extend and expand a range of tax cuts to help businesses struggling to stay afloat while tougher coronavirus restrictions were in place. Calling for immediate action, the business lobby group said firms could not afford to wait until the budget on 3 March, which Sunak has indicated will be the next date when he refreshes the government’s pandemic response. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday showed the UK economy contracted again in November, when Boris Johnson staged a last-minute decision to impose a second English lockdown to contain rapid growth in Covid infections. The economy shrank by 2.6% in November compared with October, ending six successive months of growth in the summer as rising infections and tougher restrictions across the UK pushed the economy into a double-dip recession. Economists had forecast a bigger fall in GDP of 5.7% in November. GDP fell by 19% in the second quarter during the first national lockdown – the biggest decline in history. The impact this time is expected to be felt most by the embattled hospitality sector. Pubs, restaurants and cafes were forced to close or operate as takeaway-only during the second lockdown in England, while more non-essential shops remained open than during the first, and manufacturing and construction activity continued. Britain’s biggest pub and restaurant groups recorded a 72.6% drop in sales over the pivotal Christmas period, according to figures published on Friday by the Coffer Peach business tracker, in what should have been the sector’s most profitable time of year. Trading figures for the five weeks to 3 January showed drink-led pubs and bars were worst hit, with total sales down by more than 80% on the same period a year ago. London, which had been largely open at the beginning of December, fared slightly better than the rest of the country as tougher restrictions were in place in the north of England under the tiering system. However, sales in the capital were still down 66.8% on a year ago, compared with a 73.9% decline outside the M25. Paul Newman, the head of leisure and hospitality at the accountancy firm RSM, which produces the tracker alongside the data provider CGA and Coffer Group, a leisure industry specialist, urged the chancellor to step in quickly. “Urgent clarity on substantial, additional government support is needed now as the 3 March budget may simply be too late. The chancellor’s latest grant package does not go far enough, barely touching the fixed monthly site costs that businesses face,” Newman said. Tighter since Christmas restrictions are expected to trigger an even bigger drop in economic output in January, as stay-at-home orders and school closures further weight on growth. The interventions come after Sunak announced £4.6bn in new grants for firms in the hardest-hit sectors of the economy last week. The furlough scheme – which has been used to subsidise the wages of more than 9m jobs at more than 1m companies since its launch, at a cost of more than £46bn so far – has also been extended until the end of April. However, business leaders said companies needed a further year of business rates relief and an extension of the 5% reduced VAT rate for hospitality firms owing to the cumulative hit from multiple lockdowns. Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said government support schemes had saved many firms and jobs, but they had not gone far enough to help many survive a tough start to 2021. “The drip-feed approach to business support measures has meant many firms simply cannot plan for the future,” he said. “We are urging the government to urgently adopt a package of measures that covers the whole of 2021, and that takes away the cliff-edges firms face in a few weeks’ time when reliefs, forbearance and furlough are set to end. Many companies simply can’t wait until the March budget. Action is needed now.” A Treasury spokesperson said more than £280bn had been spent by government to support jobs and businesses during the pandemic, adding: “As the chancellor set out this week, the budget is the most appropriate interval to consider what further interventions may be necessary, given these schemes now extend through to the spring.”",business
"Norwegian has announced it will no longer fly long-haul routes, even after the pandemic, bringing an end to its low-cost, long-haul vision and spelling the loss of about 1,100 jobs based at Gatwick airport. The airline said it would retrench to a short-haul European network and domestic Norwegian routes for good, as it outlined its business plan for survival. About 2,150 jobs in the UK, Spain, France and the US will go, and one union warned that the airline industry was in an employment “death spiral”.  The airline’s 1,100 UK flight crew and pilots had been furloughed since the start of the Covid-19 crisis. About 400 other UK crew who worked on short-haul routes were made redundant last year. The airline is going through bankruptcy protection proceedings in Ireland that will allow it to restructure and continue operations by demonstrating a viable business plan to judges there. Norwegian will no longer retain any of its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners that it used to fly long-haul, and will reduce its overall fleet to 50 narrow-body planes. It was once the third-biggest airline at Gatwick and pioneered low-cost transatlantic flights, but its ambitious expansion put it in financial peril even before Covid-19 hit. The airline’s plan focuses on saving Norwegian jobs and it is understood to be in renewed dialogue with Norway’s government about potential state support, two months after ministers said they could not invest more taxpayers’ money in propping up the airline. Jacob Schram, the airline’s chief executive, said: “Our short-haul network has always been the backbone of Norwegian and will form the basis of a future resilient business model. By focusing our operation on a short-haul network, we aim to attract existing and new investors, serve our customers and support the wider infrastructure and travel industry in Norway and across the Nordics and Europe.” The pilots’ union Balpa said Norwegian’s announcement was further devastating news for UK airline staff, with about 300 pilots among the 1,100 Gatwick job losses. Brian Strutton, Balpa’s general secretary, said: “The airline has failed for several reasons but there can be no blame apportioned to the pilot, crew or other staff groups.” He said it was further evidence of the “jobs death spiral”, adding that “aviation remains in serious crisis”. The Unite union, which represents crew, said airline workers had not been consulted about the job losses and were owed outstanding wages and redundancy pay, and should be the first priority during the insolvency process of Norwegian’s UK arm. Under Norwegian’s complex company structure, only its subsidiaries employing the crew have gone into liquidation, allowing its Gatwick-based airline, Norwegian UK, to survive on paper and one day potentially return to the air. However, it is extremely unlikely to spread its wings quite so far again. Schram said: “Our focus is to rebuild a strong, profitable Norwegian so that we can safeguard as many jobs as possible. We do not expect customer demand in the long-haul sector to recover in the near future.”",business
"Tesco has hailed a “record” Christmas on the back of booming online sales and customers treating themselves to its luxury Christmas food ranges. The UK’s biggest supermarket said sales at stores open one year were up 8.1% over the key six-week Christmas trading period. That was a step up from growth of 6.7% over the three months to 28 November. Ken Murphy, the Tesco chief executive, described the performance over the six weeks to 9 January as “market-leading”, adding: “We delivered a record Christmas across all of our formats and channels.” The “unprecedented demand for online groceries” meant the company delivered more than 7m orders containing 400m-plus items over Christmas. Murphy also revealed there were some gaps on in its shelves in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as the supermarket chain grappled with new post-Brexit border controls. The problem was focused on products, such as ready meals and processed meats, which have a short shelf life, as well as citrus fruits. Tesco has hired a veterinary agency to certify products before they cross the border. “We are working with government on both sides of the Irish Sea to smooth the flow of products and I would say that our availability in both markets remains strong,” Murphy said. “The disruption is limited to certain categories, with a particular emphasis on some short shelf-life products where every hour, let alone every day counts.” The company was also experiencing “teething problems” at the main Channel crossing, where about a tenth of the food consumed in the UK is transported. “Inevitably there are the bedding issues that you would expect with any new process that’s been set up as a relatively short notice,” said Murphy. “We’re working our way through and we would hope over the coming weeks and months that we will end up with a much smoother flow of product. “I want to reassure the public that we are coping with this and availability in Northern Ireland, the Republic and mainland UK remains very strong. We see this as a challenge that needs to be overcome and resolved … but we don’t see it as a crisis.” Last week Marks & Spencer complained about new “rules of origin” regulations, which dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. However, Tesco said the issue was minimal for its business. With more shoppers turning to the web to buy groceries, the retailer said online sales had increased by more than 80% over the 19 weeks. That equates to nearly £1bn in extra sales. The retailer also highlighted that sales in its largest stores also grew strongly as customers favoured larger, less frequent shopping trips. Sales of its Finest range were up 14% over Christmas while demand for plant-based products also increased strongly, with sales of its Plant Chef range up more than 90%. General merchandise sales were also up 4% driven by a strong performance in toys, home and electrical items. Tesco, which is the UK’s largest private sector employer, said about 10%, or 30,000, of its staff were off or shielding as a result of coronavirus, three-fifths the number in the initial months of the pandemic. The retailer is introducing rapid testing in its distribution centres and Murphy urged the government to prioritise vaccinating food industry workers after the vulnerable groups had been done. The company said extra costs linked to the pandemic would be £810m in the current financial year, up almost £100m from a previous estimate. Its annual profits forecast remained unchanged despite the strong Christmas performance. Sales at its wholesale arm Booker, which Tesco bought for £3.7bn in 2017, have been dented by the closure of hospitality businesses. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco had done well but had not “shot the lights out”. The sales growth was, he said, “a little behind our expectations. Whereas Sainsbury’s has been boosted by Argos, Tesco has witnessed greater headwinds than we anticipated from Booker in the UK, where lockdowns have been weighing heavily upon the catering side of the business.” Tesco’s shares closed at 241.4p, remaining flat compared to the previous day’s traiding.",business
"National Express is to suspend its entire network of coach services across the UK from Monday due to the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions. The company, a major provider of timetabled coach routes, said it would be halting all services until March. Chris Hardy, the managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.” All journeys until Sunday night will run as planned to ensure that no passengers making essential journeys are stranded, National Express said, while customers whose travel has been cancelled will be contacted for free rebooking or full refunds. Hardy said there was a provisional restart date of 1 March in place but warned that could change: “As the vaccination programme is rolled out and government guidance changes, we will regularly review when we can restart services. “We will now make sure we are ready to get back behind the wheel as soon as the nation needs us again.” National Express suspended its coach operations for almost three months from April 2020 in the first lockdown. While local bus operations have been underwritten by a government bailout, which is giving operators assistance equivalent to lost revenue, intercity coach services have not had similar financial guarantees. Since the start of the pandemic National Express has launched a division called Transport Solutions to use its brand and coaches in the vastly changed market. The withdrawal of coach services comes as the Department for Transport and train operators consider which rail services will be withdrawn, with around 50% of the timetable likely to be suspended during the lockdown.",business
"Savers who have lost track of pension and investment funds will have their money used for charitable causes that could aid Covid recovery efforts under government plans to expand its dormant asset scheme beyond bank accounts. The Reclaim Fund was established in 2011 to distribute the cash from bank and building society accounts that were left unclaimed for at least 15 years. It came after banks were accused of bolstering their balance sheets by sitting on dormant savings. It has already helped with Covid recovery efforts, having released £150m from the fund to help charities, social enterprises and vulnerable individuals during the outbreak in May. About 30 banks and building societies take part in the scheme, but the new programme will open to City firms across the insurance, pensions, investment and wealth management sectors after the government puts forward legislation to expand it. Each sector will have their own guidelines determining when assets should be shifted to the Reclaim Fund. Firms are expected to make reasonable efforts to track down customers and reunite them with their accounts before transferring them to the Reclaim Fund, which has so far distributed £745m to charitable causes.  However, only a small proportion of deposits are ever recovered by their rightful owners after they are transferred, at a rate of just 5% a year. In total, customers have only reclaimed £93m since the fund was established, which is less than 7% of the £1.35bn collected over the same period and lower than the £147m transferred in 2019 alone. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (took the decision after a four-year review concluded there was widespread support for the scheme’s extension. It said customers would still be able to apply to reclaim their assets in full at any time, and said the expanded scheme “will have consumer protection at its heart, with the priority continuing to be locating and reuniting people with their financial assets”. The voluntary scheme has run into controversy. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that HSBC had been warned by its own compliance staff in 2017 that it was not doing enough to reunite customers with their cash before freezing their accounts, and was potentially harming elderly and vulnerable savers who may have lost track of their savings. HSBC denied it had mistreated customers, or that it took insufficient action, and said it had made “substantial and continuous improvements” to its dormant account policy since 2016.",business
"Hyundai’s value surged by $9bn (£6.6bn) on Friday after reports that it could join with Apple in developing a driverless electric vehicle – despite confusion as it backtracked on a statement acknowledging “early discussion” with the iPhone manufacturer. Investors sent the South Korean carmaker’s share price on the Seoul exchange up almost 20%, as local media reported a possible tie-up on electric cars and batteries with Apple, which has been developing its own vehicle technology. Reports on South Korea’s Economic Daily claimed the two firms were in talks. Hyundai originally issued a statement saying: “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided.” A subsequent statement to the stock exchange from Hyundai omitted any reference to Apple, merely saying there were “requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies”. Last month it was reported that Apple was hoping to launch a self-driving personal vehicle by 2024, which, a source told Reuters, could represent an evolution in electric car battery technology in the way the iPhone evolved mobile phones. It was suggested that Apple could look for a traditional manufacturing partner to help make the car. Apple did not comment on the Hyundai statement. The scramble to invest in Hyundai comes after a year in which the share price of the market leader in electric vehicles, Tesla, has rocketed – to the extent that chief executive and major shareholder Elon Musk this week overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest man. An Apple vehicle would have the design cachet to compete with the California company, which shipped almost 500,000 vehicles last year and has pushed the boundaries of autonomous driving as well as electric car technology. Hyundai has been keen to burnish its credentials, last month announcing it would develop in-house its own electric car platform and battery systems, expecting to extend the range of a single charge to 500km. It has also had an eye on more futuristic technologies, establishing a self-driving joint venture, Motional, with car component supplier Aptiv and ploughing $2bn into the new firm. Motional has announced plans with ride-hailing firm Lyft to launch robotaxis in the US from 2023. An investor in robotics firms, Hyundai in 2019 unveiled a concept “walking” robocar for tougher terrain. Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about its product development plans but it has been reported to have been working on Project Titan, its electric and autonomous car vision, since 2014.",business
"Ryanair expects to lose 95% of its traffic in February and March, with few if any flights operating from the UK and Ireland, because of the latest Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions. The Dublin-based airline, which normally carries the most passengers in Europe, lambasted “brutal lockdowns” and called on the Irish government in particular to accelerate vaccinations. Ireland has banned incoming travel from Britain until Friday, and from Saturday is expected to require all international arrivals to provide a negative Covid-19 test from within the previous 72 hours to enter the country. The UK is considering a similar testing measure. Ryanair said it was again cutting its full-year traffic forecast by a further 5 million passengers to between 26 million and 30 million, at best below 20% of 2019 levels. It expects to fly fewer than 1.25 million passengers in January and 500,000 in February and March, when it would usuallyfly approximately 10 million a month. It said it would significantly cut flight schedules from 21 January so there would be few, if any, flights to or from Ireland or the UK “until such time as these draconian travel restrictions are removed”. The carrier warned last week it would post its first annual loss since 2009, when the financial crisis struck. It said the cancellations would not further affect its results as the flights would have been largely loss-making. Ryanair urged the Irish and UK governments to accelerate vaccination programmes, contrasting in particular Ireland’s current vaccination rate with other countries. An airline spokesperson said: “The WHO have previously confirmed that governments should do everything possible to avoid brutal lockdowns. Ireland’s Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the north of Ireland.” The World Health Organization’s guidance in fact states that lockdowns can slow Covid‑19 transmission and while it warns that “such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees”, it says it recognises that “some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures: and is “hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed”. Ryanair added: “The fact that the Danish government, with a similar 5 million population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than Ireland shows that emergency action is needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland.” The Irish airline has been advertising flights while highlighting the availability of vaccines, calling on customers to “jab and go” – a campaign that drew more than 1,600 complaints, according to the Advertising Standards Authority, which is investigating. Ryanair said all customers affected by further flight cancellations and restrictions would be emailed on Thursday to advise them of free rebooking or refunds. It has previously not offered to refund passengers when flights operated, regardless of lockdown rules. EasyJet, which carried most UK passengers pre-Covid, said on Monday it would be reviewing its schedules and probably operating only domestic and limited international flights while lockdown lasts. Meanwhile, the Hungarian airline Wizz Air said it was cancelling flights as a result of the latest lockdown. Capacity in January is expected to fall to 25% of 2020 levels from the 35% level it flew in December.",business
"Percy Pig has emerged as one of the first casualties of Brexit red tape, with Marks & Spencer warning that its famous pink sweets could be hit with new import taxes in Ireland. The sweets are among the more than 2,000 products sold in M&S food halls that are affected by the “rules of origin” regulations set out in the trade deal struck with the EU. The rules dictate whether import taxes, called tariffs, must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. Steve Rowe, the chief executive of M&S, gave the example of its bestselling Percy Pig sweets, which are manufactured in Germany and brought to the UK before being re-exported to Ireland – a journey that would now be subject to import taxes. “About a third of the products in our food business are subject to complex rules of origin around componentry and how much has been altered in the UK,” Rowe said. “Depending on that, there is a variable rate of tariff on goods. Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print.” The UK’s free trade agreement has spared Marks & Spencer’s domestic business from tariffs but would “significantly impact” the retailer in Ireland, where it has 18 stores, as well as in the Czech Republic and France. The “scope and complexity” of the new rules meant many retailers would have to “find an expensive workaround”, Rowe said. The rules of origin do not affect products sold in its stores over the border in Northern Ireland. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said at least 50 of its members were facing potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU. William Bain, the BRC’s trade policy adviser, said it was trying to come up with short-term options and “seeking dialogue with the government and the EU on longer-term solutions to mitigate the effects of new tariffs”. He added: “We need a solution which genuinely reflects the needs of UK-EU supply and distribution chains for goods.” ",business
"Thousands of British Gas engineers and call centre workers will down tools from Thursday as part of a national five-day strike in response to the energy giant’s “fire and rehire” plans. The GMB trade union called the strike after 89% of its 9,000 British Gas members voted in favour of industrial action following the breakdown of talks with executives at Britain’s biggest energy supplier last year. The union expects the majority of the 7,000 engineers and 2,000 call centre workers who are part of its membership to take part, but will limit picketing due to coronavirus restrictions.  The strike marks the end of months of tense negotiations between union representatives and energy company executives over plans to reduce the workforce and shift employees on to new contracts. The union has accused Centrica, the embattled owner of British Gas, of “bullying” its 20,000 employees to accept worse employment contracts or lose their jobs as part of a so-called “fire and rehire” plan. The FTSE-listed company, which has lost more than three-quarters of its market value in the last five years, said it has asked all employees to sign up to new employment contracts to help simplify the business. A similar approach was proposed by British Airways last year, alongside staff cuts, but the airline dropped the controversial plans after negotiations with trade unions. Justin Bowden, GMB’s national secretary, said: “British Gas boss Chris O’Shea’s attempts to bully workers into accepting cuts to their pay and terms and conditions has provoked this inevitable outcome – massive disruption to customers in the depths of winter and a stain on the reputation of an historic company and brand.” About 7,000 frontline office workers represented by the Unison trade union accepted the energy company’s new terms last month, and 4,000 non-unionised staff also agreed to sign new contracts. A spokeswoman for Centrica said: “We’ve done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action.  “Whilst we’ve made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown.” The company said it has “strong contingency plans in place” and will “prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies”. British Gas has lost about 1 million customers in recent years due to fierce competition in the energy market from a string of cut-price energy supply startups.  As a result, Centrica reported a £1bn loss for 2019 before scrapping its shareholder dividend and warning investors there would be a steep slump in revenues in 2020.",business
"Flatowners who have struggled to sell their homes because of fire safety risks, despite not having any cladding on their building, could soon be able to find buyers after surveyors proposed changes to how the properties are valued. Following the Grenfell fire tragedy banks and building societies have taken extra steps to ensure buildings have passed fire safety checks before offering mortgages on homes within them. Since December 2019, surveyors working for lenders have relied on proof of an inspection by an expert outlined in an ESW1 form to show that a building does not have any dangerous cladding and will not need expensive works to put right. However, some homeowners have been asked for a form when selling or remortgaging flats where there is no cladding in place, and found that their properties are effectively worthless without one. Last year, the government said 450,000 flatowners had been “stuck in limbo” in properties with no cladding which might be deemed unmortgageable and lifted its requirement for checks on these buildings. Now a consultation from the surveyors’ group Rics has proposed new guidelines for its members to decide whether an EWS1 form is needed. For buildings below four storeys it says it is unlikely that an EWS1 is needed if there is no aluminium or metal composite (ACM or MCM) cladding in place. On higher buildings, it has outlined rules on balconies, and when other kinds of cladding should prompt an inspection. Ben Elder, head of valuation standards at Rics, said government advice and lending criteria had changed since the form was introduced. “EWS1 was never intended to hold up the market, indeed without it, no one would be moving,” he added. The National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents housing associations that own some of the buildings in question, said the proposals were encouraging. Victoria Moffett, head of building and fire safety programmes at the NHF, said: “This situation is now critical, with many leaseholders, also affected by the pandemic, at serious risk of losing their homes or becoming bankrupt because they cannot remortgage or sell.” However, she said upfront funding for safety work was needed from the government. “This is the only way to satisfy lenders that leaseholders will not face large bills for potential safety work in the future, and ultimately allow people to sell and remortgages.” The consultation will close on 25 January 2021, with the new guidance given to surveyors in the spring.",business
"Boeing has been fined $2.5bn by the US justice department after being charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection with two fatal crashes of its 737 Max airliner. Boeing’s employees chose “the path of profit over candor by concealing material information” from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US’s top airline regulator, David Burns, the acting assistant attorney general of the justice department’s criminal division, wrote in a release. Burns said the company had also engaged “in an effort to cover up their deception”. The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. A March 2020 congressional investigation concluded that Boeing promoted a “culture of concealment” and was “grossly inefficient” in its oversight of the Max’s development. At a heated congressional hearing in October 2019, Senator Richard Blumenthal accused Boeing of selling “flying coffins” as a result of its decision to conceal issues with the planes from pilots. “The tragic crashes of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world’s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,” said Burns. Boeing admitted that two of its technical pilots deceived regulators about the safety of the Max’s MCAS stall prevention software, implicated in both of the fatal crashes. In both cases, the planes crashed shortly after takeoff when their pilots were unable to regain control of the planes after they went into a nosedive. The settlement includes $2.2bn in compensation to the families of the people killed in the two Max crashes and a $243m fine. In a statement, Boeing once more blamed its former employees. The “agreement is based on the conduct of two former Boeing employees and their intentional failure to inform the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group (AEG), the group within the FAA responsible for making pilot training determinations, about changes to the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS)”, the company said. David Calhoun, Boeing’s president and chief executive officer, said: “I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do – a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations. “This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations.” Boeing has now addressed concerns about the Max and the plane returned to service in the US in December. Lawyers for the families lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash dismissed the settlement and said they would continue their litigation against Boeing. “The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing’s wrongdoing – a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court. This agreement, including the ‘crash-victim beneficiaries fund’, has no bearing on the pending civil litigation against Boeing, which we plan to prosecute fully to ensure the families receive the justice they deserve,” Clifford Law Offices said in a statement. They said the 737 Max should not have been returned to service “until all of the airplane’s deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews – which to date still has not occurred”.",business
"What is $900m to a Wall Street giant like Goldman Sachs? Relatively little, when it counts the drop in profits for a year of record-setting market swings and economic turmoil, all sparked by a pandemic. The firm should regard itself as lucky to be poised for profits of about $7bn (£5bn) for the whole of 2020. That average analyst forecast, compiled by Refinitiv, is a mere 11% drop from the $7.9bn it made in 2019, a year when the phrase “Covid lockdown” had never been uttered. The projected decline is smaller than the $2.8bn it put aside to cover a potential jump in defaults within the first nine months of the year alone, a number estimates suggest could rise to $3.1bn for the 12 months to December. Those provisions pale in comparison with those of European peers such as HSBC, which already put by $7.6bn to cover Covid-linked loan losses by the third quarter. The bank’s results will emerge unscathed from the $2.9bn settlement it reached in October with global regulators and the US Department of Justice, over its alleged role in the 1MDB corruption scandal. The announcement came just months after Goldman agreed to pay $3.9bn to the Malaysian government, amid claims it allegedly turned a blind eye while $4.5bn was looted from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Goldman bosses, including chairman and chief executive David Solomon, will feel the pinch of a $31m cut to their combined 2020 pay over the scandal, but hefty provisions previously put aside for the 1MDB case will largely cover the settlements. All this means Goldman’s full-year earnings – released on Tuesday – will make headlines for less scandalous reasons. For one, its fledgling consumer bank, Marcus, has made further headway as customers lucky enough to keep their jobs or benefit from government Covid support programmes spent less and saved more during lockdowns. Marcus savings accounts were in such high demand in the UK – thanks to a pocket of cash-rich and interest-hungry savers – that in July it was forced to close to new British accounts to avoid breaching regulatory limits. But the 150-year-old lender’s bread-and-butter services will have proved its saving grace in 2020. The asset management business, fixed income division, and investment bank – which earns fees for advising clients on deals and corporate fundraising – produced a near doubling of third-quarter profit to $3.6bn. Those divisions have benefited from a recovery in merger and acquisition activity, which stalled at the start of the pandemic, and from US stock markets hitting fresh record highs in the latter half of 2020. It has given Credit Suisse a reason to be bullish on Goldman’s earnings, with that bank’s own analysts recently upgrading profit forecasts to $7.4bn. If JP Morgan’s results last Friday are any indication, the market rebound could also help Goldman beat forecasts. Its Wall Street rival reported a 42% jump in profits to $12.1bn for the fourth quarter, leaving full-year profits down 20% at $29bn. A strong performance could raise pay for Goldman traders, who are reportedly set to see 2020 bonuses rise 20% compared with 2019.",business
"The British footwear brand Dr Martens is planning a £3bn flotation, more than 60 years after its first pair of boots were stitched together in Northamptonshire. Best known for its 1460 boot featuring its trademark yellow stitching and chunky soles, the company expects to float at least 25% of the business on the London stock market. It comes nearly seven years after Dr Martens was bought for £300m by the private equity group Permira. Sales under its ownership have surged, rising from £160m in 2013 to £672m in the year to March 2020. Sources close to the plans said the shoe company expects to seek a valuation of about £3bn. The brand, which sells 11m pairs of shoes and boots a year across more than 60 countries, managed to grow throughout the pandemic, despite lockdowns that forced its 130 high street stores to close. Dr Martens reported an 18% rise in sales to £318m in the six months to September, while profits grew by a third to £86.3m. The majority of sales come from the wholesale business, which sells to third-party retailers. The first pair of Dr Martens made in the UK was in 1960 at its original factory in Northamptonshire, where one of its two main offices is still based. The boots grew in popularity over the following decades, first adopted by skinheads in the 1960s, and later becoming fashion staples among punks, goths and schoolgirls. However, Russ Mould, the investment director at broker AJ Bell, said there were some “red flags”, including consumer complaints over the quality of Dr Martens footwear. “Could it be that the business has suffered under private equity ownership? Many investors are sceptical about backing companies that are being sold by private equity, for fear they might have suffered from underinvestment and subjected to a ‘quantity over quality’ approach for production,” Mould said. However, some critics have said the alleged deterioration came after it shifted the bulk of its production from the UK to Asia nearly 20 years ago, he said. Dr Martens said it rejected allegations of declining standards, and said Permira had continued to invest in the business since its takeover. The footwear firm also said on Monday it had diversified its supply chain, and reduced the proportion of shoes made in China from 46% to 32% between 2019 and 2020, but did not link the changes to quality concerns. Mould said Dr Martens’ IPO was coming at an interesting time for UK markets, hot on the heels of a Brexit deal and the best-ever start to a calendar year for the FTSE 100. “If ever there was a good time to market a well-known British name to investors, it is now,” he said.",business
"A surge in online shopping helped to push up the Post Office’s income over Christmas, as web-based retailers escaped the Covid-19 restrictions that bedevilled the high street. In the four weeks to 27 December, the Post Office recorded 51.3m customer transactions, just 0.5% below the same period of 2019, with sales up 17% to £66.3m. Mail and parcel services increased “significantly”, boosted by the soaring growth of Drop & Go, the Post Office’s fast-track service for businesses and online sellers, which boosted sales by 87%. Cash and banking services declined only slightly, down 10%, despite the restrictions affecting thousands of small businesses that bank at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches, the largest retail network in the UK. The biggest negative impact of Covid restrictions was on travel money transactions, where like-for-like sales dropped by 69%, as holidays were rendered near-impossible for most of the period. The Post Office’s chief executive, Nick Read, hailed the contribution of postmasters, the people who run individual branches. The company was forced to apologise last year after a landmark legal case ruled it had wrongly accused dozens of postmasters of criminal activity, resulting in multiple convictions. “After a very challenging year for much of the retail sector, I am pleased to see 17% growth in network income over the Christmas period thanks to the hard work of postmasters,” said Read. “Our physical presence has been vital across the UK, with customers enjoying the convenience, expert advice and safe hands that our postmasters offer, in addition to the invaluable support they have provided to local communities during the pandemic, with 99% of the network remaining open.” Variable income for postmasters rose 20% during the year. Despite milder-than-usual weather over the four weeks to 27 December, income from bill payment was up after the Post Office won a contract with British Gas to process top-ups.",business
"For the past year Britons have been told to stay home and save lives but while tabletop gamers have been stuck at home they have been busy fighting bloodthirsty wars from the safety of their bedroom or garden shed. Sales at Games Workshop, which sells fantasy miniatures and toy soldiers, soared by a quarter at the end of last year as fans escaped the grim reality of 2020 by losing themselves in its games, including its bestselling space fantasy game Warhammer 40,000 – or 40K as it is usually known. Given the human misery created by the pandemic the appeal of “the grim darkness of the 41st millennium” where “there is only war” can be hard to see. But Warhammer counts its fans in millions. Its Warhammer community webpage has 4.7 million users, its YouTube page has 400,000 followers and there are 280,000 on Instagram. Nonetheless Kevin Rountree, Games Workshop’s chief executive, said there had been a “step change” in demand over recent months for the figures and weaponry players used to build their armies. The company sold nearly £187m of games, figurines and paints in the six months to the end of November, up £38m on the year before, and profits were up more than 50% to £92m. Rountree described it as a “cracking performance”. The devotion felt by Games Workshop’s fanbase is likened to the cult following enjoyed by the likes of Lego, which has also enjoyed a sales boost as children and adults look for ways to entertain themselves at home during lockdowns. Games Workshop, however, is seen to attract an older, more male following. Its figures cost anywhere between £10 and £100-plus, while tiny pots of paint, with names such as “plaguebearer flesh”, start at about £3. Over the past five years the Nottingham-based company has become a stock market sensation as investors woke up to the might of the Warhammer games franchise. Five years ago the shares were worth about £5, but today they change hands for more than £100 as the growing army of hobbyists pick up their paintbrushes. The company is now valued at £3.6bn – or £1bn more than Marks & Spencer. Games Workshop shuns publicity but on its website 50-year-old Rountree, who has worked for with the company for more than 20 years, says its mission is simple: “We make the best fantasy miniatures in the world and sell them globally at a profit. We intend to do this forever.” The company was started more than 40 years ago by three school friends: John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. The gaming fanatics shared a flat in west London where they started out selling handmade, classic wooden games before going on to open stores. After a management buyout in the 1990s the company listed on the stock exchange in 1994. The business is also clear, that despite running 529 stores, it is first and foremost a manufacturer. The shops, it says, are a recruiting ground for people with “our particular hobby gene”. Its factory in Lenton, Nottingham, pumps out tens of million of miniatures a year with the stores, which are often run by a single employee, used to show customers “how to engage with our hobby of collecting, painting and playing with our miniatures and games”. Games Workshop’s success during the pandemic, despite the turmoil caused by on-and-off store closures, has seen it repay the taxpayer support extended in the early days of the crisis. With its shops closed for long periods the company’s online sales were up 87%. “People have a lot more time on their hands and these models take a lot to time to do well,” says GlobalData retail analyst Zoe Mills, who points to high levels of engagement on Warhammer’s social media channels where fans share pictures of their painted miniatures. “In many ways Games Workshop is unique; there isn’t really another brand out there that offers the same sort of experience.” The huge lifestyle changes brought about by the pandemic have seen lots of Britons take up new and old hobbies, from baking to crafting to learning a language. “Warhammer is ultimately just another sort of hobby, although some people might see it as a more serious thing than that,” said Mills. “People are spending more time away from their phones and because are we not going into offices some people have got some extra time in the evenings that they don’t necessarily want to spend in front of the television.” With the nation on lockdown for much of the last year the games sector received a pandemic boost as bored Britain stumped up a record £4bn-plus to keep entertained. The amount spent on digital gaming, from casual mobile phone gamers to hardcore players, hit £3.6bn last year. More than the amount spent by the record number of subscribers to services such as Netflix and Amazon, and triple the size of the UK music streaming market. Many gamers had also been conserving their cash for the arrival of new consoles from Sony and Xbox, which launched late last year and helped the spend on physical video games surge to £600m. By far and away the biggest selling game of last year was FIFA 21, at 2.2m copies, well ahead of second-placed Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which sold at 1.4m, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. The other titles in the top five were by Grand Theft Auto V, Fifa 20 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Beyond the predominantly male-skewed list of the biggest titles there was also big demand for family fare, with cutesy Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players become animal villagers to make an island paradise, proving a surprise hit. It ended the year as the UK’s sixth biggest-selling game. Sales of board games and jigsaw puzzles have also soared as traditional pursuits made a comeback to while away hours stuck at home. Early in the pandemic, the best-selling game was Monopoly Classic with Cluedo, Scrabble and card games UNO and Dobble also in the top 10, according to market research firm NPD.",business
"The UK economy is facing its “darkest hour” due the latest Covid-19 lockdown, which is likely to delay the recovery, the Bank of England governor has warned. In comments on Tuesday that echoed warnings from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak a day earlier that the economy “is going to get worse before it gets better”, Bailey said the UK would bounce back, but only after the lockdown had ended and concerns about the spread of the virus had receded. Referencing Winston Churchill’s use of the phrase in 1940 following the evacuation of Dunkirk, he said: “There’s an old saying about the darkest hour is the one before dawn.” He added: “[We’re] in a very difficult period at the moment and there’s no question that it’s going to delay, probably, the trajectory.” In an online speech to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce he said the shape of the recovery, while delayed, would broadly follow the forecast made by the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) last November. Bailey said the unemployment rate, which he previously expected to peak at about 7%-8% in the summer, would now be lower after the government extended its job protection scheme and other measures to safeguard household incomes. However, the rate remained likely to rise above the 4.9% that official figures estimate for the three months to October. Amid concerns that the UK will suffer a double dip recession after expected falls in GDP during the last quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, Bailey said the figure was already higher despite the extra measures that Sunak has announced, including a further £4.5bn last week for the hospitality sector. “Our best guess nationwide is probably it’s around 6.5%,” Bailey said. The MPC meets early next month to discuss how the central bank can help to protect the economy during the lockdown, including whether interest rates should be cut to below zero – a move that could ease borrowing costs on households and businesses. Bailey said he was sceptical that a cut from the current all-time low of 0.1%would be painless, arguing it could make the situation worse. He said there were “lots of issues” with cutting interest rates into negative territory and such a move could hurt banks. “In simple economics and maths terms, there is nothing to stop it at all,” he said. “However there are a lot of issues with it.” At its meeting in November, the nine-strong committee voted to launch a fresh £150bn stimulus package in response to the economy’s flagging recovery, taking the total amount of electronic money pumped into the economy to £895bn. In December the committee said it would wait for further evidence of a downturn – and consider the impact of a Brexit trade deal – before committing extra funds to the stimulus package. Bailey said the Bank had seen anecdotal evidence of disruption caused by Britain’s departure from the European Union at the turn of the year, but it was unclear how persistent the delays would prove beyond the first month of the year. On Monday, one of the MPC’s nine committee members said she believed the likelihood of a further downturn following the third lockdown meant negative rates would benefit the UK economy and help it make a faster recovery. Silvana Tenreyro said central banks in Japan and the eurozone had cut rates to below zero to support borrowing and she was likely to vote for the UK to follow suit when a review by the Bank was completed. Bailey said negative rates – the subject of a feasibility review by the central bank – would complicate high street banks’ efforts to be profitable and force them to restrict lending. Officials at the central bank fear that negative rates will trigger a flight of savings, depleting the reserves of commercial banks and forcing them to cut back lending. Bailey argued that it was not easy to draw a direct parallel with similar action in the eurozone, where banks have mostly passed on the benefits to large businesses while keeping household savings and mortgage rates at higher levels.",business
"The Hut Group, the recently floated online retail company run by billionaire Matthew Moulding, has upgraded its profit forecasts after strong sales at its beauty and sports nutrition brands during the coronavirus pandemic. The Manchester-based company which floated on the London Stock Exchange in September, said sales rose 51% to £558.7m during its fourth quarter, beating previous expectations of an increase of between 40% and 45%. The Hut Group (THG), which runs the websites Lookfantastic, Glossybox and Zavvi as well as beauty brands such as Espa and Illamasqua and the sports nutrition company Myprotein, said sales had benefited from strong demand for beauty products including self-tanning kits, vitamin tablets, Myvegan supplements and hand sanitiser during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, THG said it was expecting 2021 revenues to be 30% to 35% ahead of last year’s, up from its previous estimate of 20% to 25%. Matthew Moulding, the co-founder who serves as executive chairman and chief executive, told analysts and investors that the “key standout was the beauty division”. He said the company had hired 3,000 people, largely within the UK, taking its global workforce to 10,000, and opened five new warehouses across the world. Black Friday had been strong, he said, and the firm’s websites typically got 20 times their usual orders in a day. The Hut Group made a strong stock market debut in mid-September, when its shares rose by a quarter to 625p. After the success of the stock market debut, Moulding was handed one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history – an £830m share award. The shares rose 1% to 798p on Tuesday, giving the firm a market value of £7.75bn – up from £5.6bn on the first day of trading – and valuing Moulding’s 25% stake at nearly £2bn. Last month, THG bought the US beauty website Dermstore and it has struck partnerships with the fragrance brand Creed, and GlaxoSmithKline for its vitamins portfolio in the UK. The Hut Group was founded in 2004 by the former Phones4u executives Moulding and John Gallemore to sell CDs online, and expanded rapidly by exploiting a now closed tax loophole that allowed companies to avoid VAT on small goods, including CDs and DVDs, by posting them to the UK from the Channel Islands. The firm sought to improve corporate governance by appointing another independent director, taking the number of independents on the eight-member board to four. The Hut Group has been criticised for handing Moulding both the executive chairman and chief executive roles, along with a “golden share” that allows him to block hostile takeover attempts for three years.",business
"A surge in sales of makeup and jogging bottoms over the Christmas period has boosted sales at the online fashion retailer Asos, which is expecting to make bigger full-year profits as a result. As Christmas parties were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and many office workers now work from home, shoppers splashed out on comfortable leisure wear including tracksuit bottoms, rather than party frocks. Health and beauty products – “makeup, lotions and potions of all sorts” – were also popular, said Nick Beighton, the Asos chief executive, as customers focus more on their wellbeing and improving their looks for video calls. The number of regular shoppers at the online firm rose by more than 1 million to 24.5 million. UK sales rose by 36% over the last four months of 2020, as Asos benefited from a surge in online shopping since the coronavirus outbreak last March, while Covid-19 restrictions forced high street rivals to shut non-essential retail stores. Total retail sales worldwide advanced 23%, including 18% growth in the EU and 13% in the US. Asos also benefited as customers returned fewer items, due to tighter restrictions across the UK, and the November lockdown in England. With England and Scotland entering new lockdowns in the new year, and restrictions likely to last until at least mid-February, Asos expects a Covid boost to pre-tax profits of at least £40m in its first half. As a result, it said pre-tax profits would hit the top end of City forecasts for the year to 31 August 2021, which range from £115m to £170m. In the previous year, profits more than quadrupled to £142.1m. Even so, Beighton highlighted an uncertain outlook. “Looking forward, given the uncertainty associated with the virus and the impact on customers’ lives, our cautious outlook for the second half of the year remains unchanged.” Asos also said that Brexit “country of origin” rules, which cover the shipment of products between the UK and the EU, would result in tariff costs of £15m. It announced earlier this week it would build a £90m distribution centre in Lichfield, Staffordshire that will handle parcels for its online clothing and beauty business and hire 2,000 people over the next three years.",business
"The boss of Unilever, one of the UK’s biggest companies, has said his office workers will never return to their desks five days a week, in the latest indication that coronavirus will transform modern working life. Alan Jope, the chief executive of the consumer goods group, said the company would also encourage all of its employees to receive vaccinations against Covid-19, but would stop short of making jabs mandatory. Employees who opt not to be vaccinated, however, will face mandatory testing. Jope said the company would look at different working patterns after it saw during the pandemic that it could adapt and make big changes far more quickly than previously thought. Unilever, the third most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange, is the maker of brands including Dove soap, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Marmite. It also owns Hellman’s, Knorr, Lipton and Persil. The pandemic has forced office staff to work from home in most of Unilever’s main markets, including the US and UK. Factory workers in most economies have been exempt from stay-at-home orders. Speaking on Wednesday at a Reuters conference, Jope said he did not expect office workers across western Europe and north America to return to work until at least April, and added that Unilever would use a “hybrid mode” of working between homes and offices after that. Permanent changes are expected for many of its 150,000 global employees, 7,000 of whom are in the UK. “We anticipate never going back to five days a week in the office,” Jope said. “That seems very old-fashioned now.” He also said the pandemic had made it clear that the company did not need to be as hierarchical. However, he added that Unilever was still keen to return to offices after seeing a “slow erosion of social capital” as working from home prevents colleagues from meeting in person. Many business leaders have voiced concerns about lack of innovation and the impact on training younger staff when workers do not congregate. Several large companies have said they intend to keep some of the new ways of working forced upon them by the pandemic. Twitter last year said it would allow employees to work from home “forever”, while the owners of empty city-centre offices are nervously hoping that economists are incorrect in predicting a sustained increase in homeworking. Morgan Stanley last summer predicted 30% of US workers would work from home after the pandemic, double pre-Covid estimates. Unilever is already experimenting with working practices. In New Zealand, its staff are trialling a four-day week, making it one of the biggest companies to consider reducing the hours its employees work, after a number of smaller firms found it helped productivity and employees’ wellbeing. The 81 New Zealand staff will continue with the four-day week until December, when Unilever will assess its performance and consider whether to extend it around the world. As well as bringing changes to working life, the pandemic has altered spending patterns, hitting sales of products such as ice creams but helping sales of cleaning products and food for home cooking. Jope highlighted the “rise of e-everything” during the pandemic, referring to increased online shopping from consumers stuck at home, as well as increased concern from consumers on environmental and social sustainability. “People are e-browsing, e-buying, e-paying, e-media-consuming and we expect that will continue,” he said. “We can rely on people’s use of technology to stick around.” The pandemic will continue to disrupt European and American economies during the first half of 2021, depressing spending, Jope said. However, he said east Asian economies such as Singapore and China – which have effectively suppressed viral outbreaks – were almost back to normal . On vaccinations, Jope criticised “vaccine hesitancy” and said Unilever would try to ensure access to vaccines for all of its workers. But, he added: “I don’t want any of my employees to be jumping the queue on frontline medical workers or vulnerable people.” ",business
"Lidl has celebrated a record Christmas in the UK as customers switched to the discount supermarket for festive treats including panettone and pink prosecco. Sales at the chain rose by 17.9% in the four weeks to 27 December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The increase was larger than those at the nation’s four biggest supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and the fellow discounter Aldi. Customers’ taste for premium food and drink over the Christmas period boosted their spend, and sales of Lidl’s Deluxe range climbed by 22%. Lidl shoppers bought more than 1m bottles of pink prosecco during the festive period, as well as 2.7m servings of panettone. An average of 17,000 Deluxe mince pies an hour were sold during December. The store’s first branded Christmas jumper, featuring the logo as part of a festive design, was popular, with one sold every minute in the month to 27 December. British supermarkets notched up their biggest month on record in December, spending £11.7bn on take-home groceries, according to analysts at the research group Kantar, as coronavirus restrictions led to the closure of many restaurants, pubs and cafes during the key trading period. Lidl said shoppers bought more goods – with basket size increasing by almost 25% year on year – and British households switched £34.7m of spend to Lidl from other supermarkets. Christian Härtnagel, the chief executive for Lidl GB, said its record sales and basket size growth demonstrated the strength of the chain’s appeal. “Despite this Christmas being a difficult time for many across the country, we are pleased to have been able to help our customers enjoy themselves by offering high-quality food at the lowest prices on the market,” he said. In December, Härtnagel joined the ranks of supermarket bosses who said they would return the government’s business rates relief. The privately owned German chain said it would give back more than £100m. Lidl opened four new stores in the UK in December, including in Southampton and Nottingham, creating 120 jobs. It is investing £1.3bn over the next two years to help to reach a target of 1,000 stores in the UK by 2023.",business
"Locked-down consumers across Europe ordered 57% more takeaways from the continent’s biggest delivery group in the final three months of 2020 than a year earlier. The huge leap in trade reported by Just Eat Takeaway.com was a further acceleration in growth from the 46% jump in the third quarter, as surging coronavirus cases resulted in countries across Europe reintroducing strict restrictions, keeping people at home. In the UK, delivery orders surged by almost 400% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period of 2019, as many consumers were once again asked by the government to stay at home. Just Eat Takeaway, based in the Netherlands and one of the world’s largest online food delivery firms, said it had put “tremendous effort” into improving the Just Eat UK business. It said it had doubled its UK sales force compared with the previous year, driving increased choice of restaurants for customers. Food delivery groups have been a clear winner during the pandemic because restrictions have often prevented restaurants, pubs and cafes from serving diners on their premises. The group now expects Just Eat’s delivery orders in the UK market to overtake the total food orders of the third-largest firm. Jitse Groen, the chief executive of Just Eat Takeaway.com, said the firm’s investment programme had been successful and led to significant gains in market share in most countries. “The progress in the UK is particularly exciting: order growth of 58%, and we have increased our delivery orders nearly fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019,” he said. “In 2021, we will continue to invest in price leadership, improving our service levels and expanding our offering to restaurants and consumers.”  The results come just over a year after shareholders in Just Eat approved a £6.2bn merger with the Dutch food delivery firm Takeaway.com, creating one of the largest food delivery groups in the world, serving customers in 23 countries from Europe to New Zealand. In June, Just Eat Takeaway agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn (£5.8bn) in a deal that created the world’s largest food delivery service outside China. Just Eat Takeaway said it had obtained all regulatory approvals relating to the Grubhub transaction, as well as shareholder approval, and it hoped to complete the deal in the first half of 2021. Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub together processed 593m orders in 2019 and have more than 70 million active customers globally.",business
"Burberry has reported a near 40% drop in sales in European markets on the back of store closures and fewer tourists but is experiencing a strong rebound in other parts of the world. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa slumped 37% in 13 weeks to 26 December, a major contrast with the Asia Pacific region, where sales jumped 11% on strong demand from Chinese and Korean shoppers. With 15% of its stores closed and about a third operating under reduced trading hours or restrictions, Marco Gobbetti, Burberry’s chief executive, said the British luxury brand faced an “uncertain trajectory, given the spread of the more transmissible new variants of Covid-19”. He said: “Given this outlook, we expect trading will remain susceptible to regional disruptions as we close the financial year.” However, Gobbetti struck a positive note on the new future as new collections, and advertising featuring people such as the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, attracted younger customers to its designer clothes and accessories. Shoppers were embracing the designs of its creative boss Riccardo Tisci with sales of leather handbags and outerwear up in the “low teens”. Gobbetti said: “While the short-term outlook remains uncertain due to Covid-19, we are well placed to accelerate when the pandemic eases.”  Burberry is working through the implications of the Brexit deal. Based on its preliminary analysis, the company expects a “modest increase in border trade compliance costs as well as some incremental duty under the rules of origin”. Third-quarter sales in established stores were down 9% overall, with the figure pulled down by the company’s decision to reduce the volume of end-of-season discounts, as well as reduced tourist numbers. Online sales were up by more than 50% in the company’s third quarter and by more than 100% in mainland China.",business
"After months of tortuous negotiations between the UK and the EU, a Brexit trade deal was agreed at almost the last minute. But how prepared are UK businesses for the significant changes that will come into force on 1 January? Are they happy with the terms of the agreement? A shock rise in high street prices caused by billions of pounds of new import taxes on everyday goods has been avoided thanks to the new trade deal. Four-fifths of UK food imports come from the EU, and the British Retail Consortium has told shoppers they can heave a “collective sigh of relief”. Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim, said: “Two weeks ago there was a risk that Brexit could be catastrophic. The deal has provided certainty in terms of what retailers need to do. What we are facing now is at the lower end of the scale in terms of the potential for disruption.” John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, who had warned that import tariffs would have triggered higher food prices, said he was now “relatively calm” about the impact of Brexit on retail, and food retail in particular. But he cautioned: “If we don’t do something very positive to counteract it in terms of the national economy in the long run, we will be a bit worse off than we would have been if we’d stayed in the EU.” Zoe Wood The chaos caused by last week’s French travel ban, which left thousands of truckers stranded in Kent and supermarkets flying in fresh fruit and vegetables, means we have already seen what the worst-case scenario for 1 January could look like. Could those scenes be repeated? The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has already predicted “bumpy moments” for companies navigating the new customs procedures, and analysts think tailbacks at the ports are inevitable in the early days. However, the government’s decision to temporarily waive most of its border checks takes some of the pressure off. The initial focus is on imports of “controlled” goods such as alcohol and tobacco, but controls will ratchet up in April and again in July. After the frenetic stockpiling before Christmas and the Brexit deadline, the volume of goods moved in January is lower, which will also help if there are hiccups with new systems. But any disruption to the flow of cross-Channel trade caused by new Brexit bureaucracy would soon be felt on British shores. With 3,500 trucks a day using the Channel tunnel, the Eurotunnel terminal is an obvious bottleneck if businesses struggle with new customs paperwork. Border delays would be disastrous for exporters of perishable goods, such as Scottish seafood, which were badly hit last week. ZW Given that UK haulage companies had feared having to fight over a small number of annual permits to carry on sending lorries across the Channel, for most the agreement is a significant improvement on the no-deal scenario. However, their operations will be constrained in terms of cabotage (ie moving goods within an EU country) and cross-border deliveries within the EU. That could pose a headache for some, and could prove insurmountable for specialist companies providing logistics for events such as music tours through several countries. The deal still means an enormous amount of red tape for customs and borders, and while the haulage sector itself will not be responsible, lorries could be held up or stopped if their importing/exporting companies have not got the new paperwork correct. Gwyn Topham Drugmakers have long been preparing for Brexit by stockpiling more medicines to ensure there are no shortages of vital drugs and by planning alternative supply routes away from the busy Dover to Calais straits. The industry is confident that medicines will reach patients come 1 January and beyond, but says some things are out of its control, such as delays at borders due to new customs and border checks. Under the Brexit deal, inspections of drug manufacturing facilities are recognised by both sides, but the text does not mention mutual recognition of medicine batch testing. Additional safety tests on medicines made in the UK before they are sold in the EU and vice versa would lead to delays of several weeks. For Northern Ireland, the UK and EU have agreed a one-year phase-in period to implement medicines regulation. Julia Kollewe UK airlines had long been resigned to losing some of their freedoms to operate throughout Europe, such as flying between two EU member states, with easyJet having already hived off part of its operations into a new company in Austria to tackle potential losses from its route network. Meanwhile, contingency measures had guaranteed that flights could continue between the UK and EU in the event of no deal. The structure of International Airlines Group, the Madrid-based owner of British Airways, was questioned before the deal. A clause now allows UK carriers to be controlled by a combination of EU and UK shareholders, which should avert any obligation for BA or other airlines to be split off from owning groups or for shareholders to divest. GT While the Brexit deal says very little about financial services, it has been broadly welcomed by City firms whose business borrowers and corporate clients could have suffered from tariffs and quotas on cross-border trade. But industry groups including UK Finance are calling for an equivalence agreement on financial services – which would give similar access rights to City firms after the end of the transition period – as soon as possible. The lobby group TheCityUK has said that while there are agreements covering basic banking transactions, there are up to 40 treaties affecting cross-border activities for the financial industry that need to be renegotiated. However, reports suggest an agreement on equivalence may not come until spring or summer 2021. TheCityUK’s boss, Miles Celic, said: “While a deal is welcome, financial and related professional services are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to continue to develop the relationship in services in the years ahead.” Most City firms – investment banks, asset managers and insurers – had not expected a deal covering financial services to be struck before the transition deadline, and prepared accordingly. Firms have spent the last four years applying for licences with local regulators, revising client contracts, and shifting more than 7,500 roles and a combined £1.2tn in assets to the EU, to ensure they could continue serving continental customers by the time the UK left the bloc. However, areas that have not yet been granted equivalence, such as derivatives trading, are facing disruption despite the deal. Traders and brokers will have to make alternative arrangements, bypassing the London market to use derivatives trading platforms in countries such as the US that have already been granted equivalence. If traders and brokers get used to rerouting their business through different countries, it could threaten London’s dominance as a financial centre, and make trading less efficient and more costly for users. Kalyeena Makortoff UK manufacturing firms were overwhelmingly in favour of a deal that avoided tariffs and quotas that would have destroyed the business models of many companies importing or exporting materials, parts or goods from Europe. However, new customs and rules of origin checks at the border mean parts will be slower to enter the UK, which in turn means carefully planned “just-in-time” supply chains for companies will have to cope with longer import times, adding billions of pounds of extra customs costs for EU and UK businesses. Manufacturers have called for a significant adjustment period to allow them to continue to trade freely while they adjust to the new rules. One of the trickiest issues for advanced manufacturers is around complex rules of origin. For instance, Japan’s Nissan or Toyota will only be able to source 45% of their car parts from Asia to avoid tariffs. However, the deal means parts sourced from the EU and vice versa will not be affected, and there will be leeway with electric car batteries until 2023. Jasper Jolly The trade deal’s energy chapters have a notable emphasis on the climate crisis, including commitments on using more renewables and avoiding a race to the bottom on climate regulations. In fact, the trade deal could be suspended entirely if either side reneges on the 2015 Paris agreement. The deal includes a new commitment for both sides to work together in the North Sea on big offshore windfarms linked to both the UK and the EU. However, there are large gaps remaining on how exactly existing trade in gas and electricity across interconnectors will work, with only a commitment to sort technical details by 2022. The energy industry is particularly keen for the deal’s parallel UK and EU carbon pricing schemes to be joined together, which it says would avoid extra costs. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the lobby group Energy UK, said that agreeing to link carbon markets in 2021 would be “a great demonstration of collaboration on decarbonisation” before the UK hosts the Cop26 climate talks in the autumn. On nuclear power, the UK and the EU have agreed to continue cooperating, including on the safe movement of nuclear material, equipment and waste. The UK will still be part of various nuclear research programmes. And as with many parts of the deal, the agreement heralds the start of rolling negotiations: the energy chapter will cease to apply in June 2026 – potentially a worry for investors looking at the big energy projects that will be needed to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. JJ Taking back control of the UK’s waters was a rallying cry for the Brexit campaign, even if fishing’s contribution to the UK and EU economies is small relative to other sectors. The deal transfers 25% of the value of fish caught by EU boats in UK waters back to the UK over five years – considerably less than the 80% originally demanded by the UK. UK vessels will catch about two-thirds of fish caught in UK waters, but EU boats will be able to operate as close as six miles from the UK’s coast. Fishers’ lobby groups were aghast that the deal will end the practice of quota swapping between British and EU vessels, meaning that in some cases UK fishers may be limited to smaller catches. And the deal is by no means an end point: instead, the EU and the UK will conduct annual negotiations on catch size. Some UK fishers hope the UK will continue to push for further increases in their catch. JJ",business
"UK technology companies attracted a record $15bn (£11.2bn) in venture capital funding in 2020, including the creation of seven “unicorn” firms valued at more than $1bn. The firms raised more money from VC investors than the rest of Europe combined, according to research by the data provider Dealroom. The $15bn total compares with the previous record of $14.8bn in 2019. The investments helped create seven unicorns – : the electric vehicle startup Arrival, the recipe box company Gousto, the green energy provider Octopus Energy, the e-commerce platforms Gymshark and Cazoo, and the cloud communications platform Infobip. The UK is now home to more unicorns than any other European country, and as many as Germany, Netherlands and France combined, according to the research. Oliver Dowden, the digital secretary, said: “It’s fantastic to see the UK’s tech companies flourishing, despite all the challenges of 2020. The thousands of high-skilled jobs they are creating will be a crucial part of our economic recovery and the government is committed to supporting the tech sector through an unashamedly pro-tech approach.” The venture capital investment in UK companies was lifted by a series of “mega-rounds” of funding raised by companies including the challenger financial technology company Revolut and the digital insurance provider Ki, which both secured $500m. In the final weeks of December significant fundraisings included $95m for GoCardless, while Octopus Energy raised $200m. The investment from a Japanese utility firm valued Octopus, which was founded little more than five years ago, at $2bn. The 7.4% stake of the founder, Greg Jackson, is worth an estimated $155m (£115m). Oxford overtook Cambridge to take the number two spot in terms of VC investment in tech firms behind London. Oxford’s startups and “scaleups” raised $532m in investment this year, led by the city’s health-related companies such as the biotech unicorn Oxford Nanopore, which raised $84.4m in October. Companies based in Leeds, Newcastle and Glasgow also raised more money than last year. The digital minister Caroline Dinenage said: “Despite the challenges of 2020, the UK tech sector has had one of its strongest years yet, creating seven new billion-dollar companies and achieving record levels of investment. “The success of our regional tech hubs is something to celebrate, as is the industry’s resilience by offering high levels of employment opportunities across a variety of disciplines. Over the upcoming months, we will work closely with the sector to support tech firms and ensure this momentum can be maintained.”",business
"2020 has been the most remarkable year for the global financial markets. After the Covid-19 pandemic triggered the worst crash in a generation, unprecedented stimulus measures and vaccine breakthroughs have sent stocks roaring back to record highs. In a year in which at least 1.7 million people died from coronavirus and unemployment soared in a global recession, world stock markets are ending 2020 up 13% – despite the latest surge in cases forcing further lockdowns this winter. The year began with immediate drama, when the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed in a US drone strike at Baghdad airport, sending oil prices higher and markets lower. But fears of Middle East conflict soon took a back seat as troubling reports of an unidentified pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China, emerged. By the start of the Lunar New Year in mid-January, at least 26 people had died. Beijing’s stock market plunged 8% in its worst rout in more than four years when it reopened after the holiday, amid a scramble to shut cinemas, suspend travel, close factories and make people work from home. Weeks later, as the virus spread, the shock that the Lombardy region in Italy was imposing its own lockdown triggered Europe’s worst stock market meltdown in decades. The realisation that politicians would deliberately freeze economic activity to try to slow the virus and prevent health systems being overwhelmed created a month of unprecedented financial turmoil. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, says that as a working investment manager, 2020 was both scary and fascinating. “We were facing a disease that we didn’t understand, and which could have been the equivalent of medieval plague. We now know that it’s really unpleasant but not nearly as bad as it could have been, but we didn’t know that at the time,” Miller explains. “Plus, governments had stopped the global economy – something that had never been done before. Would that lead to an economic depression that would make the 1930s look tame?” Heavy falls in the last week of February were followed by a massive selloff on the bourses in March as investors braced for a global recession and Donald Trump shocked the markets by banning flights from Europe. The UK’s FTSE 100 suffered its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis on 9 March, falling 7% on “Crash Monday”, followed by a horror show three days later when London and New York both posted their worst days since the 1987 crash, shedding a further 10% each. Wall Street’s long bull market died, not with a bang but a wave of selling that briefly saw the Dow lose all its gains under President Trump. At its worst, the selloff wiped out a third of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index’s value. Having started the year at 7,542 points, it had fallen to about 5,000 points by mid-March – its lowest level since 2011 – during its worst quarter since 1987. The pound was also hammered, falling below $1.20 to its lowest level since 1985 amid a wild scramble for US dollars. Sterling was no one’s idea of a safe haven in a pandemic. But what felt like economic Armageddon in March was actually the buying opportunity of a lifetime – if you had the nerve to pile into the stock market in the early stages of the lockdown. The cavalry had arrived, with central bankers slashing borrowing costs to record lows and launching massive new asset purchase programmes, while governments tried to prop up their economies with packages such as the UK’s job retention scheme. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank Berenberg, says central banks, finance ministers and regulators deserve praise for acting fast and effectively. “Despite a plunge in output by up to 30% within two months and a bout of serious financial turmoil in early March, the world did not descend into a genuine financial crisis,” Schmieding says. Miller agrees that those support packages for businesses and households were vital. “No one has ever stopped economic activity and locked down a country like we did this year. This is a first.” As the Covid crisis escalated, the financial sector was in better shape than before the 2008 crisis. So in 2020, although there were queues outside the supermarkets, there was no repeat of the run on Northern Rock 13 years ago. Miller says his experience of previous recessions over a 40-year career in the City gave “useful perspective” for 2020’s drama, but this year’s events were still unprecedented. But hard on the heels of cratering equities and the ailing pound came another shock – Saudi Arabia and Russia launched an oil-price war. With air and road travel in deep freeze, an oil glut was already filling up every spare tanker. Riyadh dramatically turning the taps up, not off, sent US oil futures plunging below zero as investors scrambled to offload contracts. The spring also brought grim economic news – more than 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April alone, sending the US unemployment rate soaring to 14.7%, its highest level since the second world war. But the markets were recovering much faster than the real economy, thanks to those huge stimulus programmes. Some analysts and investors were cautious, fearing the consequences of a second wave of Covid-19, but the rally had legs. After its worst quarter in over 30 years, the FTSE 100 posted its best three months since 2010 between April and June, as global markets staged a rapid rebound. Tech companies were the clear early winners – as the pandemic pressed the fast-forward button on the move towards digitisation, video-conferencing and online shopping. “The speed of the recovery caught everyone off guard,” explains Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at Axi. “The pandemic has compressed what we thought was going to happen over the next five years into three or six months.” By the summer, economies were emerging from their deepest peacetime recessions, and attention turned to the recovery. Talk that frenzied money-printing by central banks would lead to an inflationary boom swept the gold price to $2,000 per ounce for the first time ever in August. Global markets recovered their pandemic losses as investors began to price in a return to economic normality in 2021, and the prospect of yet more stimulus measures. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says there hasn’t been the same sense of panic as in 2008, apart from the rapid slide in February and March. “Even though this year has been difficult for many, I wouldn’t say investment-wise it’s been more challenging than 2008-09. Back then, the crisis felt much closer to the financial markets, and unlike the credit crunch, the pandemic has always seemed like a problem with a solution, namely the vaccine,” Stevenson explains. 2020 also brought a fresh wave of retail investors to the market. The FAANG technology titans of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet helped the Nasdaq to jump more than 40% this year. Tesla enjoyed the most astonishing run, up almost 700% in 2020. Those stock market gains boosted the wealthiest the most, intensifying the economic inequality created by a pandemic that hit lower-paid workers in areas such as hospitality particularly hard. “The people who most need the money don’t have it to invest, unless they took a flier on Amazon or Tesla, but most didn’t,” Innes points out. The London market lagged behind the wider rally, though, hamstrung by its lack of big tech firms, and abundance of miners, oil giants and banks, all bruised by the global downturn. By the autumn, a resurgence of Covid-19 cases and new restrictions pushed the FTSE 100 back down to a six-month low. But then came a record-breaking November for global markets. Many on Wall Street had started 2020 quietly expecting Donald Trump to be re-elected. Never mind the unpredictability and trade wars, went the theory, just enjoy the promise of lower taxes and deregulation. But by the time Joe Biden had triumphed, money had already poured into renewable energy stocks, along with cyclical companies, in anticipation of increased spending on infrastructure and new stimulus moves from a Democratic White House. Biden’s win prompted a rally after a weak October, which accelerated when Pfizer brought the news everyone had been hoping for – successful vaccine trial data. Global stock markets surged to new record highs, with a frenzy of buying lifting beleaguered “value” stocks such as airlines and hospitality firms, on optimism of a better 2021. The year wrapped up with fresh records, as the Federal Reserve pledged to keep monetary police very loose until the US economy had recovered. First the Dow hit 30,000 points, then bitcoin broke through to $20,000, and raced to $28,000 days later. Quite a revival, given the cryptocurrency had slumped to $6,000 during the March crash. The tech boom refused to abate, with Airbnb’s share price doubling as it floated on the Nasdaq. As the year ends, MSCI’s All Country World index of global shares is more than 13% higher for the year, and two-thirds higher than its March lows. Innes says 2020 was the toughest of his 30-year career. “I’ve never seen anything like it, both the pace of the compression, and then the rebound. Things happened 20, 30 times faster than ever seen before, and I’ve never seen such a strong, concerted, reaction from central bankers either.” Brexit also weighed on UK stocks this year, and was one reason the FTSE 100 fell behind other markets – and is still down 12% for the year. As negotiations reached a climax in December, the pound hit a 31-month high over $1.36, then suffered a late wobble before the final deal was agreed. Although the agreement is thinner than hoped, particularly for services, UK stocks still rallied to a nine-month high once fears of a disorderly Brexit abated. Those huge stimulus packages also drove government bond yields to fresh record lows – the UK can now borrow for free for five years. While welcome news for finance ministers facing huge deficits, such low returns also push investors into riskier assets like equities in search of returns. But it was another rough year for those who trusted their savings to the bank, rather than risking the ups and downs of the financial markets. With interest rates at record lows, cash savings have languished again. “Deposit rates at high street banks are barely above zero and even tying your money up for 10 years in UK government bonds [gilts] will currently earn less than half a per cent per annum, if held to maturity,” says Simon Young, portfolio manager at AXA Investment Managers.",business
"The owner of Primark has revealed that the latest wave of Covid-19 lockdowns cost the fashion chain £430m in lost sales but that it has experienced a “phenomenal” jump in sales this week since stores were allowed to reopen. The finance director of Associated British Foods (ABF), John Bason, said that trading across reopened Primark stores in England, Ireland, France and Belgium had been better than predicted. “Our trading before the lockdown and now our trading these first few days after lockdown [is] way higher than we had previously expected,” Bason said. “It is phenomenal, in some cases we haven’t seen anything like it,” he said. Primark reopened all 153 of its English stores on Wednesday after a month-long lockdown, with extended trading hours in an attempt to recoup some of its lost sales. Eleven stores stayed open overnight, resulting in a 40-hour trading marathon, with hundreds of shoppers queueing to get into the shops in the small hours of Thursday morning. The company said 34 of its stores – including all those in Northern Ireland and Austria – are still temporarily closed, accounting for 7% of its total store footprint. That compares with the closure of 62% of its store space in November. The jump in pre-Christmas sales is expected to help Primark offset the £430m it lost over England’s second lockdown. The estimated loss, which was released in a trading update on Friday, is larger than the £375m hit it predicted at the start of November. ABF still expects Primark to beat sales and profits recorded for the past financial year, when sales fell 24% to £5.9bn and profits slumped 62% to £362m in the 12 months to September. The company said that some stores were still facing restrictions on trading hours and the number of customers allowed in stores, and that there was still “uncertainty” about further lockdown closures in the short-term. In a week when two of the UK’s biggest retailers – Debenhams and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia empire – have collapsed into administration and amid growing concerns about the future of the high street as a result of the switch to online shopping, the Primark owner struck an optimistic tone, saying it remained committed to expanding its shops. Primark does not sell online. The news sent ABF shares up 2% on Friday morning. The company also said it was fully prepared for the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of December. As companies await news of a potential UK-EU trade deal, ABF said: “Our businesses have completed all practical preparations for the end of the transition period this month and contingency plans are in place should our businesses experience some disruption at that time.” ",business
"The Spanish owners of TSB are considering putting the UK bank up for sale, in what could lead to the third major ownership shakeup for the loss-making lender in seven years. Sabadell has asked Goldman Sachs to launch a review of TSB that could result in a sale of the entire bank, which it bought for £1.7bn in 2015. However, the Guardian understands Sabadell is open to other options including selling a partial stake, floating TSB on the stock exchange, or maintaining full ownership of the UK lender. The news emerged hours after Sabadell called off merger talks with its larger Spanish rival BBVA, after the two banks failed to agree on a price. Sabadell said it was launching a new strategy that “will prioritise its Spanish domestic business”. “Sabadell will also analyse strategic alternatives for creating shareholder value with regard to the group’s international assets, including TSB,” the Spanish bank added. Goldman Sachs was originally hired by Sabadell to explore various options for TSB back in July. It has now been given a mandate to pursue a sale, according to Reuters, citing a source. It is the latest UK lender to be the subject of a possible sale. Sainsbury’s Bank has also been approached by NatWest, while the Cooperative Bank has received a bid from US private equity fund Cerberus. A sale of TSB would mark the third major ownership change for the UK bank, which was hived off from Lloyds in 2013 as part of efforts to boost competition following its £20.3bn government bailout in 2008. TSB returned as a standalone high street bank nearly 20 years after it was snapped up by Lloyds in 1995. Led by chief executive Paul Pester, the new TSB spanned 631 branches and boasted 8,500 staff. It eventually floated on the UK stock exchange in 2014, but was bought by Sabadell a year later, marking one of the biggest cross-border banking deals since the financial crisis. However, the lender’s reputation was tarnished after the botched launch of a new IT system in 2018 that left millions of customers locked out of their bank accounts for weeks. Pester resigned as chief executive within months of the meltdown, following intense criticism from regulators and MPs. The bank had been rushing to push through the new system, which meant it would no longer have to rely on Lloyds’ IT infrastructure, or pay for the privilege of using it. An independent investigation later concluded that TSB’s board lacked “common sense” and was shifting customers to the new platform before it was fully tested. The incident cost TSB £366m, including customer compensation. Sabadell appointed CYBG executive Debbie Crosbie as CEO to push ahead with a three-year turnaround plan that recently resulted in plans to cut nearly 1,000 staff and close 164 branches. It will leave TSB with 290 branches and about 6,000 staff. TSB’s profits have also been hit by the Covid crisis. TSB reported a £65.5m loss for the first half of 2019 compared with a profit of £21.1m a year earlier, after setting aside £111m to cover the cost of potential defaults linked to the economic downturn. TSB, Sabadell and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.",business
"Retail sales on Black Friday have fallen sharply despite a boom in online spending as non-essential shops remain closed on England’s high streets during the second coronavirus lockdown. Retailers said online sales hit record levels on the pivotal discount day to soften the blow from the closure of stores. However, UK figures from Barclaycard, Britain’s biggest credit card provider, show payments made in physical stores and online fell by more than a 10th comparedwith Black Friday a year ago. John Lewis said Friday would break all of its previous records for online spending, with sales up by 35% compared with its busiest day during the same period a year ago. It said 2.5m products had already been shipped since it started offering Black Friday offers on 20 November – up 67% on last year – and that record searches had been made for new games consoles, beauty products and Lego kits. However, the boom comes at a time when the company will record zero sales at all 38 of its shops in England, and at its Glasgow store, where government restrictions have forced the closure of shops. Cardiff, Aberdeen and Edinburgh remain open. Barclaycard, which processes nearly £1 in every £3 spent in the UK, said most Black Friday sales typically take place in physical shops, underscoring the potential hit to retailers struggling during the pandemic. It warned that overall payments made to retailers between midnight and 4pm on Friday had plunged by 16.7% compared with the same time a year ago. In a typical year, about two-thirds of the transactions processed by Barclaycard on Black Friday come from in-store sales, with the rest coming from online. The research provider Springboard, which monitors retail footfall, said visits to shopping destinations were down by 58% across the UK by 3pm on Friday compared with last year. Footfall was down most on high streets and at shopping centres. The biggest fall was in central London, with a drop of 82.9%. However, the decline in footfall was far lower in Wales and Scotland where Covid restrictions allow more shops to open. Footfall in Wales was down by a third across the country compared with Black Friday a year ago, while retail visits were down by 50% in Scotland. Separate figures from Nationwide show total spending by its debit card holders – which unlike Barclaycard do not specify whether payments are being made to a retailer – increased by 21% compared with the same day a week ago, as Black Friday provided a boost during lockdown. However, it said transactions were 1% down on Black Friday a year ago. The figures underscore the challenge facing Britain’s retailers in the run-up to the key Christmas shopping period, when more than a fifth of annual sales usually take place. The British Retail Consortium estimates that shops that were forced to close over the past month have lost a combined £8bn in sales. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show online sales accounted for about 28.5% of all spending in October, compared with 19% in January before the emergency struck. Online food sales have nearly doubled. Clothing stores have managed to drive up online sales by 17.1%, but these gains have been outweighed by a 22.1% fall in spending in physical stores. Rob Cameron, the chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said: “Despite the fall in transactions, the silver lining remains the growth of e-commerce. Already this month Barclaycard has seen a 32% increase in the value of online transactions processed, and this is even higher in key ‘gift’ categories such as electronics, cosmetics and jewellery. “This growth signals both a change in consumer behaviour, with people unable to buy gifts in-store, and the fact that many retailers have been spreading out their discounts throughout November, meaning shoppers can take advantage of early bargains.”",business
"Sir Philip Green’s retail empire is on the brink of administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk and threatening an end to the tycoon’s high street reign. Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Evans, Outfit and Burton, was struggling before the coronavirus hit and is set to seek protection from creditors after months of Covid shutdowns took their toll. It is understood that Green is considering a process known as a light-touch trading administration, in which management would retain control of the day-to-day running of the business while administrators seek buyers for all or parts of the company. The process, currently being used by ailing retailer Debenhams, protects the business from creditors while options for its future are considered. Administrators could be appointed as early as Monday next week with Green, 68, thought unlikely to attempt to buy back the assets of his 500-store group. Industry watchers said Topshop and Topman would still attract interest from suitors but the smaller brands would be less appealing, with Boohoo, the online specialist, one of a few likely buyers of those assets. ITV News reported that Mike Ashley, the entrepreneur behind Sports Direct, was interested in all of Arcadia’s brands. Responding to a Sky News report that Arcadia was set to appoint administrators from Deloitte, the company said in a statement: “The forced closure of our stores for sustained periods as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has had a material impact on trading across our businesses. “As a result, the Arcadia boards have been working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group’s brands. The brands continue to trade and our stores will be opening again in England and the Republic of Ireland as soon as the government Covid-19 restrictions are lifted next week.” Arcadia has been suffering from heavy competition from new rivals such as Boohoo and Asos for some time. It follows years of underinvestment in online selling under Green’s stewardship. In July, the group announced 500 job losses at its head office after it narrowly staved off administration in June 2019 through an agreement with creditors that involved 1,000 job losses and about 50 store closures. Early in the Covid crisis it asked landlords for rent cuts and temporarily paused payments into its pension scheme. It has recently been searching for £30m in funding to help it through the peak trading period. The collapse of the group would leave a pension deficit estimated to be as much as £350m by John Ralfe, a pensions expert. On administration, the group’s schemes will fall under the auspices of the industry-funded pensions lifeboat. The move could cut pay-outs for staff members by 10% when they retire. Last year, Tina Green, 71, the wife of Sir Philip and ultimate owner of Arcadia, pledged to pay an extra £100m into the funds over three years and signed over rights to property worth £210m. However, according to Raife, the fall in the value of retail property means a sale of those assets is unlikely to fill the pension black hole. The pensions issue is likely to cause controversy after BHS collapsed into administration in 2016 with a £571m pension deficit only a year after Green sold it for £1 to a former bankrupt. Green eventually paid £353m to support the BHS scheme after pressure from the pensions regulator. Like all fashion chains Arcadia has suffered heavily from a slowdown in spending on fashion as pubs, clubs and many workplaces have been closed for much of the year. Groups that are heavily reliant on their stores have suffered further as sales lost during the high street lockdowns have not been made up online. The potential collapse into administration of Green’s empire comes only weeks after rival Philip Day’s Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group called in administrators leading to about 1,000 job losses so far with thousands more at risk. Department store Debenhams is also fighting for survival as it aims to secure a rescue deal with JD Sports. The problems at Debenhams, which has closed more than 40 stores in the last 12 months, have had a knock-on effect at Arcadia because it is one of the department store chain’s biggest suppliers. Insolvency experts said both companies were under pressure from creditors who want to call in debts while the retailers are cash-rich during the peak Christmas trading period.",business
"The Labour former business secretary Peter Mandelson has described the government’s national security and investment bill as “a powerful deterrent to foreign direct investment”, amid warnings that its introduction could be chaotic. In a webinar discussing the impact of the new legislation, Lord Mandelson argued that “in those halcyon New Labour days, such a system of state screening would have been unthinkable.” Introduced by the Conservative government this month, the bill contains sweeping powers to block takeovers and other deals involving Chinese and other foreign firms, and even UK businesses, on national security grounds. The existing regime was introduced by Labour in 2002, and the Conservative government now believes is too light-touch. It is expected to increase the number of takeovers and other deals that are security-screened from one a year to around 1,000. That prompted Mandelson, who had two stints as business secretary, to query how the system would be handled. He said: “What will notifiers be doing. Simply forming an orderly queue … crossing their fingers and hoping for the best?” John Fingleton, a former chief executive with the Office of Fair Trading, a predecessor of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), estimated that the business department could require “potentially 500 to 1,000 people” to handle the national security caseload. He said the CMA, which examines whether mergers pose a monopoly risk, had a staff of around 100 and took on a similar number of cases each year. “I think it’ll be quite chaotic in the beginning and it will take time to set up a new unit like this,” the former regulator said, adding that early cases referred could take longer to process as staff built up confidence and expertise. The bill envisages that transactions in critical industrial sectors will have to be notified to the unit in the business department that will scrutinise deals. Other transactions could potentially be called in and reviewed up to five years after they are concluded. Ministers would have the power to void deals on security grounds. Fingleton said the bill could create too much pressure on the government, and argued that “to protect ministers from themselves” any remedies proposed should only be related to national security. He added: “What will happen is that any vested interest, whether it is a competitor or a group of workers or anybody that has been disaffected or a former owner … who doesn’t like a deal will launch a campaign to lobby a minister to call something in.” The bill has been drafted at a time of growing concern on the Conservative benches about China, and how far Chinese companies should be allowed to invest in the UK’s critical infrastructure, following Downing Street’s announcement that all Huawei 5G kit would be removed from phone networks by 2027. However, it has been carefully written so that no one country is singled out. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said at the time the bill was launched that while ministers were keen to ensure the UK remained attractive to inward investment, “hostile actors should be in no doubt – there is no back door to the UK”.",business
"Families are preparing for a home-baked Christmas as they tackle the boredom of lockdown restrictions by making their own puddings, mince pies and cakes. Retailers are reporting a surge in sales of festive favourites such as dried fruit, marzipan, candied peel and mincemeat while first-time bakers have also prompted a rush on sales of pudding bowls and baking trays. Waitrose said sales of homebaking goods were up by a fifth including a 70% jump in sales of mincemeat, the key ingredient in mince pies, and a 77% rise in marzipan, which can be used to make stollen as well as a topper for cakes. Sales of chocolate chips have more than doubled. Another main supermarket said sales of sugar, marzipan, cherries, candied peels and chocolate drops were up by more than a quarter on previous years with some shelves looking bare as stores struggled to keep up with demand. The therapeutic power of baking has been a theme of pandemic life, from experimenting with homemade sourdough bread, to trying to recreate takeaway favourites. Such was demand for flour in the spring that supermarkets ran short and flour mills struggled to keep up with demand. The homewares shop, Lakeland, said it had seen a 47% rise in sales of mixing bowls this year. There has also been a leap in sales of bowls for a Christmas pudding and a more than 80% increase in bun tins suitable for making mince pies. Sales of Christmas cake decorations – such as model Santas, holly and robins- are also up on last year. Natalie Breslin, home baking buyer at Waitrose, said many customers were baking their christmas gifts this year: “We know that our customers are looking to add a homemade touch to the gifts they give. Putting time and effort into a bake or making a special gift is a way of showing those around us how much we care.” Research by One Poll for Waitrose and sister chain John Lewis found 42% of people are planning to be more creative with homemade gifts this year than previous years. Katherine Paterson, customer director at Hobbycraft, said the festive DIY trend was not just about baking. Its bestselling products this year includes fillable advent calenders and baubles as families seek to personalise decorations: “It’s going to be the biggest handmade Christmas ever with people making and creating with the passion and skills they’ve learned throughout the year,” Paterson said.",business
"Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group has collapsed into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk as the retail tycoon’s high street career ends in failure. The owner of household names including Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton appointed administrators from Deloitte on Monday. No immediate redundancies were made as a result of the appointment and the group’s stores and websites will continue to trade. The move will protect Arcadia from creditors while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Green, 68, is not expected to bid for any of the assets. Arcadia’s management will retain day-to-day control of the business under the light-touch trading administration, the same process operating at the troubled department store chain Debenhams. Ian Grabiner, the chief executive of Arcadia, said: “This is an incredibly sad day for all of our colleagues as well as our suppliers and our many other stakeholders. “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands. Throughout this immensely challenging time, our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side. Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.” Arcadia stores will reopen in England on 2 December when the coronavirus lockdown is lifted. Arcadia has about 450 directly leased stores in the UK and 22 overseas, as well as dozens more concessions in department stores and other outlets including Tesco. Its entry into administration is the biggest British corporate failure of the pandemic, and the latest blow to an already battered UK high street. Arcadia has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs since its parent company, Taveta, slumped to a £177.3m loss in the year to 1 September 2018 – Taveta’s last published set of results – with sales over that period slipping nearly 5% to £1.8bn. The collapse not only brings to an end Green’s decades-long presence on the British high street, but appears to have been the final straw for JD Sports’ potential rescue of ailing department store Debenhams, where Arcadia is a big supplier. The sports retailer looks likely to pull out of talks, raising the prospect of thousands more job losses at the department store group if an alternative rescue plan cannot be secured. Matt Smith of Deloitte, the joint administrator, said the coronavirus lockdowns, combined with “broader challenges” for high street retailers, had resulted in a “critical funding requirement” for Arcadia, forcing it into administration. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, offered Arcadia a £50m emergency loan, but that offer was turned down on Monday before administrators were called in. Smith said: “It is our intention to continue to trade all of the brands, and we look forward to welcoming customers back into stores when many of them are allowed to reopen. We will be rapidly seeking expressions of interest and expect to identify one or more buyers to ensure the future success of the businesses.”  Retail analysts say that some of Arcadia’s more popular brands, such as Topshop and Topman, could appeal to potential buyers, although the administrators may struggle to raise interest in some of the group’s other assets. The group’s brands had been suffering from years of underinvestment before the Covid pandemic and had failed to keep up with the switch to online selling and digital marketing. More than 10 buyers are thought to be lining up for Topshop, including online specialist Boohoo, Frasers Group and a number of private equity players. Industry insiders said big chains including Marks & Spencer and Next, which has been expanding its portfolio of brands as a way to utilise its strong online infrastructure, might also be interested in taking on the fashion brand, which would give it better access to a younger market. While Ashley has made no secret of his interest in Arcadia, his capacity to take on the business is in doubt. He is also casting an eye over both Debenhams and some brands that formed part of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, while struggling to revive House of Fraser and update his main Sports Direct chain. As workers hope a deal can be done to rescue jobs, the administration also raises concerns for members of Arcadia’s pension fund, which has an estimated deficit of £350m. The pension fund will be assessed for entry into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-backed pensions lifeboat. However, the move to the PPF could mean members who have not yet reached the scheme’s normal retirement age lose 10% of their benefits, even if they have already started taking the pension. MPs and trade unions have called on the Green family, who have benefited over the years from huge Arcadia payouts, including a £1.2bn dividend in 2005, to plug the pension fund’s shortfall. The family agreed to contribute £100m of additional funds earlier this year as part of a deal with the regulator and signed over security on property assets, but the scheme is still thought likely to be short of funds. In 2017 Green agreed to put £363m into the pension fund for BHS, which he had sold for £1 in 2015 only for it to collapse a year later. Stephen Timms MP, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: “There is unquestionably a moral case for the Green family to do the right thing and guarantee Arcadia’s hardworking staff what is rightfully theirs, whatever happens this Christmas. But the Pensions Regulator must also ensure that it is doing everything in its power to fight the corner of the pension scheme members. “This is a crucial moment for the regulator to show that it has learned the lessons of previous corporate collapses, such as those of BHS and British Steel.” ",business
"For as long as Anna-Jane Casey can remember she has spent the run-up to Christmas on the stage in the West End. But this year Casey is joining a growing army of workers from Covid-blighted industries to deliver an unprecedented volume of parcels across the UK. “It’s gone bonkers. Last week both myself and my husband were doing 180 to 200 parcels a day,” she said. “People are so lovely when they get their things but I want to scream in their faces ‘stop ordering stuff’!” Casey, 48, who has appeared in shows including Chicago and Billy Elliot, and her husband, who is also an actor, were forced to search for work when all the theatres closed in March. “I have a mortgage and two children to support. I have responsibilities,” she said. “What do you do when your earnings have literally gone? We had to find work where we could.” Home deliveries are one of the few growth sectors of the struggling British economy. The pandemic has accelerated existing trends, with more people than ever ordering goods and groceries online, while delivery companies and supermarkets strain to keep up with demand. The latest figures collated by internet industry body IMRG show online sales are up by more than a half in the middle of November from the same point last year. “It will be a record-breaking Christmas online - though retail overall will have a tough period,” said Andy Mulcahy, IMRG director. Online groceries sales now account for 13% of all food sales, up from 7.4% in March. Analysis by Metapack, which provides software linking most of the country’s high-street brands, including John Lewis and M&S, with hundreds of delivery firms, reveals the parcel volumes going through its systems last week are 70% higher than the corresponding week in 2019. “We are having an online Christmas,” says Bruce Fair, Metapack executive. “The combination of another lockdown and a sustained shift in the behaviour of consumers is creating a peak wave.” He adds the top four carriers in the UK – Yodel, Royal Mail, Hermes and DPD – have already reached capacity and are not taking on new customers. Delivery companies have responded to the online boom by hiring thousands of new drivers, often from the parts of the economy hardest hit by the pandemic. DPD is recruiting 3,500 new drivers and Hermes is taking on 9,000 new self-employed couriers, who can opt into holiday pay contracts negotiated with the GMB union. “We have seen an increase in couriers from hospitality, aviation, retail and the arts,” said a Hermes spokesperson. “Courier work suits lots of people because it is so flexible, it becomes a great lifestyle choice.” Recruitment agency, Manpower, has placed 3,000 new drivers in the last few months, with an estimated 30% turning to driving because of the pandemic. Jason Greaves, Manpower’s brand leader, says: “This year, entrants to the driving labour market are from a much broader range of sectors than normal; former cabin crew, publicans, live music support crew to name just a few.” Delivery firm Yodel has recruited 2,950 drivers and seen a 200% increase in applications for its seasonal jobs. “Demand for our seasonal jobs has always been high but this year we’ve been inundated, says Mike Hancox, boss of Yodel CEO. However, unions argue that many of these new jobs are self-employed franchises where drivers have to pay for their own vehicles and cannot claim sick pay. Matthew Draper, Unite’s logistics organiser, said the bulk of the new jobs were precarious, with no guarantees about work levels or income in the long term: “It’s great the parcel sector is a growth industry but many of these jobs are insecure. Companies should be creating full-time, secure jobs.” Mick Rix, GMB organiser, said workers were being cheated. “Apart from those employed by Royal Mail and a few couriers in some companies, 90% are so-called self-employed, either using their own vehicles, providing their own insurance, taking all the risk,” he said. “That is why other companies’ parcel distribution costs are cheaper than Royal Mail. They are not paying employment costs and the rest of the package that would go with employing people.” Casey and her husband are classed as self-employed. They used the last of their savings to buy a £3,000 second-hand Vauxhall Vivaro van and have been making deliveries across Kent since June. “We are hanging on by our fingernails, covering our costs,” she said. “We get paid £1 per parcel but out of that we’ve got to insure our van, pay for our petrol, put away for tax, as well as provide for our children and keep our house going.” She is also worried about falling ill. “We’ve been around hundreds and hundreds of people. Thankfully Covid has not got us but if it does and we can’t go to work, then we don’t earn,” she said. “We are praying we don’t get ill.” According to Equity, which represents people working in the arts, 40% of its members have had no financial support from the government’s furlough or self-employed grant schemes. They have either been forced on to universal credit or taken work outside the industry. “Those seeking work in other sectors such as logistics are disproportionately more likely to be from working-class backgrounds or marginalised groups. The end result will be an ever more elitist creative industry,” said Paul Fleming, Equity general secretary. Arts workers are not the only ones dropping off parcels or supermarket shopping. Bill Stephens worked for many years in the oil and gas industry until Covid hit. “I tested subsea valves. There has been a decline however and the pandemic sealed the future of the company I was working for and sadly they had to let over 70% of the workforce go,” he said. “I do miss it – I miss the salary.” Stephens, not his real name, is now working full-time as a driver on a minimum 20 hours-a-week contract. “I wanted to be kept busy and it was a job that interested me and was easily available. I also thought it would be something I could always return to in the future [and it] looks like there will always be a need for delivery drivers.” Wasim Salam teaches English, maths and IT in a private Bristol college helping vulnerable adults and the unemployed gain qualifications but he has been forced to take four other part-time jobs, including delivering for a major supermarket, to support his family during the pandemic. “Tesco is the only place that is booming at the moment. They just can’t keep up. It is very busy,” he said. “We’ve had a range of people joining the workforce, including builders and actors. Like myself it’s not something any of us wanted to do. It’s not something we see a professional future in but Covid has made us do all kinds of jobs that we wouldn’t otherwise do.” The relentless routine has left Salam, 44, with barely enough time to see his wife and three children or wider family. “When I was full-time and teaching, I had a better quality of life,” he said. “I’m not able to spend the time I would like with my family. I’m always rushed on the phone. “Nobody seems to know me any more. I feel completed exhausted and completely out of touch.”",business
"Caffè Nero has rejected a takeover bid by the billionaire brothers behind EG Group, a chain of petrol stations, as the struggling cafe chain insisted it would continue with a separate restructuring process.  Caffè Nero on Monday revealed that the last-minute offer had been rejected because Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who are also in the process of buying Asda, had not engaged with the company and did not understand its financial situation. The EG Group founders wrote to Caffè Nero at the weekend to offer to buy the chain from its founder and main shareholder, Gerry Ford. The business has 800 cafes and employs more than 6,000 people in the UK. Under the EG Group proposal, which was first reported by Sky News, EG would have paid in full the rent owed to Caffè Nero’s landlords in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Like other hospitality firms, the chain has been hammered by the forced closure of the business during the first Covid-19 lockdown and the conversion to a takeaway-only business in parts of the UK through the autumn. The firm, which owns 650 Caffè Nero-branded stores, 40 Harris + Hoole cafes and 100 Coffee#1 sites, appointed KPMG in September to help it negotiate rent cuts with its landlords. Landlords are due to vote on a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) later on Monday – a form of insolvency that allows retailers to reduce rent and shut shops. Results of the vote, which ends at midnight on Monday, are expected on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement on Monday evening Caffè Nero said the “clear intention” of the bid was “to disrupt the CVA process currently under way as a precursor to opportunistically acquiring the company at a later date”. It added that a takeover would be unlikely to be completed because it would need the support of lenders. Caffè Nero said the CVA proposals would allow it “to withstand the devastating impact of the current pandemic, and any further subsequent lockdowns, and emerge strongly to regain previous trading momentum once restrictions are lifted”. Caffè Nero added that it had tweaked the terms of the CVA so that landlords will receive their full rent arrears if EG Group does later manage to take over the cafe chain. The Issa brothers, from Blackburn in Lancashire, made their fortunes building EG Group (founded in 2001 as Euro Garages) into a big business that runs 6,000 filling stations in Europe, the US and Australia. It has partnerships with Starbucks and KFC. Backed by the private equity firm TDR Capital, the billionaire brothers are buying Leeds-based Asda, Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain, from the US retail giant Walmart for £6.8bn. Walmart will retain a minority stake. However, questions were raised over EG Group’s finances when its auditor Deloitte suddenly quit in October, reportedly because of governance concerns, and was replaced by KPMG. EG Group posted revenues of €20bn (£18bn) and a pretax loss of €82m last year. Caffè Nero was founded in 1997 by Ford as an Italian-style coffee chain in London. Before the pandemic, it had more than 1,000 cafes in the UK and 10 other countries ranging from the US and Sweden to Oman, and served 135m customers a year. Ford, who is also chief executive of the chain, recently said that Caffè Nero had worked hard to adapt to the situation by expanding its coffee at home range, launching click and collect via its app and offering a delivery service through Uber Eats. EG Group declined to comment on the bid’s rejection.",business
"Financial markets are braced for a plunge in the pound and a sharp fall in UK company share prices if a no-deal Brexit is triggered on Sunday evening. As the chances of a deal appeared to fade, the pound came under renewed selling pressure on Friday, falling by more than 1% against the dollar as post-Brexit trade talks enter a crunch weekend. Sterling was heading for its worst week since September, slipping to a low of about $1.3135, before recovering slightly after Germany’s foreign minister suggested that negotiations could possibly continue beyond the Sunday deadline. The FTSE 100 tumbled by 0.8%, ending the week down at 6,546. Analysts warned that ending the talks on Sunday without a deal would trigger a fresh sell-off, which could sink the currency close to parity with the dollar, and a rout in UK company share prices when the London stock market reopens on Monday morning. “If we get a hard Brexit on Sunday evening the market will be shocked,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. Shares in UK company shares could fall by as much as 7%, he said, led by bank stocks. “Market participants are used to politicians reaching a deal in the last minute, but the UK and EU are far from each other in terms of reaching a trade agreement.” Faced with the prospect of a no-deal departure crystallising on Sunday evening, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley warned the UK-focused FTSE 250, which tracks the value of the UK’s largest 250 companies outside of the FTSE 100, could fall by as much as 10%. Share prices in big UK banks would plunge by up to 20%, it said, because the Bank of England might respond to a no-deal departure with negative interest rates to cushion the economic fallout from disruption at UK ports from 31 December. Under the policy of negative rates, Threadneedle Street would cut its base rate from a record low level of 0.1% to below zero, meaning commercial banks would need to pay interest to place deposits with the central bank. Although designed to encourage lending to the economy, experts warn it would hit banks’ profits and could undermine financial stability. Morgan Stanley said most economic forecasters had factored in some kind of free trade deal from the start of January, meaning a no-deal Brexit “would represent a genuine and negative ‘surprise’ that markets are likely underprepared for” that could cause severe turbulence. The Bank of England warned on Friday that failure to agree a deal before the end of the Brexit transition could unleash volatility in financial markets and disruption for customers of UK and EU banks. Threadneedle Street said that Britain’s biggest banks were adequately prepared to withstand any shocks that could be triggered by the end of the transition at 11pm on 31 December, when UK access to the single market and customs union expires. It said UK banks could sustain losses of £200bn while continuing to operate safely – far higher than the expected economic fallout of no-deal Brexit and the Covid crisis. “However, financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise,” the Bank warned. Publishing its regular financial stability report, the Bank said large UK firms were generally well prepared to continue making cross-border payments. However, it said there was less clarity about the progress of EU companies. “To the extent that gaps remain at the end of the transition period, they are likely to result in some disruption to both EU and UK customers and businesses.” The pound fell by about 10% after the EU referendum in 2016 and has remained low on the global currency markets since, reflecting the uncertainty for the economy over the UK’s post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU. Trevor Greetham, the head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, said much of the bad news was already factored into the currency this time around, but that sterling could still tumble by 5% in a no-deal scenario. “We are hopeful, though not confident, that a political compromise will be found to enable trade UK-EU talks to continue beyond the weekend but it would be rash to base an investment strategy on the basis of one outcome or the other. Both of the arrangements under consideration reduce the growth prospects for the UK economy,” he said.",business
"Forget nut roast, or boring old vegetable wellington. From so-called “veganettone” to sticky toffee pudding and even meat-free whole “no turkey” crowns, retailers and food manufacturers are pulling out all the stops to offer a dizzying range of plant-based options for the traditional Christmas spread. As research reveals that more than one in four Britons plan to eat more vegan food at Christmas this year, supermarkets are reporting strong sales of alternatives to festive staples, with some “limited edition” alternatives to the turkey centrepiece already selling out. Tesco is tempting taste buds with a record 10 plant-based “centrepieces” – up from six last year – including its new Wicked Kitchen “no turkey roast crown”, which has already sold out online. Derek Sarno, a US chef and self-proclaimed “plant pusher” hired by the supermarket as its “director of plant-based innovation” to overhaul and bolster the entire range, said: “It looks like turkey, carves like turkey and even tastes like it. It has taken us two years to bring this to market and it’s the first of its kind, and what I believe will be a game-changer for the industry. Made of wheat protein and soy, we also worked with a specialist flavour house to create a natural plant-base turkey flavouring that gives the full experience of the real thing.” According to research carried out for the Vegan Society, 26% of Britonsplan to eat more plant-based foods this Christmas, continuing the trend of eating less meat during lockdown. That reflects people paying closer attention to what they eat on health and environmental grounds, with increasing numbers adopting “flexitarian” diets – cutting down on meat and dairy while eating more plant-based foods. Waitrose says pre-orders of vegan Christmas foods are up by 700% comparedwith last year while searches on Waitrose.com for “vegan cheese” increased by 76% on the same period in 2019. Its Vegan Festive Filo Swirls are proving a popular main dish,. It is also is offering the first supermarket dairy-free vegan fondue. Charlotte McCarthy, vegan buyer at Waitrose said: “We anticipate this Christmas will be the biggest ever for vegan food. We’ve worked really hard to ensure that there is an exciting range available for our customers that is delicious, whether they follow a vegan diet or not.” The grocery chain Planet Organic has recently expanded its online business to go fully nationwide, with a new website allowing customers to shop by ‘‘lifestyle” – gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, vegetarian and vegan – with the last category enjoying highest online traffic. Shoppers have a choice of nine different Christmas hampers, three of which are specifically branded as vegan (vegan snack attack, vegan chocolate lover and ultimate vegan) and together account for more than half of all hamper sales. Within its general seasonal range the overall best-seller is veganettone; vegan panettones made using traditional sourdough starters and leavening techniques, but without butter and egg yolks. Montezuma’s dairy-free “Like no udder” chocolate bars are also flying off the shelves. Al Overton, Planet Organic’s buying director, said: “Countless Christmas vegan items are selling well, including dairy-free chocolate and cheese platters, Christmas cakes and wine; traditional items made to vegan recipes so nobody has to miss out. The seitan roast – an alternative to turkey – has recently sold out, as has the truffle and mushroom faux gras pate, but there will be more available at least a week before Christmas.” Lakeland said it had sold 65% more vegan hampers in October than last year as customers shopped earlier, and while now sold out online they are still available in store. Marks & Spencer is rolling out more than 30 new vegan foods for Christmas under its Plant Kitchen brand in its biggest festive collection to date. Its Plant Kitchen vegan festive wreath – named BBC Good Food’s best vegan main course at this year’s Christmas Taste awards – goes on sale in stores next week; a pastry main course stuffed with roasted mushrooms and chestnuts and topped with a cranberry and orange glaze. M&S said its Plant Kitchen frozen sticky toffee pudding – launched last month – was now selling three times as much as the standard dessert. Its plant-based frozen party food range now accounts for 30% of its frozen party food sales, with the top-selling line its mini “no chicken” kievs.",business
"Before the pandemic hit, 34-year-old Andrew Perry of New Orleans worked in bars and did live sound engineering for shows. But now, with venues closed, Perry has struggled to find another job, even at minimum wage, while his unemployment benefits have been reduced to just $90 per week. He’s worrying about losing his home. The temporary federal moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on residential evictions is set to expire on 31 December, leaving millions of Americans like Perry at risk of being evicted from their homes even as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to rise. An estimated 12.4 million individual adult renters have reported they are behind on rent payments, based on the latest US census survey data, while nearly 83 million adults have reported struggling to afford expenses for basic necessities such as rent, mortgage, food, car payments, medical expenses or student loans in the past seven days. According to Moody’s Analytics, nearly 12 million renters in the US will owe an average of $5,850 in rent and utilities by January. Perry’s landlord has already given notice they will evict him from his apartment when the CDC eviction moratorium ends. “I had to sell my car for a fraction of the asking price so I could keep the power and water on in my house. I can’t afford new clothes or shoes for winter. I’m not eating three times a day,” said Perry. “I don’t see an end to this any time soon, and with no stimulus being announced, I’m starting to wonder if I will lose everything and be homeless again, the last time after Hurricane Katrina in 2006.” The CDC moratorium on evictions is limited, and based on income eligibility and inability to pay rent. Landlords have continued to file eviction cases to be implemented once the moratorium ends and have engaged in other tactics to try to force those who are behind on rent out of their homes. “There are holes and flaws in the order, and renters are suffering because of those flaws,” said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Yentel said the moratorium is not automatic and requires tenants to take action to be eligible for protections under it, but she said the federal government has done little to inform renters or enforce the moratorium’s protections, while rental assistance programs are widely depleted or non-existent. “Rent is still due, and that rent is accruing along with utility bills and, in many cases, fees and penalties landlords are charging. That is why it is essential the eviction moratorium be paired with substantial emergency rental assistance,” Yentel added. Dess Reign of Greensboro, North Carolina, just gave birth to her second child, but is currently facing eviction, even as her landlord refused to accept payments from North Carolina’s Housing Opportunities and Prevention of Evictions (Hope) program. She lost her job as a call center representative when the pandemic hit in March, but it took until July to start receiving her first unemployment payments. When her initial unemployment benefits expired, her transition to pandemic unemployment assistance was initially denied and she’s still in the process of appealing it. Meanwhile, she hasn’t received any income since October. “This system has completely failed us,” said Reign. “Nobody cares about the people in need. Landlords don’t care about evicting families, especially people with kids, and it’s sad. I have no family here. Where would I go if I get evicted with a newborn and a two-year-old?” In St Augustine, Florida, Nicole Strunk and her husband have been in and out of court with their landlord, who managed to obtain a writ of possession on their home for 1 January, when the CDC moratorium ends. Strunk, who lost her job as a restaurant server when the pandemic hit, is still trying to obtain back pay owed to her from unemployment during the first few months of the pandemic, and recently claimed her last week of unemployment benefits that have now expired. Her husband lost his job in construction in June, and only receives $125 a week in pandemic unemployment assistance, which is set to expire on 26 December. “What we’re figuring will happen is we’ll be served with the 48 hours’ notice to surrender the property, then store our belongings if we can,” said Strunk. “Then we’ll break our hearts by giving up our pup to a shelter, where he probably has no chance of survival due to his health issues, and we’ll live in our car, which is 26 years old, until something changes. That’s what we’re facing now.” Kerrie Welch of Trenton, New Jersey, a mother of a four-year-old, lost her job in food service when the pandemic started. Her unemployment benefits pay just $231 a week now, and she hasn’t been able to find another job. She missed rent in November, and her landlord has told her he intends to file for eviction when the CDC moratorium expires. “We will be homeless as soon as the CDC moratorium expires,” Welch said, who can’t afford to give her daughter Christmas gifts this year. “I had to draw a Christmas tree on the wall. How do I explain to my daughter I had nothing – nothing – to offer? It’s terrible and no one cares.” In Wisconsin, Chris Donahoe, litigation and advocacy director of Legal Action Wisconsin, explained dozens of families have been evicted in the Milwaukee area despite the federal moratorium. “They not only face all the collateral damage, the further descent into poverty, families being separated, school districts changing, but it also means they are at significant risk of contracting Covid,” she said. A recent study published by researchers led by Dr Kathryn Leifheit at UCLA found over 10,000 deaths and as many as 433,700 coronavirus cases were caused by evictions from the beginning of the pandemic to early September, when the CDC eviction moratorium was enacted. “Without further eviction moratoriums or rental assistance, families will have no options. It will be the middle of winter, in the worst stages of this pandemic, and they will be out on the streets, with an eviction on their record,” added Donahoe.",business
"BDO, one of the UK’s leading accountancy firms, is refusing to pay back £4.5m in furlough money it received from taxpayers despite paying its 264 partners an average of £518,000 each. In total the company paid its partners £137m. Paul Eagland, the firm’s managing partner, said there had been a “moral debate” at the firm about whether or not to pay the money back, but that the firm believed it had a greater responsibility “to invest in jobs”. Eagland said the furlough money BDO received early on in the pandemic had helped the company save 700 people from possible redundancy. He said BDO partners had also taken a hit, as their pay had fallen from an average of £602,000 they collected a year earlier. BDO rivals Deloitte and PWC did not receive any money from the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, also known as the furlough scheme. But BDO did take advantage of the emergency funding to subsidise the pay of 450 first-year recruits and 250 administrators. BDO received £2.7m of furlough support in its financial year to June 2020, and the firm said it had received £4.7m in total. He said the firm had topped up furloughed staff’s wages to 100% and had not made anyone redundant. In a statement, Eagland said: “The government took bold action with its emergency funding measures which undoubtedly saved many jobs and businesses across the UK. We would ask the government to ensure future policies also support mid-sized businesses, which are vital to the UK but can be overlooked and undervalued despite providing around one in three UK private sector jobs.” Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “It’s pretty shameful for an organisation to take millions of pounds of public money while paying such vast sums to its senior management. “The defence that they need it to protect jobs is risible when a small sacrifice from each partner would comfortably cover the costs of repayment, and would still leave the partners earning over £500,000 a year, putting them comfortably inside the top 0.1% of UK earners.” BDO reported a £25m decline in underlying profits to £137m for the year to June. It blamed the drop in profits on the pandemic. Under the coronavirus job retention scheme the government paid 80% of furloughed staff’s wages up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. The amount paid was reduced from August, but then increased again at the time of the second national lockdown in November. The total cost of the scheme to the taxpayer was £43bn by the middle of November.",business
"Britain’s largest banks will be allowed to restart limited dividend payments and banker bonuses in the new year, after regulators determined that lenders were strong enough to weather the remainder of the Covid pandemic. The Bank of England said on Thursday it was lifting a temporary ban on shareholder payouts, but warned that dividends distributed for full-year 2020 should be capped, and that cash bonuses for bankers would be closely scrutinised in light of continued uncertainty. “Notwithstanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy, banks remain well-capitalised and are expected to be able to continue to support the real economy through this period of disruption,” the central bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) said. It comes more than eight months after the central bank ordered lenders to scrap nearly £8bn worth of dividend payouts due for the 2019 financial year in light of the Covid crisis. It also ordered banks to pause dividend payments throughout 2020, and put a temporary halt on share buybacks and cash bonuses for executives. The Bank of England said it was easing the dividend ban on Thursday, after putting the banks through two separate stress tests that proved the sector was “resilient”, even in severe economic scenarios. Lenders have now been urged to limit payouts to either 25% of profits over 2019 and 2020 combined, excluding previous dividend payments, or 0.2% of the value of their riskiest assets, whichever is highest. “Expect a high bar for justifying any exceptions,” the PRA said. Banks were also warned that the regulator would be paying close attention to bonus payouts in the new year. The PRA said it expected firms to “exercise a high degree of caution and prudence in determining the size of any cash bonuses granted to senior staff given the uncertain outlook and the need for banks to deploy capital to support the wider economy”. It added: “The PRA will scrutinise proposed payouts closely to ensure large banks have applied the PRA’s rigorous remuneration regime in an appropriate fashion.” The regulator explained it was otherwise up to bank boardrooms to determine the size of dividend payments covering the 2020 financial year onwards. The announcement will be welcome news for bank shareholders, who expect regular income from dividend payments. Major lenders including NatWest and HSBC previously said they would restart payouts as soon as possible after regulators lifted the ban. Bank share prices have plunged this year in light of the Covid crisis and dividend ban. NatWest shares have tumbled 34% since the start of 2020, while Barclays lost 23%, Lloyds has dropped 44% and HSBC shares have fallen 32%. Eurozone banks are still waiting for a decision on dividend payouts from the European Central Bank, which has urged lenders to halt dividend payments and share buybacks until at least 1 January 2021.

"The UK’s largest listed financial firms have handed their board members a near-80% pay rise since 2009, prompting shareholder advisers and high pay campaigners to call for greater transparency on director fees. Data gathered by the Guardian shows median pay for the three highest earning non-executive directors (NEDs) in each of the FTSE 100’s 17 financial firms surged from £90,700 in 2009 to £162,000 in 2019. It means board members overseeing the UK’s largest banks, insurance and investment firms are earning 79% more than they did a decade earlier, despite being in part-time roles. The largest increases have been at Lloyds Banking Group, where top NEDs are earning 257% more than in 2009; the London Stock Exchange Group, where there has been a 219% rise; and investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, where fees have jumped 170%. Headhunters said the rise was partly due to strict regulations introduced after the financial crisis, which meant NEDs had to keep closer tabs on operations, and take greater responsibility when things went wrong. However, there is no precedent for UK NEDs having their pay docked for company misconduct. The insurance company Aviva is considering clawing back director pay after a row over how it announced a plan to cancel its preference shares in 2018, but blame for corporate failures has historically been laid at the feet of company executives. It is also difficult to confirm directors’ workloads beyond what is disclosed in annual reports. Data suggests the highest-paid NEDs were attending just five more committee and board meetings a year in 2019 than they did in 2009, with the median number of meetings now sitting at 26 compared with 21 a decade earlier. The busiest among them sat through 48 meetings last year. Reacting to the Guardian research, the High Pay Centre thinktank and influential shareholder adviser PIRC called for more detailed information about top earners like NEDs, whose ballooning fees have flown under the radar over the past decade. While criticism has been aimed at multimillion-pound pay packages granted to company executives in recent years, the High Pay Centre said some board members were already earning more than 99% of the UK workforce, despite committing just a fraction of the hours. “On balance, NED pay should require greater scrutiny, expecting the same rigour as executive pay and linked to demonstrable peer-group benchmarking in terms of fees, workload and meetings and items discussed,” said Francesco Navarrini, PIRC’s head of research. He said companies should consider the pay ratio between NEDs and a company’s rank-and-file employees when considering further pay rises. NEDs at financial firms could face greater pressure over fee transparency, since they are earning significantly more than their UK peers. On average, NEDs at financial firms are now earning £210,019 a year, which is more than double the average £99,139 earned by NEDs across all of the UK’s 150 largest listed firms, according to separate figures gathered by headhunter Spencer Stuart, which did not include median pay. While the median captures the middle of the range, the mean or average captures the typical figure when dividing fees equally between the entire group. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “Paying out such lucrative sums for part-time work does create a damaging public perception of directorships and the way businesses are run, and potentially attracts people to the roles for the wrong reasons.” “Pay for high earners, particularly in financial services, amounts to a significant cost for businesses, and there should probably be more detailed disclosure requirements on what companies are spending on those making six figures and upwards,” he added. Board members are usually paid a so-called base fee but earn extra money for sitting on key committees that help decide executive pay, oversee financial reporting and governance. Both have jumped over the past decade, with base fees rising by nearly 20% to £75,000 on a median basis. Committee membership earned NEDs 55% more in 2019 than a decade earlier, while chairing those committees will mean pocketing 71% more in fees. While none of the financial company NEDs from 2009 are still in their post – owing to a nine-year-limit – many serving on financial services boards have seen their fees double or triple during their tenure. Among them are HSBC’s board member Heidi Miller, who has received a 204% pay rise from £206,000 to £627,000 over four years, after she was appointed as non-executive chair of HSBC’s North American operations – earning her an extra £431,000. Meanwhile, NatWest’s Frank Dangeard has seen his pay rise 91% from £138,000 to £264,000 since 2017, having since taken over as chair of the group’s investment bank NatWest Markets. However, NatWest does not break down his fees. While a handful of NEDs included in the data do hold additional non-executive roles within their businesses like Dangeard and Miller, not all firms will disclose how much they are paid for each position, strengthening the argument for further transparency and more rigorous standards around NED fees. Jenni Hibbert, a global managing partner at executive search firm Heidrick and Struggles, said directors put in more time than is disclosed in company reports. She estimated that NEDs for complex, FTSE 100 financial firms will usually be putting in about 80 to 100 days a year, including time spent preparing for meetings and getting to know the business. “We have to remember that being a NED is a huge responsibility – the Companies Act does not differentiate between an executive and a non-executive director when it comes to fiduciary responsibilities,” Hibbert said. “An NED is therefore required to take the same level of care as an executive, and they cannot do this by just turning up to board meetings – it takes many hours of reading, investigating and getting under the skin of things, to do their job well.” But with roughly 250 working days a year, NEDs are still working part-time while earning significantly more than most employees within the business. “Many financial services firms paying six-figure sums to their NEDs will also have low-paid staff in branches, call centres or administrative roles struggling to make ends meet,” Hildyard said. “The UK should be debating what we could do more generally to achieve a more even income distribution.”",business
"It is known throughout the world as a byword for security. But the Bank of England is evidently a tad unclear on the whereabouts of £50bn of banknotes, and it doesn’t seem to be overly concerned about it, a powerful group of MPs has said. In a stiff rebuke for Threadneedle Street, the Commons public accounts committee said the money – equivalent to a stack of £5 notes more than 800 miles high – had essentially gone “missing” because the Bank did not keep close enough tabs on cash usage in modern Britain. Despite walls 8ft thick and an imposing reputation for guarding billions of pounds of gold bars in its vaults, the PAC said the Bank had nonetheless displayed a “lax attitude to whereabouts of bulk of sterling cash supply”. However, banknotes by their very design are not traceable, making it hard for the Bank to follow the money and know exactly where its notes end up. According to a report from the National Audit Office, there are about £50bn worth of issued banknotes that may be being used overseas or in the UK, a tiny fraction of the trillions of pounds in money circulating in the UK economy in physical notes and by digital transfers. The PAC speculated that this money could be stashed away under mattresses as unreported household savings, may have been taken abroad, or used in the shadow economy. “The Bank of England doesn’t know,” it said. The value of banknotes in circulation has shot up this year, which the Bank has said is probably because more people started hoarding cash during the Covid-19 pandemic in case they needed it. Coin use has declined over recent years, with the production of new pennies and pounds by the Royal Mint falling by about 65% in the last decade, a trend that could be accelerated by the pandemic as more people move to using contactless debit card payments. Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC, said: “£50bn of sterling notes – or about three-quarters of this precious and dwindling supply – is stashed somewhere but the Bank of England doesn’t know where, who by, or what for, and doesn’t seem very curious. “It needs to be more concerned about where the missing £50bn is. Depending where it is and what it’s being used for, that amount of money could have material implications for public policy and the public purse. The Bank needs to get a better handle on the national currency it controls.” A spokesman for the Bank said: “It is the responsibility of the Bank of England to meet public demand for banknotes. The Bank has always met that demand and will continue to do so. Members of the public do not have to explain to the Bank why they wish to hold banknotes. This means that banknotes are not missing.”",business

"Lloyds Banking Group is redeploying 700 staff into full-time homeworking roles from 2021, in the latest sign that big banks are embracing remote working even as vaccines put the end of Covid restrictions in sight. The UK’s largest domestic lender – which has 50,000 of its 65,000 employees working from home because of the outbreak – temporarily shifted about 1,000 workers from Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland branches to customer service teams, in order to cope with a surge in demand in areas such as telephone banking and video chats during the outbreak. The Guardian understands about 700 staff will be permanently moved, making it the largest tranche of Lloyds workers to ever be shifted into homeworking roles full-time. “All colleagues will need to be able to work from home for the customer services role,” Lloyds documents explained. Staff may still be asked to travel into an office for special events or occasional team meetings, including with their remotely based line managers. However, the bank warned: “Your eligibility to meet the criteria needed to work from home will need to be met on an ongoing basis, please consider this carefully when making your preference.” Lloyds documents said it presented “opportunities for colleagues to help better manage their work-life balance.” It also means staff will not have to live near one of Lloyds’ call centres in cities including Leeds, Liverpool or Belfast, in order to apply for any of the roles. Lloyds is among the 75% of City firms reviewing their real estate footprint after the boom in homeworking during the pandemic. Barclays also confirmed this summer that it was reviewing the amount of office space it uses after seeing how 30,000 of its 50,000 UK staff had been able to work from home effectively during the crisis. NatWest has told employees that 50,000 of its roughly 60,000 staff will continue working from home until at least April, when it plans to allow for more flexible working. In the meantime, the bank is developing an app that will allow whole teams to book seating when they want to come into the office – rather than dedicating entire floors to certain divisions. The London-headquartered lender Standard Chartered is also shifting to flexible working on a permanent basis. It followed a pan-bank review of all jobs that showed 80% across the business are suitable for “hybrid” working. Staff will be able to formally apply for their preferred way of working, starting in early 2021. That will apply to its 2,000 staff in London – where about 10% of staff have been going into the office since the coronavirus hit. Some big banks such as JP Morgan – which has 19,000 employees in the UK – have raised concerns about the impact of homeworking, including the lack of mentoring for young staff, and a small drop in productivity on Mondays and Fridays. However, the Wall Street lender is still expecting up to 30% of its almost 257,000 global employees to work remotely in future, at least part of the time. One of the Lloyds Banking Group’s staff unions, Accord, welcomed plans to redeploy branch staff to homeworking customer service roles, saying it would help save jobs. Lloyds has announced about 2,000 staff cuts since September as part of its restructuring programme. “Working from home in the long term isn’t suitable for everybody but we’ll work to ensure that there are support services in place to help everybody to make a success of this positive initiative,” Accord said. It is understood that some of those staff may eventually be allowed to work from the office part-time, depending on their circumstances and how government guidance evolves in the long term. A Lloyds spokesperson said it was shifting staff in response to customer behaviour. “We are asking our branch colleagues if they would like to make a move from their branch role to one in our customer services teams. This means we can have the right amount of support in the areas our customers want it.”",business
"Gyms, crazy golf, student flats, hotels or even a whisky-based tourist attraction: the future of many department store sites is unlikely to involve shopping. More than 200 of them are now empty or closing next year, and property experts say the shift will prompt a reinvention of malls and town centres on a scale not seen since the postwar years. Last week’s decision to wind down Debenhams is likely to see the closure of 124 stores – or just over a million square metres of retail floor space – in England and Wales. That’s the equivalent of 148 Premier League football pitches seeking a new purpose, according to property advisory firm Altus Group. Before the latest closures, Debenhams had already shut more than 40 stores in the past two years. Meanwhile, at least 11 House of Fraser sites have closed since August 2018, and more are expected to bring down the shutters next year. John Lewis has also recently closed eight outlets: half of these were full-scale department stores and are now standing empty. That, in turn, followed the collapse of the Beales chain, which left its 22 stores vacant. Only one has since reopened. “This is apocalyptic. We are going to see the biggest change in urban grain [the pattern of streets] since the second world war,” said Mark Robinson, chair of the government-backed High Streets Task Force. “Department stores have supported the footfall that drives people through the doors. We are going to have to evolve a whole new way of looking at the purpose of towns and centres,” said Robinson. There will be no single solution. What works in Hull will not suit High Wycombe. “Putting a chi-chi food market like Altrincham’s in every department store is not the answer,” said Robinson. “Public consultation is key. You have to look for the answer within places and take local communities with you.” A look at what happened to BHS’s 164-strong chain, which collapsed in 2016, highlights the scale of the challenge. Four years after its demise, just over a quarter of former BHS stores remain empty, according to analysis by the Local Data Company. Less than half continue to trade as large stores and the remaining 30% have been redeveloped – either by demolishing or completely rebuilding the interior, splitting them into smaller stores or merging them into neighbouring buildings. Primark took on about five stores, B&M and Sports Direct took on three each, while others now house TK Maxx, Metro Bank or H&M. In 2020, there are likely to be few retail takers for large stores. Chains such as Marks & Spencer and Next are also closing outlets, while Primark has largely completed its UK estate. Some department stores will switch to leisure use, such as cinemas. The former BHS on Oxford Street, for example, has been split into a Swingers golf centre, a food hall and the UK’s first outlet for Reserved, a Polish fashion brand. In Reading, Hammerson has won planning permission to turn a House of Fraser outlet into a food hall, bowling alley and crazy golf course. Edinburgh’s House of Fraser on Princes Street is being developed by drinks firm Diageo into a tourist attraction promoting Johnnie Walker whisky. Several other House of Fraser outlets, including those in Birmingham, Lincoln and Exeter, are set to become hotels alongside shops and offices, as is Debenhams in Manchester. West London’s Westfield shopping centre has permission to turn two-thirds of a House of Fraser into a co-working space, while at least one department store in Bristol may become student accommodation. Elsewhere, local authorities may play a more central role in reinventing the space for civic amenities such as health centres, nursery schools or libraries, if the cash can be found. In Folkestone, one option for the former Debenhams site, which has been bought by the local authority, is a mix of retirement homes and a healthcare centre alongside leisure facilities such as a cinema. Another part of the jigsaw will be homes. Where once they were citadels of shopping, out-of-town malls are now looking to reinvent themselves as new towns, with homes alongside retail and other services. At Lakeside in Thurrock, Essex, there is a plan to create more than 1,000 homes. Some authorities see an opportunity to use similar ideas to bring people back into city centres hit hard by the pandemic. David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisory firm Colliers, thinks that the landlords of three-quarters of Debenhams’ current sites will already have a plan for the future that may involve a mix of smaller stores and other uses. But some older stores may be harder to reinvent. The cost of stripping out asbestos is prohibitively expensive, and holds up refits or even demolition. For some, the answer could even be goingback to nature. In Stockton-on-Tees, the local authority is set to turn a moribund 1970s local shopping centre into a park, and a similar plan is now being floated in Nottingham.",business
"Ryanair has ordered a further 75 Boeing 737 Max planes worth up to $9bn (£6.7bn), defying aviation industry pessimism over coronavirus and concerns that the public may avoid the model due to safety fears. Europe’s biggest short-haul airline has now ordered a total of 210 of the aircraft that its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has described as a “gamechanger” for the carrier’s business model. The airline is likely to have negotiated a substantial saving on the planes. O’Leary said he obtained a “modest discount” on the fleet, as well as compensation for the delay in delivering the original order of the 737 Max, which was grounded after two crashes caused by its automated systems killed a total of 346 people. First deliveries of Ryanair’s 737-8-200 Max variant are expected in the spring, and O’Leary said he hoped to have up to 30 of the planes in service in time for the summer 2021 peak season. Speaking as the contract was formally signed in Washington DC, he said the Max was the “most scrutinised and audited aircraft in history”. He said the European regulator, Easa, had done an extraordinary review of all aspects of flight control systems, and all Ryanair pilots would have mandatory training on three Max simulators the airline had already bought and installed. “I cannot tell you how confident we are in the safety … Passengers are going to love it.” He dismissed the suggestion that many would avoid it on safety grounds, adding: “Any customer who doesn’t want to fly on the Max can offload and fly on the next NG, no problem.” The 737NG is an earlier variant of the aircraft that the airline operates. O’Leary said the Max was quieter, 16% more fuel efficient, and had more legroom than the current fleet, despite incorporating more seats per plane. “This aircraft is going to transform Ryanair’s future … our passengers will be travelling with lower fares and in more comfort. We believe the combination of vaccines and these new planes will lead us back into a period of growth.” Traffic has slumped since the pandemic but O’Leary forecast customer numbers would surpass the 149 million from 2019 by 2022, rising to 200 million customers annually by 2026. Ryanair’s order is the largest for the Max since 2018, before the disasters in Indonesia and Ethiopia resulted in the plane being withdrawn from service worldwide. IAG, the owner of British Airways, also made a public show of faith in the Max last year with a “letter of intent” to buy up to 200 of the model, at a substantial discount. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, certified the Max last month as safe to fly and other regulators around the world are expected to allow the plane back in the skies soon. Dave Calhoun, the president and chief executive of Boeing, said it was “gratified that Ryanair is once again placing its confidence in the Boeing 737 family”, and that it was focused on delivering delayed plane orders to the airline and others in the new year. He said: “We firmly believe in this airplane and we will continue the work to re-earn the trust of all of our customers.” Calhoun said it had been “one rough year” for the US aircraft manufacturer, but it had worked with regulators to “dot every i and cross every t” in examining the 737 Max, and was “utterly confident in the product”. The plane has been redesigned after investigators pointed to problems with sensors and the anti-stall software known as MCAS as causes of the Lion Air crash in October 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March 2019.",business
"Hopes that the world will bounce back from the ravages of coronavirus in the new year have been buoyed by strong growth in output from Asia’s huge manufacturing centres, led by an accelerating post-pandemic boom in China. China’s factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in a decade in November, a closely watched survey showed on Tuesday, in the latest sign that the world’s second-largest economy is recovering to pre-pandemic levels. China’s Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 54.9 from October’s 53.6, marking the highest level since November 2010. The gauge stayed well above the 50-level – which separates growth from contraction – for the seventh consecutive month. A steady recovery in global demand also helped Japan’s factory activity move a notch closer to stabilisation in November, while in South Korea the same metric grew at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI hit 49.0 in November, up from the previous month’s 48.7, and South Korea’s IHS Markit PMI rose to 52.9 in November.Factory activity also grew in Taiwan and Indonesia, a sign the pick-up in Chinese demand was underpinning the region’s economy. The strong showing of the region’s factories, allied to widespread optimism about the potential positive impact of Covid-19 vaccination programs in developed countries, also helped to boost stock markets fresh from the best November for 19 years. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.26% on Tuesday after closing the month 9% higher. Japan’s Nikkei was 0.9% higher on Tuesday while the Kospi index was up 1.4% in Seoul. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.72% higher on Tuesday, In Australia, the central bank held rates at near-zero amid signs the country’s easy monetary and fiscal policies have helped it weather the pandemic. Figures released on Tuesday showed that house prices, one of Australia’s favourite economic indicators, have begun to rise again, bringing the promise of greater consumer confidence and more building work. The benchmark ASX200 index was up more than 1%. “We’ve seen clearly a huge wave of liquidity coming to equities in response to the vaccine news and in response to US election news,” said Hamish Tadgell, a portfolio manager at SG Hiscock & Company. “But there are still risks, and as a result we could see the market pull back, I think, particularly as we come into sort of the Christmas period.” Capital Economics said that the boom in China could fade a little in the coming months, but it was expected that the government in Beijing would continue to offer plenty of policy stimulus while strong global demand for Chinese-made consumer goods also provided a good impetus. “In the near term, we think supportive fiscal policy and strong foreign demand should keep industrial growth robust,” said China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard in a note on Tuesday. “The economy is likely to remain above-trend in the coming months. Although Wall Street closed weaker on Monday as investors cashed in their November gains, the S&P500 looks set to start Tuesday up by 0.8%. In London the FTSE100 is expected to open up 0.56% at the bell after its best month since 1989. “There was profit taking around the world so we ended a record month with a whimper not a bang, and you know, taking a little bit of a breather,” said Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick. “I think that markets are pricing in, if not fully pricing a recovery, they are pricing in the vast majority of it [and] it’s very hard to meet these elevated expectations.” The US dollar was under pressure on Tuesday, after closing out its worst month since July with a little bounce and as investors anticipated that the US Federal Reserve would have to produce yet more monetary easing. Oil prices were slightly lower on uncertainty about whether the world’s major oil producers would agree to extend deep output cuts at talks this week. Brent crude futures were largely unchanged at $47.86.",business
"Britain’s manufacturers have enjoyed their best month in almost three years as firms cranked up production in case knife-edge Brexit trade talks with the EU ended in failure. The latest survey from IHS Markit/Cips found the industry was unaffected by November’s four-week lockdown in England, with output at its highest since December 2017. While large chunks of consumer-facing sectors of the economy were shut or heavily restricted last month, the latest purchasing managers’ index showed a strengthening of the manufacturing sector as factories stayed open. The final PMI rose from 53.7 points to 55.6 points in November and was higher than the flash estimate of 55.2 points published last month. It has now been above the 50 level indicating that the sector is growing for six months. Yet with only a month to go before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union, the report said many firms were seeking to insure themselves against a no-deal outcome by stockpiling raw materials and bringing forward export orders. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “Growth of the UK manufacturing sector picked up in November, temporarily boosted by ‘Brexit-buying’ among clients and the ongoing boost from economies reopening following lockdowns earlier in the year.” Dobson added that the boost to manufacturing had been concentrated among firms supplying other companies and from investment goods. Production of consumer goods had been weak due to low levels of confidence and rising unemployment.  “Whether the upturn of manufacturing production can be sustained into the new year is therefore highly uncertain, especially once the temporary boosts from Brexit purchasing and stockbuilding wane,” Dobson added. Fhaheen Khan, a senior economist at the manufacturers’ group Make UK, said the survey pointed to a continued, yet subdued expansion of the sector as orders slowly returned following the easing of restrictions. “It also appears the alarm bells that took hold of manufacturers just before the first EU-exit deadline have returned in some capacity as businesses sought to stockpile. While it may be rational in today’s uncertain environment, it is creating the impression that manufacturing is performing well just before the transition period ends. “It is clear the uncertainty is felt by both sides as EU manufacturers are also stockpiling to some degree resulting in a short-term boost to business for UK manufacturers too. However, such actions are generally followed by a period of depressed activity as manufacturers begin to service future orders using these very stockpiles.”",business
"The outgoing boss of Lloyds Banking Group is taking over as chairman at Credit Suisse, where he will deal with the fallout of the Swiss lender’s spying scandal. Credit Suisse announced on Tuesday it had chosen António Horta-Osório to replace chairman Urs Rohner, who promised to step down earlier this year after the bank ousted ex-chief executive Tidjane Thiam after the corporate espionage row. The 56-year-old Portuguese banker, who will take over in May, will face the challenge of boosting Credit Suisse’s image following the scandal, which has sent shockwaves through the country’s secretive banking industry and is being investigated by Swiss regulators. Credit Suisse admitted to hiring private detectives to track two of its executives last year. While it blamed – and sacked – its former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouée over both incidents, lawyers hired by Credit Suisse have reportedly uncovered two previous incidents in which the bank separately had staff followed in Asia and New York in 2017 and 2018. Credit Suisse said it does not condone spying on staff. “Due to the ongoing enforcement proceedings by [Swiss regulator] Finma, with which Credit Suisse has been cooperating since the beginning, we are not commenting further on the matter at this time.” Thiam’s ousting has also raised concerns about alleged discrimination in the Swiss banking sector. In one incident, Thiam, who was the only black boss of a big global bank, reportedly walked out of Rohner’s Studio 54-themed birthday party last November when a black performer dressed as a janitor danced on stage. Rohner’s friends also performed a number, all of them wearing afro wigs. Credit Suisse later apologised for “any offence caused”. Horta-Osório will leave behind a separate scandal at Lloyds Banking Group, which is still dealing with a compensation programme linked to a £245m loan scam at the HBOS Reading branch that pre-dated his appointment in 2011. Six people were jailed in 2017 over the scam. Lloyds – which rescued HBOS from collapse in and subsequently took a £20.3bn state bailout in 2008– is also awaiting the results of an an inquiry into issues including whether Lloyds tried to cover up the scandal. Horta-Osório also had to handle the aftermath of the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which cost Lloyds around £22bn. However, Horta-Osório has gained accolades for returning the bank to profit and private ownership during this near-decade-long tenure at Lloyds, which is the UK’s largest domestic lender. Lloyds could temporarily be led by its finance chief William Chalmers until Horta-Osório’s replacement – incoming chief executive Charlie Nunn – completes his notice period and garden leave at rival HSBC. Credit Suisse has not disclosed the size of Horta-Osorio’s pay packet, but is expected to reveal the terms of his contract by the end of April when the bank holds its annual shareholder meeting. Horta-Osório – who was the UK’s highest-paid banker until earlier this year – earned £4.7m in 2019. However, he could take a pay cut at Credit Suisse, which paid its outgoing chairman 4.7m Swiss francs (£3.9m), including 1.5m Swiss francs worth of shares, last year.",business
"The UK’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will lag behind every other major economy apart from Argentina, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Warning the UK and other countries to resist cutting government spending in order to ensure a stronger rebound, the club of 37 rich nations said severe risks to growth and jobs still remained despite the prospect of a vaccine being deployed earlier than first anticipated. In its latest economic outlook report, the Paris-based organisation said it expected the UK economy to contract by 11.2% this year, compared with the 10.1% fall in GDP it was forecasting in September. The OECD also sharply downgraded its forecasts for UK growth next year, to 4.2% from 7.6% three months ago. It said world GDP was on track to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year fuelled by the rollout of vaccines and strong growth in China. However, it warned the UK economy would still be 6% smaller compared with its late-2019 position at that stage. Only Argentina fared worse among 20 nations and the eurozone. In an assessment of the UK that warned the country was at a “critical juncture”, the OECD said there was a double threat to growth from the second Covid wave and Brexit, with less than a month before the EU transition period expires at the end of December. Urging both sides to reach an agreement, it said a deal was essential for economic prosperity, and that failure was among the large downside risks to its forecasts. “The failure to conclude a trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 would entail serious additional economic disturbances in the short term and have a strongly negative effect on trade, productivity and jobs in the longer term,” it said. Against a backdrop of heavy government borrowing to assuage the economic impact of the pandemic, the OECD said nations needed to continue to make use of record-low borrowing costs to spend on protecting businesses and households. This would help pave the way for faster and more sustainable growth in future, the organisation added. In a clear warning to nations contemplating spending cuts or tax rises, including the UK, the OECD said there was a risk that the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis would be forgotten – when government austerity drives choked-off growth and entrenched inequality. It comes after the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, used his spending review to impose a pay freeze on public sector workers outside the NHS and slashed the overseas aid budget to tackle record levels of government borrowing this year. Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the OECD, said: “We made the mistake in 2010; we need to learn from the mistake. We need to keep up the support for the people and those in and out of jobs. We must make sure income is supported.” Urging governments to continue spending while awaiting a vaccine, she added: “When you’re in a battle and you know the cavalry is coming, you don’t stop fighting. In fact you keep fighting until the cavalry is around. In fact you keep fighting while the cavalry is there.” Updating its forecasts from previous estimates made in September, the OECD said the global economy was now set to shrink by 4.2% this year, slightly below a previous forecast of 4.5%, before rebounding by 4.5% next year as vaccines are deployed around the world. However, it said the second wave of the pandemic continuing into the start of 2021, before immunisation programmes could get under way, meant its forecast for next year was below its September estimate for 5% growth. Angel Gurría, the secretary general of the OECD, said: “For the first time since the pandemic hit in early 2020, we have hope. The good news about vaccines has instilled a degree of optimism and somehow dissipated the fog of uncertainty that has covered us all. “There is hope but we’re not out of the woods yet.”",business
"JD Sports is set to pull out of talks over a rescue deal for Debenhams on Tuesday, putting thousands of jobs at risk at the struggling department store group. Last-ditch negotiations to secure a deal were continuing but the news on Monday night that Debenhams’ major supplier Arcadia had collapsed into administration, as well as uncertainty about conditions on the high street and negative reaction from shareholders, are thought to have cooled JD’s interest. A near 6% rise in JD’s share price on Monday amid speculation that it might be backing away from Debenhams was one major influence on the group’s management team led by Peter Cowgill, the executive chairman. The rebound came after millions of pounds were wiped off the company’s value last week when it emerged it was considering buying Debenhams. Debenhams, which employs about 12,000 people, has been considering a potential sale since the summer after it went into administration in April for the second time in a year. JD is thought to have been mainly interested in the Debenhams website but analysts said it was hoped it could take on almost half the group’s 124 outlets. The group saw a chance to move into a broader market and sell homewares, beauty products and smarter clothing to its existing customers. If JD does pull out of rescue talks, the only remaining suitor likely to take on a significant number of stores is Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group. Ashley has made no secret of his interest in the ailing department store despite seeing a £150m stake he built up in the then-listed company wiped out last year in a debt restructuring deal with the department store’s lenders. Frasers could save costs for the department store group by merging it with its House of Fraser chain. However, Ashley’s offers for the business have so far not exceeded half of the £300m hoped for by its owners. Other potentially interested parties, including the online specialist The Hut Group, which is understood to have been interested in just the website, and India’s Reliance Retail, appear to have melted away. Other retailers may be interested in Debenhams brands including Maine and Mantaray, or some of its prime sites. Restructuring firm Hilco has been lined up to sell off stock and other assets if no buyer can be found. Debenhams’ current owners are not expected to hold on to the group. Debenhams and JD Sports declined to comment.",business
"US rating agency S&P Global is to buy London-based market data and research company IHS Markit in an all-stock deal worth $44bn (£33bn) that will be the biggest corporate acquisition of 2020. The deal, which IHS Markit’s chief executive, Lance Uggla, told employees in a memo had been in the works for the last few months, will create a heavyweight in the increasingly competitive market in financial information. It highlights the growing importance of big data in financial markets governed by information-hungry trading algorithms. It is expected to close in the second half of 2021 if it can pass reviews by antitrust regulators who have been showing increasing interest in the sector. “The next steps will be to receive regulatory approvals both in the US and the EU, which we expect to take between six to nine months, and receive approval by our respective shareholders,” Uggla said in the internal memo. S&P Global is best known for providing debt ratings to countries and companies, as well as data on capital and commodity markets worldwide. It became a standalone business in 2011 when its then parent McGraw-Hill separated S&P from its education business. IHS Markit was formed in 2016 when US company IHS, whose businesses include data on automotive and technology industries, bought British rival Markit for around $6bn. Markit, founded by former credit trader Uggla, provides a range of pricing and reference data for financial assets and derivatives. IHS Markit has a market value of about $36.88bn based on the stock’s last close on Friday, according to a Reuters calculation, with its share price up around 22% so far this year. As part of the deal, which includes $4.8bn of debt, each share of IHS Markit will be exchanged for a ratio of 0.2838 shares of S&P Global stock, the two companies said. S&P Global shareholders will own roughly 67.75% of the combined company and the rest will be held by IHS Markit shareholders. Douglas Peterson, chief executive of S&P Global, will lead the combined firm, while Uggla will be a special adviser for a year after the deal closes. Global merger and acquisition activity touched a record high in three months to the end of September, with more than $1tn worth of transactions, mostly focused on coronavirus-resilient sectors such as technology and healthcare, according to Refinitiv data. The London Stock Exchange is in the final stage of trying to win clearance for its planned $27bn acquisition of Refinitiv, which has been through a long review process by the European Union’s competition commissioner.",business
"A historic shipbuilding yard in north Devon is to reopen after it was bought by the natural gas storage company InfraStrata in a £7m deal on Tuesday. The Appledore Shipyard, in Bideford, closed in March 2019 after its owners, Babcock, said its future was not secure, despite the offer of a £60m Ministry of Defence contract. InfraStrata, which also owns Belfast’s Harland & Wolff (H&W), said the Appledore yard’s ability to cater for smaller vessels was “a market segment that cannot be ignored”. Boris Johnson visited the site on Tuesday and said ithad a “massive history but it’s also got a great future”. “What we want to do is to ensure that there’s a good enough stream of contracts coming through to drive jobs and growth here in Devon,” he said. Unions welcomed the deal and urged the government to give the yard, which will be renamed H&W (Appledore), more orders. InfraStrata said while the yard had been dormant in recent months and the acquisition came with only one employee – the site manager – the workforce could be “very quickly ramped up” if contracts for work were secured. Discussions were under way with the government and private vessel owners, InfraStrata said. John Wood, the company’s chief executive, said: “The acquisition at this point in time is opportunistic for the company and one that should not be missed. It not only gives us a strategic foothold in mainland UK but also makes the overall business highly competitive in the smaller and higher ends of the shipyard market, respectively.” The Appledore Shipyard dates back to 1865, and has built more than 300 vessels, including some of the Royal Navy’s latest aircraft carriers.Ian Waddell, the general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: “The prospect of Appledore being reopened is great news for British shipbuilding and we welcome its purchase by InfraStrata. “Appledore played a vital role making the complex bows for the aircraft carrier and it could play a similar role building the future solid support ship which the government must build in Britain in order to invest in our regional economies and get the economy back up and running.” The GMB’s union regional organiser, Matt Roberts, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the confirmation that the yard will reopen. We have always firmly believed that the yard can be viable and thrive in the right hands.”",business
"Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19 gathered pace in the past month, fuelled by consumer spending and people taking advantage of the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme, despite fears mounting over rapid growth in unemployment. On the Guardian’s latest monthly tracker of economic news since the pandemic spread to Britain this spring, the release of pent-up demand with the easing of lockdown is driving the sharpest rebound in economic growth among the G7 advanced economies, while retail spending has returned to pre-crisis levels. However, after the country plunged into the deepest recession on record in the three months to June, companies have started making job cuts at a faster pace than during the 2008 global financial crisis, with hundreds of thousands of redundancies announced in the past few weeks alone. Sounding the alarm as the UK government prepares to remove its furlough job retention scheme this autumn, Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, warned that continued support would be required to avert a jobs catastrophe and long-term damage to the economy. Writing in the Guardian, she said: “Without urgent action we face the prospect of mass unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1980s.” Issuing an appeal to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, she said: “There is still time to stop mass unemployment. We worked together once before as this crisis began: I will work with you again if you are serious at stemming the haemorrhage of jobs.” The Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, the Covid Crisis watch will also monitor how the UK is faring compared with other countries. In the past month, private sector business activity has risen at the fastest pace in seven years as companies race to catch up on work put on hold during lockdown. The increase in demand for services and manufactured goods, which followed the easing of restrictions during the summer, sent the IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index to 60.3 in August, up from 57 in July. On a scale where a figure above 50 indicates expansion, the latest figures suggest the UK is recovering faster than the US, China and the eurozone. The recovery comes after Britain was officially confirmed to be in the deepest recession since modern records began in the 1950s, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling by 20.4% in the second quarter. In the deepest decline of any nation in the G7 and the EU, the slump was worsened by the later launch of lockdown and prolonged use of controls to limit the spread of the virus. In a reflection of the deeper downturn for Britain, non-essential shops were closed for just 50 days in Germany, compared with 84 days in the UK. Retail sales jumped above pre-pandemic levels in July during the first full month since the relaxation of restrictions, as shoppers gradually returned to the high street. The hospitality sector also received a shot in the arm from the “eat out to help out” scheme, with a Monday-to-Wednesday boom at restaurants, pubs and cafes in August. More than 64m discounted meals – the equivalent of one for almost every person in Britain – have been claimed by venues taking part in the scheme so far. However, significant pressure remains for firms, threatening a sharp increase in unemployment this autumn. Online spending remains higher than before the crisis struck, footfall remains down in several big cities amid the continued absence of office workers, and demand remains weak in certain sectors more reliant on social interaction or travel, such as entertainment, aviation and tourism. Millions of workers have been brought back from furlough as firms gradually reopen with physical distancing measures in place, with the total number of people on the government’s wage subsidy scheme down from a peak of about 9 million in May to about 4.5 million at the start of August. However, more than half of the workforce in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry remains furloughed, compared with only 13% still away from work for the economy as a whole, according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite the government scheme protecting millions of jobs, official figures show almost three-quarters of a million jobs have been shed from company payrolls since March. Economists say unemployment is set to more than double as the government rolls back the furlough scheme this autumn and as firms cut their costs amid weaker levels of demand while Covid-19 remains a risk to health. Warning that the crisis is far from over, O’Grady said employers would need continued government support to protect jobs and create new ones as the risks from the pandemic gradually recede. “Mass unemployment is not inevitable. If the government acts fast to keep people in work, our economy will recover faster and our country can build back better,” she said.",business
"The house always wins, even in the midst of a pandemic. In the early days of lockdown, as the stock market lurched into stomach-churning freefall, the share prices of Britain’s gambling powerhouses also tanked. The cancellation of sports events cut off the steady revenue stream that many had come to enjoy, not just from horse racing but, increasingly, from football betting, which typically involves small stakes but extremely high volumes. With no certainty over the return of sport – and of the football cash cow in particular – the immediate future looked bleak. Since then, two things have happened. First, football has returned – behind closed doors – and the fixture calendar boffins are making up for lost time by scheduling games more or less every day, with more of them televised than ever before. Second, firms with a strong offering in areas such as online poker and casino games have enjoyed a significant uptick in website traffic, as the boredom of lockdown helped spur new account sign-ups. On Thursday, the world’s largest online gambling firm, Flutter Entertainment, will update the market on its performance in the six months to the end of June. Flutter – the owner of Paddy Power Betfair – has been one of the most resilient performers in the sector, thanks to its scale and diversification in both geography and the products it can boast since its $6bn mega-merger with Canada’s The Stars Group, which includes Sky Betting and Gaming. While some UK rivals such as William Hill still rely all too heavily on UK sports betting customers, Flutter has an array of impressive arrows in its quiver. The deal with Stars saw it acquire PokerStars, one of the leading global brands, as well as a sizable presence in Australia and an improved casino range. This, according to Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, made Flutter one of the firms “best-suited to helping or entertaining the UK’s population while it was under lockdown”. Flutter also owns FanDuel, a fantasy sports betting site used by more than 8 million sports fans in the rapidly expanding, newly liberalised US market in which Flutter – like every British gambling company – is trying to establish a beachhead. “Covid-19 will probably result in a faster rate of US sports betting legalisation, potentially followed by online casino legalisation, in our view,” say analysts at Jefferies. All of this helps explain why Flutter Entertainment is valued at more than 40% more now than it was at the start of March, while rivals GVC (owner of Ladbrokes Coral) and William Hill have struggled to make up the ground they lost during lockdown. Industry insiders say management at Flutter have also put in a more impressive performance than their rivals, particularly after GVC’s veteran boss, Kenny Alexander, announced his intention to step down. Any signs in Thursday’s numbers of a stronger-than-expected recovery in sports betting could provide a further shot in the arm, not just for Flutter but for some of its more sport-focused peers, too. And yet not all is rosy in the gambling garden, and 2020 could prove to be one of the most important years in the history of the UK industry, a sector which is genuinely world-leading. So far, firms including Flutter and casino-focused rivals such as 888 have navigated the choppy waters of the pandemic adroitly. But this year will also see the government kick off its review of the 2005 Gambling Act, the legislation introduced by Tony Blair’s government that gave Britain one of the most liberal gambling markets in the world, and created the industry we see today. There is a broad cross-party consensus that the regulatory pendulum must now swing back in the other direction. If that happens, as with the pandemic, Flutter’s size and diversification will serve it well. But it will also make the stakes for its US expansion much higher, and with no shortage of competition for American punters, that is going to be a fierce battle. Flutter – and the broader industry – have ridden out the coronavirus pretty well but the real dangers still lie ahead.",business
"Nothing like the recovery in the US stock market has ever been seen before. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the time it took for shares to regain their previous peak was measured in decades. After the global financial crisis of 2008, it was measured in years. This time it has taken less than five months – from a low on 23 March – for the S&P 500 to regain all its lost ground and hit a new high. At the time, not even the most bullish trader would have been bet on such a rapid recovery, but five factors explain the remarkable turnaround. Even while the market was crashing in early March, America’s central bank was acting to reassure investors that it would go to any lengths to support the world’s biggest economy and prevent a financial crisis. As in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Fed moved swiftly: it cut interest rates to zero; it promised to pump $5 trillion into the troubled money markets; it created lending programmes to help the cash flow of US businesses big and small; it bought corporate bonds; and it has given the impression that it may buy stocks as well. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global, says the rally on Wall Street and the recent fall in the US dollar are “being driven primarily by central bank policies of adding unprecedented liquidity to markets through renewed quantitative easing and ultra-low rates.” The lockdown has been disastrous for some sectors, notably hospitality and airlines, but people stuck at home have been spending more time online, shopping, watching, socialising and working. That has been good news for the five big US tech giants – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. Dhaval Joshi, analyst at BCA research, says the S&P 500 should be renamed the S&P 5 because it is now so dominated by a handful of companies. Likewise, about 10 stocks – mostly in finance and energy – drive the UK’s FTSE 100. “A crucial defining feature of a stock market,” Joshi says, “turns out to be its exposure to healthcare and technology – whose profits are in major structural uptrends – versus its exposure to financials and energy, where profits are in major structural downtrends. He points out that healthcare and technology businesses account for 40% of the total value of the US stock market, compared with 12% for the UK. The US economy contracted by almost 10% in the second quarter of 2020, but on Wall Street that is now ancient history. What matters is that activity is picking up and unemployment is coming down, albeit in fits and starts – as shown last week, when new unemployment claims rose back above 1 million. Traditionally, Wall Street looks beyond the short term and anticipates that a company’s earnings – on which its stock market valuation ultimately depends – will recover. However, some investors, including Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund, say this is risky at a time when Covid-19 is not beaten. Trond Grande, the fund’s deputy chief executive, said markets did not reflect the real economic impact of the virus, which was not under control “in any shape or form”. The devastating economic impact of Covid-19 has meant a worldwide race to find a vaccine. Normally this takes years, but there are hopeful signs – including from researchers at Oxford University – that the process could be speeded up. Wall Street has proved highly sensitive to reports of a possible breakthrough, from either US biotech companies such as Gilead or foreign rivals. But even on the most optimistic assumption, a vaccine will not be widely available until 2021 at the earliest, and the chances of failure are high. But for the past few months, vaccine optimism has helped boost not just pharma shares but Wall Street stocks generally. In the early stages of the pandemic, investors dumped shares and parked their money in traditional safe havens such as cash and US treasury bonds. But the actions of the Fed and other central banks have made these options less attractive. Interest rates for savers are barely above zero, and in some countries the interest rates (yields) on government bonds have turned negative, which means investors have to pay the state for the privilege of putting their money in a safe asset. For investors who believe shares are overvalued, there is gold, whose price has risen by almost $400 an ounce in the past six months. 2008 After Lehman Brothers collapsed, banks the world over stopped lending amid panic over losses on speculative investments, and were saved from collapse by massive governments bailouts. From spring 2008, in the deepest recession since the war, GDP fell by 6% over five quarters. Growth returned in late 2009, but unemployment hit 8.5% in 2011. What happened to stock markets? The FTSE 100 suffered its worst ever calendar year in 2008, plunging by 31% as the global banking system went into meltdown. It took until 2013 for it to regain its pre-crisis high. Early 1990s recession The classic example of boom and bust came in the early 1990s as Britain lurched into recession after stellar economic growth in the late 1980s. GDP fell by 1.9% for five consecutive quarters before a return to growth in the fourth quarter of 1991 and unemployment peaked at 10.7% in December 1992. What happened to stock markets? The FTSE 100 lost 20% from January to September 1990 but the market rallied through 1991, rising by 16%. 1970s oil shock Oil prices rocketed fourfold as Arab states embargoed crude exports to the US, UK and other nations after the Yom Kippur war. This and other problems for Britain led to the three-day week in early 1974. The economy shrank 4% between autumn 1973 and spring 1974, then fell into a double-dip recession in 1975, with six more months of decline totalling 1.9%. What happened to stock markets? The oil crisis triggered the longest stock market slide since the 1929 Wall Street crash, with a near two-year decline. In New York, the Dow Jones lost almost half its value. The London Stock Exchange’s FT 30 – predecessor of the FTSE 100 – collapsed by 73% between spring 1972 and the end of 1974. Richard Partington",business
"Cinema owners will be holding their breath next Wednesday when  Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi film Tenet becomes the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released since March as it is the first test of whether movie fans are ready to head back to big screens in their masses. The UK cinema industry, destined for the worst year at the box office in almost three decades, has been struggling to get back on its feet since the government gave the green light to reopen theatres last month. In the past week the top 10 films in cinemas in the UK and Ireland made just over £800,000 at the box office. Last year, an average week notched up £24m. With a schedule devoid of new Hollywood blockbusters, cinema operators have had to fall back on low-grossing classics and old hits, from Inception and The Empire Strikes Back to franchises including Twilight and Harry Potter. Earlier this month, cinema owners were dealt a blow when Disney pulled its new blockbuster Mulan from schedules, in favour of a release on the streaming service Disney+, leaving the Warner Bros’ Robert Pattinson-led Tenet as the great hope to reignite their year. “There is no getting away from it, it’s the first big commercial release,” said Crispin Lilly, chief executive of the boutique chain Everyman. “Tenet will be a very important step. This is the one that could get it all going. The uptake, the interest, the buzz is that it is going to do what we need it to do, which is re-kick cinema to the wider audience.” Tickets went on sale last week and Lilly said the rate of sales pegs Tenet at a box-office take similar to the Elton John biopic Rocketman or Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which took about £25m, or possibly even The Joker, which notched up £50m. “That would be superb,” Lilly said. “It is looking incredibly encouraging, it really is.” Tim Richards, the founder of Vue, one of the largest cinema operators in Europe, delayed reopening its 91 cinemas in the UK and Ireland until this month. Early ticket sales look strong, at levels matching Nolan’s Inception (£40m) to potentially as high Sam Mendes’s 1917 (£60m). “We have done a staggered opening over three weeks to make sure we are game ready when Tenet comes out,” said Richards. “Pre-bookings right now are really strong. With Warner Bros’ marketing and promotion muscle behind it, expectations are that it is going to do pretty close to pre-Covid levels of business.” The pre-sales figures suggest that the government’s regulation that cinema-goers must now wear face masks hasn’t deterred the majority of fans. But the physical distancing required means that cinemas are only able to run at about 60% capacity. Cinema owners, however, believe the distance rules will not have a big impact on ticket sales, because the pandemic has led to a step change in habits with the overwhelming dominance of weekend movie-going now at an end. “People are being cautious … many are now going on a Tuesday afternoon or a Wednesday evening instead of the traditional Friday and Saturday night,” said Richards. “Capacity restrictions are not such a big issue as we move to a true seven-day-a-week business.” However, one source cautioned that with the industry so badly needing Tenet to be a hit, the film may be in danger of being overhyped as it is unlikely to be to everyone’s tastes. “I think it will do well, but this is not Avengers we are talking about, and I am a little concerned that because it is the first big movie release it is being turned into something it is not,” said the source. If Tenet pulls in the crowds, and a second wave doesn’t result in a renewed shutdown, there are still plenty of box-office pounds to be salvaged this year. Marvel’s Black Widow, The New Mutants, the next instalment in the Kingsman franchise, Bill & Ted Face the Music starring Keanu Reeves and, of course, James Bond: Never Say Die are all set for release in the coming months. “If Tenet proves that the broader audience is there to come back and there is business to be done then that’s really powerful,” said Lilly, who opened three new Everymans in Chelsea, London and Lincoln during the pandemic. “Then [the year is] there to be recovered to be honest.” Top 10 films in the UK and Ireland (week starting 14 August) 1.

"The coronavirus pandemic has driven Australia’s flagship carrier, Qantas, to declare its worst financial result for a century – a $2bn loss – amid widespread devastation in the travel and tourism industries. Despite concerns in the market that the airline is bleeding cash as much of its fleet remains grounded, the company declared on Thursday that it remains a going concern and its chief executive, Alan Joyce, took a swipe at stricken rival Virgin Australia by declaring that after the crisis Qantas would be “the only Australian airline that can fly long haul”. Joyce also said he thought flights to and from the Covid-19-ravaged US, which is one of Qantas’s key international destinations, would be up and running within three years. State and national border closures have crippled the operations of Qantas, its smaller rival Virgin Australia, which is in administration, and smashed travel agencies and tourism operators across the country. In a sign of how deeply the travel bans are biting, Joyce on Thursday attacked the governments of Queensland and Tasmania for closing their borders and suggested there should be a national set of rules governing state border closures. The call was immediately rejected by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who said she was “not going to bend to anyone” on border closures and would instead follow the advice of the state’s chief health officer. Qantas’s record loss sparked renewed calls from unions for a comprehensive government rescue package for the air travel sector. “The shocking Qantas losses are an indication of just how sick our industry is,” the Transport Workers Union’s national secretary, Michael Kaine, said. “It must surely be only a matter of time before Qantas follows Virgin in requesting help from the federal government to stay alive.” He said the Morrison government should take measures including buying equity stakes in struggling businesses, ending a policy that stops employees of ground services business Dnata from getting jobkeeper income support payments because it is owned by the government of Dubai and capping executive pay in the sector. Qantas’s record loss came after online flight booking site Webjet reported a $143.5m loss late on Wednesday. Airports are also bleeding. From this weekend, the family-owned Canberra Airport will close its doors on Saturdays, and it is also considering closing on another weekday. Traffic figures released on Tuesday show just 317,000 passengers passed through Australia’s busiest airport, Sydney, during June – down 92% from the same time last year. With passenger numbers for the year down 62% for the year so far, the airport is deep in the red, declaring a loss for the year of $52m last week. It is currently trying to raise $2bn from its shareholders in order to pay off some of its crippling debt load of $9.1bn. On Thursday, Simon Westaway, the chief executive of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, told a parliamentary inquiry that his industry has halved over the course of the year, shrinking by $80bn. He said state border closures were costing the industry $84m a day and backed Joyce’s push for a national framework governing when they should be opened or closed. Qantas said that it made a profit on an underlying basis of $124m, before tax – down from $1.2bn the previous year. However, this figure excluded items including redundancy costs and the airline’s decision to slash the value of its airline fleet by $1.4bn. Qantas has also had to borrow more money to meet the costs of running the company while flying is heavily restricted. Total borrowings rose from $5.1bn to 6.7bn. The Australian Services Union seized on the positive underlying result to insist Qantas pay bonuses of between $1,500 and $2,000 owed to about 6,000 workers. “Announcing a $124m profit while still withholding money from workers who can’t even pay the rent is just plain wrong,” the ASU’s assistant national secretary, Linda White, said. Qantas announced the payments in 2018 when it unveiled a bumper profit of $1.4bn. The 2018 result also marked the first time since 2009 that Qantas has paid company tax (of $4m), due to losses it had carried forward over the period. Thursday’s gargantuan loss means Qantas will have more tax credits available to reduce its bill in coming years.",business
"Retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July, the first full month non-essential shops were allowed to reopen, officials figures showed. Indicating an increased appetite since the easing of the lockdown in May to travel to work and shop on the high street, sales increased to higher levels than in February. The value of sales increased by 4.4% and volume sales by 3.6% compared with June despite a fall in the sale of food that the Office for National Statistics said could be attributed to shoppers switching from buying dinners at the supermarket to purchasing restaurant meals. Internet shopping also suffered a slight monthly dip, in response to many high street shops opening for the first time in July, but sales online remained more than 50% higher than in February and helped push overall retail sales above pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Household goods stores and other non-food stores experienced the sharpest recovery, increasing sales by 6% and 2.2% respectively above their February 2020 levels. The ONS said: “Retailers told us that DIY products sold well as people carried out home improvements during lockdown.” When compared with February 2020’s pre-pandemic level, total retail sales were 1.7% and 3% higher in value and volume terms respectively. However, sales in the three months to July remained below the same period last year, with a fall of 5.3% for value sales and a fall of 4.1% for volume sales. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “Retail sales clearly benefited in July from a full month of non-essential retailers being allowed to open. Retail sales were also likely helped in July by the opening up of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers pushing up footfall. “However, the opening up of the hospitality sector and other consumer service sectors may have diverted some consumer spending away from retail sales towards services.” Retail sales, which account for 5.4% of GDP, have rebounded more robustly than many other parts of the economy, though mostly through online sales. Earlier this month, official figures confirmed that the economy was in recession after a slump in GDP of 20.4% in the second quarter that followed a 2.2% fall in the first.",business
"London’s suburbs are leading the capital’s economic recovery from the pandemic, as consumers shop and dine out locally, while the absence of office workers and tourists has kept city centre spending muted. Consumer outlay on clothes and hospitality in smaller local centres, such as Southall and East Ham, either matched or surpassed January levels by mid-July, according to a report from the thinktank Centre for London and King’s College London. The report tracked the impact of the pandemic on the capital’s economy five months after the coronavirus crisis began. Trend data from the credit card company Mastercard showed consumer spending had shifted from central London towards outer zones, as office staff continued to work from home even after lockdown restrictions eased, and international tourists stayed away. Three-quarters of London’s white-collar workers have not yet returned to their desks, according to data from the US bank Morgan Stanley, benefiting residential areas. By mid-July, restaurant transactions in Southall, west of the city centre, were 17% higher than in January, and clothes purchases were 10% up in East Ham, in the east, the Mastercard data showed. However, spending had not returned to pre-Covid levels in the capital’s larger town centres, including Stratford, Ealing, Bromley and Orpington, where transactions remained about a third lower in July than in January 2020. Consumer spending also remained persistently low in the centre of the capital, which the Centre for London attributed to its relatively small resident population of 330,000. Before the pandemic, this figure would increase by 80% every day, as office workers, shoppers and tourists travelled to the area for shopping, work, hospitality or cultural attractions. Retail spend in central London was 60% down in July, according to the Mastercard data, while restaurant spending was 80% lower. Transport for London data showed journeys to London workplaces remained at 50% of average levels in the first week of August, although driving and cycling rates had returned to normal. The pandemic had accelerated some existing social and economic changes, such as the shift to online shopping and remote working, said Mark Kleinman, professor of public policy at King’s College London’s policy institute. “We are now seeing some evidence of additional impacts, particularly on the balance of economic activity between the centre and other parts of the city, that are in part a consequence of these accelerated changes,” Kleinman said.",business
"Lego is to start phasing out single-use plastic bags used to package loose bricks in boxes from early next year, as it steps up efforts to make its products and packaging more sustainable over the next three years with a $400m (£310m) global investment. The Danish toymaker, which aims to make all its packaging sustainable by the end of 2025, will replace the clear plastic bags with easy-to-open recyclable, sustainably sourced paper bags – certified by the Forest Stewardship Council – as part of a new trial. Prototypes made from a range of different sustainable materials have been tested by hundreds of parents and children. Lego has already reduced the size of its boxes by 14%. Lego’s millions of younger fans across the world have been instrumental in helping to bring the move forward, said the Lego Group chief executive, Niels B Christiansen: “We have received many letters from children about the environment asking us to remove single-use plastic packaging. We have been exploring alternatives for some time and the passion and ideas from children inspired us to begin to make the change.” In 2015, the the family-owned toymaker, one of the world’s most popular brands, set a target to make its products from sustainable materials by 2030. Lego bricks have been made with a strong, oil-based plastic known as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) since 1963, although other pieces in its sets do not need such strong materials. Two years ago the first Lego pieces made from plant-based bio-plastic sourced from sugar cane went on sale, initially more “flexible” pieces such as green leaves, bushes and trees, although since extended further to cover dragon wings and carwash brushes. The company has pledged to expand its use of this material, which currently accounts for less than 2% of all pieces. It is continuing to search for a replacement for ABS in the majority of its bricks. Earlier in September, Lego reported a 7% global sales rise in the first six months of 2020 due to more families playing together during lockdown and “more adults than ever before” buying its harder-to-build sets. Among other targets announced on Tuesday, Lego aims to achieve zero waste to landfill by the end of 2025 and carbon-neutral manufacturing operations by the end of 2022.",business
"Stock markets have lost some of their spectacular gains made over the past several months, as investors sold off high-flying tech companies and worried about the continuing crisis in the US jobs market. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 808 points, or 2.78%, after passing 29,000 for the first time since February on Wednesday. The S&P 500 was down 3.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.9%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had set their latest record highs a day earlier, and the latter index is still up nearly 28% for the year. The S&P 500 had been up nine of the last 10 trading days and posted its fifth straight monthly gain in August. In London, the sell-off ended a rally on the FTSE 100, which closed 90 points lower at 5,850. The index is now down 22% for the year. Markets across Europe also ended the day lower. Big tech companies have seen huge gains in their share price in recent months as investors bet the firms would continue posting huge profits even with many coronavirus restrictions still in place, as people might spend even more time online with their devices. Market watchers have questioned recently whether those gains were overdone. Apple’s 8% share price fall knocked $180bn off its value. Other hot stocks fell further with Tesla dropping 9% and video conferencing company Zoom falling 10%. Randy Frederick, the vice-president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, said: “Some of the stocks have gotten a little pricey, and what the actual cause is to spark this sell-off is difficult to say. The leading sector for quite a long time has been the Nasdaq, which is very heavily weighted in technology stocks so people just saw this as an opportunity to take the profits off the table.” Investors were also taking into account the latest economic figures. The number of US citizens who applied for unemployment benefits fell last week to 881,000, a sharp drop after weeks of 1m plus claims and slightly better than economists had expected. The figures have been adjusted to take account of the extraordinary impact of the coronavirus on the US job market, a move economists expect will reduce the number of weekly claims. However, the numbers remain four times higher than the average before the pandemic. Edward Moya, a senior market analyst for Oanda in New York: “Too many Americans need benefits and this will likely remain the case for the rest of the year. “The US trade deficit also expanded to the widest level since 2008, a troubling sign that US-China tensions are about to heat up even further. President Trump campaigned in 2016 [saying] that trade wars are good, and easy to win, so financial markets will look to see if he turns up the pressure against Beijing.” The stock markets in the US have rallied since plunging in March. Most of the rally has been on strong performances from tech stocks, but also a hope that the worst of the pandemic is over, despite rising infections in schools and the possibility of a second surge of infections in the autumn. Huge amounts of support from the Federal Reserve and Congress have also helped bolster the US economy. Investors will be paying close attention on Friday when the US labour department releases its August job report. Economists surveyed by the financial data company FactSet forecast that the US economy created 1.4m jobs last month, down from 1.74m created in July. Tens of millions of US citizens remain unemployed however. A report by payroll processor ADP, widely watched as a forerunner of government employment data due out Friday, showed the private sector added 428,000 jobs in August, less than half the 1m expected by forecasters. If Friday’s jobs numbers do not deliver, it is unlikely the stock market will rise much higher, analysts said.",business
"Ocado has temporarily suspended deliveries to its employees as the online grocer battles to clear a backlog following a new tie-up with Marks & Spencer. Ocado said the move would free up space for customer orders, after apparent teething problems in the newly launched partnership caused it to cancel customer deliveries on its first day on Tuesday. An Ocado spokeswoman could not say how many staff orders were affected. Employees of the company usually receive a 15% discount on grocery orders, among other benefits. The spokeswoman said: “The M&S launch has been incredibly popular. To help minimise the impact of the surge in demand on our customers, the deliveries for Ocado colleagues were paused for the first few days.” The M&S launch has been closely followed by the retail industry after Ocado ended a 20-year partnership with Waitrose. Waitrose has launched a marketing push to persuade customers to move to its website, rather than remaining with Ocado and switching to M&S products. The Ocado deal is also an important move for M&S, whose grocery delivery services were previously limited to party food. M&S last month announced it was cutting 7,000 jobs in management and stores as it tried to reduce costs. Lockdowns prompted a surge in demand for online shopping across the retail industry, but growth in online orders of essential grocery shopping in particular has accelerated far beyond what analysts had expected. The consequent increased investor interest propelled Ocado’s share price to record highs above £25 per share on Wednesday, compared with below £13 at the start of the year. The pause on staff orders was first reported by Retail Week.",business
"The scale of the downturn hitting the coffee industry is reflected in figures from the countries with the biggest markets. The world’s biggest cafe market, the US, expects sales at specialist tea and coffee shops fall nearly 11% in 2020 after years of strong growth, according to Euromonitor International. In China, now the world’s second-biggest market for coffee, sales growth is expected to slump from just over 40% to just 1.6%. The rise of international chains such as Starbucks and the UK’s Costa, which now operates in more than 30 countries, had spurred strong growth in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and across eastern Europe. But that is set to go into reverse this year. Southern Europe, especially Italy and Spain, with its traditional coffee culture and a busy tourist industry, has also recorded a big drop in consumption. As the market has contracted, net imports by coffee-buying countries were down nearly 6% in the three months to the end of June compared with the same period last year, with figures for the US and Japan particularly poor, according to Rabobank, a leading financial services provider for the food sector. Its analyst Carlos Mera said the market was “not the bloodbath it could have been” with major chains hopeful of a rebound in trade while sales of coffee capsules have grown. But the pandemic has sent an already volatile coffee market on a deeper rollercoaster ride. Prices on the global commodity market climbed steeply in February and March as the world stockpiled under the coronavirus threat. Prices then plummeted by more than a quarter in mid-June, when many of the world’s coffee shops closed, before rising sharply again. The price changes are not only affected by changing demand and fluctuations in the dollar, in which coffee is usually traded, according to Mera, but also as a result of investment funds piling into commodities as an alternative to plunging equity markets. Those changes are likely to have a wide-ranging impact on producers who are already struggling to cope with depressed coffee prices and the effects of climate change which has made growing crops more difficult by, for example, increasing incidence of disease in some regions. Becky Forecast, supply chain manager at ethical trading group Fairtrade, said: “Volatility of coffee prices has been a big problem and the Covid crisis has exacerbated that.” She added that the changes in price made it difficult to plan ahead and cover costs, making the Fairtrade way of conducting business, which guarantees a minimum price for producers, more important than ever. “That safety is not only crucial for farmer but for the long-term sustainability of coffee. If they are not covering the cost of production there is little incentive to carry on [farming].” The good news for producer countries is that most of the world’s biggest coffee growers, including Brazil, were able to harvest their crops despite the crisis which slowed down transport links. The effect on roasters has been mixed with those supplying retailers or selling direct online faring much better than those more reliant on the hospitality industry. Small roasters such as Grind and Ozone often buy beans direct, rather than relying on commodity markets, so these relationships have protected their supply chains during the crisis. But Forecast said: “There is a big concern that demand won’t pick up again or what people are consuming domestically won’t balance out what they were buying out of home.”",business
"Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin is to have a say in the running of the brand for the first time since departing over a year ago under a new “relationship agreement”. Kelvin, who owns nearly 12% of the fashion company, will have his interests represented on its board by a non-executive director – corporate financial adviser Colin La Fontaine Jackson – with immediate effect. Once known as “the man closest to Ted”, Kelvin resigned in March last year following allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staff. Kelvin’s departure came after a voluntary leave of absence from December 2018 when allegations of misconduct, including “forced hugs” and ear-kissing, were made against him. Kelvin has denied all allegations of misconduct. The group’s share price slumped to less than a tenth of its value before the allegations emerged. In July, Ted Baker said it would cut 500 jobs after a torrid few years including the “forced hugs” allegations, a string of profit warnings and an auditing error, and the coronavirus pandemic which caused sales to slump by more than a third. An investigation into the audit error in which the company overestimated the value of clothes in its warehouses by more than £30m is ongoing. In June, Kelvin slashed his stake in Ted Baker by more than half, handing control of the company to an investor known as “the Rottweiler” as part of an emergency £105m fundraising to get the business through the pandemic. In a statement to the stock market, Ted Baker said the agreement “brings the benefits of access to Ray’s unique brand experience and insight, while at the same time introducing clear guidelines that will ensure board independence is maintained and that the interests of shareholders are prioritised and protected”. It said the agreement formalised Kelvin’s relationship with the company. A source close to said Kelvin: “Ray will do anything to help the company.” John Barton, chairman, said: “We are pleased to welcome Colin to the board and to be able to access Ray’s great experience in building the brand over the last 30 years as we continue to make progress with Ted’s new formula for growth.”",business
"Employers need more help to prevent a “lost generation” of young people affected by the Covid-19 recession, despite the launch of a £2bn Treasury scheme to boost job creation for under-25s, a lobby group has warned. Against a backdrop of rapid unemployment growth across the country, ministers announced details on Wednesday of how companies can use the “kickstart” programme, which aims to create thousands of new jobs for 16- to 24-year-olds. Under the scheme, first announced by the chancellor Rishi Sunak in the summer statement, employers can offer young people who are claiming universal credit a six-month work placement funded by the government. However, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said more action was needed to support employers, warning that urgent steps were required to prevent a “lost generation of young people”. As schools in England reopen and pupils return to classrooms for the first time in months, the lobby group said clarity on the government’s plans for apprentices and a renewed focus on technical education and skills were needed. “More must be done to ensure small firms have all the support they need to survive and then thrive after this pandemic,” said Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB. “If more small businesses are unable to afford an apprentice, without the means to offer an industry placement for T-level pupils or provide a traineeship or kickstart role, we will be letting down the next generation.” Under the kickstart scheme, the government covers 100% of a young person’s pay on their relevant minimum wage, national insurance and pensions contributions for 25 hours a week. Employers can top this up further, while the state will also pay £1,500 to set up support and training for people on a kickstart placement. Sunak said the scheme, which will run until the end of next year with an option to extend it further, would “open the door to a brighter future for a new generation and ensure the UK bounces back stronger as a country”. The Treasury said businesses of all sizes, including household names such as Tesco, were looking to use the scheme and create quality jobs for young people. While there is no cap on the number of places the scheme can support, as many as 538,000 young people aged 24 and under were on universal credit as of July, while 700,000 young people are expected to leave education this year. Jane Gratton, the head of people policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the scheme would help firms take on young workers at a time when cashflow was tight, but that support would be needed for struggling firms. “To be successful, kickstart needs to create long-term, quality employment opportunities and ensure that both businesses and employees are fully supported throughout the placement,” she said.",business
"HSBC has become the latest bank to restrict sales of its low-deposit 90% mortgages in a move that will leave many first-time buyers struggling to find a loan. While HSBC has stopped short of pulling 90% mortgages off the shelf, it said it was “temporarily reserving” mortgages worth more than 85% of the value of a home to customers switching interest rates. It is meant to help the lender process a backlog of low-deposit mortgage applications. Michelle Andrews, HSBC UK’s head of buying a home, said it was “not a decision we have taken lightly but one we will be reviewing regularly”. The bank’s 400 mortgage advisers are currently flooded with applications from buyers, with customers forced to wait as long as three to four weeks to be interviewed by HSBC. Meanwhile, the bank has only opened a daily window of as little as half an hour in the morning for brokers to apply for loans before the daily allocation of money runs out. HSBC – which accounts for about 6.8% of the UK’s mortgage market – had been reviewing the issue on a daily basis as it tried to find a responsible way to curb high demand for its low-deposit mortgages. “The recent significant uptick in applications has meant that we have not been able to consistently meet the high standards we set ourselves, which is not always a positive experience for our customers and can delay and put a property purchase at risk,” Andrews said. Typically, banks wanting to reduce demand either raise interest rates or change product criteria, such as requiring a higher deposit or by toughening up affordability constraints.  Since lockdown, other major mortgage lenders have shied away from 90%-plus lending, fearful of falling house prices and arrears. However, the surprise rise in the market has caught lenders unaware, with HSBC faced with many more applicants than expected from first-time buyers. The introduction of HSBC’s restrictions – which were first reported by the Guardian – will leave many first-time buyers with only Nationwide as an option. But Nationwide has strict criteria for its 90% loans, which will leave many potential buyers unable to find a loan. There was a glimmer of hope for first-time buyers, with Virgin Money relaunching into the low-deposit market – but only if customers agree to a minimum seven-year fixed period. “We can’t carry the market on our own, the operational strain on us is huge,” one senior HSBC banker told the Guardian. However, the banker insisted that the mortgage market remains sound, with arrears and defaults still low.   Sam Harhat, the head of financial services at Andrews Property Group, said: “For 75% loan-to-value mortgages and below, there is a huge amount of lender competition but at higher LTVs finding a lender is like looking for a needle in a haystack.” Chris Sykes of the brokers Private Finance added: “Given the restrictions at this end of the market, it is no surprise that those lenders still offering higher LTV products are facing overwhelming levels of demand. If buyers require a mortgage at that level and need to move quickly they may struggle at this point in time or may face higher rates.” ",business
"Last week, as Louis DeJoy testified before the House of Representatives about mail slowdowns around the country, the Republican congressman Jim Jordan praised the embattled postmaster general’s career as the chief executive of New Breed Logistics, saying DeJoy had an “amazing record in business”. But court documents reviewed by the Guardian allege that as DeJoy expanded his father’s shipping company into a logistics empire, he alienated his own family, pushing his brother Dominick out of the company and triggering an acrimonious legal battle with long-lasting consequences. The lawsuit and its outcome provide new insight into how Louis DeJoy came to control the company that made him wealthy and put him in a position to become a top Republican donor and, later, the postmaster general. A complaint filed by Dominick DeJoy in North Carolina state court in January 2000 alleges that Louis DeJoy: Family patriarch Dominick DeJoy Sr founded New Breed in 1968 as a small-time trucking concern in New York and New Jersey. After suffering a debilitating injury in 1977, he passed control of the company to his sons Dominick Jr and Michael; Louis, the eldest, was in college at the time, studying to become an accountant. Dominick did not go to college, instead taking over New Breed’s operations after graduating from high school. Louis graduated the following year and became a certified public accountant shortly after, and returned to New York to join his brothers at the helm of their father’s company. For the next decade, Louis was New Breed’s chief financial officer, handling the company’s bank accounts and tax filings. Together, the three brothers reincorporated New Breed with Louis as president and each brother owning a third of the company. They then pushed business outward from the New York area, expanding operations nationwide and moving the headquarters to North Carolina; according to the court filing, the brothers only held one in-person board meeting over the course of more than 15 years, despite Dominick and Louis living just a few miles apart in Greensboro. “Dominick Jr trusted Louis, believed he was a capable [accountant], and believed that Louis would responsibly look after all three brothers’ interests,” said the court filing. Some time in the 1990s, Louis and his brother Michael allegedly executed a kind of financial shell game to deprive Dominick Jr of his stake in the family business, according to the complaint. Michael established a new set of holding companies that did business with New Breed’s clients, and Louis allegedly told his brother Dominick multiple times that he would be entitled to a third of the proceeds from these new companies. In fact, according to Dominick’s complaint, the new arrangement gave Dominick no equity in the companies whatsoever. It wasn’t until April 1998, when Louis undertook to reorganize the entire company once again, that Dominick alleges he became aware of what he claimed was a scheme to defraud him. The ownership structure of the reorganized company would reduce Dominick’s share in New Breed by more than half, giving him a 15% stake instead of the one-third stake he thought he had. According to the court documents, Louis and Michael “conspired and did force” Dominick to sign the agreement. The following year, according to the court documents, Dominick made an even more shocking discovery: Louis had established multiple accounts in his name at local banks and investment trusts, forging Dominick’s signature in order to set up accounts of which they were supposedly the joint owners. Louis then deposited Dominick’s New Breed earnings into these accounts and either spent the money on his own personal expenses or funneled it back into New Breed, according to the court documents. When certain employees tried to send evidence of these fake accounts to Dominick, Louis allegedly sent his own employees to intercept the documents and prevent Dominick from seeing them. No sooner did Dominick sue Louis than New Breed sued Dominick on Louis’s behalf, demanding Dominick drop his lawsuit. Court records show that the cases were consolidated in a state business court later that year. Records also show that the presiding judge arranged in January 2001 for Dominick to depose an employee of Wachovia Securities, a bank that was considering an outside investment in New Breed. But later that month, just two days before the deposition was scheduled to take place, the brothers reached a confidential settlement and the judge dismissed the case. Even before Dominick’s departure from the company, his relationship with Louis was a contentious one, with the brothers often getting into heated arguments during meetings, according to two people who worked at New Breed. As tensions rose, Louis and Michael held a board meeting where they voted Dominick out of the company, and later had security escort him from the building. One person remembered a group of police officers standing outside the door of New Breed headquarters the next day to bar Dominick from coming back into the office. According to a person familiar with the family, Dominick has not spoken with either of his two brothers since he left New Breed. He now lives in La Jolla, California, and leads a small company that produces an “inertia drive” propulsion technology that creates a “constant steady state acceleration force due to an imbalance in angular momentum”. Another person familiar with the lawsuit who declined to be named said the resolution of the lawsuit was favorable to Louis. This person also said that the dispute behind the lawsuit had to do not just with Dominick’s financial stake in New Breed but also with the brothers’ competing visions for how the company should grow. “I think in the end Dominick wanted to cash out, and Louis was happy for him to cash out, they were just arguing over the price,” this person said. But another person who was familiar with the situation said that while Louis was the “brains” of the company, Dominick had been the one who had been in charge of building dozens of equipment sorting centers around the country. It was these centers that made the company so valuable to the US Postal Service, which awarded it millions of dollars in logistics contracts over the years. “Dominick spent years building out the logistics side, and then once we rolled out all those sites, it was like we didn’t need him any more,” this person said. “He was gone pretty soon after that.” After Dominick’s departure, Louis became the controlling shareholder of New Breed rather than one partner among three. As a result, when Louis sold New Breed to XPO Logistics more than a decade later, for a reported price of $615m, he got the lion’s share of that payout. If Dominick had still been an equal partner in the company the brothers would have had to split the sale price between them. It is unclear whether Michael received any money as part of the XPO deal, but for Louis the windfall helped catapult him into the top ranks of Republican donors. He funneled at least some of this payout to Republican candidates and pacs, donating almost $3m to the Trump campaign alone over the next five years and endearing himself to the party establishment. The Postal Service’s board of governors nominated DeJoy to serve as postmaster general in May after a months-long search spearheaded by the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, according to the New York Times. Robert Duncan, a former Republican National Committee chairman who Trump appointed to the board of governors in 2017, was the first to suggest DeJoy for the position. The board’s vice-chairman, longtime postal executive David Williams, told Congress in a testimony earlier this month that DeJoy “didn’t strike [him] as a serious candidate” for the job. Williams resigned from the board, whose members are all Trump appointees, when it became clear that the board intended to approve the selection of DeJoy. Since taking office, DeJoy has been criticized by postal workers, union leaders and Democratic politicians for implementing policies that have slowed down mail delivery, including by limiting overtime work and removing mail-sorting machines from postal stations. Amid intense public pressure, DeJoy recently said he would suspend some of these changes until after the election, and recent data suggests that service has rebounded in recent weeks, but Democrats in the House of Representatives this week announced their plan to subpoena DeJoy over the changes. A spokesperson for DeJoy’s family foundation said that the postmaster general “is extremely proud of the logistics and shipping company that he and his leadership team, including family members, built over decades of hard work”. The spokesperson said: “The DeJoy brothers amicably settled these issues and all civil actions were dismissed by agreement of all the brothers. Mr DeJoy continues to honor the terms of the agreement to not disclose additional details. “Immediately following the settlement, New Breed began a 15-year period of substantial growth supported by both public and private investors who embraced the company’s commitment to the highest standards of financial discipline and ethical operations.” Dominick declined to comment for this article. Michael did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",business
"Ahead of the 2020 election, Donald Trump and administration officials have claimed the era of offshoring American jobs and factories is “over”, but even through the pandemic US corporations have continued to lay off employees and send their work abroad. Petitions for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) – a government scheme designed to soften the blow from jobs sent overseas – shows that about 37,000 workers had their positions sent overseas between 15 March and 31 July 2020, , a nearly identical rate to the same timeframe in 2019. Bed, Bath & Beyond shut down a call center in Layton, Utah, last month, displacing 286 workers and sending the work abroad to the Philippines through a contractor. “They actually tricked people into training these other people. The way they worded it was they’re bringing the contractor to help out with the overflow. I was never told in any form I was training people to take my job,” said a laid-off call center employee who requested to remain anonymous due to a confidentiality agreement. “For them to make the change with the layoffs, when they did, was the biggest slap in the face for employees. There was no need to do it in the middle of a pandemic.” Bed, Bath & Beyond did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Workers were told in an email the layoffs were part of a restructuring plan. Since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January 2017 to 31 July 2020, over 308,000 workers have been certified for trade adjustment assistance benefits. Trump campaigned on promises to stop offshoring, and workers at companies that have shut down or scaled back operations, including AT&T, Carrier in Indiana, Siemens in Iowa and Nabisco in Illinois, have criticized the lack of support for workers once he took office. As part of restructuring ahead of bankruptcy, Brooks Brothers decided to shed their “Made In America” commitment and shut down three clothing factories in the US in July 2020. The company will rely on production abroad, displacing up to 700 workers in the US. “It’s tough for everybody. We didn’t expect the company to close it. People have been here for 30 to 40 years,” said Pedro Lopez, president of Unite Here local 187 who worked at the Brooks Brothers’ Southwick factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for over 10 years. He hasn’t found other employment out of fear of making his 92-year-old mother, who he cares for, sick from coronavirus.  In a recent policy paper, Owen Herrnstadt, the IAM’s chief of staff to the international president and director of trade and globalization, disputed claims from the Trump administration that current trade policies were bringing back jobs to the US, citing the continued influx of TAA petitions, the lack of progress in reversing job losses abroad, and promised jobs from corporations such as Foxconn in Wisconsin that never panned out. “We cannot simply turn around offshoring by doing what the current administration has done: tweeting out tariffs and issuing executive orders ‘encouraging’ companies to use domestic sourcing,” Herrnstadt argued. A report published in August 2020 by the Economic Policy Institute noted that between 2016 to 2018, the latest year of available data, nearly 1,800 manufacturing factories in the US had disappeared. The report notes coronavirus has further hit manufacturing with the loss of 740,000 jobs this year, and trade deficits that drive offshoring, particularly with China and Mexico, have continued to increase under Trump. Among the TAA petitions filed during the pandemic are 403 workers in Buffalo, New York, at Panasonic who will be displaced at the end of September 2020. The petition says Tesla and other companies are switching to purchase solar products from China and existing production will be sent overseas to Malaysia. On 15 September, 500 workers at the Asarco copper processing plant in Hayden, Arizona, will be displaced as the mining company plans to ship concentrate that was to be processed in Arizona to Mexico. Some 110 workers at an Amarillo, Texas-based Asarco refinery are also being impacted. The displacement comes shortly after Asarco workers ended a nine-month strike in July 2020 after a NLRB ruling in their favor over new contract negotiations. Winoa USA shut down its Redford, Virginia-based steel abrasive plant in June 2020, sending the production equipment abroad to Canada and France. Thirty-eight workers were affected by the shudown. “It was very sudden. We didn’t have a lot of notice. Obviously the market had been up and down prior to that due to Covid, but we were all optimistic up until the decision was made to close the doors to the plant,” said a worker at the plant who requested to remain anonymous due to a confidentiality agreement. “I’m currently still unemployed, searching for work. Hopefully I can change that in the near future. It’s put me in a tough position.” Brooks Brothers and Winoa USA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",business
"Citigroup has appointed the Scottish-American banker Jane Fraser as its next chief executive, the first time a big Wall Street bank will be led by a woman. Fraser, who has worked for the lender for 16 years, will take over from Michael Corbat in February. Fraser was born in Scotland and studied economics at Cambridge University and Harvard Business School before starting her banking career at Goldman Sachs in London. Since then she has worked in roles across the world for a range of companies. Citigroup is one of the world’s biggest banks, with assets worth more than $2.2tn (£1.7tn) on its balance sheet at the end of June. The promotion will make Fraser one of the most prominent women in US business. Only 38 of the Fortune 500, which tracks the US’s biggest listed companies, had female chief executives at the start of August, according to CNN. Fraser will also be one of the few women at the top of the global banking industry. In the UK, NatWest Group – formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – appointed Alison Rose as its chief executive in September 2019, while in the public sector Christine Lagarde was made head of the European Central Bank in July 2019. Fraser was appointed as president of Citi last year when she took control of its global consumer banking division. Before that she had senior leadership roles for the bank in Latin America and in its US mortgages and mergers and acquisitions divisions. Prior to Citi, Fraser worked at the management consultancy McKinsey. Corbat will retire after eight years as chief executive and 37 years at the US bank. He took over in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when Citi received a $45bn government bailout, one of the biggest given to any bank. Since Corbat took over the bank’s share price has increased by more than 40%, although it has struggled to make up ground lost to rivals. Fraser’s first job will be to guide Citi through the extended period of economic weakness expected by many economists as the US and other major markets struggle to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. In July, the bank reported that net income in the second quarter of 2020 fell by 73% on the same three months last year as the bank set aside billions of dollar to cover bad loans. Fraser said: “I am honoured by the board’s decision and grateful to Mike for his leadership and support. We will invest in our infrastructure, risk management and controls to ensure that we operate in a safe and sound manner and serve our clients and customers with excellence. “Citi is an incredible institution with a proud history and a bright future.”",business
"Hotels and restaurants have been hit by a wave of cancellations as new coronavirus restrictions throw the country’s Christmas celebrations into doubt and raise the prospect of a fresh setback for the high street. If new rules banning gatherings of more than six people remain in place over the festive season, analysts say, the absence of Christmas parties and big family get-togethers could cost retailers billions of pounds in lost clothing and food sales. “I think that this could reduce retail spending by billions,” said independent retail analyst Richard Hyman. “Toys and presents will obviously be bought, but I think clothing sales will be hit.” “Clothing retailers need the fillip that is triggered by going to parties and family gatherings, and that’s clearly going to be very significantly curtailed. Why bother [buying something new]?” The festive season is when many retailers bank the lion’s share of their annual profits, and many stores are desperate to make up lost ground after being forced to close their doors for months during the lockdown. The weeks of frenetic socialising in the run-up to Christmas and new year are also extremely important to Britain’s pubs, restaurants and hotels. Some venues bank as much as 40% of their annual profits between Halloween and January. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the industry trade body, said its members had experienced an immediate drop in bookings, with tables even cancelled for Wednesday night after Boris Johnson announced the clampdown. The new rules threatened to undo the work of the government’s recent “eat out to help out” scheme, which had encouraged Britons to venture out of their homes and helped rebuilt confidence in the sector, she said. “The fear is that, having built momentum over August and brought back two-thirds of our workforce from furlough, consumers get nervous and feel they can’t go out,” explained Nicholls. “There was a very clear ‘Don’t socialise’ message [from the government].” The new restrictions in England and Scotland pose a fresh threat not only to restaurants and pubs that had started to get back on their feet, but also to nightclubs, events venues and hotels, whose livelihoods rely on the large gatherings that have not yet been allowed to resume. “We’ve seen lots of cancellations already and then there’s the question of what it means for planning for the October to December period,” said Nicholls. “You have still got a million people whose jobs are being subsidised. Those employment levels are looking unsustainable unless you are able to guarantee that you can open.” After what has been a year to forget for many people, Christmas was the one date people had to look forward to in their diaries. John Lewis opened its Christmas shop early after it found that searches for festive products had nearly quadrupled compared with last year. Last week online marketplace Notonthehighstreet said searches for “Christmas” on the gifting website were running at double last year’s level. The usual Christmas shopping jamboree was already under threat owing to the recession and the financial uncertainty faced by furloughed workers as the government scheme is withdrawn. Retailers also face the headache of adhering to social distancing rules at a time of year when stores usually throng with shoppers. The retail sector itself also remains in turmoil after the lengthy lockdown accelerated the transfer of sales from physical stores to the digital realm, contributing to a wave of store closures and administrations that has led to the loss of nearly 125,000 retail jobs. While DIY and homeware retailers have reported bumper sales as the shift to working from home, coupled with cancelled holidays, sees consumers spend money on sprucing up their homes, fashion retailers in particular have struggled. With nowhere to go, consumers have shunned their usual wardrobe updates and the absence of Halloween and Christmas parties will provide another excuse to cut back. “Clothing is the part of the retail sector that remains under the most amount of pressure by far,” said Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim. “There have been significant changes in consumer habits, we’re still not going out and socialising with the frequency that we were previously.” Lim added: “It’s about the feel-good factor, and this year, perhaps more so than in any other year in living memory, Christmas is going to be hugely important for many households and families. But people will be nervous about these restrictions and the last thing that retailers need at the moment is to put a dampener on Christmas spirits.”",business
"Scottish Power’s wind and solar farms will soon help produce green hydrogen to run buses, ferries and even trains as part of a pioneering strategic partnership to develop the UK’s nascent hydrogen economy. The renewable energy company, owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, will work alongside companies that specialise in producing and distributing the zero-carbon gas. Hydrogen is expected to play a major role in helping the UK to meet its climate targets. Scottish Power will use the clean electricity generated by a major new solar farm planned for a site near Glasgow to run an electrolyser, owned by its project partner ITM Power, which will split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The third company within the partnership, BOC, specialises in compressing and distributing gases and will help transport the hydrogen gas to councils, factories and transport depots across the country. “Green hydrogen is something that everyone is talking about,” said Lindsay McQuade, the head of renewables at Scottish Power, “but we wanted to do something about it. This is a pioneering partnership which brings together skills from all the companies involved.” The hydrogen gas can be used in place of methane-rich North Sea gas to run power plants, heavy machinery and transport vehicles without adding to the greenhouse gas emissions that are accelerating the climate crisis. Scottish Power’s first project will be based near a new solar farm that it plans to build near the site of the largest onshore windfarm in the UK: Whitelee, south of Glasgow. The site is also expected to be equipped with a “super battery”, which can store and release clean electricity when it’s needed. The plans are expected to be replicated across the country using Scottish Power’s windfarms, solar panels and battery installations to use renewable energy when it is at its cheapest to run the electrolysers that create hydrogen. “Our revolutionary approach – which really will be a game-changer – fully supports the large-scale transformation needed to replace heavy diesel vehicles with cleaner, greener alternatives,” McQuade said. She said that by working with industry leaders such as ITM Power and BOC the partnership would be able to offer the operators of heavy vehicle fleets and industry “a packaged solution that brings all of the pieces of the jigsaw together – production, distribution, supply” from as soon as 2022. “All they have to do is provide the vehicles,” she said.

"Governments must resist imposing spending cuts and hefty tax rises before their economies have recovered from the effects of coronavirus lockdowns, a leading global thinktank has warned. In its quarterly health check of the global economy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said it would be necessary to continue borrowing extra funds into next year to support the worst-hit households and businesses despite concerns about mounting public sector debts. In a clear shot across the bows of governments contemplating tax rises, including the UK, the OECD said public spending was needed to support a rebound in growth that had begun to slow in many countries since June, mainly on fears of further lockdowns this winter. “The aim must be to avoid premature budgetary tightening at a time when economies are still fragile,” said the organisation, which advises 36 mostly wealthy countries from its headquarters in Paris. Rishi Sunak has come under pressure from several Conservative backbenchers to quickly reduce spending and increase taxes to cap the UK’s borrowing, which is expected to hit almost £300bn in this financial year. On Tuesday, the chancellor refused to rule out tax rises in the next budget, which is expected in November, following questions in the Commons by the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. Speaking this week at the TUC conference, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the chancellor needed to pump further funds into the economy to replace the job retention scheme and “develop those sectors where it is most needed” – such as retail, hospitality and aviation. The OECD’s chief economist, Laurence Boone, said governments could revise the support they offer households and businesses as the needs of the economy shifted with a focus on higher welfare and training for those made redundant. She highlighted moves by the Netherlands government to pay a supplement to workers forced to take part-time jobs while also offering new forms of online training. However, she stressed that governments would need to continue running spending deficits next year while local lockdowns limited a rebound in GDP growth. “This is not asking governments to be profligate or calling for a spending spree when we say that support is needed next year. We are concerned about the people hit hardest by the pandemic and how they need support to find a new job,” she said. Since the OECD’s previous assessment in June, most developed countries have bounced back quickly and without the high levels of unemployment that were expected. Boone said the global economy would shrink by 4.5% this year, which was 1.5 percentage points less than was predicted in June, before rebounding by 5% next year. The UK’s growth forecast was revised upwards by 1.4 percentage points to -10.1% this year, which she said would be followed by a 7% increase in 2021. The largest revision was to US GDP, which three months ago was expected to contract by 7.3% in 2020 but is now forecast to shrink by only 3.8% before growing by 4% next year. Boone said the stimulus package agreed by Congress and the dramatic easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which cut rates to zero from last year’s 2.5% and expanded its quantitative easing programme by $700bn, helped boost growth. The report said: “The extensive policy actions undertaken as the pandemic developed have helped to prevent an even larger collapse and buffer the incomes of households and companies. “With the recovery remaining hesitant, sporadic outbreaks of the virus still occurring, and many sectors still struggling to adjust, fiscal and monetary policy support needs to be maintained to preserve confidence and limit uncertainty. “At the same time, a delicate balance has to be struck between facilitating the immediate recovery by supporting viable jobs and companies and ensuring that policy allows sufficient flexibility for necessary reallocation across sectors to occur over time. This calls for flexible and state-contingent policy support that can evolve as the recovery progresses.” Boone repeated the OECD’s call for greater cooperation to support countries that lack the infrastructure or borrowing capacity to offset the worst effects of the pandemic. India, South Africa, Mexico and Argentina will contract by more than 10% this year, she said, and only India will return to strong growth in 2021. Mexico will grow by 3%, Argentina by 3.2% and South Africa by only 1.4% in 2021.",business
"The value of “buy-now pay-later” finance group Klarna has soared past $10bn after investors pumped $650m into the Swedish payments company. The company said a new round of investor funding valued the company at $10.6bn (£8.1bn), a blockbuster figure that makes it the fourth-largest private fintech in the world. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, said the worlds of retail and finance had reached an “inflection point”. He added: “The shift to online retail is now truly supercharged,” adding that there had been “a very tangible change in the behaviour of consumers who are now actively seeking services which offer convenience, flexibility and control in how they pay”. Klarna is among a wave of fintech firms seducing shoppers on tight budgets. It bills itself as offering a “healthier, simpler and smarter alternative to credit cards” as shoppers can spread the cost of purchases over interest-free instalments. However, some financial experts fear easy-access digital loans could turn into a debt trap. Unlike traditional high-street credit products, Klarna earns fees from the retailers rather than from charging shoppers interest although some fintech companies, including Klarna, also offer interest-bearing products. Klarna now has more than 200,000 retailers on its books, including Asos, JD Sports and H&M in the UK, and 90 million customers worldwide. Retailers like the plans because shoppers using them typically spend more, more often. Investors clearly think the “buy-now pay-later” model has big potential, with the US private equity firm Silver Lake, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and BlackRock among the new investors. Indeed, Klarna has doubled in value over the past year as a 2019 investment round valued it at $5.5bn. Klarna’s growing worth comes despite the 15-year-old company making its first annual loss in 2019 as a result of a rising number of bad debts – a trend that has continued into this year. Andrew Quartermaine, of payments firm ACI Worldwide, said Klarna’s soaring valuation reflected the growing consumer demand for alternative ways to pay as well as altered shopping habits “as an increasing number of consumers choose to shop online due to the ongoing pandemic”.",business
"Kim Roe, 57, managing director of Circa Group, a conferences and events business based in Tunbridge Wells, was elated when she heard about the high court judgment in the Financial Conduct Authority’s test case on business interruption policies. “It’s a great relief,” she said. “It could save mine and hundreds of smaller businesses around the country.” Roe set up her business, which organises conferences and charity events, in 2009. The firm has been insured with Hiscox ever since. Hiscox was one of several insurance firms which had refused pay out on business interruption insurance claims caused by the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. “When the judgment came out, I checked and we are in the categories of those that should be covered,” she said.  Roe said it was “extremely frustrating and disappointing” to learn during the Covid-19 lockdown that Hiscox was refusing to acknowledge legitimate claims on the business interruption policy. “I feel the wording was clear on the policy. We’ve paid for it every year and that’s what insurance is for. If we’re covered, we’re covered. I feel they have to step up to the mark,” she said, adding that Hiscox’s refusal to pay out on it business interruption insurance policies was particularly disappointing because the insurer had a reputation for being good for small businesses. Before the pandemic, Circa Group employed eight people and also used a host of freelancers. Now it’s just Roe and one part-timer. “We lost all of our business for this year, every single event. A lot of things have been postponed into the second quarter of next year,” she said. Roe estimated that Circa lost £500,000 in business this year and will lose a further £1.5m next year, because of the cancellation of major events. She hopes to claim for those losses on the business interruption policy, and potentially future losses because the events and hospitality industry will take a long time to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. She believes the Hiscox policy provides cover for up to five years of losses. “We won’t be anywhere near our normal trading levels for three to five years because the conference and events industry has been massively hit,” she said.",business
"Costa Coffee is to cut up to 1,650 jobs in its cafes – more than one in 10 of its workforce, as it said trading remained challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, which was bought by Coca-Cola two years ago, said it had now reopened 2,400 of its 2,700 UK outlets – all of which closed for six weeks during the lockdown. It plans to reopen the remaining stores over the next month. All Costa staff were put on the furlough scheme with full pay but as that scheme winds to a close the coffee shop group said it would remove the assistant store manager role across all shops to cut costs. “While trade is returning, helped by the government’s VAT reduction, which Costa passed on to customers in full, and the recent [eat out to help out] scheme, there remain high levels of uncertainty as to when trade will recover to pre-Covid levels,” the company said in a statement. Costa’s move comes as service-sector companies in Britain cut jobs at a faster pace than in the 2008 financial crisis, according to a closely watched survey of business activity. Despite the return of economic growth as lockdown controls have been relaxed, IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply said the rate of redundancies accelerated in August. It said as many as one in three companies in a survey of 650 service sector firms had reduced their staffing levels last month, with businesses putting redundancy measures in place as their usage of the government’s furlough scheme winds down.  The job cuts at Costa come after rival coffee shop chain Pret a Manger said last week it planned to cut nearly 2,900 jobs after its sales plummeted. Airport and train station specialist SSP, which owns Caffé Ritazza and Upper Crust, said in July it would cut 5,000 jobs because of dwindling passenger numbers, while the high street cafe Le Pain Quotidien shed 200 staff and closed 11 of its 26 sites after falling into administration. In July, Coca-Cola said its sales of tea and coffee had fallen by nearly a third in the three months to June, largely due to the temporary closures of nearly all its Costa cafes in western Europe. Neil Lake, managing director for Costa Coffee UK and Ireland, said: “We have had to make these difficult decisions to protect the business and ensure we safeguard as many jobs as possible for our 16,000 team members, whilst emerging stronger ready for future growth.” Costa said it would seek to find those whose jobs were at risk alternative roles within the business where possible and provide support to help for those leaving the business.",business
"Willie Walsh is not quite enjoying the retirement he had planned. When his departure was announced in January, he had just led British Airways owner IAG to a €2.3bn pre-tax profit for 2019, its share price was moving back towards all-time highs, and as one of the FTSE 100’s longest-serving chief executives, he was preparing to step down in March. Fast-forward eight months and the world looks very different. After pushing back his leave date when the severity of Covid-19 became clear, Walsh will finally hand over the controls at IAG’s delayed annual meeting on Tuesday, at a time when the airline industry appears permanently changed by the pandemic and British Airways is flying only a fifth of its pre-crisis schedule. Instead of churning out profits, IAG made a €4.2bn loss in the first half of 2020, and Walsh himself will leave under the cloud of a potential shareholder revolt about his big pay packet at a time when the company is laying off thousands. Walsh is a rare thing in the airline industry: a former pilot who made it to the top of the boardroom. Starting at Aer Lingus before moving to British Airways in 2005, Walsh engineered BA’s 2011 merger with Spain’s Iberia to create a new, unorthodox group with separate management teams but shared costs in some central services. At Aer Lingus he earned the moniker “Slasher Walsh” after cutting thousands of jobs and selling off the company’s art collection. That approach has continued right until his last days in the job, with British Airways alone announcing plans to cut 12,000 jobs during the pandemic. It has made 6,500 voluntary redundancies so far, to the anger of unions, which argue that the company is taking advantage of the crisis. Investors at Tuesday’s meeting, to be held in Madrid, will have the chance to give Walsh a final bloody nose before his departure: the influential adviser Institutional Shareholder Services is urging investors to reject an £883,000 bonus to be awarded to the chief executive for 2019 in a non-binding vote on its pay report. Several major investors are said to have indicated that they will vote against the report. The company argues that the bonus relates to pre-pandemic performance and that Walsh’s pay has been cut by a fifth since April. However, there is little sign that the company’s at times uncompromising style under the chief executive will be abandoned. Walsh’s notoriously tough style has its advocates. John Strickland, who runs aviation analyst JLS Consulting, said that Walsh understood the importance of cost management to airlines even before the crisis, as budget airlines took market share. He adds that Walsh’s legacy is evident in IAG’s large cash reserves, which have allowed it to avoid government bailouts through the pandemic. Walsh will on Tuesday hand over to new chief executive Luis Gallego, the lieutenant whom he trusted to oversee Iberia’s turnaround in 2012. Chairman Antonio Vázquez last month announced his intention to retire in early January 2021, so the company’s recovery from the pandemic will be overseen by a new team. Gallego’s attention will be focused for months on the recovery effort – helped by a €2.75bn fundraising call, also to be voted through on Tuesday. But beyond the pandemic lies arguably a bigger challenge for an industry still hooked on fossil fuels: the climate crisis. Walsh has talked a good game, committing the company to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But aircraft technology lags far behind green ambitions, so Walsh leaves IAG with few clues to its long-term future.",business
"The Co-op is to create 1,000 jobs as it opens 50 new stores, becoming the latest supermarket to expand during the coronavirus pandemic. The jobs will be spread across the new shops and another 15 stores that will be enlarged as part of a £130m investment, the company said. Another 12 franchised stores, run with Co-op branding but owned by others, are also planned for 2020. It is the Co-op’s second hiring spree during 2020; it gave permanent jobs to 1,000 of 5,000 workers brought in to cope with an increased workload at the height of the UK’s lockdowns. The Co-op employs 55,000 workers across the UK, with 2,600 stores. While employment in high-street retail and hospitality sectors has been hit hard by the pandemic, supermarkets have had to contend with extra demand and new costs as the pandemic altered customer shopping habits. The pandemic has prompted a rapid acceleration in numbers of customers using supermarkets’ online grocery delivery services. A report by Waitrose has found that the number of UK consumers in the UK doing a weekly grocery shop online has doubled since the coronavirus lockdown, in a trend it described as “irreversible”. While the latest hiring by the Co-op will occur across the stores, many of its new workers are employed on online orders. Co-op workers collect orders within individual supermarkets for distribution, rather than rely on central fulfilment warehouses. The Co-op also has a distribution deal across 400 stores with Deliveroo, the delivery app that has expanded from takeaway food to groceries.",business
"It is almost 30 years since Australia last slid into recession, a now distant time when no one had heard of the internet and the Property Council had just appointed a young researcher called Scott Morrison. The then treasurer, Paul Keating, famously said it was the “recession we had to have”, but the slump prompted structural reforms and the economic scars were quickly healed as Australia rode the Chinese tiger to unprecedented prosperity. Fast-forward three decades and the path out of recession does not look so simple with unemployment climbing to more than 1 million. One expert says “nobody is safe” from redundancy. The combination of a recession and the coronavirus lockdown laid over the top poses a profound economic challenge for the future labour market. Low-hanging fruit such as productivity improvements and the transition to a service-based, global-facing economy have been plucked from the tree. The Reserve Bank was able to slash interest rates to stimulate growth back in 1991-92, but this time around borrowing costs are already at a record low and households are among the most indebted in the world. The entire shutdown of once thriving sectors in a matter of days gives this economic crisis a particularly vicious edge, with consumer-facing workers in the hospitality, entertainment and hotel industries the first to bear the brunt. Jobs that once looked future-proof were the next to go as the contagion spread throughout the economy. Qantas has gone from making record profits two years ago to its worst ever loss and thousands of redundancies last month. Its rival, Virgin Australia, collapsed altogether. Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, says “nobody is safe” and warns that we could end up in a widespread slump that could last several years. “Companies laid off workers because they can’t see customers coming back, such as Qantas and universities,” he says. “There will be more of that as we go along and as the government pulls back employee support such as jobkeeper.” Economists and consultants believe the double whammy of the current crisis will rapidly accelerate structural changes in the labour market that were already under way. Peter Wheeler, a partner in people and organisation at consultancy PwC, says challenges facing workers such as productivity, technology and gaps in skills already existed before the pandemic brought on the recession. “Covid and the recession has accelerated these things,” he says. “So while the change might have taken five years before, it is now happening in a matter of months.” Prof Jeff Borland, Truby Williams professor of economics at the University of Melbourne, agrees and says history shows the recession will “bunch together destructive forces” and spell bad news for some sectors. “During past recessions, manufacturing was very vulnerable as many jobs could be automated. It accounted for more than 20% of the workforce in the 70s but now represents just 7%. “I don’t see any reason why we won’t see this occurring again. Jobs that involve tasks that can be codified will slowly disappear such as machine operators or clerical jobs,” he says. The hollowing out of middle-income jobs is also a threat, Borland says, as the crisis speeds up what he calls “job polarisation” whereby the middle decline as low-skilled jobs and high-skilled jobs increase. Manufacturing is not the only sector that has declined in the last 30 years. Back then, 21% of the working population was employed in the retail and wholesale sector, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, compared with 13% in 2019. Agriculture has also halved from 5.5% to 2.6%. Construction, which expanded to employ 13% of the workforce by 2019 (15% of all men) from 9%, is in the doldrums thanks to a slump in building approvals, but is likely to benefit as governments throw money at infrastructure schemes to keep people in work. Stanford argues that only massive government intervention to support industry and create jobs in infrastructure projects and other programs could avert the disaster facing workers in many sectors who may never return to their jobs. “The public sector will expand in the coming years,” he says. “Government is the only actor with sufficient resources and authority to make things happen. It has incredible resources as we have seen and can roll things out super-quick. We’ve seen why we need strong government to protect people and the economy.” Another clear growth area that experts agree on is healthcare as the pandemic reshapes community priorities and the way we all live and work. Liam Harrison, a healthcare analyst at market research firm IBISworld, says the rollout of contact tracing to counter Covid-19 could be here to stay as it becomes more financially viable in future to track regular flu outbreaks. The need for more so-called telehealth, where contact between doctors and patients is minimised, will leave healthcare technology companies well placed to benefit and create jobs. “Demand is way up,” he says. As well as increased health spending across the board to deal with the pandemic and an ageing population, the aged care royal commission is likely to lead directly to higher staffing and more regulation in homes. Last year, a report by the consultancy McKinsey on the future of work in America identified the changes on the horizon in an analysis that can also be applied to some extent to the Australian economy. It said that while employment in office support and food service may decline, “healthcare, STEM occupations, creative and arts management, and business services” would see strong growth. The prediction about the arts industry now looks terribly wrong to the thousands of people left unemployed by Covid-19, but it illustrates a point by PwC’s Wheeler that we never really know everything about the jobs of the future, just that they will exist. Key transferrable skills such as digital literacy, data analytics, cybersecurity, robotics and AI will be crucial for young people to develop. But he also argues that soft skills such as emotional intelligence, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and creativity will also be crucial to the future of work. “New jobs will arise,” he says. “We don’t know the jobs of the future. We never did. But we know young people will have multiple careers and jobs and experience lifelong learning. Learning on the job will be more important than ever.”",business
"Consumers are being asked to rifle through their bins in order to weigh and record their daily food waste, in an ambitious trial that aims to reduce the 6.6m-tonne mountain of food thrown away by UK households every year. The UK’s largest supermarket, Tesco, has linked up with the environmental charity Hubbub to run the six-week experiment in which families will receive advice on meal planning and food storage along with recipe tips for using up leftovers. The results from 55 households will be used by Tesco and Hubbub to offer advice and practical steps to help cut food waste, which on top of its negative environmental impact typically costs a family of four about £60 a month. The UK has signed up to a global sustainable target of halving food waste by 2030. The trial takes place at a time when the UK lockdown has led to a dramatic change in the nation’s shopping and cooking habits. New polling of about 2,000 adults for Tesco found that 67% now felt differently about food. Almost a third of respondents (29%) said the pandemic had made them value food more. “Lockdown has driven the biggest change to the nation’s food habits in generations, and many of us have experienced shortages for the first time,” said Aoife Allen of Hubbub. “Cutting food waste has proved a stubborn challenge and we are a long way from the goal of halving food waste.” Supermarkets have been criticised for wasting food in their supply chains that could be diverted to food banks. Tesco was the first to publicise its figures.  In 2018 Sainsbury’s abandoned a £10m scheme to halve food waste after a year-long trial in a Derbyshire town produced disappointing results. The Waste Less, Save More experiment fell far short of its 50% target, with households thought to have cut waste by only 9% while telling Sainsbury’s the issue was not a priority for them. However, lockdown has thrown up new challenges and in July the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, said self-reported food waste was up by 30%, reversing progress made at the start of the pandemic as consumers threw away less food while confined to their homes. In Tesco’s research, 35% of people said they reduced their food waste during lockdown and 75% said they had kept this up since restrictions were lifted. Nearly two-thirds (61%) were cooking with leftovers every week, while 32% were planning meals and almost a quarter (22%) were batch-cooking and freezing more.  Only 3% of those who cut food waste during lockdown said they did not plan to continue these new habits in future.",business
"Nottingham city council’s failed energy supplier, Robin Hood Energy, has agreed to sell thousands of customer accounts to British Gas, and will make hundreds of employees redundant before closing later this year. The council-run energy company, one of the first in the UK, informed staff on Thursday that 250 people would lose their jobs following a deal to sell its customer base to the UK’s biggest energy supplier. The deal will result in 112,000 households and 2,600 business customers being transferred to British Gas, five years after Robin Hood Energy was set up to challenge the dominance of the UK’s big six energy suppliers. The closure of Robin Hood Energy follows a damning report from auditors at Grant Thornton this summer which found that the not-for-profit company had lost a total of £34.4m by March 2019 despite receiving £43m of public cash and £16.5m of loan guarantees. The report dealt a severe blow to the UK’s experiment with council-run energy suppliers, which had previously won the support of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Nottingham council leader, David Mellen, said: “We know this is a very sad day for the business and its employees who have played a part in creating a more dynamic and customer orientated market for all energy consumers.” Nottingham city council launched Robin Hood Energy in 2015 with the intention of offering customers green electricity at an affordable price. Bristol city council followed suit with Bristol Energy the year after. But both council-run suppliers have struggled to stay afloat as a deluge of investor-backed challenger brands entered the market. Robin Hood Energy reported a writedown of £24m on its loans this year, and a financial loss of £22.5m for the financial year ending in 2019 before putting its customers up for sale. The deal comes weeks after Bristol Energy put itself up for sale after reporting a loss of £10m for the 2018-19 financial year. Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas parent company Centrica, said all customers joining the supplier from Robin Hood would be offered a green electricity tariff at the same rate as they paid before. “We are delighted to welcome Robin Hood customers to British Gas,” he said.",business
"Three million fewer passengers travelled on Britain’s trains on Tuesday than a year ago, with only a slight increase in commuters rather than the widespread post-Covid return to offices that the government had urged. Figures from train operators indicated that total journeys were just 38% of the equivalent day in 2019, a proportion that had been steadily increasing over the last two months but is only marginally higher than last week. An average 5 million passengers a day were travelling by rail in late 2019. Network Rail said footfall in its managed stations, the busiest in London, England and Scotland, was 6% higher than the same day last week but still 60% lower than usual. Separate figures for transport use last week, published by the Department for Transport on Wednesday, showed train journeys on Monday 24 August at 38% of 2019 levels (averaging 33% for the rest of the working week, in provisional figures that are expected to be revised upwards). The train operators’ figures are consistent with data from Transport for London on Tuesday that showed only a negligible increase in tube and bus journeys in the capital, amid increasing concern for the economy and future of cities, with Britons lagging behind other countries in returning to the office. In the Canary Wharf financial district of London, and Manchester’s Spinningfields, the start of the post-bank holiday working week brought a “trickle, not a torrent” of employees making it back into offices. The rail industry is regarding next Monday, 7 September, as a key marker, a day when more train services will be restored, including a full timetable in some commuter networks, after many operators ran a reduced service during the lockdown. There is growing pressure to overhaul rail fares, as part-time working makes season tickets unviable, while the cost of individual peak-time tickets is a prohibitive daily expense for many living in commuter belts. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the Commons that the government was “working at pace with rail companies to try to deliver new products in terms of ticketing that would ensure better value and enable people to get back to work in a flexible way”. Most train operators remain locked in negotiations with the DfT over the renewal of emergency agreements, due to expire later this month. The government suspended franchises in March after advising the public, apart from key workers, to stay at home and avoid public transport due to the pandemic. The Treasury expects to have spent an additional £3.5bn by September 21 in underwriting the rail network. ",business
"Businesses are offering incentives such as free food, extra childcare and even executive parking spaces to coax staff back into the office but could fall foul of employment law if perks aren’t distributed fairly, according to experts. While many companies and trade bodies have cautioned against putting pressure on staff to return, some firms have come up with offers for those that do so. Bankers at Goldman Sachs’ London office have been given free takeaway breakfast and lunch, having previously had to pay for food. Before the pandemic, they were entitled to 20 days of free childcare at an onsite creche, but can now claim an extra 10 days as they try to juggle childcare and work. Rival bank JP Morgan built an internal smartphone app that allows senior bankers who are on holiday to donate their parking spots at Canary Wharf, east London, to more junior staff willing to come into the office but worried about travelling on public transport. The bank has also opened up the changing rooms at its pay-to-use gym for staff who want to change after cycling or jogging to work. But employment lawyers said firms needed to be careful about ensuring they did not discriminate against staff who stayed at home, including those with disabilities. “There is a risk in offering an incentive to someone who comes into the office and not to someone who doesn’t,” said Rustom Tata, an employment law expert and chairman of the City law firm DMH Stallard. “If an employer is offering a policy such as free meals, they may have to consider whether they offer an equivalent benefit to someone who isn’t coming into the office for reasons to do with a disability. “Administering all of that is a nightmare. You’re almost better off giving it to everybody or nobody.” Several employment lawyers said firms should also check whether perks such as parking spaces or offers to fund congestion charge payments would be treated as a taxable benefit by HM Revenue & Customs. Tata said: “The other thing they have to do is not appear to be placing undue pressure on the employee to come in, particularly if they haven’t properly done their risk assessment and consulted with employees as part of that. “You can see some employers saying we’ll bung you a meal and hope you turn a blind eye to that.” Despite the government’s push to convince people to come back to offices, David Wreford, a partner at global human resources firm Mercer, said most firms were focusing on helping staff who did not want to or could not return. “I haven’t heard of a single company – and we’ve talked to a hell of a lot – who say it hasn’t worked,” he said, of people working from home. “I don’t think companies are in the mindset of hurrying people back to the office.” Employees have also enjoyed working from home, with nine out of 10 keen to continue doing so, according to a survey of more than 20,000 people conducted by Cardiff and Southampton universities. Workspace, a property firm that makes money by leasing office space, has been less keen on home working, telling staff to come to the office where possible. A company spokesperson said staff who were unable to do so for health reasons could work remotely and flexible working patterns had been created. But they added: “We have already seen the benefits of this return and believe the office fosters strong collaboration and a unified company culture.” The Health and Safety Executive continues to advise that “everyone who can work from home should do so”.",business
"Locked-down punters swapping sports betting for online poker and casino games during the coronavirus crisis helped the Paddy Power and Sky Bet owner, Flutter Entertainment, to report better-than-expected profits in the first half of 2020. The world’s largest online betting company, created via the $12bn (£9.1bn) merger of Flutter and Canada’s The Stars Group, said pre-tax profits fell by 70% to £24m in the six months to the end of June. The decline was largely because of costs and accounting changes associated with the merger. Flutter’s chief executive, Peter Jackson, lauded a performance that resulted in the enlarged firm brushing off the effect of the pandemic lockdown, which led to cancelled or postponed sports events and the closure of its network of high street bookmakers in the UK and Ireland. Jackson said the impact of the pandemic on sport was “more than offset by an increase in the number of recreational customers playing our poker and gaming products globally, as people sought new forms of home entertainment”. The group managed to increase revenue from sports betting in the US and Australia, where horse racing has continued during the pandemic and enjoyed greater television prominence as other sports stopped. Analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies described Flutter’s performance as “another upbeat gambling sector update”, with the rise of online poker and casino games largely cushioning the blow of the pandemic for the industry. The merger with The Stars Group has increased the company’s spread across regions and forms of gambling, particularly poker. PokerStars, acquired as part of the merger, increased its revenue by 40% in the first half to £697m. Gaming grew by 43%, with overall poker revenue up 38% and casino growth of 51%. Jackson said Flutter was in good shape coming out of lockdown, as the online gaming customers picked up during lockdown appear to have stuck with the company, while sports revenue had returned as sports such as football pick up where they left off. “Looking ahead, we have identified promising opportunities to increase investment across the group and, while the outlook with respect to Covid-19 remains highly uncertain, the diversification of our group means we approach the future with confidence,” Jackson said. The group has also built a promising business in the US market, which has been rapidly expanding after sports betting regulations were relaxed. Flutter has established a beachhead in North America via the acquisition of the fantasy sports betting platform FanDuel and the Fox Bet brand.",business
"The jet engine maker Rolls-Royce gave a stark warning about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the business as it reported a record £5.4bn loss for the first half of the year. The company does not expect orders to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2025. The pandemic led to a slump in demand for its engines as airlines reduced flights and aircraft manufacturers slowed production. Rolls-Royce originally expected to make 450 engines during 2020 but now plans to deliver just 250. It continues to burn through cash, and expects to have burned through £4bn by the end of the year, and said it may not be able to find enough funding to cover its needs. Announcing its results for the first half of the year, it said: “The inherent uncertainty over the severity, extent and duration of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore the timing of recovery of commercial aviation to pre-crisis levels and the availability of sufficient funding, represent material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.” Rolls-Royce is undertaking the largest restructuring in its history and, as a result, will close several production sites, including Barnoldswick, in Lancashire, and Annesley, in Nottinghamshire, as it consolidates its operations. Rolls-Royce previously announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs globally, more than 15% of its workforce, because of the pandemic, with UK staff making up two-thirds of the total. The company said 2,500 of its UK workers had applied for voluntary redundancy or agreed to take early retirement, substantially reducing the need for compulsory redundancies. To date, 4,000 people in its civil aerospace business have left the company, reducing its global workforce to 48,000; a further 5,000 are due to leave before the end of the year. Rolls-Royce predicts pre-tax savings of at least £1.3bn by the end of 2022 from its restructuring programme. As part of the attempts to shore up its balance sheet for the longer term, it is looking to sell at least £2bn worth of assets, including the Spanish engine maker ITP Aero. The company said it had taken decisive action when the pandemic began to affect its business, such as its restructuring programme, but it only expected deliveries of large engines to increase from 2022. Alongside its results Rolls-Royce announced that its finance chief, Stephen Daintith, was leaving after less than four years to join Ocado, the grocery delivery company. The company said its defence business had remained resilient during 2020 and demand from its key government customers was unchanged. Covid-19 has had an “unprecedented impact on the civil aviation sector”, said the Rolls-Royce chief executive, Warren East. The restructuring “will significantly reduce our cost base, which, combined with recovery in power systems and continued resilience in defence, will help us to deliver significantly improved returns as the world recovers from the pandemic,” he said. The amount of cash Rolls-Royce is burning through is “simply unsustainable”, said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at aviation consultancy StrategicAero Research. “Its strategy to sell off assets to generate cash is a limited option – what will they do when there’s nothing left to sell?” Managing the fallout from the coronavirus crisis will be East’s greatest challenge at the jet engine maker, said Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. “With its reputation currently diminishing, shareholders starting to bail out and the full force of Covid headwinds yet to come, East still has a lot of work to do to make sure Rolls-Royce can ride out the storm,” she said. The company said it would scrap its dividend while the economic outlook remained uncertain.",business
"The annual Davos gathering of world leaders, billionaires and business executives on a mountain in Switzerland has been delayed by Covid-19 until the summer of next year. Announcing the move because of health and safety concerns, the World Economic Forum – which has been putting on the meeting of the global elite at a Swiss ski resort for half a century – said it would hold several virtual events in January instead. Regarded as a cornerstone event for international relations, business and the world economy, the event normally takes place at the end of January each year and is attended by heads of government, company chief executives, celebrities and activists from across the globe. “The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the ‘Great Reset’ in the post-Covid-19 era is so urgent. However, the advice from experts is that we cannot do so safely in January,” the WEF said. The dates and location of a rescheduled 2021 annual meeting will be made available as soon as the health and safety of guests and the host community high in the Swiss Alps can be guaranteed, it added. Almost 3,000 people head to Davos each year, with many of the world’s super-rich flying in by private jet to discuss issues ranging from global heating to inequality, technology and business. At its 50th annual meeting earlier this year, as many as 53 heads of state from around the world joined the event, including the US president, Donald Trump, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.",business
"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has renewed his attack on HSBC for the bank’s alleged treatment of pro-democracy customers in Hong Kong, saying that China is “bullying” the UK. Pompeo, who in June accused HSBC of a “corporate kowtow” to Beijing, cited reports of Hong Kong-based executives at Next Media being unable to access their bank accounts. He accused the bank, which is based on London but makes most of its profits in Hong Kong and China, of “maintaining accounts for individuals who have been sanctioned for denying freedom for Hongkongers while shutting accounts for those seeking freedom”. “Free nations must ensure that corporate interests are not suborned by the CCP [Chinese Communist party] to aid its political repression,” Pompeo said on Wednesday. “We stand ready to help the British government and its companies resist CCP bullying and stand for freedom.” HSBC, which is struggling to balance its need to stay in favour with China while the US and Britain remain critical of Beijing’s handling of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, declined to comment. The bank has also come in for criticism from Aviva Investors, one of Britain’s biggest investors and a top 20 shareholder, after Peter Wong, HSBC’s Asia-Pacific chief executive, signed a petition that backed China’s plans to enact a sweeping security law in Hong Kong. Last month, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, reprimanded HSBC and other banks for supporting the controversial security law, saying the rights of the people of Hong Kong should not be sacrificed for bankers’ bonuses. HSBC’s chief executive and his counterpart at Standard Chartered – which is also London-based but also one of Hong Kong’s biggest banks – have already been censured in a letter from Labour frontbenchers. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, urged both CEOs to withdraw their support for legislation. The members of the shadow cabinet warned the banks in a letter that they could face a boycott and urged them to uphold Britain’s democratic values. The US has criticised Beijing’s crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong after the security law was imposed on 30 June. The move by Beijing has also been widely condemned by other western nations. The Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy activist and top executive at Next Digital, was arrested this month under the law, further stoking concerns about media and other freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to China in 1997.",business
"New Look is seeking a three-year rent holiday on 68 of its stores and big rent reductions on hundreds of others as it battles to stay afloat and save the jobs of its 11,200 employees. The fast-fashion chain is attempting to secure its second  rescue deal in 18 months and, along with the payment holiday, is asking landlords to slash rents to between about 2% and 12% of sales – on a further 402 of its shops. Such rents are not only likely to be lower than current levels but more flexible in the event of further high street lockdowns.  New Look said its debt holders had agreed to inject £40m in new cash into the business and cut debts by about £440m to about £100m if landlords would agree to the rent cuts. In return, landlords will be able to exit leases more easily if they can secure better terms elsewhere, raising the prospect that dozens of New Look stores will close. Landlords and other creditors representing at least 75% of the value of the firm’s debts must vote to approve the rent-cutting deal, an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), at a meeting on 15 September. New Look has also given commitments not to drop the amount of rent paid by more than 15% year on year during the CVA period, no matter how stores perform, and to continue to pay service charges, including business rates. If the deal does not go ahead New Look is at risk of collapsing, with the potential loss of more than 11,200 staff jobs and hundreds more agency workers at its warehouse. The company’s banks and other lenders have promised to swap most of its debts for equity in the business in order to help keep New Look afloat. A buyer is being sought as an alternative source of new funds but it is thought unlikely one will be found in the current climate. Nigel Oddy, the chief executive, said New Look was launching the latest CVA “out of absolute necessity”. He said sales in stores that had reopened after lockdown remained down by more than 30% on average. The high streets remained quiet and it was not clear how long it would take for shoppers to return, he added. Oddy said New Look’s latest ranges were doing well online and its strategy to broaden its appeal and offer good value on local high streets could succeed. “I firmly believe there is still a place for New Look in the retail market,” he said. However, he said New Look could not continue to pay rents at historical rates. “[The] magnitude and speed of the shift in consumer behaviour and confidence nationwide requires a change in the way leases are structured in order to manage uncertainty so that stakeholders share both risk and upside, and to ensure continued business viability,” Oddy said. “Covid-19 has changed the retail environment beyond recognition, accelerating the permanent structural shift in customer spend and behaviour from physical retail to online, which we have seen in recent trading. Despite this, we still fundamentally believe the physical store has a significant part to play in the overall retail market and our [online] strategy.”",business
"Brands often outsource their manufacturing processes – but they need more than their suppliers’ reassurance that the conditions and practices in their factories are up to scratch. Regulators usually go into such sites only if they have reason to suspect wrongdoing. Auditing is supposed to ensure that workers’ rights are routinely respected – and give brands an ethical “seal of approval” to reassure investors and customers. In reality, there is huge variation in standards and approaches. While some audits entail genuine scrutiny, critics say others can be seen as tick-box exercises designed to give brands deniability if problems later emerge. There are hundreds of factories In Leicester’s sprawling textiles industry, many of them subcontractors making clothes for a brand that might not even know they exist. Standards, output and even the locations of these businesses are notoriously hard to track, and whistleblowers who may not have the right to work in the UK themselves but are prepared to go to the authorities are few and far between. Social audits look at issues from fire safety to workplace discrimination to standards at subcontractors – and, crucially in Leicester, whether workers are paid the minimum wage. Audits are a hoop that factories typically have to jump through if they want to get a contract with a particular brand. If they refuse to do so, they won’t get the orders. But if they participate and the results are positive, they may then wish to share the audit with other prospective buyers. It depends on the brand. Some companies, such as Primark, are understood to have in-house teams that work exclusively on their behalf. Others, such as Asos, River Island and Marks & Spencer use a combination of their own teams and external specialists.  Definitely not – but there are some common practices and benchmarks. Many fashion and textile companies have signed up to the Fast Forward programme, which means that auditors use a shared methodology and assess factories against set criteria. This will potentially identify compliant or leading practices, raise areas for improvement, or uncover serious issues. They may also be signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative, an umbrella group that has a base code founded on the International Labour Organization’s benchmarks. Then there is the Smeta system, a template for audits that are then put on to the widely used Sedex platform for suppliers to share as they wish. Boohoo has resisted membership of the ETI and does not subscribe to the Fast Forward programme. It has also refused to publish a list of its suppliers. It contracted the external auditors Verisio and Bureau Veritas in 2019 and has increased inspections in Leicester in recent weeks.  Audits can be a critically important tool for businesses with a genuine interest in ensuring they have an ethical supply chain. It is important to note, though, that they provide a snapshot of issues at a particular time and may not account for subsequent changes in practices. Done badly, they can be a smokescreen for companies that have no serious intention of changing their ways. Reformers are particularly critical of what they see as superficial tick-box audits carried out by inspectors under time pressure, and conducted at significant expense. These may, for example, examine a set of payslips and conclude that minimum wage is being paid, but fail to interview the workers who might tell them otherwise. In these cases, critics say, audits can be a lucrative whitewash, and there may be no incentive to report negative findings. This means that while audits are vital, they may not be enough to gain a clear picture of the fair treatment of workers on their own. ",business
"I am 20 minutes into my scheduled 30-minute call with Shivani Maitra when I start to freeze. Maitra, a partner at global consultancy firm Deloitte, is leading the firm’s post-Covid-19 research into the future of work, and is giving me a seamless analysis of what business is about to look like: more autonomy, more remote work, happier workers, more accessible leadership – all facilitated by technology. But I can’t get Skype for Business to function. It’s a hot day and the connection comes and goes, leaving me contorted and sweating over my laptop. Maitra is not necessarily wrong, but as my kids (aged three and five) thunder into the room, I can’t help but think we have some way to go. Los Angeles-based tech company PORTL Inc has promised that, in five years’ time, we will all be able to beam life-sized, talking holograms of our colleagues into our homes; right now, I think an impenetrable forcefield around my desk would be more useful. “Technology is going to be key to how we work in the future,” Maitra concedes. “But it’s going to be an enabler – it’s not going to be an answer.” It is too early to know exactly what Covid-19 will do to office-based work (you can’t “WFH” – work from home – on a factory line, or as a surgeon, obviously). But many businesses are predicting that whatever happens next – even if there is a vaccine – this moment could represent the end of the nine-to-five as we know it, and in particular the end of vast corporate offices with banks of identikit desks. According to a recent study by Morgan Stanley, only 34% of UK workers who could go back to the office have actually done so, and many businesses have publicly stated that they will extend the option to WFH indefinitely. Facebook has said that 50% of its jobs will be remote within 10 years; Twitter is letting almost all its global workforce WFH forever, if they like; global law firm Slater and Gordon has given up its London office; fund manager Schroders says staff can continue to work flexibly for an indefinite period, as have investment bank JP Morgan and legal firm Linklaters. Work that would previously have been considered impossible to do remotely moved online within a matter of weeks of the UK going into lockdown.  But this doesn’t mean all business districts are going to remain ghost towns. Organisations can’t just tear up their leases, and many are wary of going completely remote. They want to keep a space to bring teams together, if only occasionally. How to do this safely, without encasing everyone in Perspex or turning office blocks into hundreds of self-contained pods is the critical question. (Multimillionaire Xu Weiping plans to release prototype cube offices this autumn, as he redevelops part of London’s Royal Albert Dock.) Darren Comber is chief executive of Scott Brownrigg, an international design practice specialising in the built environment, which not only shifted to remote working at the beginning of the pandemic, but also shifted the focus of its 300 staff to looking at ways of minimising contagion. “One of the biggest things that has to happen is access to fresh air,” he says. “At the moment, only 10% of the air, typically, in an air-conditioned building is fresh, and 90% is recirculating. We’re going to see that flip around completely, because people want cleaner, healthier environments, and are less tolerant of somebody getting a cold at one end of an air-conditioned space, and then everyone getting it. That technology already exists. It’s more expensive, but what’s the human cost? Your staff will simply say, ‘I’m not going to go in.’” Instead, Comber is looking at the introduction of hydroxyl radicals into indoor air. “These occur naturally outside, and are one reason your chances of catching something outdoors are less. UV lighting is making a massive difference, too.” He is keen on giving buildings, including offices, health badges, “in the same way that you have a hygiene rating system for restaurants”. Other tech solutions include contactless facial recognition to gain access to a building; voice-activated doors, windows and blinds; app-controlled vending machines; and smart wearables that detect signs of illness, or alert you whenever someone strays into your personal space. (Raising the question of how much personal data we might be prepared to hand over to our bosses, just to get back to the daily grind.) “We have all just been through the biggest work-life experiment in decades,” says Emma Morley, office designer and founder of trifle* creative, who has worked with companies including online stationers moo.com, Coco de Mer and Soho House. Despite having had to radically alter her latest project, a 40,000 sq ft, 500-person, 25-meeting room office building, she is excited about what this year might offer. (Social distancing means that, where there would have been six desks, there is now only room for two, with wider corridors, and far more circulation space.) “Rather than feeling hindered, let’s turn that around and say we’ve got the greatest opportunity to create a workspace design revolution. We can say to people: what do workspaces really need to be? Because if we don’t need all those desks, happy days. Desks take up 70-80% of space – and if we’ve all got a desk or table at home that we can work on, then when we go into the office it’s about collaboration, socialisation and sharing ideas. I’ve been talking about this for 15 years – about the importance of having different types of space to work, about not filling spaces with desks, because desks are not the best places to come up with ideas. And, now, all of a sudden, it’s here.” Morley has chosen a hybrid setup for her own team, which she plans to phase in this month, as long as it seems safe to do so. “We will be together two days a week, and three days a week from home,” she says. “As humans, we need to be together. Collaboration does not happen very easily over Zoom.” Even before the pandemic, the senior team at Awin, a global affiliate marketing agency with staff in 20 countries, was planning a major shift away from the office, having already experimented with remote working among its UK staff. When the crisis hit in early March, they were ready. “We didn’t want to take any risks – we shut everything down almost overnight,” says Adam Ross, COO, who was happy to take a breather after six years of constant travel between the UK and Berlin offices. “All 1,200 staff: one day they were in the offices and the next day they weren’t, and everything worked perfectly.” After a virtual workshop in which the board planned for a fully remote 2023, they realised that most of what they wanted to achieve in three years could be done now. When the staff were surveyed and found to be in favour, the board decided not only to move to an entirely remote workforce, but also to a flexible four-day working week (with no salary reduction), which they hope to introduce early next year. “We realised everyone needed more time, whether for home schooling, or younger kids and the nightmare of that. Or if you don’t have family, you need time for you – so we gave everybody Friday afternoons off. It was incredibly well-received, and it didn’t reduce productivity. So we thought, ‘How can we go one better?’” In order to implement a four-day week, “we are looking at automation, easing some of that grunt work. We believe this is the way forward,” Ross says. They intend to shrink their offices, keeping some space for collaboration, but with few or no desks. “We are going to actively discourage coming into the office every day,” Ross says. “We’re very conscious of the pitfalls that might come from having a hybrid situation, because you end up with a weird halfway house and nobody knows where they stand.” A 2019 study published in the academic journal Organization Science showed that remote employees have to do more than their in-house counterparts to get their achievements noticed, often making more personal sacrifices to do so. Although it’s too soon to have data on this, it seems likely that this will apply most to younger or newer remote employees. “Our younger staff, when we surveyed them, did report that they loved [office] culture,” Ross says. “We had a vibrant atmosphere and a beautiful space. But [the results] were still overwhelmingly in favour of more flexibility, depending on the age group – older staff were less keen on coming in at all, and younger people wanted to come in one or two days a week.” An Awin taskforce is now researching a package to help people work wherever they choose, potentially also contributing to home broadband or utility bills. “If you give people trust, and you respect that they need a work-life balance, then they give it back to you in spades,” Ross explains. At the award-winning architectural firm Selencky Parsons, most of the team are already – safely – back in their London office, with newly spaced-out desks all facing away from each other. “Most of our employees are young, and they don’t have massive homes to work in,” says co-founder David Parsons. The business managed lockdown by instituting virtual morning meetings and Friday beers (they got a local brewery to deliver to everyone’s home), along with Zoom quizzes. “And that was fine for about 10 weeks, but what started to worry me was a lack of enthusiasm in the team.” He also worried that some staff were very lonely. Although there was plenty of work coming in, productivity seemed to drop. “It wasn’t that people weren’t working as hard. It was that they weren’t getting to the answers as quickly – not feeling like they could call and ask any question, at any time, as they would if they were physically next to us.” His concern was that his younger team members were missing out on both formal and informal incidental learning. “The amount you learn from just listening to other people’s conversations is huge. To be completely isolated from all that, I think, is a big problem,” he says. This year’s abrupt shift to remote work has better suited more experienced workers, who are less in need of on-the-job training and career development, and who are more likely to live somewhere with room for a desk. A woman in her early 30s who works for a large organisation (and asked to be anonymous) told me, “It’s quite a shock, as when all this started we were told to expect a phased return in September, and then maybe not till next year. But now it’s pretty much: ‘Expect this indefinitely, with the odd day in.’ I am still coming to terms with it. I’m single, so it really is just me, all day long. Working from home suits middle-class families who have enough space and a garden. I worry about my future and meeting new people organically.” Another woman told me about a flatshare in which the living room had been repurposed as a bedroom, to lower the rent; as a consequence, four people were all working full-time in the kitchen. Untold numbers are perched at worktops, on their beds or, in the case of my friend Jo, an ironing board. Remote work may be very hard for some (it is also tough on carers of all kinds), but in the longer run, the tilt away from five days in the office may mean more choice about where to live. If you’re only visiting the office once or twice a week, you can live farther from it, perhaps somewhere more affordable. If you rarely visit at all, you can, in theory, live almost anywhere. And, as Maitra points out, this could create a more diverse workforce: “The most far-reaching effect is going to be [organisations saying]: ‘You can live anywhere you want to, but you could still come and work for me.’ People then don’t have to live in expensive city flats.” Will workforces move away from cities in general, and from overpriced London and the south-east in particular? The book publisher Hachette recently surveyed its staff about which UK cities they would like to live in, and is now hunting for regional hub offices in Edinburgh, Newcastle, Manchester, Sheffield and Bristol to match the results. The pandemic has opened up a home-buying rush in the countryside: inquiries from city dwellers across the UK who want to move to a village are up 125%, according to Rightmove – and one reason is the disappearance of the commute. Some of the downsides to remote working will take longer to reveal themselves. While people working from home may currently appear highly productive, pre-Covid research by Cardiff University, carried out in 2017, showed that they are also prone to longer hours, and struggle to set boundaries between work and home life. Even before the pandemic, remote workers reported comparatively high stress levels, according to a 2017 UN report (41% of remote workers compared with 25% of office workers). For every Awin, which has 70 volunteers working in five taskforces (known as Wherever/Whenever; Office Redesign; Four-Day Week; Change in Mindset and Culture; Ease Workloads), there is another organisation whose employees feel abandoned. “My company has decided to go fully remote and I am despairing about it,” says Paul, an IT developer. “I used to be notorious for how fast I worked, but it was because I’d give myself incentives – lunch with a colleague, or getting out on time for a drink. Now I mostly feel like I’m wading through treacle.” Some employees are working at an unsustainable speed because they don’t want to be forced back into an office, or because they are afraid they will lose their jobs. Juliet, who works in exhibitions, tells me: “Everybody is up for the chop. I’m trying to be as indispensable as I can. I find myself logging on at all times. The boundary between on and off is very blurred. We’re all vying to show how productive we are.” Laura, a manager who works in the energy industry, also struggles with virtual presenteeism. “Leading a team, I feel pressure to be available and online through extended hours. I need to believe it’s OK to close the laptop and switch off.” Lucy, who works in marketing and has small children, tells me she is at breaking point: “Every moment is interrupted or interruptible. My husband and I both work every weekday evening to keep up, despite not having a commute to eat into our time. There are no real breaks.” This autumn marks a critical moment in our work culture: could it be the tipping point where office work changes unrecognisably, and for the better? Or will less enlightened organisations see it as a chance to lower their overheads, encouraging staff to work remotely and then failing to support or nurture them? For now, a hybrid model, blending the best of both worlds, looks the best bet. If you eliminate the office completely, Emma Morley argues, you eliminate “the culture and community that a business creates, and the opportunities for human beings to thrive and grow”. Whatever they choose to do, employers need to embrace the fact that this has been a year of unimaginably rapid change for their staff. Getting work wrong could lead to an epidemic of burnout. But getting it right could have huge dividends, for everyone. All employee names have been changed.",business
"The former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has returned to his roots as an investment banker with a job spearheading environmental and social investing for a Toronto-based asset manager. Carney will join Brookfield Asset Management, which ranks as the world’s second-largest investor in climate-friendly businesses behind the US firm Blackstone with about $550bn in assets under management. Bruce Flatt, Brookfield’s chief executive, said Carney would join the firm as vice-chairman and steer its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment strategy, with the task of marrying double-digit returns with positive social and environmental outcomes. A Canadian who also holds Irish and British citizenships, Carney left the Bank of England in March just before the Covid-19 crisis hit the UK and the government forced the economy into lockdown. City analysts expected him to be courted by the world’s largest investment firms after a lifetime building up one of the most extensive contacts books in the finance industry. Blackrock, which employs the former chancellor George Osborne, was known to be interested. Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker who was governor of Canada’s central bank for five years until 2013 when he took over at Threadneedle Street, was also the head of the G20’s financial stability board for eight years from 2011, which put him in touch with a wide range of finance ministers, central bank governors and sovereign wealth fund bosses. He moved back to Ottawa, Canada’s capital city, fuelling speculation that he planned to go into politics. In January Boris Johnson appointed Carney his finance adviser for the flagship COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, but this was delayed by a year due to the Covid crisis. Carney is also a UN special envoy for climate and finance. “Based on our fundraising capacity, the operating businesses and background that we have, and Mark’s relationships and strategic knowledge of this area, I think we can become a category killer in ESG investing,” Flatt said. It is not known how much Carney will be paid at Brookfield, but while at the Bank, Carney was one of the world’s best-paid central bankers with remuneration of £882,885 including pension benefits and a housing allowance during the last financial year. He said last year in an interview: “The question particularly for asset owners, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others is: How are you oriented? Are you on the right side, or the wrong side, of history?” He added: “I didn’t want to just go back into the private sector, to straight commercial life. Having something where I could see the potential impact and the marrying of the commercial with the purpose was pretty important to me.”",business
"The traditional end-of-summer commuter crush appears unlikely to materialise next week as companies and staff shun the office and embrace remote working, prompting a warning from the UK’s leading business body about the future of firms that rely on passing trade. Hundreds of thousands of mostly white-collar workers are expected to continue working from home, in some cases permanently, despite the reopening of schools in England over the next fortnight. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 firms, has called on businesses and the government to strike a balance to ensure outlets in sparsely populated city centres do not face oblivion. “Remote working has been a real success for many firms and employees, and none of the many benefits should be lost,” said the CBI’s deputy director general, Josh Hardie. “But there has also been a knock-on effect to our town and city centres, where many businesses dependent on passing trade face an uphill battle just to survive. “Both the government and business have a role to play in supporting more people back to the workplace safely and securely. Things won’t return to how businesses operated pre-Covid-19, nor should they. But there is a middle ground to find as the economy reopens.” Train operators said on Wednesday that they were beginning to ramp up services to normal levels, with capacity due to hit more than 90% from 7 September as school holidays come to an end and many parents go back to work. Passengers will be invited to use National Rail’s Alert Me app that will provide up-to-the-minute information about which trains are busy, to help people practise social distancing. But plans being drawn up by several major businesses indicate that the end of summer and the reopening of schools will not herald a return to the urban rush hour of old. Lloyds Banking Group has said it is reviewing its office space needs and exploring new ways of working after concluding that 50,000 of its 65,000 staff have worked from home effectively during the pandemic. It plans to distribute more equipment such as laptops to staff to enable them to work in a more agile way. The Wall Street giant JP Morgan, which employs 16,000 people in the UK, is expected to let investment banking staff rotate between the office and home working on a permanent basis. Around 20% of its UK staff have returned to the office, and the proportion is set to increase over the coming months. Junior recruits who are still in training are among the few staff required to show up in person from 8 September. NatWest – formerly Royal Bank of Scotland – will adopt a hybrid model, with 50,000 of its 65,000 staff working from home at least until 2021, with some element of the new working model retained beyond that. HSBC wants some of its 52,000 staff to start coming back to the office but will cap building capacity at 20%. The law firm Linklaters announced this week that all of its global staff could spend 20-50% their time working remotely from now on under its “long-term agile working policy”. Some firms are planning phased returns before the end of the year. Barclays will ask some of the three-fifths of its 50,000 staff still working from home to start coming into the office in waves from October.  Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the business leaders’ group the Institute of Directors, said there was no guarantee things would snap back to normal come the end of the summer holidays, even with schools reopening. “Many businesses have found remote working suits them and their people, with commuting costs cut to a minimum,” he said. “The benefits of the office for some firms shouldn’t be understated: it can often provide more informal development and a better working environment for staff. However, the pandemic could see a lasting shift for some office jobs.” The Trades Union Congress called on employers not to assume that parents were now able to come into the office. “Although schools are returning, employers must recognise that not all childcare settings will be open yet,” said its general secretary, Frances O’Grady. “They must be flexible where parents still need childcare, and make sure everyone can travel safely.” The TUC reminded firms of their duty to carry out risk assessments to ensure staff could return safely, and it called on employers to share the results with employees.",business
"British Gas is to pay out a total of £1.73m for failures in the way it handled a switchover of payment provider for its prepayment customers. The UK’s largest energy supplier has paid £1.48m in compensation to affected customers, who pay for their energy in advance through top-ups rather than bills, and £250,000 to the energy regulator Ofgem’s energy redress fund. The payments relate to British Gas’s failure to inform some of its most vulnerable customers about a change of top-up provider, from Paypoint to Payzone, and a change in minimum top-up spend from £1 to £5. The energy provider, which is owned by Centrica, informed most of its customers in December 2019 about the changes, which came into effect on 1 January 2020, but failed to notify around 270,000 people. As a result, Ofgem found that some customers could have had their energy supply cut off in the middle of winter, or could have made wasted journeys to shops where they were no longer able to top up their accounts. In addition, affected customers were not able to contact British Gas by telephone on its general enquiries line on the day the changes came into force. British Gas finally contacted some affected customers in late January, weeks after the changes were introduced. Ofgem found that the customers who were notified in advance were given insufficient time to switch energy suppliers if they found British Gas’s new arrangements to be unsuitable. The notice to customers contained only internet links to information about the changes rather than a telephone number, which could have disadvantaged people without internet access. Ofgem has decided not to take formal enforcement against the energy supplier following British Gas’s decision to make the payments. Philippa Pickford, Ofgem’s director of retail, criticised British Gas’s failure to inform its customers of changes during winter. “When such a fundamental change is being made, such as where meters can be topped up, energy suppliers need to communicate with their customers in plenty of time,” she said. “British Gas should have informed all of their prepayment customers, many whom are in vulnerable situations, of the change to how to top-up their meters.” All energy suppliers should learn lessons from this case, said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, and added it was “unacceptable” that people risked having their energy supply cut off in winter due to poor communications. “Households with pre-payment meters are disproportionately likely to be on lower incomes, have children or include people with health conditions,” Guy said. “It’s critical that suppliers take extra care and make sure changes like this don’t put people at risk.”",business
"WPP has highlighted the glacial pace at which staff are returning to work as the coronavirus lockdown eases, with just 3% of UK employees regularly heading in to its offices. The world’s biggest employer in the marketing and advertising sector, which has clients spanning Ford to Facebook, has a workforce of about 10,000 in the UK. WPP revealed on Wednesday that just 300 staff are working in its British offices, as the company takes a cautious approach to health and safety and embraces the homeworking revolution. The UK is lagging behind WPP’s other most important European market, Germany, where 17% of staff are back in the office. However, in markets where the pandemic is still widespread the prospect of a significant return to work remains distant. In the US, where WPP employs 19,000 staff, office working is at 1%. And all WPP’s 8,000 staff in India are still working remotely. The sluggish rate of the return to work chimes with a report from the Centre for Cities, which found that overall just 17% of workers in British cities had returned to offices by early August. The data, based on mobile phone signals, showed no increase in the footfall of workers going to city centres between late June and the week starting 3 August. The new data underscore the challenge facing Boris Johnson, who is desperate to get people back to work to help reignite spending in towns and cities. “The costs of office closures are becoming clearer by the day,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry. “Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities.” PricewaterhouseCoopers, which employs 22,000 staff in the UK, said this month it had just a little over a quarter of staff spending time in one of its 20 offices. The “big four” accountancy firm is aiming to get to 50% capacity by the end of September, but returning to work will be voluntary. The Office for National Statistics has said footfall in mid-August in high streets, retail parks and shopping centres had only reached 70% of levels a year ago. WPP has issued guidelines to its agencies that limit office capacity to 20%, with the possibility of moving to 30% occupancy in the future if further health and safety requirements can be met. Returning to work is voluntary at WPP and the majority of those who have gone back to the office are younger staff members who have found remote working challenging because of a lack of space at home. Mark Read, WPP chief executive, said he expected the numbers of staff heading to work will increase as more offices are opened, but health and safety comes first. “While I am concerned about small businesses and footfall in central London, where most of our people work, there is a need to give people the confidence that it is safe as numbers returning rise,” he said. “We are going to think much more flexibly. I don’t think 99% of people working from home is sustainable in the long term, but neither do I think a 99% return to the office is.”",business
"Australia’s biggest super fund, the $180bn AustralianSuper, has dismissed as inadequate Rio Tinto’s decision to strip bonuses from executives over the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Ian Silk, the chief executive of AustralianSuper, said a report into the debacle by Rio Tinto’s board “highlights profound systemic, operational and governance failings”. “AustralianSuper has met with the chair of Rio Tinto and expressed our view that the proposed penalties fall significantly short of appropriate accountability for those responsible,” Silk said. “We have asked the board to reconsider its response and are continuing to engage with the company on the matter.” Silk did not say what additional action AustralianSuper wanted. It is believed the fund, which owns about $1.3bn in Rio Tinto shares, is yet to receive a response to its demands from the company. Rio Tinto destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received five separate reports on the significance of the sites since 2013. On Monday, Rio Tinto said it would strip about $5m in bonuses from chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and about $1m in bonuses from iron ore boss Chris Salisbury after the company “failed to meet some of its own internal standards and procedures in relation to the responsible management and protection of cultural heritage”. The internal review has received criticism from industry and shareholder groups. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the review was “highly disappointing” and “little more than a public relations exercise.” “Tens of thousands of years of cultural significance get blown up and all that goes to show for it is $7m of lost remuneration,” ACCR’s James Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that was “pocket change for these highly paid executives” and that Jacques and Niven should lose their jobs. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors said the review “does not deliver any meaningful accountability”. “Remuneration appears to be the only sanction applied to executives,” the council’s chief executive, Louise Davidson, said. “This raises the question – does the company feel that £4m [about $7m] is the right price for the destruction of cultural heritage?” The $52bn super fund Hesta said investors are concerned risks aren’t being appropriately managed after the destruction of the Juukan Gorge. Hesta says it has outlined its investor expectations in a letter to 14 Australian mining and energy companies. “We are committed to engaging with companies to understand how they are managing these issues, and we will consider using our voting rights where we identify the need for improved practices and disclosure,” the Hesta CEO, Debby Blakey, said. Blakey said investors were dismayed at the destruction of culturally significant sites at Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto.",business
"The Treasury has told a new bank customer complaints body to prepare for an influx of grievances over government-backed Covid loans. The Business Banking Resolution Service (BBRS) – set to launch in mid-November - was preparing to tackle cases dating back to 2001. But its chair, Lewis Shand Smith, said the unprecedented surge in business lending during the pandemic – starting with the state-guaranteed coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) – had forced it to shift focus. “We’ve been certainly encouraged by the Treasury to be to be ready to deal with complaints that arise out of Covid loans,” Shand Smith said. “For example, it could be because somebody hasn’t been given a loan and they think they should have, or that the conditions changed, the regulations changed … and they wanted to change the loan into a different one.” The BBRS will give independent decisions on disputes between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and their lenders. It was the industry’s response to the 2018 Walker review into how the sector should deal with SME complaints around consumer lending, which is unregulated in the UK. Its services will be open to businesses with an annual turnover of between £6.5m and £10m whose claims cannot be handled by the Financial Ombudsman Service, which will be the first port of call for SMEs who applied to the smaller bounce-back loans scheme. It means the BBRS will be poised to handle disputes arising from a portion of the approximately £14bn worth of CBILS loans that have so far been granted to 60,000 businesses across the UK. Banks have received more than 123,000 applications for CBILS loans, which are worth up to £5m and come with an 80% government guarantee. The smaller bounce-back loans, worth up to £50,000, are not covered by the BBRS. Eligible businesses can also raise concerns with the BBRS over the terms of standard commercial loans issued outside of the government loan programme. Each claimant will be assigned a “customer champion” by the BBRS to help them assemble their case and prove they are eligible for the resolution programme. Efforts will be made to settle the case informally, but will otherwise go through mediation, and if necessary, formal adjudication. Seven of the UK’s largest banks have signed up to the BBRS and must pay up to £600,000 if a case is ruled in the customers’ favour.  However, borrowers who took out Covid loans with one of the other 90-plus accredited CBILS lenders will not have access to the BBRS. Shand Smith said his team was hoping to bring new lenders into the scheme. “Because it is a voluntary scheme we can’t force them to sign up. But I think – I suspect – if things go wrong with them, we’ll find exactly the same [thing] as what happened after 2008, there will be a huge level of political pressure because the businesses will go to their MPs.”  The Treasury said in a statement: “Our loan schemes have provided lifelines to hundreds of thousands of firms during the crisis. We’ve always been clear these are repayable, government-backed loans and that decisions around approvals are for lenders in accordance with the guidance.”  This article was amended on 22 September 2020 to note that the BBRS will handle disputes arising from a portion of the CBILS loans that have so far been granted to 60,000 businesses, not all as an earlier version could have implied, and to reinstate a quote from the Treasury that had been mistakenly removed during the editing process. In addition, after publication, the BBRS confirmed that each claimant will be assigned a “customer champion”, not a “consumer champion” as a spokesperson originally said. ",business
"The fast-fashion retailer Boohoo has been selling clothes made by at least 18 factories in Leicester that audits say have failed to prove they pay the minimum wage to workers, a Guardian investigation has found. Third-party audit reports produced over the past four years make claims of “critical” issues over record-keeping and working hours at the time they were written, suggesting that in parts of the supply chain workers may be paid as little as £3-£4 an hour. Disclosed alongside new whistleblower claims about Boohoo’s supply chain, the confidential reports provide a snapshot of alleged issues in a factory at a specific time. They pose a new challenge to the brand’s insistence that issues reported in July were simply evidence of “the actions of a few” and stood in contrast to “the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area”. Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, where many of the factories are based, said the allegations suggested “an unforgivable breakdown of our basic social contract” and called on Boohoo to urgently release a full list of its suppliers in the city. Boohoo said the documentation seen by the Guardian “appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed”. But it added that its own investigations “have highlighted similar issues” in some of the manufacturers identified by the Guardian and that it had suspended trading with them until its concerns were resolved. Claims in the documents, which were described by one expert as “a smoking gun” on Boohoo and other brands’ oversight of minimum wage issues, detail allegations of: The reports, which date from 2017 to just a few months ago, came alongside whistleblower claims of other violations in Leicester’s factories. Industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they had seen dozens more that raised similar concerns at other Boohoo suppliers. There is no suggestion that Boohoo had access to the reports, which were circulated to some factory managers and other brands. The company, which has been accused in the past of turning a blind eye to issues in its supply chain, has its own oversight process for factories in Leicester. On its own investigations, Boohoo said: “Due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers … we have immediately suspended orders with a number of suppliers whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the Guardian.” It added that it was “deeply concerned by these findings” but said that until its own investigations and an independent QC-led review were complete “it would be inappropriate for us to comment further”. The brand did not clarify which of the factories it had suspended. Eight of the 18 companies denied some or all of the claims set out in the audits, with some calling them historical or saying they did not represent typical standards. The other 10 did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Audit reports are a central part of how fashion brands assess working practices in factories before deciding whether to place orders. But while they may be circulated within the industry, until now the reports have not been released publicly, even when they raise concerns over possible minimum-wage violations. “We have long known these reports exist, but brands never release them,” said Nik Hammer, an associate professor in employment studies at the University of Leicester and author of a 2015 report on the city’s textiles industry. He said they appeared to be “a smoking gun on industry oversight of minimum-wage issues. These [findings] are classic signs of a risk of violations, and they are absolutely consistent with what I’ve heard over the years.” The reports came alongside separate claims from one worker at Pro Fashion Limited, a subcontractor making clothes for Boohoo and its sister brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal.  The worker showed the Guardian a recent “official” payslip. It showed them earning the £8.72 legal minimum wage. Separately, the worker had what they described as a “shadow” payslip which was handwritten and they said showed many hours more had been worked. That suggested the real rate was just £6 an hour. Pro Fashion denied the claims, saying it “follows the government guidelines of paying minimum wage … [and] does not issue any other payslip as you mention”. It said it “transfers wages to our employees direct to their bank account”. An estimated 70-80% of clothes produced in Leicester are for Boohoo, Nasty Gal and PrettyLittleThing. Concerns over the company’s supply chain have been raised repeatedly over the years by campaign groups, the media and MPs, including the Conservative Andrew Bridgen in a speech to parliament earlier this year. But the brand and the government have until recently largely ignored calls for reform. The scrutiny intensified again this summer after the Guardian revealed claims that Leicester textile firms had breached lockdown measures, and the Sunday Times reported that one Boohoo supplier had offered an undercover reporter £3.50 an hour. The Manchester-based brand had £1.5bn wiped off its share price in two days in July amid growing investor concern over practices within its supply chain. When the lockdown claims first emerged, Boohoo said they were inaccurate and that it “categorically does not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance … with our strict code of conduct”. With investors deserting the firm, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding the company do more to protect workers in its supply chain, it announced plans to set up a “model factory” in Leicester where workers would be treated fairly, and set up an independent review. It also said it would increase an inspection programme led by the third-party auditor Verisio. But critics say the whistleblower accounts and reports seen by the Guardian provide a worrying snapshot of the problems within the industry, particularly over alleged minimum-wage violations.  At Onyx Fashion, a Boohoo supplier, one audit claimed managers admitted full-time workers were being falsely recorded as working part-time hours – an allegation the company “vehemently denied”. A 2018 report on Ezili Dariyai, which mainly produced leisurewear, said timesheets were not signed by workers and minimum-wage payments could not be verified. The company then went into liquidation, owing more than £600,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, causing Mahomed Hanif Musa Patel to be struck off as a director. He did not respond to requests for comment. Another firm, Bux Clothing, was accused in a 2017 audit of failing to keep proper records of working hours, making it impossible to verify the payment of minimum wage. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Bux Clothing is one of five textile firms in Leicester to separately be issued with improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over hygiene and social distancing measures since the city’s second lockdown, alongside I Design Leicester, Clothing Pallet, VR Mode Limited and Smart Garments. All five complied with the notices. As well as Bux, the Guardian has established through worker interviews that Smart Garments is also a Boohoo supplier. Smart Garments did not dispute the HSE’s findings that it “failed to put reasonably practicable control measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19” but said the body was “satisfied with our risk assessment and how we managed the factory in the current Covid environment”. Boohoo did not comment on the improvement notices. Dominique Muller, whose report on Leicester factories in lockdown for the campaign group Labour Behind the Label prompted the recent Boohoo storm, claimed the range of the audits showed that “the idea that this could go on without Boohoo’s knowledge or tacit acceptance, it’s a complete fallacy. They hold the power in Leicester, and it’s disingenuous to pretend anything else.”",business
"Qantas has rejected calls for its chief executive, Alan Joyce, to resign after the airline announced plans to cut almost 2,500 ground staff jobs in a move labelled “economic violence” and “an evil act of corporate bastardry”. The airline on Tuesday said it planned to hire an external company to provide services including baggage handling and plane cleaning at 10 large Australian airports. Its move comes just two months after it announced a “three-year plan to accelerate its recovery from the Covid crisis and create a stronger platform for future profitability” that included axing about 6,000 of its 29,000 workers. Together, the two rounds of axings are set to result in the company shedding about 30% of its workforce. Qantas last week blamed a loss for the year of $2bn on the coronavirus crisis. But Joyce maintained his aggressive attitude towards rival Virgin Australia, which is in administration, declaring last week that after the crisis ended Qantas would be “the only Australian airline that can fly long haul”. Tuesday’s move was immediately condemned by the union that covers ground staff at Qantas, the Transport Workers Union. Its national secretary, Michael Kaine, called on Joyce to resign, saying the airline boss had committed “economic violence” against workers and claiming Qantas had squandered more than $500m in government support. “Qantas has taken millions in jobkeeper wage subsidies, more than any other company, with the express intent of keeping people employed,” Kaine said. “But now Alan Joyce wants to destroy thousands more livelihoods. This is callous abuse of public money.” He called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to step in and take an equity stake in Qantas, which he said was floundering in a crisis that has gripped the entire aviation sector. “Scott Morrison, stop kow-towing to this corporate dictatorship,” he said. The Labor senator Tony Sheldon, who formerly occupied Kaine’s position, said the new job cuts were “an evil act of corporate bastardry from some of the highest paid executives in the world”. “They are cruelly axing the jobs of 2,400 people who stuck by them when times were tough only to find they are expendable,” he said. The chief executive of Qantas’s domestic division, Andrew David, said calls for Joyce to resign were “not worthy of a response”. Qantas said it received $515m from the government, of which $267m was jobkeeper payments to keep people employed. The remainder was a subsidy to run flights including a skeleton domestic schedule and repatriation flights. The airline said that its net benefit from the government subsidies was just $15m. “We’re very grateful for it [jobkeeper] here at Qantas,” David said. “We’re not looking to extend people’s tenure in the organisation artificially so they can receive jobkeeper and then make them redundant at that point in time. “It’s certainly not fair to the Australian taxpayer to do that. “This is a terrible situation, these are very hard decisions to make.” Joyce has previously lashed premiers for closing borders to protect their states from the spread of coronavirus. David said that border closures, along with the lack of a vaccine and the certainty of a “deep recession”, were among the reasons why Qantas had decided to make a second series of job cuts. But Gareth Evans, the head of Qantas’s budget division, Jetstar, said it would have made no difference if premiers had agreed to open their borders at a national cabinet meeting last week. “We’ve seen examples where borders have opened and then closed again,” he said. “The uncertainty that is wrought by the way that this disease is playing out is having a huge impact on the business and we just don’t know how long this is going to last.” The cuts will hit Qantas and Jetstar staff at airports in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin, Cairns, Townsville, Alice Springs and Canberra. Qantas said it already outsources ground services at 55 other airports. The company estimated the cuts would save the company $100m a year in wages and equipment maintenance costs. In a letter to staff, obtained by Guardian Australia, it also said the cuts meant it would not have to spend $80m on a planned equipment upgrade. “Due to the significant financial impact Covid has had on our business we no longer have access to the cash to invest in modernising this equipment,” Qantas said in the letter. Under an enterprise agreement with the TWU, ground staff at Qantas will be able to make a counter-bid to keep their jobs. However, they face an uphill battle as Qantas estimates it can save as much as 40% by outsourcing the work to an external company. Employees are to submit their bid by 16 October, according to a schedule distributed to workers by the company. Jetstar workers have no such agreement and do not have the ability to submit a bid of their own. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia’s administrators have told unsecured creditors of the airline, including bondholders owed about $2bn, that they stand to receive as little as 8.4c in the dollar. But they will receive less – or nothing at all – if they attempt to knock back an offer to buy the airline put forward by US private equity group Bain, administrators from Deloitte said in a report to creditors circulated on Tuesday. The report came ahead of a meeting of creditors set for 4 September at which they are to vote on the Bain proposal. But creditors, who also include aircraft financiers, suppliers and staff, have little chance of stopping Bain taking control of Virgin because the administrators have the power to sell the assets of the company without approval. Employees are to get everything they are owed under the Bain deal, at a cost of about $448m. Bain has also agreed to take on responsibility for about $600m in travel credits and booked flights that haven’t been taken yet. Key suppliers to the airline fare a little better than bondholders – they are to receive around 14c in the dollar. But the most bondholders can hope for is 12.8c in the dollar, according to modelling conducted by Deloitte. A group of bondholders had hoped to put an alternative proposal to the meeting, but this now appears unlikely to happen. “We have set out our opinion to creditors that it is in their interest to approve the deed of company arrangement proposed by Bain Capital as it provides for the best return to creditors in what are extraordinary circumstances, and that were impossible to foresee,” the lead administrator, Vaughan Strawbridge, said. “This will provide certainty for the business under new and committed owners. It provides certainty for employees and customers, a return to creditors, and it can be completed sooner, and at less cost than other alternatives.” “It achieves all the objectives of the voluntary administration process that we sought from the outset. Now we just need to bring the airline out of administration as soon as possible.” Virgin Australia’s board of directors put the group into administration in April after the company’s repeated requests for a government bailout were refused.",business
"Tesco is to permanently employ 16,000 extra staff taken on during the pandemic to help support a surge in online grocery trade. The roles include 10,000 pickers, who select and pack grocery orders for home delivery, and 3,000 drivers, as well as a variety of other roles in stores and distribution centres. Tesco’s move comes after the electrical goods specialist AO.com, the DIY chain Kingfisher and the delivery firms DPD and Hermes hired thousands more workers combined to cope with the rise in home deliveries. However, the shift online has hit high streets hard, with Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Boots among the chains shutting stores and cutting jobs. London department store Liberty is also planning redundancies via a voluntary scheme under which at least 50 of its 550-plus UK team are expected to go. The UK’s biggest supermarket said it had already hired 4,000 other permanent staff since the start of the pandemic, during which it took on more than 40,000 temporary workers to help cope with higher demand and to cover for those forced to self-isolate. Some of those workers, who included pilots, pub staff and others put on furlough from their usual jobs, have now returned to their posts or found new work elsewhere. The hiring comes as online groceries have risen to 16% of Tesco’s sales during the pandemic, up from about 9% at the beginning of the year. The supermarket is expecting online sales of £5.5bn this year, up from £3.3bn last year. The supermarket’s experience reflects rapid growth in online sales across the UK so that home deliveries now account for 13.5% of the grocery market, up from 7.4% before lockdown. Overall grocery sales are also up strongly as the move to working from home and closure of schools prompted a switch to home cooked meals and away from meals at restaurants, coffee shops and canteens. The growth in the online market has prompted Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose all to expand their delivery networks. Amazon has also stepped up its activity, offering its Prime subscription customers free grocery delivery. The supermarkets are also gearing up to make the most of Ocado’s switch from partnering with Waitrose to Marks & Spencer next week which could prompt some shoppers to change provider. Online growth is not expected to be particularly helpful for profits at the supermarkets, however, as the need to take on new staff, buy vans and add other equipment for delivery systems all add to costs and potentially take sales away from stores. But retail analyst Clive Black said that a move towards larger online orders and better efficiency was helping. “The step-up in the overall value of the UK grocery market, in revenue terms, and the migration from modest loss-making to marginal profitability [online] means that we see the UK supermarkets as emerging butter side up from the step-change in online grocery activity,” he said. Tesco brought in 400 extra vans and changed shopping hours so more orders could be picked in stores to help expand its service to almost 1.5 million customers a week online, up from about 600,000 at the start of the pandemic. Jason Tarry, the head of Tesco in the UK and Ireland, said: “Since the start of the pandemic, our colleagues have helped us to more than double our online capacity, safely serving nearly 1.5 million customers every week and prioritising vulnerable customers to ensure they get the food they need. These new roles will help us continue to meet online demand for the long term.” Alongside creating the permanent roles, Tesco said it planned to support the government’s Kickstart work placement scheme by offering places to 1,000 young people. More than 80 young people will join internship schemes in stores, distribution centres and offices next month. Almost 50 students also joined Tesco’s summer internship programme this year, which was delivered virtually.",business
"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund the US Postal Service, amid ongoing complaints by Democrats that the Trump administration is attempting to sabotage the delivery of mail-in ballots ahead of the presidential election in November. The Democratic bill, which passed on Saturday despite opposition from Republicans, would provide $25bn in aid for the USPS and prioritize election mail as “first class”, to ensure ballots arrive in time to be counted in an election in which the coronavirus pandemic will cast a shadow over in-person voting. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, said the bill was necessary to “reject the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the critical mission of the postal service”. On the floor of the House, James Comer of Kentucky, the ranking Republican on the oversight committee, said the Democrats’ bill was the “result of a legislative process only slightly less absurd than the conspiracies, insinuations, and fabrications that gave rise to the purported need for it”. The bill is unlikely to progress further, with the Republican-held Senate unwilling to pass it. After Saturday’s vote Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the Senate would “absolutely not pass” the stand-alone bill.  The White House has also signalled it would veto the bill, with Republicans claiming the postal service has plenty of cash on hand and is being used by Democrats for political purposes. Democrats have accused Louis DeJoy, a major donor to Donald Trump who is now postmaster general, of implementing cost-cutting measures meant to slow the mail, with the intention of aiding Trump in the election. Trump has falsely claimed there is widespread fraud in mail-in ballots, stating that “nobody knows what’s happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots”. Experts have pointed out there is no evidence to support these claims and Trump himself has voted via the mail multiple times himself. On Friday, DeJoy conceded that mail delivery had slowed down but refused to reinstate hundreds of mail sorting machines that have been removed, ostensibly because of a decline in deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic. He has, however, reversed a plan to remove hundreds more of the machines ahead of the election. On Saturday the Democratic chair of the House oversight committee, Carolyn B Maloney of New York, released internal USPS documents from a briefing to DeJoy on 12 August. Maloney said DeJoy had been warned of “steep declines and increasing delays nationwide over the last two months as a result of his drastic operational and organizational changes”. In a statement, Maloney said: “To those who still claim there are ‘no delays’ and that these reports are just ‘conspiracy theories’, I hope this new data causes them to re-think their position and support our urgent legislation today. “We have all seen the headlines from every corner of our country, we have read the stories and seen pictures, we have heard directly from our constituents, and these new documents show that the delays are far worse than we were told.” Later on Saturday, after playing golf, Trump weighed in again on Twitter with a rambling complaint including more claims regarding voter fraud. “This is all another HOAX by the Democrats,” the president wrote, “to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes, without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam … Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!” As has been pointed out repeatedly, mail-in ballots and absentee ballots are the same thing. Trump is opposed to the practice of proactively sending ballots to voters, which many states are pursuing during the coronavirus pandemic.",business
"Treasury predicts Australia’s effective unemployment will top 13% before the end of the year, with the Covid outbreak in Victoria hampering the recovery which saw real unemployment fall to 9.8% in July, down from a peak of 14.4% in April. The sobering figure is contained in the treasurer’s July employment analysis, which also shows the Northern Territory registering the highest effective unemployment rate in the country at 12.1%, followed by Queensland at 11.4% and Victoria at 10.5%. The ACT recorded the lowest unemployment rate, at 5.2%, followed by Tasmania at 7.9% and New South Wales at 8.5%. South Australia and Western Australia finished in the middle at 9.8%. Effective unemployment is the number of unemployed people looking for work, combined with the number of people who are still technically employed, because of stimulus measures such as jobkeeper, but working no hours, and the number of unemployed people who have given up looking for work. Last month, the official unemployment rate released by the ABS, which does not count people who have dropped out of the labour force or people who have worked zero hours and are on jobkeeper – recorded Australia’s jobless rate as 7.5%. In his analysis, treasurer Josh Frydenberg was looking for the positives. “We know the road to recovery will be bumpy as we have seen with the setback in Victoria, however, the jobs recovery across the rest of the country gives cause for optimism that through containing the spread of the virus and reopening the economy we will get through this,” he said in a statement. “Treasury estimates show that nearly 700,000 people have gained effective employment since April recovering more than half of the jobs lost or those who were stood down on zero hours at the start of the crisis. “There is still a long way to go through this crisis and high frequency data is showing signs that the jobs recovery may be slowing as state border closures have been tightened.” The nature of the pandemic’s impact on the workforce, along with the government’s stimulus responses, has made measuring unemployment in the usual sense more difficult. Analysts have begun looking to the hours worked measure in the ABS statistics to get a better idea of who remains working, in the workforce. Last month, the employment data showed a record 1 million Australians were now without a job but were actively looking for work, while another 165,000 people worked no hours, but were counted as employed because of jobkeeper. Jobkeeper will be extended until March next year, as part of legislation introduced to the parliament this sitting, but Labor is already pushing for further clarity on what will happen beyond the new end date, when the impact of the global recession begins to bite. On Sunday, outgoing finance minister Mathias Cormann said the nation needed to prepare for a time when businesses were weaned off the stimulus packages. “Clearly we need to transition out of this,” Cormann said. “… the appropriate period we are proposing jobkeeper is to the end of March, and that is another six months beyond the original timetable. “At some point, we need to get back into a situation where viable profitable businesses pay for the wages of their employees out of their income, rather than on the bias of taxpayers support.” Frydenberg too, was turning toward recovery. “Our jobmaker plan is designed to rebuild our economy and includes the $1bn jobtrainer fund we announced last month to help create 340,700 new training places and a further $1.5bn in support for small and medium businesses to retain their apprentices,” he said. “We will continue to do what is necessary to contain the spread of the virus and support the recovery, with the Morrison government’s unprecedented level of support totalling $314bn supporting millions of Australians through this challenging period.”",business
"News that STA Travel has become the latest to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted an outpouring of sadness and nostalgia from former customers and staff. Known for its enthusiastic staff and its budget round-the-world plane tickets, generations of students would flock to STA Travel stores to book gap years and summer breaks through the company – or simply to gaze longingly at the adventures it promised. Its bright yellow and blue signage has been a familiar sight on high streets and university campuses for decades, but now after it confirmed it had ceased trading on Friday, 54 UK stores look set to close their doors, putting 500 jobs at risk. Lowri Lloyd Owen from near Aberystwyth worked for the company for 10 years, first as a travel expert and then as a store manager. She said she felt “extremely saddened” when she heard the news. The job enabled her to move to Australia, where she lived for eight years and started her family. “The 10 years I spent working for this company taught me so much, took me to places far and wide and I met lifelong friends along the way, many of whom are still employees and will be facing very difficult times ahead,” she said. “Selling travel is the most awesome thing you can sell someone.” She was not surprised by the reaction to the news. “Whether you were an STA customer or an employee, it was a company that supported young people often at the start of their travels or career and that stays with you,” she said. Tim Walker, who runs Beaumont Music and lives in West Sussex, was one of the company’s loyal customers when he was a student in the early 2000s. He used the travel agent from the age of 18 to 22 to book his gap-year adventure as well as summer trips while at university. “I remember booking flights to Mexico and the staff member calling over a colleague who had just returned from their own trip. We were excited anyway but as this guy launched himself over the desk towards us, his enthusiasm was ridiculously infectious and all they wanted to do was to make sure we had a fantastic time.” Walker says the demise of STA Travel was a “real loss” to future students wanting to go on their first big trips abroad as they won’t be able to benefit from STA’s experienced staff. Ronke Adewa-Faboro, a wedding planner from Essex, was an international student studying at De Montfort University in Leicester in the 90s when she went to STA Travel to book her dream holiday. “I booked to spend Christmas in New York. I had always wanted to do it and I asked a couple of friends to go but they didn’t want to. So I was a little discouraged, but decided to go anyway.” STA Travel made her feel more comfortable about going on her own. They produced flyers about solo travel for women, which Adewa-Faboro studied before going. “I was a solo traveller, aged 19, and my family in Nigeria thought I was crazy. But I thought I only live once so I just decided to do it. STA made me feel really safe about it. I had six magical days there. “The team were amazing in making a foreign student from Nigeria’s dream come true. Money was tight so they booked me into two separate hostels to save me money. They were brilliant.” It wasn’t just students booking gap years and post-university travels. STA Travel, founded by two Australian backpackers in Melbourne in 1979, originally stood for Student Travel Australia, but it branched out to a wider customer base and rebranded itself to become Start the Adventure. Sophie Butler and her husband, Nick, booked their honeymoon with STA Travel in 2012 and have used them for other holidays since, including a trip to New York. “We chose them [for the honeymoon] because we were going to Australia so knew they would be experts. Also, for me, I never did the whole gap-year thing so it was my chance to travel as much as possible. “I remember going to their store in Covent Garden and a lovely lady – Annie, I think – helped us plan out the whole trip.” Butler, who runs the Sugar Tea Room in north London, said: “We were both sad to hear about STA travel closing because it wasn’t just for students, they had the best prices for long-haul travel.” Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne, the founder of the period product brand Freda, who lives in London, has fond memories of using STA Travel to go to the Gambia, Senegal and Guinea Bissau when she was a student more than 30 years ago. She said: “We used to have an STA in the University of London Union in the 80s when we still had holiday brochures and you could discuss your trip in person with someone who’d probably done that trip already. It wasn’t just the student discount but also the student perspective and tips in a non-internet era. I’m so sad to see it go.” Another former customer, Ellie Dix, a board game designer from Hertfordshire, has been reminiscing about Camp America, which she booked through STA Travel in the 90s. “I was at Birmingham University from 1994 to 1997 and we had an STA Travel on campus. I remember going and just gazing at the options as a sort of escapism from student life. I did Camp America for two years running in 1996 and 1997 and STA dealt with the travel. “I don’t remember actually thinking there was any other way to travel as a student other than with STA. It was STA or nothing.”",business
"The government response to the coronavirus pandemic is on track to cost the public purse £210bn for the first six months of the crisis, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has said. Reflecting the scale of the emergency since March, the National Audit Office (NAO) said ministers had instigated more than 190 measures in response to the crisis so far, including emergency job support, additional NHS funding, and business grants. Equivalent to almost a quarter of the government’s annual budget for running the public sector, making welfare payments and investing in infrastructure, the £210bn sum, the NAO said, was the office’s latest cost-estimate of the government response. The analysis covers spending promises made by ministers up to 7 August, indicating that the final costs of the Covid-19 crisis for the public purse could be much higher. The NAO had previously estimated a price tag of more than £120bn for the period up to 4 May. Releasing details of the projects in a new “Covid cost tracker” keeping tabs on government spending announcements, the NAO said £70bn of the promised funds had been spent, and there were a number of measures still to be fully implemented. The analysis comes as pressure mounts on ministers to reveal the details of contracts awarded to private firms worth billions of pounds, including for the purchase of personal protective equipment and for the government’s virus test and trace system. According to the NAO, £1bn of the promised £10bn funding package for test and trace had been spent by the end of July. The government has awarded contracts for the scheme to private-sector firms, including Serco and Capita. The organisation said about half of the £15bn earmarked for personal protective equipment (PPE) had been spent by the end of July. The Treasury’s furlough scheme, with a price tag of £47bn, was the single most expensive intervention in the NAO tracker. With more than 9.6m jobs furloughed since March, at a cost of £35.4bn so far, the scheme has been widely credited with preventing mass unemployment during lockdown. However, there are growing calls on the government to extend furlough beyond its end date in October to prevent a spike in redundancies this autumn. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is weighing options for scaling back the government’s emergency pandemic response and raising taxes to combat a sharp increase in public borrowing. Driven by the sharp increase in spending and weak tax revenues amid the decline in economic activity, public-sector net debt has increased by £227.6bn over the past year to more than £2tn for the first time. National debt is at 100.5% of GDP for the first time since March 1961.",business
"Willie Walsh faced down a pay revolt on the final day of his 41-year career in aviation, bowing out as chief executive of British Airways owner IAG with a warning that the industry faces the gravest crisis in its history. Almost 30% of shareholders failed to back the company’s remuneration report, which awarded Walsh an £833,000 annual bonus that took his total earnings for 2019 to £3.2m. The deal was agreed before coronavirus sent the company’s finances into freefall and thousands of pilots, crew and ground staff were either sacked or forced to take substantial pay cuts. Provisional numbers issued at the end of IAG’s annual shareholder meeting in Madrid on Tuesday showed only 71.6% of investors had voted to approve directors’ pay awards, with about 20% voting against. IAG said it was “disappointed” by the vote and would engage with shareholders to understand their concerns. However, shareholders overwhelmingly backed one of Walsh’s final acts as IAG boss, the €2.75bn (£2.49bn) rights issue announced in July to shore up the company’s balance sheet during the Covid-19 crisis. Walsh issued a stark forecast as he departed, warning IAG could not expect 2019 levels of passenger demand to return until 2023 or even 2024. The IAG chief executive had delayed by six months his handover to Luis Gallego, the boss of BA’s sister airline Iberia, after the impact of thepandemic on aviation became clear. The 58-year-old Irishman said he was both retiring from IAG and leaving the aviation industry, where he started 41 years ago as a trainee pilot. He said he was leaving with the industry in “the worst crisis we have ever faced, far worse than both 9/11 and the financial crash in 2008”, and highlighted the change in the latest quarterly financial results – a swing of nearly €2.4bn for April-June from 2019 to 2020, when most planes were grounded and passenger numbers fell by 98.4%. He defended controversial moves to cut 12,000 BA staff and move others on to inferior contracts. He said: “We were quick to take action not only to address the immediate challenge we face from the pandemic but, critically, to enable us to emerge from the crisis in a strong position … ensuring that our businesses are the correct size and structure for the new operating environment in which they will find themselves.” Walsh also renewed his attack on the government’s quarantine rules for their “huge impact on an already troubled aviation industry”, calling for a more constructive approach from the government.  Heathrow airport has proposed cutting quarantine periodsby imposing a regime of airport testing and establishing air corridors with parts of the US that have recorded lower rates of Covid-19 infections, a plan Walsh said he backed. The outgoing IAG boss, who took control of the newly formed company in 2011 after plotting its creation via a £5bn merger with Iberia, said it had been “one hell of a journey since then”. He grew IAG with the acquisitions of Spanish no-frills airline Vueling and Aer Lingus – the Irish carrier where he had earlier made his name as a chief executive, slashing jobs to make it profitable. The group also launched a low-cost subsidiary, Level, to fend off the challenge of budget rivals, but it has failed to grow and Walsh said it would be pared back to a Barcelona base. He has become one of the global aviation business’s most respected figures, having led moves to industry consolidation and established IAG – until Covid-19 – as a highly profitable firm in an industry notorious for losses. However, he will leave with little love lost among thousands of BA employees, and cabin crew in particular. Unions fought a bitter dispute to preserve terms and conditions when he was running the airline directly, from 2005 to 2010. Now many long-serving staff have lost their jobs or been forced onto lower-paid contracts as BA, as Walsh has told politicians, “embraces reality” after coronavirus.",business
"US stock markets fell sharply again on Friday then rebounded in a volatile day of trading as investors soured on the high-flying tech companies that had driven markets to record highs. The S&P 500 fell 3% at the low point on Friday but ended down 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen 850 points, ended down 0.56%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.27% after regaining morning losses of 5%. All three indexes had dropped significantly on Thursday, their biggest one-day declines since June. In Europe stock markets also closed down. In London the FTSE dropped 0.88%, Germany’s DAX dropped 1.65% and in France the CAC dropped 0.89%. Asian markets had also closed down after Wall Street’s fall. The falls in the US were led by the technology sector, whose share prices have soared during the coronavirus pandemic as investors have bet more business will move permanently online. Tech’s soaring share price has reportedly been fueled by a $50bn bet on the sector by Japan’s SoftBank. The huge buying spree helped drive tech stocks and stock markets to new highs, The Wall Street Journal reported. And the unwinding of those trades may have contributed to the dramatic sell off. Shares of Apple fell 7%, while Facebook and Amazon slid more than 6%. Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft both fell at least 4%. Zoom, the video conferencing company whose shares were up 400% before the fall, lost another 4%. The share prices of all the companies still remain sharply up for the year and before Thursday the S&P 500 had been up in nine of the last 10 trading sessions. Michael Antonelli, the managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W Baird in Milwaukee, said the selloff so far appeared to be driven by profit-taking as investors cashed in some of the huge gains they have made on tech stocks. “Apple was going up 3-4% a day recently. I don’t know a world where people would not take some profits in that situation,” he said. “The air started coming out of the tires yesterday and that seems to be continuing today.” Friday’s selloff came as the US announced employers had added another 1.4m jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, the first time it has dipped below 10% since the pandemic hit the US economy. Antonelli said the figures were slightly better than expected but that, for now, it was the tech sector rather than the jobs figures that were driving the selloff. “I would get concerned if this starts to bleed into other sectors,” he said. But for now, he said, the selloff was about the tech companies going “too far, too fast”.",business
"Name: Windsor. Age: Yeah, quite old. There was almost certainly a settlement there before William the Conqueror showed up and built a castle in 1070. Location: On the Thames in Berkshire, about 20 miles west of central London. And FYI, it’s twinned with Goslar in Lower Saxony in Germany and Neuilly-sur-Seine in France. Yes, yes, very interesting, but this is a news-based column. Presumably there is a story? Yes, it’s the tax-dodging capital of the UK. Really? Meaning what exactly? Of all the 279 areas in the UK, Windsor has the highest concentration of tax avoiders. Analysis carried out after freedom of information requests to HMRC has revealed that there were 23 disclosures per 100,000 people of unpaid tax in Windsor (and neighbouring Maidenhead). How does that compare with the rest of the country? The average is seven per 100,000. So Windsor is more than three times as dodgy as the average place? Tax-wise yes, I suppose so. But in other ways, Windsor wouldn’t be described as dodgy at all, would it? Not at all – quite the opposite, it’s jolly nice. It’s almost like the wealthiest people are ripping off everyone else. I suppose you could look at it that way. What about other hotspots? St Albans (20 per 100,000), Guildford (17) and Tunbridge Wells (15) all do well. Though I’m not sure you mean “well”. While tax avoidance is legal, it can be open to abuse. Hang on, though, Windsor … it’s ringing a bell; doesn’t someone famous live there? Quite a few actually. It is, as already mentioned, jolly nice. No but really famous. You mentioned William I building a castle there, right? A timber one, motte and bailey, long gone. But another one was built in its place? I’m thinking the bell that’s ringing might be coming from St George’s Chapel … Hey, this is not that kind of story. It’s not a royal one, OK? The Crown is tax exempt though? True, but since 1993 the Queen and the Prince of Wales have voluntarily paid income tax. What does the HM in HMRC stand for then? Isn’t she effectively paying herself? No. But it was only after her castle burnt down in the annus horribilis and the following outcry that the taxpayer might have to foot the massive repair bill that she offered to pay tax, wasn’t it? Yes, but this isn’t about that! Windsor, tax avoidance, that’s near enough. Go on then, do say: “Philip! We’ll do one’s return online this year, it gives us an extra couple of months.” Don’t say: “Shall we just call it the Cayman Islands on Thames?”",business
"The slow return of UK workers to their normal place of work will come too late to save hard-pressed city centre stores from going under, the body that represents retailers has said. Despite a pick-up in spending in August, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said sales were still below their pre-pandemic level and the lack of people was having a devastating impact on shops operating in places once thronged with workers. The latest health check of high street and online spending from the BRC warned that September would see more job losses, a gloomy view backed up by the latest survey of employment trends from the consultancy group Manpower. The BRC said total sales were up year on year by almost 4%, but reported a pronounced difference between booming digital spending and bricks-and-mortar outlets, particularly those selling clothes and beauty products. In-store sales of non-food items were almost 18% lower in the three months to August than in the same period of 2019, while online non-food sales were 42.4% higher last month than a year ago. The latest footfall figures from Springboard showed that the number of people visiting high streets rose by 2.6% last week, while Barclaycard said a 9% increase in transactions in restaurants and bars meant its measure of consumer spending had edged above pre-pandemic levels. But Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said there were signs of a structural change in spending patterns. “Remote working has continued to help sales in home goods, such as food, computing, furniture and TVs,” Dickinson said. “Lockdown also appears to have permanently changed some consumers’ shopping habits, with online sales continuing to boom despite shops reopening in June. Meanwhile, city centre retailers continue to be devastated by low footfall and poor sales, as office workers stayed away for yet another month.” Dickinson said many retailers were continuing to struggle, especially those that relied on high footfall. “With rents accumulating and the September quarter payment date fast approaching, many retailers are hanging on by a thread. Unless businesses and government can successfully persuade office workers back into city and town centres, some high street retailers will be unable to afford their fixed costs. Government will need to act fast or September will see more shops close and more job losses realised.” Manpower said stronger demand for construction, finance and manufacturing workers meant its jobs outlook had improved from a 28-year-low of -12 to -8 over the past month, but added that the tough employment climate for retail and hospitality workers had not changed. Mark Cahill, ManpowerGroup UK’s managing director, said: “The headline number illustrates just how tough the labour market is currently. This is still the second weakest outlook we’ve seen since 1992. But the four-point national increase from last quarter, along with a positive trend in several key sectors, is cause for some cautious optimism. “Despite the end of the furlough scheme in October and signs of a resurgence in the virus in some areas, employers expect the UK jobs outlook to be tentatively heading in the right direction as 2020 ends.”",business
"Thomas Cook could make a comeback as an online travel agent before the end of the year, under plans drawn up by the Chinese conglomerate that bought the brand after the company’s spectacular collapse. Fosun, which was Thomas Cook’s biggest shareholder before its failure last September, has said repeatedly that it wants to relaunch the business as an online brand. It is trying to secure approval from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority but is reluctant to finalise its plans in case the UK government introduces further travel quarantines. By acquiring the 179-year-old Thomas Cook brand in an £11m deal last November, Fosun gained access to its trademarks, websites, social media accounts and software across most of the world. The group owns a number of other businesses including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC. Thomas Cook’s downfall was caused by a huge debt mountain, run up as it expanded through takeovers amid fierce competition from online rivals. Its collapse triggered the largest ever peacetime repatriation to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers from overseas.",business
