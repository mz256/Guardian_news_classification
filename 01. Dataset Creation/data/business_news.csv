"A consortium that includes high street giant Next is thought to be in pole position to buy Sir Philip Green’s Topshop empire out of administration. Arcadia, which employed 13,000 people across 500 outlets at the time of last year’s collapse, is being auctioned, with Monday being the deadline for final bids. Next, which has partnered with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, is pitted against Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, which has been linked to a joint bid with JD Sports. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group and online retailer Boohoo have also been circling. Administrators from Deloitte hope to complete the sale by the end of this month. Arcadia, which Green bought for £850m in 2002, is home to a stable of household names including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, has already been hived off and sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m. Arcadia has been the biggest corporate casualty of the pandemic, which has hammered high-street retailers. The high-street closures proved to be the final straw for the group, which had suffered years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. It only narrowly avoided administration in 2019 after landlords agreed rent reductions and store closures.  Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, has confirmed its interest in Arcadia, but said it was “only interested in the brands that we think are very, very good” and would be a minority shareholder in any new venture. If victorious, the Next consortium is expected to work with Arcadia’s existing management. Stores could be saved if landlords were willing to link rents to sales, according to the Sunday Times. The Evans deal resulted in the closure of all its outlets as the new owners plan to sell its clothing online only. Wolfson said its involvement in Arcadia would be in similar vein to its Victoria’s Secret joint venture, where Next operates the stores and website but has no part in developing the ranges. The FTSE 100 retailer has been expanding its portfolio of brands over the past year, including through licensing deals with Ted Baker and the new owners of Laura Ashley, which also went into administration in 2020. In the wake of the BHS scandal, which saw Green eventually agreeing to pay £363m into the company’s depleted pension pot, the failure of Arcadia has thrown the spotlight on its own scheme, which has an estimated £350m deficit. The family is making a promised £50m payment a year early and has also signed over some Arcadia property assets – but it is not yet clear whether it will be enough to fill the hole. "
"Connells has struck an agreed offer for Countryside, the owner of Hamptons International, after raising its bid to £130m, bringing together two of Britain’s biggest estate agency groups. The boards of Connells, which is part of Skipton building society, and Countrywide, the UK’s biggest listed estate agency group, said they had agreed terms of a recommended cash offer at 395p a share. Connells made an initial offer of 250p a share in early November and raised this to 325p a share a month later. The shares traded at 145p before the initial bid was made. The deal will bring together Countrywide’s 60 well-known high street brands, including Gascoigne-Pees, Bairstow Eves and King & Chasemore, with Connells’ 25 brands – Allen & Harris, Bagshaws Residential, Fox & Sons, and Barnard Marcus in London. Countrywide has 651 branches, while the Connells group has 581. The takeover is backed by the majority of Countrywide’s shareholders and is a lifeline for the business, which has struggled under debts of £91.9m and has been closing branches after years of mounting losses. The deal is expected to complete in the first three months of 2021. It scuppers a rival move made by the UK private equity firm Alchemy, a Countrywide shareholder which proposed a £90m cash injection into the firm in October in return for a controlling stake, and had the support of Peter Long, Countrywide’s executive chairman. Long quit in late November after opposition from shareholders to the plan, and the former William Hill boss Philip Bowcock was appointed chief executive. Before Alchemy’s move, LSL Property Services, which owns Your Move, abandoned a planned all-share merger with Countrywide in March. All of Countrywide’s lenders will be repaid in full, said Connells, pledging to invest in the group’s technology and branch network to turn the business around. It said there would be some job losses as the two head offices in Leighton Buzzard and Milton Keynes were merged, but vowed to retain staff in the branches. The offer is far below Countrywide’s £750m valuation when it floated on the stock market in March 2013 amid a buoyant property market. The company amassed debts when it went on an acquisition spree in 2014 and 2015, buying up high street brands at a time when others invested in online estate agency services. Long blamed its woes on the “completely wrong” strategy pursued by the former chief executive Alison Platt, who sought to run the estate agent like a retailer from a central base, triggering an exodus of middle management. David Livesey, Connells’ chief executive, said: “We have the right management team, strategy and investment firepower to work with the talented teams at Countrywide and lead Countrywide into a bright future.” David Watson, the acting chairman of Countrywide, said: “Following a thorough evaluation of options and extensive consultation with the company’s major shareholders, we have been encouraged by their recognition of the need to put in place a sustainable capital structure and a willingness to support the company, which is a great business that has been constrained by too much debt.” The UK housing market has been surprisingly buoyant this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. It ground to a halt for a few weeks during the first national lockdown but bounced back in the summer, helped by a stamp duty cut. Demand from buyers looking for bigger homes in leafy locations has surged as many office workers switched to working from home. But forecasters expect the market to cool next year, when the stamp duty cut expires, with unemployment expected to rise sharply."
"UK mortgage approvals have risen to the highest level in 13 years, driven by the government’s stamp duty holiday and buyers reassessing their living situation during the coronavirus pandemic. Figures from the Bank of England showed the number of mortgages approved by banks and building societies for home purchases had leapt to 105,000 in November – the highest figure since August 2007, the month immediately before queues formed outside branches of Northern Rock at the start of the financial crisis. Threadneedle Street said the number of monthly approvals had increased by 7,700 on October’s level, reflecting a boom in the mortgage market during the month when rapid growth in Covid infections led the government to impose a second national lockdown in England. Mortgage borrowing plunged during the first Covid lockdown as the crisis sank Britain’s economy into the deepest recession for 300 years, hitting a trough of just £200m in April 2020. Borrowing soared to £5.7bn in November, up £1.2bn on the level in October. The number of new mortgage approvals – which provide an early indicator for borrowing levels in future months when buyers take up their mortgage offers – have increased more than tenfold, after hitting a low point of 9,400 in May. Figures from the Bank also showed households repaid £1.5bn of credit card debt, personal loans and car finance in November, in a reflection of weaker consumer spending during the second national lockdown and some households in which people work from home being able to save money. Since the start of the pandemic in March, households have repaid £17.3bn of consumer credit, according to the Bank, bucking a trend in recent years for rapid growth in credit-card borrowing. While many low-income workers have suffered a financial hit during the pandemic, total household deposits increased by almost £5bn on the month to reach £17.6bn, as people saved money while much of the high street was closed. Despite the boom in mortgage approvals – equivalent to the last days of the mid-2000s property bubble when zero-deposit mortgages were still widely available – analysts warn that a sharp drop in activity is looming. The UK housing market boomed in 2020, with property prices soaring to a six-year high as people rushed to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and re-evaluated their living arrangements during lockdown. However, mortgage lenders and economists warn the end of the stamp duty holiday in March and rising unemployment could trigger a collapse in house prices in 2021. Halifax, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, estimates an annual drop of between 2% and 5%, while the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economic forecaster, is more pessimistic, predicting an 8% fall. Faced with the potential downturn, lenders have made it tougher for buyers with smaller deposits to purchase a home – hitting first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said demanded looked set to remain strong right up until the starting threshold for paying stamp duty – the tax paid on property purchases – returns to £125,000, from £500,000 at present. “The mortgage market is heading for a hard landing,” he said. House price growth is, however, expected to return in 2022, according to analysts, despite the cost of a home rising out of reach for increasing numbers of people in recent years. Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “While the end of the stamp duty holiday in March will clearly have an impact on transaction numbers, the effect will be reduced if the pandemic has entered the endgame. Some buyers and sellers may hesitate in coming weeks, but sentiment will ultimately improve over the course of the year.”"
"Another 787,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week before Christmas, the last snapshot of 2020’s appalling jobs market before the New Year. Unemployment claims have been rising again in recent weeks to their highest levels since the autumn as surging coronavirus rates have slowed hiring and led to more layoffs. At current levels the weekly claims figures are almost four times their pre-pandemic average. The latest weekly figure from the Department of Labor was 19,000 lower than the previous week’s 803,000 claims but the average number of claims over the last four weeks is now 836,750, more than the population of the city of Seattle. The national unemployment rate started the year at 3.6% in January and hit a record high of 14.7% in April as the coronavirus shut down much of the US economy. The unemployment rate has since declined dramatically, it was 6.7% in November, but the recovery has been uneven with women and black, Hispanic and young people still experiencing high levels of unemployment. The numbers of long-term unemployed are rising. The recent increases in weekly unemployment claims signal more trouble ahead. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 25.7 million workers in the US remain officially unemployed, otherwise out of work due to the pandemic, or have experienced a reduction in work hours or pay. After months of wrangling Congress has finally brokered a deal to extend unemployment assistance to the millions laid off during the pandemic. The $900bn Covid-19 relief bill will give those receiving unemployment benefits an extra $300 a week and extends two pandemic-specific programs used by about 14 million people. But the delay in the agreement means many across the country face delays in payments and more hardship. Fernando Comas of Secaucus, New Jersey, worked as a video engineer in the entertainment industry before the pandemic and has been furloughed since March until at least 2021. Six weeks ago, his benefits were exhausted. He has been unable to receive answers from his state unemployment agency to try to resolve the issue. “I have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, a car payment, and I’m a single father of two small girls who rely on me to provide for them,” said Comas, who cannot afford to find other work because his family’s health coverage is still being covered by his employer. “I’m going to lose everything, probably going to be evicted and will start to go to the food banks for food for my family.”"
"Primark has said it will lose an additional £220m in sales as more stores are forced to close under new restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 in the UK. The cut-price fashion chain’s owner, Associated British Foods, said it expected to lose £650m in sales in the year to September, up from the £430m it had announced on 4 December, after the government said major cities including Manchester and Birmingham must join London and the south-east of England in closing non-essential shops. Primark said 253 of its stores would now be temporarily closed from 1 January, just over two-thirds of its outlets globally. The update comes as retailers brace for further pain after the government announced that all of the north-east of England, Greater Manchester, large parts of the Midlands and the south-west would fall under the strictest tier 4 restrictions from Thursday morning. All of mainland Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already under the tightest restrictions which involve the closure of hospitality and non-essential retail, which includes shops that sell clothing, toys, books and electrical goods. The restrictions have been widened in response to a new variant of Covid-19 that has contributed to a record rise in infections across the country. The number of shoppers out and about last week slumped by 46%, compared to the same period in 2019, according to the advisory firm BDO’s high street tracker. Online sales rose by 50% but that was not enough to offset the in-store decline. Total sales for established retailers fell 23%. Fashion sales were down just over a third. Primark takes a heavier hit from store closures than some rivals because it does not sell goods online. When the chain reopened in England earlier this month, however, after a month-long high street lockdown, the group said it saw “phenomenal” sales growth. Eleven stores stayed open overnight, resulting in a 40-hour trading marathon, and shoppers queued to get into the stores in the small hours of the morning."
"The fashion and homewares chain Next is considering teaming up with the US owner of Oak Furnitureland to buy the parent company of Topshop. Davidson Kempner Capital Management has held detailed talks with Next about a potential bid for Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which fell into administration last month, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Next is understood to be interested in Topshop and Topman while Davidson Kempner, which gave a £180m emergency loan to Poundland in 2018 and has previously been linked with a potential rescue of the Peacocks fashion chain, would take on Arcadia’s smaller brands such as Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans and Wallis. Sources said there was no certainty that a deal would be put forward on Monday, when a flurry of bids are now expected to be filed for Arcadia if Next chooses Davidson Kempner as its partner. Next has also held talks with other finance houses, including Alteri and Carlyle, about a bid, according to Sky News, which first reported the potential tie up with Davidson Kempner. The retailer has been expanding its portfolio of brands in the past year with a joint venture to operate 18 Victoria’s Secret standalone lingerie stores in the UK, as well as sell the brand in its own stores and online. It has also become a licence partner licence for Ted Baker lingerie, and has taken on parts of several former Debenhams stores to create a new beauty outlet. Other parties interested in Arcadia are thought to include Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, online specialist Boohoo, Marks & Spencer and Authentic Brands, the owner of US department store Barneys. Primark has also asked for bidders information but is not expected to place a formal offer. While Boohoo is seen as frontrunner for Topshop, Arcadia’s prime asset from which administrators at Deloitte expect to raise about half the £400m guide price for the group, Next and some other bidders may win an advantage by pledging to keep a substantial number of stores open. Arcadia’s interlinked head office systems, including IT and sourcing, make it difficult for a purely financial player to break up so a willingness to take on the whole group will also be attractive to administrators. The sale is further complicated by Arcadia’s close links to Debenhams, which is set to close all its stores by March if a buyer cannot be found. The department store chain is in talks with Frasers about a potential rescue deal. Davidson Kempner bought Oak Furnitureland out of administration in June and has since been touted as a potential rescuer for several failed UK businesses including Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, the owner of Peacocks and Jaeger, which is also being sold off by administrators."
"Tougher coronavirus restrictions have dealt a fresh setback to struggling city centres, with Christmas shoppers staying away as doubts increase about whether the Boxing Day sales – the next big event in the retail calendar – will be allowed to go ahead. The prime minister this week urged shoppers to “think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales”. Billions of pounds are usually spent on what is one of the biggest shopping days of the year, although shops in Wales and Northern Ireland have already been told to close. Diane Wehrle, the insights director at the research firm Springboard, which tracks shopper numbers, said the number of shoppers visiting UK stores and shopping centres was about a third less than this time last year, despite the proximity to Christmas. The decline in central London, however, has been far greater, with numbers down nearly 70% on 2019 after the capital was placed in the toughest tier 3 restrictions. That compares with the decline of about 50% recorded by Springboard in regional cities. “Central London has undoubtedly been harder hit than smaller towns and regional cities due to the reliance on public transport and loss of office workers,” said Wehrle. “It is clear that there has been an immediate impact on activity levels following the introduction of tier 3 restrictions.” If the sales are allowed to go ahead, they may be disappointing for retailers anyway as families use their “freedom pass” to spend time together, rather than shop, Wehrle suggested. Some big high street names such as Marks & Spencer are closing this year anyway but rivals such as Next and Selfridges are still set to open. “Footfall has been falling on Boxing Day for some time but it is going to be even harder hit this year because of the five-day pass that we have,” said Wehrle. “People are not going to be thinking about going out shopping so much.” Stores in the West End are heavily reliant on local office workers and overseas tourists who are missing in large numbers. The high-end stores on key shopping thoroughfares such as Oxford Street usually rake in more than £2.5bn in November and December but this year that figure will be less than £900m. Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of the New West End Company, which represents 600 of the area’s retailer, said the weekends since stores reopened on 2 December had been stronger, with footfall “only 30% down”. It remained to be seen what Londoners’ appetite to shop would be on the last weekend before Christmas now that the city is tier 3. The tough conditions mean worried retailers have already started to cut prices to shift unsold winter fashion and gifts. “Half the West End has probably gone into sale already,” said Tyrell. “There is a lot of stock to clear and I think the worry is we might not have Boxing Day.” Harrods, which last year entertained queueing shoppers on Boxing Day with a Motown band, has abandoned its traditional hoopla. Instead the Knightsbridge store is already selling designer clothing and homeware at half-price. The Watches of Switzerland chief executive, Brian Duffy, said shopper numbers had struggled to recover in London but the picture was better in other cities, such as Birmingham and Glasgow, where shoppers arrived by car. “The only bright spots we’ve seen have been the last two weekends,” he added. “I think there will be an even greater reluctance to go shopping [in London] with the increased alert level.” The Treasury’s decision to end tax-free shopping on 31 December would also “whack” the West End, Duffy said, casting doubt on the future of some of the luxury stores trading in Regent Street and Bond Street. “This whole VAT thing is really alarming for London overall,” he said."
"Lloyds Banking Group has cancelled staff bonuses for 2020 after missing financial targets and recording a sharp drop in profits during the Covid crisis. The bank told staff across its Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland brands on Thursday that it was making an early announcement on bonuses in light of the challenging economic outlook, and with profits already down 85% to £434m in the first nine months of the year. Last year Lloyds cut its bonus pool for the first time in four years to £310m, down from £465m in 2018. The bank told staff in a memo: “Despite the good news about the vaccine rollout, like most of our peers, our year-to-date business performance continues to be challenging.” Despite reporting a third-quarter profit, Lloyds told employees: “We are not where we expected to be and are short of the commitments we made to ourselves and our shareholders – which I know also includes many of you.” The decision has not changed fortunes for the chief executive, António Horta-Osório, who is set to leave in June 2021 and confirmed earlier this year that he would waive his 2020 bonus, worth as much as £1.8m. William Chalmers, the finance chief, also ruled himself out of a payout worth up to approximately £800,000. The decision to cancel bonuses means Lloyds will avoid uncomfortable questions from UK regulators, which said last week they would be scrutinising cash bonuses for bankers in light of the continued economic uncertainty. But the cancellation could prove controversial, if the bank decides to pay shareholders dividends in the new year. The Bank of England last week lifted its temporary ban on dividend payouts to investors, but told lenders a cap would be imposed until at least mid-2021. The coronavirus pandemic has put pressure on bank earnings. Record low interest rates have squeezed net interest income, which measures the difference between interest earned on loans v that paid on deposits. The deteriorating economic outlook has also forced Lloyds to put aside £4.1bn so far to cover potential defaults on loans and credit cards. Lloyds has also announced almost 2,000 job losses since September as part its restructuring plans. Accord, a specialist union for staff in financial services, said: “Bad news is bad news and the lack of any group performance share [bonus] will give some individuals real problems next year when many family budgets are already stretched.” However, unions have reached a tentative agreement to increase salaries by at least 1% for about 80% of Lloyds Banking Group staff. The lowest-paid workers will be guaranteed a pay rise of at least £400. Lloyds is also considering distributing shares to employees in the new year in lieu of a bonus, and earlier this year paid one-off bonuses worth £250 to frontline staff who had worked through the pandemic. The group said: “This decision on bonuses in no way reflects the hard work and commitment our people have made throughout this extraordinary year to keep our businesses operating strongly and to provide support and help to our consumer and business customers.”"
"Boeing is hiring its own team of up to 160 pilots to work with airlines on its relaunch of its bestselling 737 Max as the plane returns to service around the world. The manufacturer is seeking pilots with instructor experience to observe and help airline pilots once flights of the 737 Max restart in the new year. The pilots will be given 35-day assignments at an equivalent annual salary that could reach $200,000 (£148,000), with a potential total cost of $32m, Reuters first reported. Most airlines plan to start flying the 737 Max in the early months of 2021. American Airlines will start its first commercial flights on 29 December. A smooth return to service for the 737 Max is crucial for the fortunes of Boeing, after the model was grounded from March 2019 after two crashes that killed a total of 346 people. The crisis rocked the US manufacturer, forcing the resignation of a chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, and costing more than $20bn in compensation to customers and victims’ families and extra production costs. The 737 Max crisis meant Boeing fell much further behind its bitter European rival, Airbus, in the battle to be the world’s largest aeroplane manufacturer, and left it in a weak financial position when the coronavirus pandemic caused a dramatic decline in global air traffic. Boeing said in October it would make 30,000 of its 160,000 workers redundant by the end of 2021 as it tried to retrench. The twin challenges of the crashes and the pandemic have meant orders for the 737 Max have slumped, although Ryanair this month ordered 75 of the jets, probably at a steep discount. Boeing has made a number of changes to the way the 737 Max flies in order to prevent any recurrence of the issues that contributed to the fatal crashes, namely the repeated triggering of an anti-stall system that forced the nose of the plane to dip. As well as the extra pilots, Boeing has set up a 24-hour monitoring facility in California to respond immediately in case of emergency. It is also working with airlines on talking points for discussing the 737 Max with passengers. Reuters reported that an Isle of Man-based company, CCL Aviation, was carrying out pilot recruitment. CCL Aviation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, its website advertised job opportunities for captains of Boeing 737, 777 and 787 models with instructing experience.  The advert said the pilots must have more than 1,000 hours of documented aircraft instructor experience for airlines, and have “no incidents, accidents, losses or violations” on their record. A Boeing spokeswoman said: “We continue to work closely with global regulators and customers to safely return the 737-8 and 737-9 to service worldwide.”"
"The outsourcing company Serco has announced it will repay government furlough scheme support and give staff £100 bonuses each in recognition of their work during the pandemic. Serco has been running much of the UK government’s contact-tracing operation. The furlough scheme repayment will cost about £3m, while about 50,000 frontline staff will receive the one-off bonus payments, at a cost of £5m. The company said the combined cost was equivalent to 5% of 2020 underlying trading profits of £160m-£165m. It said the overall effect of the pandemic before the payouts would be to increase its annual profits by about £14m. Serco’s profits have been boosted by lucrative contracts to run some contact tracing as part of the UK government’s heavily criticised test-and-trace programme. The company is also contracted to run some test centres. Serco said its work on test and trace was still growing and it was operating 200 test sites, up from about 125 in October. The company said it had again delayed a decision as to whether to pay a dividend to shareholders or bonuses to executives until it reported its final results for 2020, which is likely to occur in early 2021. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, raised concerns in October, saying Serco and its executives may benefit from government spending that would be better directed towards the NHS. In September the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the test-and-trace programme had had only a “marginal impact” in reducing transmission of Covid-19. Serco’s work has also been criticised for tracing fewer people than contact tracers working in the public sector. Serco’s chief executive, Rupert Soames, has rejected criticism of his company’s work, saying it hit all targets set by the government. However, those targets do not include the number of people successfully reached by contact tracers, according to key performance indicators listed in documents first reported by Private Eye. Soames said Serco workers had been “resilient, flexible and dedicated to ensuring the delivery of public services”. He added that although Serco and other companies still faced “unprecedented levels of uncertainty”, he expected to make similar revenues and profits in 2021. The company said it expected to report revenue growth of 19% to £3.9bn for 2020."
"Supermarket sales figures have captured the way Covid has caused big changes in the way we live, from lager-fuelled barbecues and home-cooked roasts replacing nights in the pub and ready meals, to lower sales of makeup, deodorant and even toothbrushes pointing to people letting themselves go a bit. With coronavirus restrictions often forbidding meals and nights out with friends, Britons put an extra £2.5bn of beer, wine, spirits and meat in their trolleys as the pandemic “shifted consumer shopping habits to the extreme”, according to The Grocer magazine’s annual Top Products Survey. After years when similar exercises have turned up more wholesome lifestyle trends such as the rise of the plant-based diet, the star performer of 2020 was lager, with sales soaring by more than a fifth, or more than £800m. Supermarkets also rang up an extra £1bn of cigarettes and rolling tobacco at the checkout. The survey, in conjunction with the market research firm Nielsen, underlined the “impact of the coronavirus on the nation’s shopping habits and the nation’s health,” said The Grocer’s editor, Adam Leyland. “A surprising trend we’ve seen this year is the rise in tobacco sales, and while some of those extra sales reflect the lack of foreign travel and duty-free purchases, it’s a step change from previous years.” The flipside of the crisis in the UK’s pub and restaurant trade has been booming supermarket sales. November was the biggest month ever for grocery sales, with shoppers spending almost £11bn as the autumn lockdowns forced people to stay home. The surprise winner of the supermarket lager boom of 2020 was San Miguel, with sales up more than 60%. Wine and spirits also had massive gains, of £717m and £567m, in the 52 weeks to 5 September tracked by the survey. The Mexican lager brand Corona managed to defy the odds, with sales jumping 40%. The curtailing of social lives and shift to homeworking led to an extra £440m spent on sausages, burgers and chicken to cook up at home. This was in contrast to 2019 when fresh meat sales, particularly of beef, were suffering. The figures reflect pub, restaurant and school closures, but as Britons found themselves with no excuses not to cook, there was a £74m hole in ready-meal sales. Rachel White, Nielsen’s retail intelligence leader for the UK and Ireland, said the pandemic had “shifted consumer shopping habits to the extreme. With more free time at home, consumers moved away from chilled ready-meal options and focused instead on creating their own dining experience at home, cooking with fresh ingredients and enjoying a drink at home rather than at the pub.” At the same time, with no one to impress at work or when out socialising, personal care regimes took a back seat. Sales of cosmetics, hairstyling products, toothbrushes and deodorant all slumped, cumulatively shedding nearly £300m in sales. The biggest loser was the cosmetics aisle, with £180m knocked off sales as remote working coupled with face mask regulations meant people dropped their usual routines. Sales of deodorants and toothbrushes were down 10%. Similarly sales of products that consumers tend to pick up on the go, such as bottled water and chewing gum, were also down sharply, because buyers were going nowhere this year."
"The Wall Street bank Citigroup will offer employees 12-week sabbaticals as part of a benefits package prompted by a review of bankers’ work-life balance after the coronavirus crisis proved staff were working productively – and happily – from home. Employees will also be allowed to volunteer with a charity for up to four weeks full-time while Citi covers 100% of their regular salary. It is understood the new work setup will be offered to the bank’s US staff first, but will eventually being extended to Citi’s 8,000 UK bankers as part of a global rollout. A recent Citi survey showed the bank’s employee satisfaction increased during the pandemic and that many staff preferred home working, which can offer greater flexibility to bankers usually trapped in offices during long work days. Citi is now planning to review all of its global roles at the beginning of 2021 to help determine which staff may benefit from home working regularly in the long term. That is on top of the new scheme that will allow staff to take up to two sabbaticals during their tenure, lasting 12 weeks each, while receiving 25% of their regular pay. Separate to the sabbaticals, staff will also be allowed two stints of charity volunteering on full pay. They must work for the bank for at least five years before being allowed to use either scheme. The perks, which were first reported by Bloomberg, will also include the ability to buy up to five extra days of annual holiday, which is already available to UK staff. Citi is just the latest firm to review its approach to work and staff benefits during the pandemic. The London-headquartered banking group Standard Chartered announced last month it was permanently shifting to flexible working by letting staff apply for their ideal mix of home and office work from early 2021. That will apply to the bank’s 2,000 employees in London, where about 10% of staff have been going into the office since coronavirus hit. The US banking company JP Morgan is also expecting up to 30% of its almost 257,000 global employees to work remotely in future, at least part of the time. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, said: “I’d be very surprised if anybody, particularly in the services sector, really needs to be in the office five days a week, physically, as a future model. But we need to be quite adaptive, quite flexible and quite specific, job role by job role.” Lloyd’s is opening its doors three days a week only, and welcoming up to 250 workers a day, compared with 6,000 pre-pandemic. Brokers and underwriters have been working largely remotely since coronavirus restrictions came into force."
"The world’s first gin in a paper-based bottle is set to go on sale in the UK early next year as packaging specialists jostle to step up production of eco-friendly alternatives to the traditional glass container. The UK manufacturer of the so-called “frugal” bottle – made from predominantly recycled paperboard with a food-grade liner inside – has received orders from around the world to make containers for sake and spirits in Japan, whiskey in the US and wine in Spain, Australia, Italy and France. Frugalpac, based in Suffolk, has recently partnered with Silent Pool Distillers in Surrey to produce the world’s first commercial gin in a paper bottle in early 2021, opening a new factory to increase production capacity. The new eco-friendly bottles – which can be recycled along with household waste – are a novel alternative to the carbon-intensive glass model devised by the Romans but which has remained largely unchanged since the 19th century. Although glass can be recycled, it is very carbon-intensive to make. The frugal bottle, made from recycled paperboard, is five times lighter than a glass one and has a carbon footprint up to six times (84%) lower than a glass bottle. New research shows that nearly two-thirds of wine drinkers in the UK said they would buy wine in a paper bottle, according to Frugalpac’s independent research. The survey by Survation found that 63% would buy it in a new-style container, while only 14% said they would not. Malcolm Waugh, chief executive of Frugalpac, said: “Our bottle seems to have really captured the imagination of drinks brands and customers. It’s clear that people want to drink more sustainably, and paper bottles are here to stay. Wine experts used to say people would turn their noses up at screw caps. But they’ve become the norm and we believe the paper bottle will prove just as popular.” The new product is based on the model for “bag in box” wines – dubbed “cardbordeaux” and “bagnums” – which enjoyed a sales surge in the UK during lockdown as Britons opted for better value for money and fewer trips to the supermarket. Frugalpac, which devised what it claimed was the world’s first fully recyclable coffee cup, was recently singled out by the UK Department for International Trade’s Great Britain campaign as “doing incredible things to help build a global sustainable future” in the run-up to next year’s COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow."
"The government has named 72 high streets across England that have been selected to receive £831m of investment to help fund their recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and to protect jobs. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said the money would “help our much-loved town centres get through this and prosper into the future”. However, the Labour party said the government had originally promised £1bn when it launched the Future High Streets Fund. “The year ahead will be a big one for the high street as it seeks to recover, adapt and evolve as a result of the pandemic,” Jenrick said. “Today’s £830m investment from the Future High Streets Fund is one of many ways the government is working to help our much-loved town centres get through this and prosper into the future. “The role of the high street has always evolved. We want to support that change and make sure that they are the beating heart of their local community – with high quality housing and leisure in addition to shops and restaurants.” Jenrick said the money – which was first promised in 2018 to help high streets struggling long before the coronavirus pandemic – would “help us build back better and make town centres a more attractive place to live, work and visit”. The government said the injection of cash was a “key milestone for the government’s levelling-up agenda”. “The funding will help these areas transform their high streets into vibrant hubs for future generations and to protect and create thousands of jobs,” the Department for Communities and Local Government said. Swindon and Sunderland are to get the most money – £25m each – to fund a “bus boulevard” in the Wiltshire town and to improve Sunderland’s 1960s railway station. A total of 15 towns and cities are to receive all the money they had bid for, totalling £255m. Another 57 areas have received provisional funding offers worth a combined £576m. The £831m total is £169m short of the £1bn Boris Johnson promised in August 2019 would “re-energise and transform” more than 100 high streets across the country. Johnson had said the Future High Streets Fund would support more than 100 high streets. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said £107m of the missing money had been transferred to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to fund the regeneration of heritage high streets. She said a further £15.1m had been spent on helping 101 local authorities make their bids for the cash. Some of the remaining money was spent on “developing a new parking code”, she said. Some high streets that were shortlisted by the prime minister in August 2019 were not selected to receive any funds. They include Barrow, Blackpool, Bideford and Runcorn. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “We are supporting our high streets to get through this pandemic through business grants, paying people’s wages and tax deferrals. “The Future High Streets Fund will help areas bounce back through regeneration projects that level up opportunities and create jobs right across the country.” Among the projects selected for the funding were £17.9m for the renovation of the Scala Theatre and Corn Exchange in Worcester, a scheme to build 186 homes in Birkenhead and a plan to convert empty retail units in Tamworth, Staffordshire, into community spaces. Jeremy Oates, Tamworth borough council’s cabinet member for heritage and growth, said: ““The projects couldn’t just be a case of smartening up an outdoor space or adding hanging baskets, the government is looking for change on a large and transformative scale, in a way that recognises the changing role of the town centre and enables it to survive and thrive on the basis of what people want. Our bid includes a number of very exciting projects which are focused on creating the right foundations for a town centre that is at the heart of the community.” The government was encouraged to launch the scheme by Sir John Timpson, the owner of the shoe repair chain that carries his name. He had called for councils to be given more money to turn town centres into communities and meeting places, highlighting that high streets were not just about shopping. “By helping our towns create their own individual community hub,” Timpson said at the time, “I believe we will have vibrant town centres to provide a much-needed place for face to face contact in the digital age.” 15 places have been selected to receive all the money they asked for 1.

"The toy-train maker Hornby has temporarily stopped all orders to customers outside the UK, blaming delays caused by uncertainty over Brexit and disruption at UK ports. The company, which also makes Scalextric car racing sets and Corgi cars, said it would not accept any non-UK orders until 4 January, after the transition period ends and EU-UK trade switches to a new relationship under rules that have not yet been agreed. Hornby’s toys exported from the UK to the EU could face tariffs of up to 4.7% of their cost if no deal is agreed. If tariffs are imposed while goods from the UK are delayed in transit, an EU customer could be forced to pay the duty themselves before receiving the goods, a complication Hornby is keen to avoid. Lyndon Davies, Hornby’s chief executive, said: “I’ve seen the Gulf war, Falklands war, three-day week, crashes on the stock market – after all these things there are issues.  “All we’re asking is, tell us what is going on. We’re forced into a position of saying, what is the point of going through the pain of all these orders? “What the world of business has to do is sort out the mess and the carnage of what’s left.” Importers to the UK have been struggling with increased demand for goods before the 1 January Brexit deadline, adding to global problems in the shipping industry that have already caused significant delays for imports from east Asia. Davies said Hornby had taken delivery of one shipment of Batman vs Joker Scalextric sets, which had been “going up and down the strait of Dover for three weeks”, as a result of port delays. However, the company has stockpiled enough toys to ensure there is no danger of running out of some of its key items, such as train sets, for as long as a year. “We will not be running out of Spitfires,” Davies added, referring to models of second world war fighter aircraft. Hornby head office tweeted the decision to pause orders on Tuesday. It said it was pausing all non-UK orders until 4 January 2021, adding: “We hope you can understand the difficult position we are in & remain patient with us until we can find a solution.” Davies said the company should be able to cope in the longer term, in part because of its surprise lockdown sales boom. Hornby enjoyed a 33% jump in sales in the six months to September as families stuck at home bought more toys. “You can sit there whilst the world is falling apart creating your fantasy train set,” Davies said."
"Dixons Carphone has indicated it has no plan to pay back business rates relief despite reporting a rise in profits after online sales made up for closures enforced during the coronavirus pandemic. Online sales more than doubled to £1.8bn in the half year to 31 October, and overall sales in the UK and Ireland electricals business rose by 15%. The group made a profit before interest and tax of £100m in the six-month period. The company said “the impact of temporary store closures was more than offset by strong online sales growth” as consumers and workers confined to their homes bought laptops and computer games to get them through lockdowns. Dixons Carphone, which also runs the Currys and PC World brands, said it received business rates tax relief worth £34m in the UK from the start of the pandemic up to 31 October. The business rates relief was introduced by the government to help retailers through what was feared to be a difficult period. However, many retailers have now repaid the relief after sales performed better than expected. These include most of the UK’s large supermarket chains and other essential retailers who remained open through the lockdowns, who collectively repaid more than £1.8bn after criticism of their retention of the money. Alex Baldock, Dixons Carphone’s chief executive, repeatedly stressed that the company was “winning” in spite of “fighting with one hand tied behind our back” during the pandemic with store closures. He said the company had been “responsible”. “We can look at ourselves in the mirror,” he said. Dixons Carphone was not classed as an essential retailer, meaning its stores were closed through each lockdown. Overall, the company said the cost of the disruption, including the store closures and extra spending on safety measures, was £155m. After government support the negative impact was £10m. That support also included £54m under the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, which paid 80% of furloughed workers’ wages up to £2,500 per month. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax, a measure of profitability, in the main UK operation nearly tripled to £95m in the half year. Shares in the company jumped by 13% on Wednesday morning, hitting their highest level since early February when the pandemic’s effects on Europe were starting to become clear. However, the company is still in the middle of a turnaround effort that has included 2,900 redundancies and 531 store closures announced in March. Baldock said Dixons had been affected by disruption at ports in recent weeks, although he did not expect major problems in the event of no EU trade deal being struck before the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January. Dixons Carphone has stockpiles of two days’ worth of goods, which Baldock said was enough to see it through any disruption. He renewed calls for reform of the business rates system to reflect more recent rental values, a move that would result in online retailers paying more. “It would get people like Amazon to pay some more tax,” Baldock said."
"Unions have described companies who pay their chief executives huge multiples of their workers average salary as obscene, and called on ministers and shareholders to act to end the “runaway train” of inequality in corporate Britain. A report by the High Pay Centre thinktank on Tuesday revealed that Ocado, the online supermarket, had the biggest pay gap between those at the top and those on the shop floor. Its chief executive, Tim Steiner, was paid £58.7m last year – which works out at 2,605 times the £22,500 paid to the online grocery delivery company’s staff on average. It means Steiner was paid about 10 times as much as the average Ocado worker’s annual salary for just one day’s work. In second place was JD Sports, which paid its chief executive, Peter Cowgill, £5.6m, but paid staff an average of only £18,300. That means Cowgill’s pay was 310 times the median average. Tesco took third place for paying its outgoing chief executive 305 times the median pay. Laurence Turner, head of research and policy at the GMB union, said: “This shocking and important report provides a vivid snapshot of the staggering inequalities and exploitation in the world of work on the eve of the coronavirus outbreak. “There is no business or moral justification for paying an executive an obscene ratio of more than 2,000 times the average worker. “Action is needed, especially at a time when hundreds of thousands of jobs are under threat and households are struggling to make ends meet. Ministers, employers, and shareholders must all put an end to this runaway train.” The report showed that across the UK’s 100 biggest stock market listed companies, chief executives collect 73 times the amount paid to workers on average. Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said the report provided “valuable new insight into the corporate cultures and working practices of some of the UK’s biggest employers”. He added: “These findings show that quite low levels of pay are commonplace for large numbers of workers at many of our major companies. Hopefully the disclosures can help investors, policymakers and of course the companies themselves think more deeply about how to improve fairness at work, and pay for low-paid workers in particular.” A spokesperson for Ocado said: “The pay ratio is particularly high for 2019 due to the inclusion of the growth incentive plan (GIP), which was a five-year award granted in 2014 and vested in 2019. The level of the GIP payment recognises the extraordinary performance of Ocado during this period when the business grew from a circa £1.5bn business to the multibillion pound technology-led global business we are today.” The High Pay Centre figures shows that the biggest pay gaps are in the retail sector, where on average bosses are paid 140 times that collected by employees. The smallest gap was in financial services with a ratio of 35:1. The company with the smallest gap was identified as the asset management firm Sanne Group, where the chief executive collected eight times the median pay. UK companies have been forced to publish chief executive pay ratios in their annual reports following widespread anger over excessive executive pay. The new figures show the relationship of the chief executive’s pay relative to the median and 75th and 25th percentile of the company’s UK employees. Mubin Haq, chief executive of the Standard Life Foundation, said: “There is great potential for rethinking pay, benefiting those on lower incomes. Nowhere is this more stark than in the retail sector, which has the highest levels of inequality. During the pandemic the industry either relied heavily on government support or made significant profits. Rewards are not being fairly shared, but companies can begin to make plans to reduce the gaps that exist.”"
"The Bank of England has written to UK bank bosses telling them to review their exposure to losses that could emerge from businesses hardest-hit by Covid-19, as part of efforts to head off potential risks to the financial system. The review is likely to cover the accommodation, food, retail, leisure and construction sectors, which have been battered by travel restrictions and strict social distancing measures, as well as regional and nationwide-lockdowns imposed since March. The Bank outlined its plans in a letter to the chief executives of UK banks on Tuesday, saying it was expecting an increase in customers facing financial difficulty, as well as borrowers falling into arrears and default, next year. The central bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is already conducting three reviews looking at the risks linked to small and medium-sized businesses, the buy-to-let market and the way banks collect the debts of ordinary customers. The new review of the sectors hardest hit by the Covid crisis will cover companies included in the lenders’ wholesale portfolios, which deal with some of the biggest corporate clients on their books. “We anticipate further thematic work on wholesale portfolios in potentially Covid-19-vulnerable sectors, plus some international portfolios subject to challenging economic and credit risk conditions,” the letter said. The PRA added it would continue monitoring banks’ financial health throughout the crisis, including their ability and willingness to continue lending to businesses and households. In a separate letter to insurance bosses, the central bank said insurance firms would have to prove that they could collapse without damaging the UK economy, setting out how they could wind down in an orderly fashion. It will be the first time insurers are required to submit so-called living wills to the regulator. The central bank warned insurers: “We have very low tolerance for disorderly failure and its costs for policyholders and the wider economy. “We will expect firms to demonstrate that they have a suitable structure and business model, and adequate contingency plans to be able to exit the market smoothly without detriment to policyholders or spill-overs to other firms.” Banks are already required to submit living wills to the PRA to show that they could afford to foot the bill for their own failures. However, while banks’ living wills will eventually be made public, the PRA is not currently planning to release insurers’ blueprints in the same way."
"LoveHolidays, one of the UK’s biggest online travel agents, has been ordered to refund £18m to more than 40,000 customers after their trips were cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Competition and Markets Authority started investigating the firm after receiving hundreds of complaints from people waiting to get their money back. When customers asked LoveHolidays for a refund, they were told they would only get money back for their flights once the firm had received refunds from the airlines. However, online travel agents are legally bound to refund customers for package holidays cancelled due to coronavirus, regardless of whether or not the agent has received money back from suppliers, such as airlines. LoveHolidays has now signed formal commitments that ensure customers get a full refund. More than £18m will be refunded to 44,000 customers. Of this, so far £7m has been returned to 20,000 customers. The company and another large online agent, On the Beach, left the Association of British Travel Agents in September following disputes over customer refunds. LoveHolidays, which is licensed to carry 1.1 million passengers a year, said then that the package holiday regulations, which oblige companies to issue a refund within 14 days, had not been designed to deal with disruption on the scale since March. The watchdog has accepted LoveHolidays’ commitment to repay customers in full by the end of March at the latest, after reviewing the firm’s financial information.  Refunds will be made in two parts. Refunds for the cost of hotel accommodation and transfers must be made by 31 December for holidays cancelled before 1 November. From January, customers will receive refunds for accommodation and transfers within 14 days of a holiday being cancelled. Customers will have to wait longer to have their flights refunded, until the end of February or March depending on when their holidays were cancelled. If the firm fails to repay customers by the dates set, the CMA is prepared to take the company to court. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: “Travel agents have a legal responsibility to make prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus. “Our action today means that LoveHolidays’ customers now have certainty over when they will receive their money back and they will receive this without undue delay. “We are continuing to investigate package travel firms and where we find evidence that businesses are breaching consumer law, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action to protect consumers.” The watchdog has written to more than 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations under consumer protection laws, and has secured refund commitments from Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, Tui UK, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals."
"British American Tobacco has moved a step closer to producing a vaccine for coronavirus using tobacco plants, as it won approval in the US to begin testing on humans. The company behind cigarette brands including Lucky Strike, Rothmans and Benson & Hedges said the US Food & Drug Administration had given it clearance to begin a clinical study with adult volunteers. While large pharmaceutical companies are already producing vaccines, BAT believes its own can be produced in six weeks, compared with the several months it takes using conventional methods. This, the company claims, is because of proprietary technology that allows elements of the vaccine to gather quickly on tobacco plants. BAT also says its vaccine is stable at room temperature, unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech jab being administered in the UK, which must be stored and transported at about -70C. The vaccine has been developed by BAT’s biotechnology division, Kentucky BioProcessing (KBP), which has previously worked on a treatment for Ebola and is also developing a seasonal flu vaccine. BAT said KBP had cloned a portion of the genetic sequence of coronavirus and developed a potential antigen, which is then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction. KBP, which is based in Owensboro, Kentucky, says it can turn tobacco plants into “bio-manufacturing factories” capable of producing proteins they would not otherwise produce. Up to 3m can be grown, harvested and processed within six weeks, meaning the relevant proteins are produced faster than traditional methods, which KBP said could take months. The company, which was bought by BAT in 2014, says it can also temporarily encode tobacco plants with the genetic instructions to produce specific target proteins. Dr David O’Reilly, BAT’s director of scientific research, said: “Moving into human trials with both our Covid-19 and seasonal flu vaccine candidates is a significant milestone and reflects our considerable efforts to accelerate the development of our emerging biologicals portfolio. “It is our unique plant-based vaccine technology, which acts as a fast, efficient host for the production of antigens for a variety of diseases, that has enabled us to make this progress and respond to the urgent global need for safe and effective treatments and vaccines.” BAT’s vaccine remains some way behind those being produced by large drug companies such as Pfizer, which is administering doses in the UK and US, with AstraZeneca and Moderna not far behind. But if it can produce doses quickly and in a stable format, it could aid a global vaccination process likely to last years, as well as burnishing the reputation of a company more used to fielding criticism for damaging people’s health."
"Steep discounting by clothing retailers pushed down UK inflation in November as the second national coronavirus lockdown in England and tough restrictions across the country kept consumers away from the high street. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer prices index fell to 0.3% in November from 0.7% a month earlier. City economists had forecast an inflation rate of 0.6% Retailers are under renewed pressure as the rapid growth in infections discourages consumers from heading to the shops and amid fresh restrictions imposed in England, alongside tough measures in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Consumers increased their spending during England’s four-week lockdown, but did so online, according to figures from the British Retail Consortium. The ONS said clothes prices would usually go up in November in the run-up to Christmas. However, the pandemic has drastically altered usual spending trends and the British economy has been struggling to escape the deepest recession for more than 300 years. Falling food and drink prices also dragged down the inflation rate by the most since 2017, driven by goods such as vegetables and confectionery. These were partially offset by rising prices for games, toys and hobbies. The drop in inflation comes as the second national lockdown in England forced the closure of many non-essential shops, making it harder for retailers to sell clothing at normal prices. Analysts said the extension of Black Friday discounts by some retailers for the whole month of November – in a bid to boost consumer spending during lockdown – also influenced the drop in inflation. In additional to steep discounts, reminiscent of the first lockdown in March and April, analysts said the failure of several big high street clothing chains in recent weeks may have also contributed to falling prices, as companies liquidate their stocks. Economists said inflation was likely to remain below the 2% target set for the Bank of England’s interest rate setting committee, as higher levels of unemployment and tough coronavirus restrictions drag down demand for goods and services. However, Threadneedle Street is not expected to inject further stimulus into the economy when its monetary policy committee (MPC) next sets interest rates on Thursday, after pumping an extra £150bn into its quantitative easing bond-buying programme last month. Despite the weak economic recovery weighing on inflation, analysts said a disruptive Brexit at the end of the month could lead to a fall in the pound and chaos at the ports, which would drive up the cost of imported goods – fuelling a rise in inflation. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: “Early discounting in clothing and footwear lowered inflation, as retailers cut prices to try to boost consumer spend. Working from home has changed people’s needs and households exercised more caution, reining in some non-essential spending in November. “Despite the weak economic background, inflation could accelerate in coming months, with border frictions as a result of Brexit causing some prices to rise more than usual.”"
"Royal Mail has ended a two-year dispute with workers in a settlement that gives staff an above-inflation pay rise and enables the company to transition to a parcels-led business to cash in on the online shopping boom. The Communications Workers Union (CWU) hailed the “landmark” deal, which it said was an “excellent agreement” for postal workers which offered job security, a reduction in work hours and a pay rise. Workers will get a 3.7% pay rise, backdated to April this year, plus a one-hour reduction in the working week, which the union said equated to a 6.5% increase over the two-year deal. In addition, Royal Mail has agreed there will be no compulsory redundancies – it employs 143,000 workers in the UK – and in return the union has promised to support an ambitious modernisation of the business. “This is a landmark agreement that means that even in these incredibly difficult times, when members stand in solidarity with their union, it is entirely possible to plan a future that can still benefit workers, customers and the company.” Royal Mail has been at loggerheads with the CWU over a five-year £1.8bn turnaround plan launched by the former chief executive Rico Back, which has been held up by the threat of strikes. A walkout last Christmas was only averted after Royal Mail won a high court injunction. Workers have been concerned about job security and employment conditions as Royal Mail looks to introduce new technology and automation to enable the development of a 24/7 parcel delivery service. “We have a window of opportunity to focus Royal Mail on what our customers want today,” said Keith Williams, Royal Mail’s chief executive. “An ever-growing need for more parcels, whilst providing a sustainable letter service. This agreement provides a framework to do just that. We have been far too slow to adapt in the past and now need to deliver change much more quickly.” Royal Mail’s traditional letter business is in long-term decline, with volumes falling about 5% each year since 2015 as people move to digital communications. The trend has accelerated during the pandemic, with Royal Mail reporting that it delivered 1.1bn fewer letters in the five months to the end of August compared with the same period last year.  Last month, research from the postal regulator, Ofcom, found that scrapping Saturday letter deliveries would have no significant impact on consumers, but would save the business up to £225m a year. In contrast, Royal Mail’s parcel delivery operation is booming, thanks to the online shopping revolution, with the company reporting a 31% increase in volumes between April and September as home deliveries surge during the pandemic. Ofcom recently reported that 2.8bn parcels were sent and received via Royal Mail in the year to the end of March – 1bn more than in 2013."
"About 4,000 lorries, and thousands more small vans, are now waiting to cross the Channel after a two-day French ban on freight arriving from the UK, with food transport firms warning that potential disruption levels now range between “a shambles and a catastrophe” just as January and the end of Brexit transition looms . Representatives of the Food and Drink Federation and the Road Haulage Association (RHA) told MPs on Tuesday that the hundreds of lorries queued on the M20 into the port of Dover, and at a temporary parking facility at Manston airport in Kent, were only a part of the problem. Many more vehicles, they said, were parked elsewhere in Kent, or waiting to depart from factories and warehouses. Roger Gough, the leader of Kent council, told the BBC that nearly 3,000 vehicles were being held – 632 on the M20 and a further 2,220 at Manston. If vehicles were unable to return to France, the hauliers warned, there would be a shortage of transport to pick up fresh goods from the continent and return to the UK in time to refill shelves after Christmas. Queues could reach 7,000 vehicles, they added. The UK government was on Tuesday evening still trying to unlock the ban, which was imposed by Paris in an effort to contain the spread of a new variant of coronavirus, as talks about a post-Brexit trade deal go down to the wire. Industry insiders said the government was preparing to set up a Covid testing facility at Manston in an attempt to unlock the blockade. Retailers warned on Tuesday that vehicles would need to begin moving within 24 hours or there would be shortages of fresh produce including lettuces, tomatoes, citrus, soft fruit and cauliflowers in stores from 27 December. The British Retail Consortium trade body said it had told the government there was “no alternative to reopening the Channel ports, given that it is a key supply route for fresh produce at this time of year”. While some fresh food shelves could look bare in coming days, retailers urged shoppers not to panic buy. They said there would still be plenty of food as traditional Christmas fare such as potatoes, carrots, brussels sprouts and parnsips were largely grown in the UK and there were plenty of supplies of long-life goods such as tinned and packet foods. However, food industry representatives said that if the French ban continued it would affect preparations for the end of the Brexit transition set for 31 December. The industry had planned to use the week between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day to build stocks of fresh food and other goods in case of any disruption caused by changes to the terms of trade with the EU. Speaking at a special hearing of the business select committee, Duncan Buchanan, director of policy at the RHA, warned the government was being complacent about the growing problems and was making “big assumptions about readiness” for Brexit. He said the government’s suggestion that only a small proportion of goods were being imported via France was “dismissing the scale of the problem”. The haulage industry says a large proportion of fresh food is brought in by lorries from Calais at this time of year. “This problem is going to be significant,” Buchanan said. “Somewhere between a shambles and a catastrophe is coming in January, and everything I’ve seen in the last 24, 48 hours leads me to believe we are going to be in a bad position. “The problem is we do not know what goods exactly will be in short supply and exactly what’s not going to happen properly and what factories are not going to be able to make what they make.” Ian Wright, the chief executive of the FDF, said the disruption at Dover was a “tiny peek at what could happen in the first few days and weeks of the transition period ending and it would be compounded by tariffs and no deal.” He added “this kind of chaos” would be “entirely possible” at a number of ports around the UK exporting and importing from the EU next year. Concerns about imports of fresh food were matched by concerns about exports, particularly Scottish seafood destined for festive feasts in Spain. Wright said companies’ insurance policies would not cover the lost stock and called on the government to compensate firms affected by the delays to deliveries, which could lead to millions of pounds worth of salmon, langoustine and shellfish spoiling. The chief executive of Scotland Food & Drink, James Withers, said that even if a protocol for freight movements was agreed on Tuesday it would already be too late for most Christmas orders. “For some of our shellfish exporters, the pre-Christmas sales have now been ruined. It looks like mission impossible to get products to the big markets in Spain which are held tomorrow. That is an irrecoverable loss of income and I fear about this being a fatal blow to some of the smaller businesses after the horrendous year they have already had,” Withers said."
"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”"
"The telecoms sector has “no genuine belief” the government will be able to meet its broadband targets, a parliamentary inquiry has found, despite those targets having been cut just weeks ago. In its national infrastructure strategy, published in late November, the government announced plans to connect 85% of the country with ultrafast gigabit broadband, which usually requires a fibre-to-the-home connection, by 2025. That target was a downgrade from a previous goal, affirmed as recently as October, to connect 100% of the country by that date. “There is no genuine belief that it is achievable,” one witness told the DMCS select committee about the nationwide goal. But despite the reduced ambitions, the committee has warned that the government still risks missing the new target unless it improves management of the infrastructure plan. “It would not be acceptable having abandoned one unrealistic target, for the government to fail to meet a second, less ambitious, target through lack of effective planning or inadequate investment,” the committee writes in the final report from its inquiry into the UK’s broadband infrastructure. “The government should outline … how it settled on the new gigabit-capable broadband target of 85% coverage by 2025, a full assessment of how likely it considers it to be met, and the detail of how it plans to deliver it,” the report adds. The committee was also doubtful that the government’s belated shift to a “technology-neutral” approach would help achieve the target. Whereas the initial focus had been on securing full-fibre connections, running fibre-optic cables to the doorstep of every home in the UK, the new strategy takes into account other modes of delivering ultrafast broadband, including the latest technology underpinning Virgin Media’s cable TV network, and the fastest varieties of 5G. While the shift makes sense, the committee reported, “the government must not let it come with a trade-off in performance or longevity: any technologies used to deliver gigabit connectivity must be future-proof. “Moreover, fibre will be a significant component of other gigabit-capable technologies, such as 5G, and therefore the challenges of rolling out a truly nationwide full-fibre network must not be underestimated.” The committee also warned that the funding from the government, a £5bn pledge to bring broadband to the hardest to reach fifth of the country, was not enough. “It is difficult to see how £5bn will be enough to meet the government’s aim [and] it is therefore disappointing that over the next four years, the government will make available only 25% of the £5bn it had committed,” the report finds. On Tuesday, the Government set out how it intended to spend that tranche of funding, releasing a procurement strategy that prioritised upgrades to homes that do not yet have access to super-fast broadband. “Today we’ve set out our bold programme of national infrastructure projects to future-proof the UK’s internet networks so we can build back better from coronavirus and create new jobs and economic opportunities,” said Matt Warman, the minister for digital infrastructure. “We will begin these procurements rapidly so broadband providers big and small can move quickly to get the job done and level up communities with this much faster, next generation broadband.”"
"Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than scheduled before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19 border closures. The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions."
"The operator of the Olympic aquatic centre and hundreds of other leisure centres across the UK is being bailed out by cash-strapped local authorities in every area it operates as it struggles with the latest lockdown, the Guardian can reveal. GLL, which trades under the name Better, runs 230 pools, gyms and sports halls in areas including Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Cardiff, Bath, Cumbria and Cornwall and several London boroughs. Its chief executive, Mark Sesnan, warns that the lockdown has come at the worst time possible for a business built on new year’s fitness resolutions. He also fears the government help will not be enough to stop pools and sport centres closing for good. Various local bailouts have been secured in more than 40 of these areas, involving either direct grants, or deferred payments or loans, he said. And negotiations are still underway in the remaining areas, including Croydon council, which declared itself effectively bankrupt last month. Despite these bailouts and the importance of personal fitness highlighted by the pandemic, the business faces “disaster” because the third lockdown was imposed at its most lucrative time of year. It has been forced to close all of its leisure services including outdoor pools despite evidence to suggest swimming in chlorinated pools is safe from Covid infection. GLL was formed in 1993 to run Greenwich council’s leisure service and has since grown to become the biggest social enterprise leisure provider in the country. But it has revealed that the pandemic has cost it £170m in lost revenue, forcing it to spend £20m in reserves. It has also had to take out a £20m loan, cut more than 500 jobs with more under threat, and become dependent on local bailouts and the government’s furlough scheme. Its predicament has led to questions about its business model and calls for the services it runs to be brought back under council control in some areas including Belfast and Swindon. Chief executive, Mark Sesnan, has defended the company’s record and insists it does have a bright future once the latest lockdown is eased. He said: “We’ve moved from being a relatively strong financial business to one that now does rely on support for local authorities. The biggest issue is that some councils are very cash strapped themselves and have more pressing priorities.” He admitted that its business planning is predicated on the furlough scheme, which has helped 10,500 GLL employees, continuing at least until Easter. The government’s promise of £9,000 for each leisure centre won’t be enough, he warned. He pointed out its largest generate £1,000-a-day income, but are currently bringing in nothing. He said: “GLL welcomes and needs any and all financial support, but to be meaningful the amount needs to be based on real business losses, not arbitrary handouts.” Unite the union which represents many of GLL’s staff, says the pandemic has “exposed” GLL’s over reliance on public money and staff on casual contracts. Regional officer, Onay Kasab, said: “The pandemic has exposed GLL in several ways. Their business model relies on local government funding and with austerity it is not a model that can continue. It is not cheaper to outsource, because it ends up costing more money in the long term. The company is clearly in danger of going down, yet council taxpayers money continues to be thrown at it.” Sesnan, a former union shop steward, admitted that more than half the staff are on “flexible” contracts. But he insisted the company is trying to help as many staff as possible. He admitted that GLL’s 50 most inefficient pools and gyms could be forced to close, but these do not include the former Olympic facilities in east London. The most vulnerable pools and sports centres are the ones that did not open after relaxations of lockdown rules, including some in Cornwall, Cumbria, Newcastle, Preston, and a number of London boroughs. The government has insisted its leisure rescue package will not pay for services that remained closed. Sesnan said: “Swimming pools are not easy buildings to hibernate, you can’t just lock the doors and walk away.” And even with paying customers, some subsidy is required. He said. “A swim costs £10 to put on, but nobody pays any more than £5 for it. So whichever way you stack it up someone has to pay for that other fiver.” But despite the difficulties he insists the organisation can survive. “GLL isn’t going down. People who have kept themselves fit have had a much better chance of surviving the virus, than people who haven’t. It’s a low-cost way of preventing things like this in the future. There needs to be a new partnership between the health and fitness going forward. So the future is good.”"
"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets.  Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips & Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective. “From modern fashion to casual apparel, intimates and footwear, designing fashion for the curvy woman that fits and flatters, is all we do.”"
"Labor will try to compel the government to release a review into Australia Post’s expenses culture under former chief executive Christine Holgate after the communications minister backtracked on a suggestion it would be made public. On Monday a spokesman for Paul Fletcher confirmed the government had “received and considered” the report triggered by Holgate’s decision to spend $20,000 on Cartier watches for four executives, but refused to release it. The Australian Financial Review has reported that Holgate was cleared of any wrongdoing, with a specific finding she had not breached any rule, policy, procedure or governance requirement – a conclusion that was not disputed by Fletcher’s office. In October Holgate stood down after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, denounced the corporate gifts as “disgraceful” – comments she later labelled “humiliating”. Despite warning the government that the “optics” of the situation were not sufficient to make her stand down, Holgate resigned early in November, expressing regret over the gifts. In November Fletcher told ABC TV he expected the report would be released “in due course” and with appropriate redactions to respect individual privacy, but that the final decision would be one for cabinet. On Monday Fletcher’s spokesman said only that departments would “apply the lessons learned from the investigation to ensure that Australia Post and other government business enterprises comply with their legislative obligations, reflect community expectations, and have appropriate internal systems in place in their use of public resources”. The shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the decision to keep the report secret “is pathetic and, just like the purchase of Cartier watches, does not pass the pub test”.“If there is nothing to see here, why is the government burying the report? “If no breaches were found, why was the former CEO seemingly pressured into quitting without pay?” Rowland accused the government of an “abuse of process” by using cabinet consideration of the document to shield it from freedom of information requests. “If the government does not think taxpayers deserve to know whether their money has been wasted by senior Australia Post executives, then the Senate will need to take up the task.” Labor has criticised Morrison’s handling of the episode as a “panicked” response aimed at securing a photo opportunity. Morrison’s denouncement of Holgate followed cuts to the Australian National Audit Office and mild criticism of its discovery taxpayers had stumped up $26.7m too much for land owned by a donor to the Liberal party."
"December was the biggest month on record for British supermarkets as shoppers spent nearly £12bn stocking up on cheese, fresh fish and pork for a very unusual Christmas. Consumers spent £11.7bn on take-home groceries in the four weeks to 27 December, up from the previous record of just under £11bn in November, according to analysts at Kantar, as many pubs and restaurants were forced to close during the key trading period. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail at Kantar, said: “December is always an incredibly busy time for supermarkets, but take-home grocery shopping is usually supplemented by celebrations in restaurants, pubs and bars – with £4bn spent on food and drink, excluding alcohol, out of the home during the normal festive month. This year, almost all those meals were eaten at home and retailers stepped up monumentally to meet the surge in demand.” However, sales of whole turkeys slid 5% and Christmas pudding sales were flat year on year as most large family celebrations were called off under strict rules to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus. McKevitt said: “Without guests to host, it seems many families decided to pare things back slightly and the performance of traditional dinner items reflects this.” While total grocery sales rose 11.4% in the three months to 27 December, spending on Christmas staples was up just 4%, despite fewer opportunities to dine out. Sprouts remained popular with sales up more than 11% but other winners were cheese, with sales up 17%, fresh fish up 20% and pork roasting joints up 19%. Alcohol sales were up by £310m – as the closure of pubs and bars led to a switch to drinking at home. Monday 21 December was the busiest shopping day – earlier than the expected surge on 23 December – as households secured festive supplies amid the uncertainties of tiered lockdowns and problems at the Channel ports which disrupted deliveries of fruit and vegetables. However, Morrisons was the only one of the big four supermarkets to gain market share as local independent stores, discounters Lidl and Iceland and online specialist Ocado all outperformed the major chains. Sales at independent stores rose by 17.4% while Iceland was by far the fastest growing chain among those with high street outlets with sales up by more than a fifth. Ocado’s sales rose 36.5% according to Kantar, more than three times the pace of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda. That reflected a market-wide shift towards online shopping with 12.6% of grocery sales made via the internet in December compared with just 7.4% a year before. Aldi continued to lose market share with sales up 6.3% as it lost out to businesses with the capability to deliver online orders."
"China’s stock market has soared to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis as the world’s second-largest economy mounts a rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the value of the biggest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, closed up 1.9% on Tuesday at 5,368 points – the highest level since January 2008. Narrowly surpassing a level of 5,353 reached in 2015, when fears over a hard landing for China’s economy after years of blockbuster growth led to a sell-off in shares, the fresh landmark stands as the latest dramatic turnaround in global financial markets since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as China’s economy stages a faster recovery than expected at a time when other nations around the world are still grappling with rising infections and severe disruption to business and social life caused by the pandemic. As the nation at the centre of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, Chinese GDP fell for the first time in four decades in the opening months of 2020. However, many analysts believe harsh controls to contain the spread of the disease helped to lay the ground for a faster return to relative normality. China avoided the technical definition of a recession last year – two consecutive quarters of falling GDP – with a return to growth in the three months to June as it rolled back lockdown restrictions. After recording growth of just 1.9% for 2020 as a whole – the lowest level for 30 years – the International Monetary Fund expects China’s economy to grow by more than 8% in 2021, dramatically outpacing the recovery in many other countries. Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, an investment management firm, said the gains on the Chinese stock market reflected its rapid recovery. “China’s rebound is quite remarkable, compared to other major economies, many of which are once again rolling out stricter restrictions to stop the spread of Covid amid a tsunami of new cases.” “China’s already impressive economic recovery is likely to pick up momentum and this will be extremely attractive. But as 2020 showed us with perhaps too much clarity, things can change quickly and so-called ‘certainties’ can shift overnight,” he said. The fresh landmark for the Chinese stock market came on a day of choppy trading on the London stock market, with the FTSE 100 closing up 0.6% at 6,612, after recording modest losses earlier in the day amid concerns over the economic impact of the third Covid lockdown in England. There are however hopes for a stronger economic recovery in Britain once more people receive vaccinations, which could propel the blue-chip index higher. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading firm IG, said: “The swift nature of the vaccination process should ensure that any lockdown-fuelled weakness will be greeted by buying pressure as we look towards a March reopening.”"
"When the UK first went into lockdown last March, many supermarket workers said they had never felt so appreciated. Customers would thank them for their service, leave chocolates for the staff room and applaud delivery vans as if they were carrying royalty rather than groceries. Not any more, according to numerous store employees who contacted the Guardian to express their fears and frustrations about working through the second wave. From debit card refuseniks pulling down their masks to lick their fingers and separate their twenties, to families treating a trip to the supermarket as a social outing, many felt they were now the “forgotten key workers”. Others feel taken for granted, suffering anxiety and panic attacks as a result of their work environment. “In lockdown one it felt a little embarrassing at times – people would wave, even stop and applaud as you went past as if you were a NHS worker. Now, it’s back to normal. Block a cul-de-sac for five minutes and you can expect abuse,” said Ben Harvey, who started delivering groceries for a supermarket in April after losing his job as a sales executive. “You want to tell them that you’re delivering essential supplies during a global pandemic and they shouldn’t even be out, but in your employer’s van and uniform you obviously just have to bite your tongue and suck it up.” Conspiracy theorists are making the job harder, said one worker from a small supermarket in the home counties. “The maskless hordes and the QAnon conspiracy spouters seem to grow by the day. Many don’t care, some are just ignorant; but the most dangerous are those that think they’re following the rules. Customers who keep their distance from others, but crawl over shop staff to get their ‘essential’ Red Bull and loo roll, thanking them for everything they are doing from a mask pulled down to their chin to ‘help’ convey their message with sincerity and microdroplets of Covid-19.” The media seemed to have forgotten supermarket workers, he said: “Doctors and nurses are continually featured in the news (and rightly so), but there is very little mentioned about those who have worked throughout the pandemic and the toll this year has taken on them. “My mental health has been battered beyond belief and no matter what my behemoth employer says – there has been no consideration shown to the wellbeing and mental health of their staff. It has gone unchecked and unconsidered while we ring endless products through the non-socially distanced checkouts and stuff dirty cash into the ever expanding pockets of the shareholders and directors.” Social distancing had gone out of the window, he complained: “My little village shop is tiny, it has three aisles and (literally) no room to swing a cat on the shop floor. The company have told us that the customer limit is 22 people. I cannot express how crazy the notion of cramming 22 customers, plus five or so staff, into the shop is. [My employer] decided towards the end of the first lockdown to remove the one-way system in its stores. We appealed against that decision, and still do, but are told that ‘people weren’t following it’.” One home shopper working in Sussex said there had been an increase in people treating a trip to the supermarket as a day out or an excuse to socialise. “There are just far too many people who come in and wander around the shop because they don’t have anything else to do”, or whole families of six or more people,” she said. As a home shopper, she spends long shifts packing six bags at a time for online customers. “It may sound a bit dramatic, but we feel like we are literally putting our lives on the line, like any frontline worker, so that people can eat. If delivery and home shopping didn’t exist, people would have to go out.” A till worker in a supermarket in Scotland said mask etiquette was poor. “People get to my till, puffing away and moaning about ‘not being able to breathe’ even though they haven’t turned blue yet and are speaking clearly to me. They believe so much that they can’t breathe they pull the mask away from their mouths and down to their chin as if being at the till suddenly makes it safe to do this and Covid only goes as far as the till belt. Oh and let’s not forget the amount of old people and middle aged people who all pull their masks down, lick their fingers to give me cash because the ‘notes all stick together’.” The manager of one store in south-east England said several members of their team were suffering from anxiety and panic attacks as a result of customer behaviour. Mental health problems were being exacerbated by staff shortages, she said. “Most staff members are exhausted because colleagues are shielding/self isolating and so everyone else takes the strain because there is still a lot of work to do. On New Year’s Eve I overheard lots of customers talking about the secret party/gatherings they were having and laughing about breaking the rules. It’s really hard to hear stuff like that, especially when they are not just putting their friends lives at risk, but ours too. It makes you feel so angry, actually and I often want to say something to them.” There was a bigger sense of comradeship before, she said. “People were doing their neighbours shopping and learning how to bake and cook etc. We were the only people that customers were seeing and we got to know them better. People would send us letters of thanks and care packages etc as key workers and we felt valued. All of the goodwill towards key workers seems to have vanished now. We feel exhausted, stressed and abused most of the time. It’s really hard to switch off too. But still we go back each day and keep filling the shelves to feed the nation.” "
"The cards and stationery retailer Paperchase is on the brink of administration after pre-Christmas store closures put an “unbearable strain” on the high street, putting 1,500 jobs at risk. The company, which has 173 stores and concessions, has filed a notice to appoint administrators as it tries to put together a rescue. The legal document provides protection from creditors for 10 days. Paperchase was particularly vulnerable to the sales disruption caused by lockdowns in the run-up to Christmas as 40% of the chain’s annual sales are rung up in November and December. New restrictions mean all its UK stores are once again closed, in line with other non-essential retail outlets. A spokesman for Paperchase said the cumulative effect of multiple lockdowns, including the loss of crucial Christmas trade in November, had put “unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country”. Paperchase, he said, was not immune to the tough backdrop, despite strong online sales. “Out of lockdown we’ve traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase.” The spokesman added that the company was “working hard to find that solution” with the administration notice a “necessary part of this work”. The accountancy firm PwC has been lined up to handle the process. “This is not the situation we wanted to be in,” the Paperchase spokesman added. “Our team has been fantastic throughout this year and we cannot thank them enough for their support.” The company was founded in 1968 by art students Judith Cash and Eddie Pond, who opened a store in London’s Kensington. The company has changed hands numerous times, with high street rival WH Smith and now defunct US books giant Borders among the chain’s previous owners. In 2010 the private equity firm Primary Capital backed a £20m management buyout from Borders. Primary Capital, which had also owned Yo Sushi and Coffee Nation, tried to sell Paperchase in 2014 and considered a stock market flotation two years later. In 2019 Paperchase used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable stores and cut rents. It blamed its financial problems on a decline in customer numbers coupled with rising costs. The CVA switched some of its stores to turnover-based rents, meaning the firm is not as burdened with property costs as some retail chains.  The last set of accounts show the retailer making a loss of £11m on sales of £125m in the year to February 2019."
"Pubs, restaurants and breweries in England have given a lukewarm reception to Rishi Sunak’s offer of grants of up to £9,000 to help them survive until the spring, warning the financial “sticking plaster” will not stave off closures in the long term. On the morning after the prime minister imposed a seven-week lockdown that will force hundreds of thousands of businesses across England to close, the chancellor announced a £4.6bn package of support for the retail, hospitality and leisure industries. But with the hospitality sector on its knees, having been singled out for tough restrictions, industry figures called for a more comprehensive long-term plan, while craft breweries decried a lack of support for their previously thriving industry. “While this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills,” said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality. “It is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector.” More than half a million businesses across England will have to close due to the third lockdown, according to the real estate adviser Altus Group. Most are non-essential retailers that were previously able to trade but the number also includes 27,022 restaurants and 37,515 pubs, many of which have already been shut for extended periods, including the lucrative Christmas weeks. Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey, whose company leases premises to 1,000 publicans, said most would still be unable to cover their costs, with smaller venues particularly vulnerable. “It won’t be sufficient to stave off a lot of difficulties and closures,” he said. The grants, worth £277m across England’s pubs sector, are based on the “rateable value” of a premises, effectively the rent the site could command on the open market. Those with a rateable value above £51,000 – typically larger pubs such as big chain venues – can get the maximum £9,000 grant. Smaller venues with a rateable value of less than £15,000 – often community pubs that largely serve alcohol – are only eligible for £4,000. Jowsey said this amounted to about £1,000 a month if restrictions on opening stay in place until the end of March. Together with existing support worth £1,334 a month for smaller pubs, the combined package falls well short of the £3,000 he said smaller pubs needed just to keep their heads above water. “That’s got to cover everything, including living expenses and feeding their family,” said Jowsey. “It doesn’t leave anything for rent.” About two thirds of Admiral’s 1,000 pubs fall into the smaller venues category in terms of rateable value – less than £15,000 - and the company is charging them a maximum of £500 per month, about a third of what they would usually pay. Pub and beer trade bodies said extra support from the government provided a lifeline but would only bring short-term respite, with far more comprehensive measures needed in the long-term. British Beer and Pubs Association chief executive Emma McClarkin said: “Without this support, pubs across England were at real risk of being lost for good at the beginning of this year. “We had been anticipating permanent closures in the very short term without it.” She said their longer-term survival would required an extension of business rates relief and the cut to VAT on hospitality to 5%, which is due to expire at the end of March. She also called for a cut in beer duty. The real ale group Camra called for a long-term sector-specific support package to help pubs survive. “While one-off grant support is welcome, it is nowhere near enough to cover the haemorrhaging costs for pubs and breweries that don’t see any end in sight,” its chair, Nik Antona, said. Camra also backed the anger expressed by small breweries’ trade body Siba that pubs will not be allowed to serve takeaway beers during the lockdown. Siba’s chief executive, James Calder, said craft breweries, which have not been eligible for much of the support available to the hospitality sector, had already lost 80% of their route to market due to the closure of pubs. “Sales through takeaway, click-and-collect and drive-through have enabled many to just about survive up to now,” he said. “This reversal in policy directly discriminates against small businesses while allowing supermarkets to continue to sell beer from global breweries.”"
"The Swiss insurance firm Zurich has introduced fully paid “lockdown leave” for parents and other carers in its UK offices. The company’s UK division said it would offer two weeks’ paid leave for parents facing childcare emergencies because of the closure of primary and secondary schools across the country. Zurich estimates this will benefit more than one in five of its 4,500 UK employees who have children. The 10 days’ additional leave can be taken individually or consecutively. Employees who are struggling to juggle work and caring for elderly parents or other vulnerable family members are also entitled to take 10 days’ lockdown leave. Zurich said it was the first insurance firm in the UK to announce such a move, and could be the first company overall to do so. Steve Collinson, Zurich’s head of HR, said: “With schools closed, working parents will be frantically trying to juggle their jobs and childcare responsibilities. We already offer flexibility for employees who want to change their working hours or structure some days differently. “But for parents trying to balance work, childcare and home schooling, this may not be enough. We’re helping our employees get through this crisis by offering mums and dads paid time-off so they can look after their health and their family. This is also available for anyone with other caring commitments.” Matt Potter, who works in IT for Zurich, said he was “very impressed with the offer”. He will ask his manager for the next five Fridays off to enable him to look after his two daughters, aged seven and nine, whose school closed on Tuesday. He and his wife work full-time and have been working from home near Southampton since the first lockdown in March. “We’ve got quite an issue here with trying to be teachers and looking after the children,” he said. Schools are closed until at least mid-February in England as part of its third Covid-19 lockdown, with pupils moving to online learning. Scotland has also embarked on another lockdown this week, and schools will remain shut until 1 February, while those in Wales are closed until at least 18 January. Schools in Northern Ireland have been told to remain shut for an unspecified period. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson said schools in England would be first to reopen when the lockdown lifts – but stressed he would be “extremely cautious” about when that could happen."
"A former manager with Royal Mail has been awarded nearly £230,000 after a tribunal concluded he had been subjected to harassment and discrimination at work. Mathan Shunmugaraja, who is a Hindu, was called a “sly dog” by one colleague and was embroiled in a dispute with another over the use of a room in which he was mistaken for a Muslim. The tribunal also heard that after Shunmugaraja took time off work because of anxiety, one of his bosses threatened to stop his sick pay. Shunmugaraja, a maths graduate, was eventually dismissed. He unsuccessfully applied for dozens of other jobs but could not find work and has split his time between sofa-surfing in the UK and living in a rural part of India with his mother. The tribunal was told that Shunmugaraja described himself as being of British Indian origin, and as a Hindu. He began working for Royal Mail in Cardiff in August 2007 and by 2017 was earning £32,000 a year. The worker who in June 2017 called Shunmugaraja “a sly dog” claimed the slur did not have racial connotations but the tribunal accepted the term “dog” and the phrase “sly dog” would be perceived as an insult in many cultures and could have racial connotations. It said: “The tribunal finds it was reasonable for the claimant to be so offended, given that the term is regarded as being highly offensive in many cultures.” In his evidence, Shunmugaraja said what particularly upset him was that the comment had been made in front of his line manager but no further action was taken against the colleague. One of Shunmugaraja’s roles was to hold weekly training and planning meetings. He began using a space known as the “quiet room” that a Christian colleague used for praying. In August 2017 the colleague reacted angrily when he realised that Shunmugaraja was using it as a meeting room. He got Shunmugaraja’s religion wrong, saying he would not have used a Muslim prayer room for the meeting. The tribunal concluded this amounted to religious discrimination. Shunmugaraja described his dismissal in January 2018 as a “fall from grace”. He said he had considered his colleagues at Royal Mail as family. The tribunal said: “The claimant loved his job, was clearly performing at a very good level and had every expectation that he would continue to progress his career at Royal Mail until his retirement.” Royal Mail was ordered to pay £229,000, which includes compensation for lost and future earnings and for injury to feelings. A spokesperson said: “Royal Mail is disappointed by this decision. We are now carefully reviewing the findings. Royal Mail takes its equality and diversity obligations very seriously and is committed to a workplace free of discrimination and harassment, where our colleagues feel respected and able to thrive.”"
"It is a festive season like no other – particularly for beleaguered retailers. In a normal trading year, stores would have concentrated on selling as much full-price stock as possible in their peak pre-Christmas trade. Yet months of stop-start restrictions have taken their toll, leading many British retailers to slash prices earlier than in previous years, even before Christmas Day. Some are also offering deeper discounts, rising to as much as 70% off, in an effort to lure shoppers online or into those branches that remained open. There have been higher levels of promotional activity than usual this year, peaking around Black Friday, according to data from PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC tracked the daily promotional activity of 206 online retailers and found that 90% offered some kind of sale around Black Friday, before reining in discounts from the start of December. Overall, retailers have offered shoppers more targeted discounts than in previous years, to encourage them to spend, according to PwC, as opposed to blanket discounts that are valid for all products. “Retailers are learning to use their approach to promotions more effectively, and this year it’s important that they hold on to as much margin as possible,” said Lisa Hooker, the consumer markets lead at PwC. Lockdowns and the temporary closure of non-essential stores in all home nations of the UK may be responsible for some discounting, according to Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics. “Lots of retailers had all of their stock and inventory in a number of stores which were closed, they missed out on these precious, vital weeks running up to Christmas,” Lim said. “At such short notice, many of them couldn’t suddenly start shipping out online orders from stores. A lot of retailers were heading into the December period with a lot more stock than they would usually have at this time of year.” The pandemic has created winners and losers within the retail industry, and led to diverging approaches to pre-Christmas discounting. Furniture retailers have struggled to keep up with demand for homeware, allowing them to be more sparing with their reductions. The UK market leader, DFS Furniture, which trades from stores branded DFS, Sofa Workshop, Dwell and Sofology, told investors in mid-December that soaring sales had led to longer lead times for its made-to-order sofas. It has been a different story for fashion retailers, however, who have faced a toxic cocktail of challenges during 2020 – the widespread cancellation of events and special occasions, the months-long closure of stores, and the continued closure of changing rooms. With nowhere to go, shoppers never bothered to get dressed up. They spurned suits and stilettos in favour of slippers and sweatpants. As a result, clothing stores have been the clear outlier in the run-up to Christmas, offering promotions on all items to try to clear their stock. Some of the biggest reductions are available at shops that are in administration – including the collapsed department store Debenhams and the Arcadia brands such as Topshop – as the firms’ administrators look to swiftly raise cash. The Debenhams website promises shoppers reductions of up to 70% on women’s clothing in its “closing down sale”, while discounts of 60% are highlighted at Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. Such swingeing discounting creates problems for competitors who might have hoped to hold off reductions until after Christmas. John Lewis, which still has its “never knowingly unsold” promise to match prices at its direct competitors, has been obliged to follow some of Debenhams’s discounts. House of Fraser, owned by Mike Ashley, tried to tempt shoppers with 20% off all full-price items to encourage a final spend before Christmas Day, while the fast fashion retailer Zara launched its Christmas sale earlier than retail analysts anticipated. This Christmas may turn out to be a “last gasp” for large-scale retail purchases, according to Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of the retail marketing agency Savvy. “This year is the year of things,” she said. “If everything has returned to normal next year thanks to a vaccine, next Christmas will be more about experiences and spending time with people.” Retail analysts also caution that consumers should not necessarily expect this most unusual year to set a trend for future pre-Christmas reductions. With difficult trading conditions set to continue along with a squeeze on consumer spending, some of the retailers desperately slashing prices may not be around to see next Christmas."
"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain & Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure.  Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain & Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales. The 1,300 employees in Brains pubs will transfer to Marston’s, which employs a further 14,000 people across the UK. Ralph Findlay, the Marston’s chief executive, said the deal would be mutually beneficial and that it “strengthens our representation in south and west Wales, while protecting the heritage and independence of an iconic Welsh business”."
"“If you have wealth, you have to share it,” was the watchword of the former president of the World Bank James Wolfensohn, a larger than life, egotistical, supremely confident, inveterate networker, but fundamentally a good and witty man. Wolfensohn, who has died aged 86, made a great deal of money and gave a great deal away. The zenith of his career was his two-term presidency of the World Bank, between 1995 and 2005, where his zest and passion for poverty alleviation left an indelible mark. Unafraid to confront the reality that too much of the World Bank’s lending found itself in anonymous offshore bank accounts held by recipients, he set up an anti-corruption task force, unthinkable before he arrived for fear of legitimising the bank’s critics while potentially smearing some innocent borrowers. Yet he pressed ahead, while simultaneously reconfiguring the bank’s lending programme to recognise another reality: too many less developed countries were just too poor ever to repay what they had been lent – and their loans had to be forgiven. Prefiguring today’s concerns, he broadened the bank’s lending programmes away from the sole support of the hard infrastructure of dams, power generation and ports, towards the social infrastructure of education, particularly of women. To cement the new emphasis he launched the Comprehensive Development Framework to provide recipient countries with rounded metrics to assess their economic and social progress. This apporach took account of educational and health standards as much as per capita income growth. His presidency of the bank was a key moment. Education, public health and the enfranchisement of women were and are as essential to economic development as power, railways and roads. Wolfensohn was always on the move – when in Washington “walking the floor” of the bank’s offices teasing and joking, or just as likely on a plane, his beloved cello often on the seat beside him, touring World Bank clients – he visited 120 countries in all – where he would unfailingly call a spade a spade, however embarrassing the remark. “What’s the difference between God and James Wolfensohn?” ran a joke in Washington. “God is everywhere – so is Wolfensohn, but never here!” He said his passion to contest inequality, to alleviate poverty and give money away as a philanthropist had its roots in his modest upbringing in a two-bedroom flat in a Sydney suburb – which may also have given him his lifelong driving ambition. His parents, Hyman Wolfensohn and Dora Weinbaum, had emigrated to Australia in 1928 after his father’s career in banking at Rothschild fizzled out, never to take off again, although he retained an affection for the Rothschilds. James was clever and hyper-ambitious: at school he would sing the young women’s roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas to get himself noticed and as a natural sportsman represented Australia in the 1956 Olympics as a valued member of the fencing team. He would say that witnessing his Jewish parents, despite their relative poverty, taking in refugees from Nazi Germany fired him up with lifelong sympathy for the dispossessed – and being an Olympian gave him the inner confidence to match his ambition. He really was good enough to climb the heights. After Sydney University he talked himself into Harvard Business School, recognising that a Harvard MBA would be a passport into the City of London that a law degree from Sydney alone would not deliver. So it proved. After a couple of false starts he landed a job at the boutique and fast growing merchant bank Darling and Co. Harvard was also where he met Elaine Botwinick. They married in 1961 and went on to have three children. Darling and Co proved to be a springboard into Schroders, where his affability and cold eye for what was and what not a good deal won him a growing client list. In 1970 he was earmarked for higher things if he could capitalise on the chance to expand Schroders’ operations in New York, where he succeeded spectacularly – courtesy of a contact book, and love of entertaining, already becoming something of a legend. But Schroders in 1976 was unprepared to offer the managing director of its New York operations the top job in the bank, preferring the British aristocrat Lord Airlie to Wolfensohn. Reading the runes, he left to join Salomon Brothers, rising to the top, confirmation of his meteoric impact on Wall Street investment banking. It was the rescheduling of Chrysler’s debts in 1979, saving the car company from bankruptcy, in particular persuading Japanese banks to continue lending, that caught the attention of the titans of Wall Street and the Democratic party establishment. This was a man who could marry high finance, good values and high politics – and put the alchemy to constructive purpose. He was tipped to become president of the World Bank – but the Republicans won the presidency, and even though he took American nationality to secure his chances (only Americans are nominated to the World Bank presidency), the opportunity was lost. Once again he reinvented himself, but as the founder of his own investment firm, Wolfensohn Inc. In the 14 years that followed he was to amass his fortune, and doubled up as a major New York and Washington philanthropist. He chaired Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts in Washington. In a typical combination of self-aggrandisement, genuine affection for music and generosity to Jacqueline de Pré, coping with multiple sclerosis, who wanted renewed purpose in her life, he took lessons from her on the cello. They were given on the condition he performed publicly, which he did on his 50th, 60th and 70th birthdays. Bill Clinton’s presidency – inevitably they were friends – was to give him the chance he craved at the World Bank, and in 1995 he assumed the presidency. Garlanded in honours by Britain, the US, Germany and his native Australia, he lived out a happy semi-retirement from 2005 that combined philanthropy and consultancy – giving up the role of peace envoy in the Middle East after 11 months because, he said, there was nothing he could usefully do. Elaine died in August. He is survived by a son and two daughters.   James David Wolfensohn, banker, born 1 December 1933; died 25 November 2020"
" Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year. Furniture retailers reported a 5.3% rise, as consumers invested in big ticket items. Britons treated themselves – as well as friends and family they could not see – to flowers throughout the year, with spending at florists rising 22.7%. Crafts and hobby spending increased 9.8%, and pets were given extra attention with vet and pet retail increasing 10.7%. But the report also shows how much restaurants suffered despite Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” initiative over the summer. Restrictions throughout the rest of the year contributed to a 47% drop in restaurant spending, while bars and pubs took a 36.7% hit. However, Covid restrictions contributed to a 49.1% rise in spending on online takeaway orders, while meal subscription services jumped 62.4%. Demand for at-home entertainment pushed spending on digital subscriptions up 31.5%, while money spent on electronics including game consoles rose 10.8%. Meanwhile, general online retailers benefited from a 52.5% hike in spending. Raheel Ahmed, Barclaycard’s head of consumer products, said: “2020 has accelerated many trends. E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally, and experiences within the home, such as virtual workouts, have become the norm.” Travel spending, including on airlines and travel agents, tumbled 61.1% in August and 63.1% in September, as coronavirus restrictions and quarantine rules took their toll. “Hopefully with a vaccine being rolled out in 2021 we will see green shoots for the most severely impacted sectors,” Ahmed said. “Having said that, some of the trends and changes we have seen in customer habits may be here to stay.”"
"The UK’s high streets were largely deserted on Boxing Day, with shopper numbers down more than 60% on last year as people remained at home amid tighter coronavirus restrictions. Data from the retail consultancy Springboard showed footfall on high streets, in retail parks and shopping centres on Boxing Day collapsed by nearly 76% in areas with tier 4 restrictions, where all non-essential shops selling things such as clothes, toys, furniture and electrical items were shut. Even in tiers 2 and 3, where all shops were allowed to open, footfall was down by 33.1% and 38.5% respectively, as many people opted to stay home. The UK’s high streets posted a 63.3% fall in shopping numbers compared with Boxing Day 2019; shopping centres were down 65.4%, and retail parks recorded a 45% decline. Marks & Spencer and John Lewis decided to remain closed on Boxing Day this year. The tougher coronavirus restrictions have compounded what has been a disastrous year for shops. Even the larger retailers are struggling; for example, the department-store chain Debenhams and the Arcadia Group, which owns brands such as Topshop, Burton, Evans and Dorothy Perkins, have called in administrators. Large parts of England, comprising 43% of the population, are under strict tier 4 restrictions, while Scotland and Northern Ireland imposed fresh lockdowns on Boxing Day and Wales reintroduced restrictions that had been eased for Christmas Day. Regional cities suffered a 72.2% fall in shopper numbers, while central London posted an 84.1% drop on Boxing Day, Springboard found. This compares with declines of 40.2% in coastal towns and 52.2% in market towns, showing people prefer to shop local. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: “Boxing Day has been attracting less retail footfall each year in five of the past seven years, as shoppers turn online to grab the best bargains. “Interestingly, Boxing Day has been evolving into more of a leisure-based day, with shoppers starting their trips later on in the day, and combining shopping trips with eating out and catching up with family and friends. The closure of hospitality in tier 3 and above means shoppers have remained at home and footfall has declined significantly.”"
"For Jim Portus, who has represented Devon and Cornish fishing interests for 33 years, the Brexit trade deal offered a sobering lesson in broken promises. Having volunteered to delay his retirement as chief executive of the South West Fish Producers Organisation to see the Brexit deal through, Portus questioned the wisdom of his decision on Saturday. “I thought we were going to get a wonderful victory, but many of the promises that were made have not been delivered,” said the 66-year-old. Not only had the sector secured the opportunity to fish far less than they had expected, Downing Street’s claims of safeguarding the sovereignty of the fishing industry – regaining control over UK waters was a central message of the leave campaign in 2016 – appeared wide of the mark. “The deal means we’re still tied to the apron strings of the EU, we’re not an independent coastal state,” said Portus, whose organisation represents almost a third of the 300 or so large trawlers operating out of ports such as Newlyn in south-west Cornwall and Brixham, south Devon. “We should have been deciding the rules and regulations on how to manage those stocks so that we took control of access arrangements for other countries.” Fishing rights were one of the final sticking points in the post-Brexit trade talks, largely due to their political weight, but Portus feels that ultimately Boris Johnson caved in. On Saturday, Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation, accused the prime minister of having “bottled it” on fishing quotas. Portus added: “I’m at the end of my working life but he [Johnson] made promises directly to fishermen and I am very disappointed for them. We should be rebuilding our fleet, encouraging our youngsters. We should be planning for a resurgence instead of being sold down the river again.” Before joining the SWFPO, Portus worked as a fisheries inspector and saw first hand what he felt were the negative impacts of the common fisheries policy, signed in 1970 and which dictated every EU fishing fleet had equal access to European waters. “I’ve witnessed the despondency of the fishing industry for so long. We thought that after the referendum, when we were out of the common fisheries policy, [we would be] free from the influence from Brussels but we are harnessed to their regulations. “Really annoyingly embodied in the deal is a reference to penalties and compensation which must be paid to foreign fishermen if we decide to deny them access to our 12-mile limit in five years’ time. It is disgraceful that he [Johnson] has allowed himself to be dictated to by Brussels.” Elsewhere, UK Fisheries chief executive Jane Sandell said Johnson’s promise that the deal would allow the UK to “catch and eat quite prodigious quantities of extra fish” appeared hollow. “We’re still looking for the ‘prodigious amounts of fish’ we were promised and for us it changes nothing,” she said. A senior member of the UK’s negotiating team defended the agreement, and described fish as “one of the areas where we had to compromise somewhat”, but said this had been done by “both sides”. The official said: “Although there is a transition, at the end of the transition it returns to normal arrangements, and we have full control over our waters.There’s a transition to that point and ideally we would’ve got out of it a bit faster, but where we’ve got to is acceptable and offers gains for the fisheries industry in the short run and a huge right to control everything and work within that after this five-and-a-half-year transition.”"
"The Hut Group, the online retail company run by the billionaire Matthew Moulding, has spent more than £300m on acquisitions as it continues aggressive expansion plans after listing on the stock market. It is buying Dermstore.com, an online skincare retailer, from the US retail chain Target for $350m (£259m). It is also spending almost £60m on the purchase of two UK-based nutrition suppliers, Claremont Ingredients and David Berryman. The Hut Group (THG) floated its shares on the London Stock Exchange in September in the biggest initial public offering in the UK since 2013. The company was valued at £6.8bn on Christmas Eve, a valuation that would make it part of the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s largest listed companies but for THG’s heavily criticised governance arrangements, which give Moulding tight control of the company. Moulding serves as both chairman and chief executive, while retaining a US-style “founder’s share” which prevents other investors from taking over the company for at least three years. Moulding, who has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party, has also this year received one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history. He is already entitled to shares worth £830m after THG’s share price hit targets set at the initial public offering, but if the company’s value reaches £7.25bn before 31 December 2022 the award could break the £1bn mark. Moulding and the finance boss, John Gallemore, both former Phones4U executives, founded THG in 2004, using a tax loophole to dodge VAT on sales of cheap CDs and DVDs. It then moved into niche retail areas, and used its IT and logistics abilities to expand rapidly. THG plans to expand its existing online retail brands, such as the makeup site Lookfantastic and protein shake brand MyProtein, as well as selling its online retail technology to other companies that want to sell directly to customers. Moulding said: “A key driver behind the decision to list THG on the London Stock Exchange just over three months ago was to enable the group to make major global investments, such as Dermstore.com. “Accessing capital through a London listing has enabled us to accelerate our growth plans and build out a global leadership position within the exciting beauty industry.”"
"The fast fashion brand Boohoo is selling clothes made by Pakistani factory workers who say they face appalling conditions and earn as little as 29p an hour, an investigation by the Guardian has found. In interviews in the industrial city of Faisalabad, workers at two factories claimed they were paid 10,000PKR (£47) a month, well below the legal monthly minimum wage for unskilled labour of 17,500PKR, while making clothes to be sold by Boohoo. Documentary, video and photographic evidence also appears to support claims of potential safety issues, including motorbikes being parked indoors next to flammable materials. In the rush to produce clothes for the western market, insiders claimed workers would sometimes do 24-hour shifts. One of more than a dozen workers interviewed said: “I know we are exploited and paid less than the legal minimum, but we can’t do anything … if I leave the job another person will be ready to replace me.” After the Guardian approached Boohoo about the findings, the company suspended a supplier, JD Fashion Ltd, and a factory, AH Fashion, from its supply chain while it investigated the claims. Another factory, Madina Gloves, denied workers’ claims that it had recently been making clothes for Boohoo. AH Fashion, which is closed for construction work, acknowledged it had fulfilled an order for the brand as recently as October. Boohoo said a third-party audit at AH Fasion on 2 November had found the factory working with no problems. It later said its own auditors had paid a separate visit in response to the allegations and said the factory was a “building site”. The auditors said they were told by the owner it had been closed throughout November for significant construction – a claim disputed by workers who said they were there more recently. The Guardian was able to buy a £30 tracksuit on Boohoo’s website this month that appeared to match fabrics and identifying labels seen in video footage filmed at AH Fashion. A week after Boohoo was alerted to allegations that the item was made by workers paid less than the minimum wage, it remained on sale. The news comes months after Boohoo, one of Britain’s best-known fast fashion brands, faced the damaging fallout from the discovery of poor conditions in factories in Leicester. Since then its share price has started to recover, and in September investors saw a 51% year-on-year surge in profits. While the firm’s code of conduct for suppliers sets out a list of minimum standards that must be met by manufacturers of its clothes anywhere in the world, workers in two factories based in the Samanabad area of Faisalabad allege that: Video footage seen by the Guardian appeared to show: The factories, which each employ more than 100 people, denied any wrongdoing and said workers were paid in accordance with local laws. Madina Gloves said claims of low pay and mistreatment of workers were “totally wrong”, while AH Fashion said workers were always paid and treated fairly. JD Fashion, a Preston-based intermediary that has supplied Boohoo with items produced at AH Fashion, said its last order there was in October and there was no Boohoo order currently in place, while AH and Madina denied they were currently supplying Boohoo. JD Fashion has no connection to the retailer JD Sports. Boohoo said it “will not tolerate any instance of mistreatment or underpayment of garment workers”. It said it was unaware of its clothes being made at Madina Gloves, and that AH Fashion was not on its approved supplier list for JD for an order delivered to the UK on 11 December. The £30 colour-block tracksuit bought by the Guardian from that consignment matched a design visible in one of the videos recorded at AH Fashion – and featured a distinctive “JD” label similar to one seen being sewn into an item in another clip. Other videos and pictures taken at the two factories also appear to corroborate workers’ claims that they have been making clothes for Boohoo recently, with the brand’s labels and logos visible. Auditing professionals, who asked to remain anonymous because of their position in the industry, watched the videos showing piled-up fabrics, motorbikes indoors and poles on bricks at AH Fashion, and said they considered the footage raised questions over fire risks and general safety. One auditor who viewed the videos said they presented potential issues but not conclusive evidence of the level of risk. Another called them a possible “recipe for disaster”, and added: “If I [was asked] to do an audit, I would refuse and ask [the] brand to pull goods out of the factory immediately … I would run out of the factory if I saw this.” AH said construction work and a lack of space were responsible. In July, Boohoo’s stock market value fell by £1.5bn in two days over allegations that its Leicester suppliers forced workers to continue in cramped conditions during the first Covid lockdown and paid below minimum wage. The company accepted the recommendations of a report from Allison Levitt QC, which described its attitude to the plight of workers in the city as “inexcusable”.  Speaking to MPs last week, its billionaire co-founder Mahmud Kamani acknowledged that Boohoo’s model of continuous expansion came with risks, saying: “In a business like ours that’s fast-growing globally, there will be things that are breaking, and all the time we are fixing them and making them better.” He also warned he could take more business overseas, saying: “For us to move out of Leicester, it’s very easy for us to take all our production offshore.” Boohoo pointed to what it said was “immediate action” to remedy the issues found in Leicester and suggested it would take a similar approach in Faisalabad. “As part of our international compliance programme, AH Fashion received a SMETA [Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit] audit in November 2020, where no issues of this nature were found, so these allegations are extremely concerning,” it said. “Independent compliance and auditing specialists Bureau Veritas are on the ground in Faisalabad and we have instructed them to immediately investigate these claims … Any supplier who does not treat their workers with the respect they deserve has no place in the Boohoo supply chain.”"
"The Gym Group, one of Britain’s largest operators of low-cost gyms, has opened talks with lenders after reporting that revenues almost halved last year and member numbers plunged by more than 200,000 due to the pandemic. The company, which runs 184 gyms across the UK, said revenues fell by 48% year on year from £153m to £80.5m as pandemic restrictions across the UK cost it 45% of trading days last year. The company, which on Friday announced that former footballer and TV pundit Rio Ferdinand was to join its board as a non-executive director, has opened talks with its lenders as the latest national lockdown stretches its finances. The company said that while its has “significant liquidity” with its £100m banking facility, it needed to extend the financial covenants. Net debt stood at £47m at the end of last year. “Given the ongoing impact from the latest lockdown and its implications for the operational reopening of our gyms, we have started discussions with our lending banks, who continue to be supportive, to review the future covenant tests relating to this facility,” the company said. The Gym Group said that as of the end of 2020 membership numbers had fallen by more than a quarter year on year, from 794,000 to 578,000. The company, which froze gym subscriptions during the national lockdown so members don’t pay while sites are closed, added that it had no students members remaining from its 2019 sign ups. The average monthly headline price for a membership was £18.81 in December. “2020 has been a challenging year for our business, our members and our colleagues,” said Richard Darwin, the chief executive. “Our cash management during the pandemic has ensured we ended 2020 with manageable levels of debt and significant liquidity. At a time when health and fitness has never been more important to the nation, we are ready to emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of the many opportunities available to us.” The company said the monthly cash burn during the current lockdown was running at £5m, lower than the £6m during the November lockdown due to the recent government grant support. Despite the pandemic the company recently opened its 184th site, and a total eight new venues last year and is progressing on three more. The group said the pandemic had also provided opportunities to snap up locations with cheap rentals as the pressure mounted on high street landlords. “The company continues to see an opportunity to access excellent new sites at attractive rents,” it said. “We are building a strong pipeline for 2021 and beyond, and we will continue to progress new leases during this current period of lockdown. We will determine the timing of the rollout programme once there is greater visibility about a reopening date for gyms.”"
"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November, as a second national lockdown in England and tough restrictions across the rest of the UK hit growth. The Guardian has spoken to three company bosses about the pressure they and their employees are facing as the second wave of the pandemic threatens to tip the British economy into a double-dip recession. Business planning has become almost impossible for Ian Grundy, the founder of Urban Village Pubs, as the November lockdown and rapid changes to the government’s coronavirus restrictions have cost his business more than £1.5m in the past year alone. “As we got to autumn and the tier system raised its head, effectively life became quite difficult. Not least because the rules changed every week as the government spun the bottle and decided what restrictions came out that week. It’s just become impossible to plan,” said Grundy. The second English lockdown meant his latest venture, the Rookwood Village in Leytonstone, east London, opened for 72 days only in 2020, after his firm bought the derelict Victorian pub and invested thousands of pounds to reopen it in July for the first time since 2013. This was at least a little better than the first lockdown, just after Grundy bought it, when builders had just four hours on-site before it was boarded up again. With eight pubs dotted across London’s suburbs and the south of England, Urban Village started operating takeaways to help maintain its presence. The money has helped, but does not cover fixed costs, despite support from the furlough jobs scheme and government-backed loans. Grundy feels hospitality is being unfairly targeted by lockdowns and needs urgent state support to prevent pubs closing for good this year. “Rishi [Sunak] is saying: ‘Oh well I’ll make another announcement at budget in March,’ but you can’t run a business like that. We have no idea what we’re looking at and have possibly no income for the next three to five months. What we need now is the government to step up and enable us to plan for what happens.” The November lockdown was tough for the Regent hotel in Doncaster after a year when 38 weddings had to be moved or refunded and crowds were banned from the final days of the town’s St Leger horse racing festival. “No one is travelling, there are no salesmen on the road, and no one to visit, so everyone’s more or less on lockdown,” said the hotel’s owner, Simon Longworth. But unlike the spring of last year, when activity stopped entirely amid a rash of cancellations, the family firm started selling takeaway meals from its a la carte restaurant to help it survive. “We said we’re not going to let this beat us, we need to be on the front foot.” With fewer travellers during the pandemic, Longworth, whose family has run the business since 1935, has now converted 20 rooms into rental apartments to maintain a steadier flow of income. But although selling takeaways has helped, it barely makes up for the loss of the hotel’s usual trade in the run-up to Christmas. Far from the 200 usual restaurant covers on Christmas Day, the hotel sold 78 meals at a third of the price, delivered to homes across Doncaster. “Obviously we were looking forward to Christmas. And come the second lockdown, certainly in Doncaster we were hoping we’d get some kind of reprieve to allow us to open in December to keep us going. If we could’ve had a week or so of that, that would’ve been great. But it was not to be,” said Longworth. “It’s a balancing act of how many more lockdowns can we go through and walking away from a business that’s been in the family for 85 years?” Crow Wood health spa on the outskirts of Burnley has been losing £250,000 for every month it is forced to close by the government. With tough restrictions in place for longer in east Lancashire than most other places in the UK, the November lockdown only added to the challenge of staying afloat for Andy Brown, whose family has run the business for 20 years. “We were under tier 3 and London was in tier 1, everyone all carrying on going to the pub and restaurants, we were locked down. It’s been horrendous. The whole levelling up agenda is, I’m afraid, just not there at all,” he said. “We’ve lost about £7m in revenue. But it could be more – we’re not through it are we? We’ve still no indication of when we can open for business, when we might be able to open a bit, or at all.” With almost 300 employees, and not operating takeaways from its three restaurants, the only revenue source is football, when top-flight football teams stay at Crow Wood’s 78-bedroom hotel when they have fixtures against Premier League Burnley or Championship Blackburn or Preston. “Otherwise we’re dead; we’re shut,” said Brown. Brown, who has questioned Sunak on calls arranged for local business leaders by the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government needed to be clearer with its lockdown plans and provide more help for companies. “I’m not sure we can prepare for reopening yet to be honest, as we’ve been in this situation so many times over the last 10 months. You can’t trust anything Boris [Johnson] says.”"
"When the UK first went into lockdown last spring the impact on the economy was swift and profound. National output dropped by almost a fifth in April. There was an echo of that decline in activity in the November figures for gross domestic product released by the Office for National Statistics but a relatively faint one. The 2.6% monthly contraction was bad – especially for consumer-facing businesses – but not nearly as bad as it might have been. Britain’s economy was 8.9% smaller in November than in the same month of 2019, but analysts were braced for an annual decline of more than 12%. Why was the drop smaller than expected? For a start, more of the economy remained open in November than it did during the first lockdown. Factories kept turning out goods, construction work was allowed, children continued to go to school. In addition, a couple of one-off factors supported activity. One was that the knife-edge state of trade negotiations between the UK and the EU encouraged firms to stockpile as insurance against a no-deal outcome. A second was that there was a delay between England’s lockdown being announced and the restrictions coming into force, which allowed people to do some early Christmas shopping or have a meal out. But as Paul Dales, the UK economist at Capital Economics has noted, the UK has built up some immunity to lockdowns. Firms have found ways of doing business despite the restrictions, such as providing click-and-collect services. Consumers don’t stop spending when the shops are shut: they simply shop online. The current lockdown will cause more damage to the economy than that in November because the restrictions are tougher and will be in place for longer. As Rishi Sunak noted, the news will get worse before it gets better, but the vaccination programme means the likelihood is that restrictions will be gradually eased from next month onwards. The expectation in the financial markets is that a solid recovery will be under way by the spring. In the meantime, there is the question of whether the UK will have a double-dip recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output. GDP will almost certainly contract in the current quarter, but the better than feared figures for November suggest growth might just have remained positive in the fourth quarter of 2020. According to Dales, GDP would need to fall by 1% in December for the economy to shrink in the fourth quarter as a whole. It is touch and go, but a double dip might just be avoided."
"Eurostar has said it is facing an existential threat, as business leaders pleaded with the government to step in and save the “vital link” with Europe. A 95% drop in passenger numbers has brought the cross-Channel train service to its knees, and the company reiterated on Sunday that while government loans had been extended to aviation, international high-speed rail had also been severely affected by the pandemic. “Without additional funding from government, there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar … the current situation is very serious,” it said in a statement. Business leaders, including Brian Bickell, chief executive of the London landlord Shaftesbury, have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urging them to save the service. Their letter repeated the warning that Eurostar could run out of funds to operate the service in and out of London St Pancras. The 28 executives said that, with the number of international tourists likely to remain low until at least the spring, the loss of the route would be a blow to the capital’s economy and the UK as a whole. Nearly four in every five passengers use the train to travel between London and Paris or Brussels. Eurostar was “not asking for special treatment” they said, but access to the same help as companies in similar positions had received, such as business rates relief and loans. “Safeguarding the future of this connection to the continent should be a symbol of both our desire to build back better and our new cooperative relationship with our European neighbours,” the letter continued, adding: “If this viable business is allowed to fall between the cracks of support – our recovery could be damaged.” Eurostar is majority-owned by the French state railway, SNCF, but is thought to have exhausted options for governmental assistance from Paris. The franchised UK train operators that have been bailed out under emergency agreements since the coronavirus pandemic began – at a cost of £8bn this financial year – are also largely owned or co-owned by foreign state rail operators. In 2019, Eurostar carried 11 million passengers and was preparing to expand services with the introduction of direct trains to Amsterdam. It employs 1,200 people in the UK, with a further 1,500 jobs supported by its supply chain."
"January is a month when Britons turn to salads after the Christmas blowout. But now, on top of the disruption caused by Brexit and Covid, even the weather is conspiring against dieters by causing shortages in UK supermarkets. The supply of salad staples such as lettuce and tomatoes has been hit by Storm Filomena, the worst snowstorm to hit Spain in 50 years. It blanketed Madrid and the surrounding area and sent temperatures plummeting to record lows in Almería and Granada, two important vegetable growing regions. The bad weather has piled extra pressure on UK food retailers and suppliers at a time when they are navigating complex new post-Brexit border controls as well as coronavirus restrictions. Tesco has reported some Brexit-related “teething problems” at the main Channel crossing, through which a tenth of the food consumed in the UK is transported. However, a shortage of some salad lines in its stores is down to the recent bad weather in Spain. In January, with British produce out of season, 90% of the lettuce we eat is imported. That figure is even higher – 95% – for tomatoes and soft fruit, with Spain the primary European producer. Four years ago, the UK was gripped by a “courgette crisis” after Spanish farmers in Murcia and Valencia were badly affected by flooding, frost and snow. The disruption, which also affected tomato, lettuce and aubergine crops, resulted in soaring prices. “When it’s cold the crop effectively stops growing, so you are seeing smaller crops across Spain,” one major supermarket supplier told the Guardian. “It is a difficult time of year anyway, and then you have got to layer on Covid and Brexit.” The situation is exacerbated by the closure of restaurants and cafes, which means a record amount of food is being funnelled through supermarkets. “Demand is up again for supermarket fresh produce because food service, which has a different supply chain, is closed,” the supplier said. “So we are trying to meet increased demand against a backdrop of supply chain challenges.” Fepex, Spain’s fresh produce export association, said the cold weather would reduce crop yields in Almería and Granada, meaning lower volumes of tomatoes, cucumbers, courgettes, eggplant and peppers. January is one of the important months of the year, when Spanish farmers export between 1.2m and 1.3m tonnes of fruit and vegetables. The intense cold could have caused irreparable damage, Fepex said in update on its website. “In the field, farmers do not have enough kilos to collect, and not enough product enters the warehouses to supply all orders.” A fall in production usually pushes up prices but there may not be enough supply to satisfy even existing commercial agreements. However, growers in other Spanish regions have fared better, said Luke King, the commercial director at organic vegetable box company Riverford, which sources from farmers in Murcia and Andalusia.  “Don’t get me wrong, the weather has been horrible, it’s been cold, it’s been wet … which is not good growing conditions and logistics can get compromised but we’ve not had any issues.”"
"Rishi Sunak is coming under renewed pressure to provide more financial support to businesses across the UK, as official figures confirmed the UK is heading for a double-dip recession. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the chancellor needed to launch a new package of cash grants, and extend and expand a range of tax cuts to help businesses struggling to stay afloat while tougher coronavirus restrictions were in place. Calling for immediate action, the business lobby group said firms could not afford to wait until the budget on 3 March, which Sunak has indicated will be the next date when he refreshes the government’s pandemic response. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday showed the UK economy contracted again in November, when Boris Johnson staged a last-minute decision to impose a second English lockdown to contain rapid growth in Covid infections. The economy shrank by 2.6% in November compared with October, ending six successive months of growth in the summer as rising infections and tougher restrictions across the UK pushed the economy into a double-dip recession. Economists had forecast a bigger fall in GDP of 5.7% in November. GDP fell by 19% in the second quarter during the first national lockdown – the biggest decline in history. The impact this time is expected to be felt most by the embattled hospitality sector. Pubs, restaurants and cafes were forced to close or operate as takeaway-only during the second lockdown in England, while more non-essential shops remained open than during the first, and manufacturing and construction activity continued. Britain’s biggest pub and restaurant groups recorded a 72.6% drop in sales over the pivotal Christmas period, according to figures published on Friday by the Coffer Peach business tracker, in what should have been the sector’s most profitable time of year. Trading figures for the five weeks to 3 January showed drink-led pubs and bars were worst hit, with total sales down by more than 80% on the same period a year ago. London, which had been largely open at the beginning of December, fared slightly better than the rest of the country as tougher restrictions were in place in the north of England under the tiering system. However, sales in the capital were still down 66.8% on a year ago, compared with a 73.9% decline outside the M25. Paul Newman, the head of leisure and hospitality at the accountancy firm RSM, which produces the tracker alongside the data provider CGA and Coffer Group, a leisure industry specialist, urged the chancellor to step in quickly. “Urgent clarity on substantial, additional government support is needed now as the 3 March budget may simply be too late. The chancellor’s latest grant package does not go far enough, barely touching the fixed monthly site costs that businesses face,” Newman said. Tighter since Christmas restrictions are expected to trigger an even bigger drop in economic output in January, as stay-at-home orders and school closures further weight on growth. The interventions come after Sunak announced £4.6bn in new grants for firms in the hardest-hit sectors of the economy last week. The furlough scheme – which has been used to subsidise the wages of more than 9m jobs at more than 1m companies since its launch, at a cost of more than £46bn so far – has also been extended until the end of April. However, business leaders said companies needed a further year of business rates relief and an extension of the 5% reduced VAT rate for hospitality firms owing to the cumulative hit from multiple lockdowns. Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said government support schemes had saved many firms and jobs, but they had not gone far enough to help many survive a tough start to 2021. “The drip-feed approach to business support measures has meant many firms simply cannot plan for the future,” he said. “We are urging the government to urgently adopt a package of measures that covers the whole of 2021, and that takes away the cliff-edges firms face in a few weeks’ time when reliefs, forbearance and furlough are set to end. Many companies simply can’t wait until the March budget. Action is needed now.” A Treasury spokesperson said more than £280bn had been spent by government to support jobs and businesses during the pandemic, adding: “As the chancellor set out this week, the budget is the most appropriate interval to consider what further interventions may be necessary, given these schemes now extend through to the spring.”"
"Norwegian has announced it will no longer fly long-haul routes, even after the pandemic, bringing an end to its low-cost, long-haul vision and spelling the loss of about 1,100 jobs based at Gatwick airport. The airline said it would retrench to a short-haul European network and domestic Norwegian routes for good, as it outlined its business plan for survival. About 2,150 jobs in the UK, Spain, France and the US will go, and one union warned that the airline industry was in an employment “death spiral”.  The airline’s 1,100 UK flight crew and pilots had been furloughed since the start of the Covid-19 crisis. About 400 other UK crew who worked on short-haul routes were made redundant last year. The airline is going through bankruptcy protection proceedings in Ireland that will allow it to restructure and continue operations by demonstrating a viable business plan to judges there. Norwegian will no longer retain any of its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners that it used to fly long-haul, and will reduce its overall fleet to 50 narrow-body planes. It was once the third-biggest airline at Gatwick and pioneered low-cost transatlantic flights, but its ambitious expansion put it in financial peril even before Covid-19 hit. The airline’s plan focuses on saving Norwegian jobs and it is understood to be in renewed dialogue with Norway’s government about potential state support, two months after ministers said they could not invest more taxpayers’ money in propping up the airline. Jacob Schram, the airline’s chief executive, said: “Our short-haul network has always been the backbone of Norwegian and will form the basis of a future resilient business model. By focusing our operation on a short-haul network, we aim to attract existing and new investors, serve our customers and support the wider infrastructure and travel industry in Norway and across the Nordics and Europe.” The pilots’ union Balpa said Norwegian’s announcement was further devastating news for UK airline staff, with about 300 pilots among the 1,100 Gatwick job losses. Brian Strutton, Balpa’s general secretary, said: “The airline has failed for several reasons but there can be no blame apportioned to the pilot, crew or other staff groups.” He said it was further evidence of the “jobs death spiral”, adding that “aviation remains in serious crisis”. The Unite union, which represents crew, said airline workers had not been consulted about the job losses and were owed outstanding wages and redundancy pay, and should be the first priority during the insolvency process of Norwegian’s UK arm. Under Norwegian’s complex company structure, only its subsidiaries employing the crew have gone into liquidation, allowing its Gatwick-based airline, Norwegian UK, to survive on paper and one day potentially return to the air. However, it is extremely unlikely to spread its wings quite so far again. Schram said: “Our focus is to rebuild a strong, profitable Norwegian so that we can safeguard as many jobs as possible. We do not expect customer demand in the long-haul sector to recover in the near future.”"
"Tesco has hailed a “record” Christmas on the back of booming online sales and customers treating themselves to its luxury Christmas food ranges. The UK’s biggest supermarket said sales at stores open one year were up 8.1% over the key six-week Christmas trading period. That was a step up from growth of 6.7% over the three months to 28 November. Ken Murphy, the Tesco chief executive, described the performance over the six weeks to 9 January as “market-leading”, adding: “We delivered a record Christmas across all of our formats and channels.” The “unprecedented demand for online groceries” meant the company delivered more than 7m orders containing 400m-plus items over Christmas. Murphy also revealed there were some gaps on in its shelves in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as the supermarket chain grappled with new post-Brexit border controls. The problem was focused on products, such as ready meals and processed meats, which have a short shelf life, as well as citrus fruits. Tesco has hired a veterinary agency to certify products before they cross the border. “We are working with government on both sides of the Irish Sea to smooth the flow of products and I would say that our availability in both markets remains strong,” Murphy said. “The disruption is limited to certain categories, with a particular emphasis on some short shelf-life products where every hour, let alone every day counts.” The company was also experiencing “teething problems” at the main Channel crossing, where about a tenth of the food consumed in the UK is transported. “Inevitably there are the bedding issues that you would expect with any new process that’s been set up as a relatively short notice,” said Murphy. “We’re working our way through and we would hope over the coming weeks and months that we will end up with a much smoother flow of product. “I want to reassure the public that we are coping with this and availability in Northern Ireland, the Republic and mainland UK remains very strong. We see this as a challenge that needs to be overcome and resolved … but we don’t see it as a crisis.” Last week Marks & Spencer complained about new “rules of origin” regulations, which dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. However, Tesco said the issue was minimal for its business. With more shoppers turning to the web to buy groceries, the retailer said online sales had increased by more than 80% over the 19 weeks. That equates to nearly £1bn in extra sales. The retailer also highlighted that sales in its largest stores also grew strongly as customers favoured larger, less frequent shopping trips. Sales of its Finest range were up 14% over Christmas while demand for plant-based products also increased strongly, with sales of its Plant Chef range up more than 90%. General merchandise sales were also up 4% driven by a strong performance in toys, home and electrical items. Tesco, which is the UK’s largest private sector employer, said about 10%, or 30,000, of its staff were off or shielding as a result of coronavirus, three-fifths the number in the initial months of the pandemic. The retailer is introducing rapid testing in its distribution centres and Murphy urged the government to prioritise vaccinating food industry workers after the vulnerable groups had been done. The company said extra costs linked to the pandemic would be £810m in the current financial year, up almost £100m from a previous estimate. Its annual profits forecast remained unchanged despite the strong Christmas performance. Sales at its wholesale arm Booker, which Tesco bought for £3.7bn in 2017, have been dented by the closure of hospitality businesses. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco had done well but had not “shot the lights out”. The sales growth was, he said, “a little behind our expectations. Whereas Sainsbury’s has been boosted by Argos, Tesco has witnessed greater headwinds than we anticipated from Booker in the UK, where lockdowns have been weighing heavily upon the catering side of the business.” Tesco’s shares closed at 241.4p, remaining flat compared to the previous day’s traiding."
"National Express is to suspend its entire network of coach services across the UK from Monday due to the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions. The company, a major provider of timetabled coach routes, said it would be halting all services until March. Chris Hardy, the managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.” All journeys until Sunday night will run as planned to ensure that no passengers making essential journeys are stranded, National Express said, while customers whose travel has been cancelled will be contacted for free rebooking or full refunds. Hardy said there was a provisional restart date of 1 March in place but warned that could change: “As the vaccination programme is rolled out and government guidance changes, we will regularly review when we can restart services. “We will now make sure we are ready to get back behind the wheel as soon as the nation needs us again.” National Express suspended its coach operations for almost three months from April 2020 in the first lockdown. While local bus operations have been underwritten by a government bailout, which is giving operators assistance equivalent to lost revenue, intercity coach services have not had similar financial guarantees. Since the start of the pandemic National Express has launched a division called Transport Solutions to use its brand and coaches in the vastly changed market. The withdrawal of coach services comes as the Department for Transport and train operators consider which rail services will be withdrawn, with around 50% of the timetable likely to be suspended during the lockdown."
"Savers who have lost track of pension and investment funds will have their money used for charitable causes that could aid Covid recovery efforts under government plans to expand its dormant asset scheme beyond bank accounts. The Reclaim Fund was established in 2011 to distribute the cash from bank and building society accounts that were left unclaimed for at least 15 years. It came after banks were accused of bolstering their balance sheets by sitting on dormant savings. It has already helped with Covid recovery efforts, having released £150m from the fund to help charities, social enterprises and vulnerable individuals during the outbreak in May. About 30 banks and building societies take part in the scheme, but the new programme will open to City firms across the insurance, pensions, investment and wealth management sectors after the government puts forward legislation to expand it. Each sector will have their own guidelines determining when assets should be shifted to the Reclaim Fund. Firms are expected to make reasonable efforts to track down customers and reunite them with their accounts before transferring them to the Reclaim Fund, which has so far distributed £745m to charitable causes.  However, only a small proportion of deposits are ever recovered by their rightful owners after they are transferred, at a rate of just 5% a year. In total, customers have only reclaimed £93m since the fund was established, which is less than 7% of the £1.35bn collected over the same period and lower than the £147m transferred in 2019 alone. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (took the decision after a four-year review concluded there was widespread support for the scheme’s extension. It said customers would still be able to apply to reclaim their assets in full at any time, and said the expanded scheme “will have consumer protection at its heart, with the priority continuing to be locating and reuniting people with their financial assets”. The voluntary scheme has run into controversy. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that HSBC had been warned by its own compliance staff in 2017 that it was not doing enough to reunite customers with their cash before freezing their accounts, and was potentially harming elderly and vulnerable savers who may have lost track of their savings. HSBC denied it had mistreated customers, or that it took insufficient action, and said it had made “substantial and continuous improvements” to its dormant account policy since 2016."
"Hyundai’s value surged by $9bn (£6.6bn) on Friday after reports that it could join with Apple in developing a driverless electric vehicle – despite confusion as it backtracked on a statement acknowledging “early discussion” with the iPhone manufacturer. Investors sent the South Korean carmaker’s share price on the Seoul exchange up almost 20%, as local media reported a possible tie-up on electric cars and batteries with Apple, which has been developing its own vehicle technology. Reports on South Korea’s Economic Daily claimed the two firms were in talks. Hyundai originally issued a statement saying: “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided.” A subsequent statement to the stock exchange from Hyundai omitted any reference to Apple, merely saying there were “requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies”. Last month it was reported that Apple was hoping to launch a self-driving personal vehicle by 2024, which, a source told Reuters, could represent an evolution in electric car battery technology in the way the iPhone evolved mobile phones. It was suggested that Apple could look for a traditional manufacturing partner to help make the car. Apple did not comment on the Hyundai statement. The scramble to invest in Hyundai comes after a year in which the share price of the market leader in electric vehicles, Tesla, has rocketed – to the extent that chief executive and major shareholder Elon Musk this week overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest man. An Apple vehicle would have the design cachet to compete with the California company, which shipped almost 500,000 vehicles last year and has pushed the boundaries of autonomous driving as well as electric car technology. Hyundai has been keen to burnish its credentials, last month announcing it would develop in-house its own electric car platform and battery systems, expecting to extend the range of a single charge to 500km. It has also had an eye on more futuristic technologies, establishing a self-driving joint venture, Motional, with car component supplier Aptiv and ploughing $2bn into the new firm. Motional has announced plans with ride-hailing firm Lyft to launch robotaxis in the US from 2023. An investor in robotics firms, Hyundai in 2019 unveiled a concept “walking” robocar for tougher terrain. Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about its product development plans but it has been reported to have been working on Project Titan, its electric and autonomous car vision, since 2014."
"Ryanair expects to lose 95% of its traffic in February and March, with few if any flights operating from the UK and Ireland, because of the latest Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions. The Dublin-based airline, which normally carries the most passengers in Europe, lambasted “brutal lockdowns” and called on the Irish government in particular to accelerate vaccinations. Ireland has banned incoming travel from Britain until Friday, and from Saturday is expected to require all international arrivals to provide a negative Covid-19 test from within the previous 72 hours to enter the country. The UK is considering a similar testing measure. Ryanair said it was again cutting its full-year traffic forecast by a further 5 million passengers to between 26 million and 30 million, at best below 20% of 2019 levels. It expects to fly fewer than 1.25 million passengers in January and 500,000 in February and March, when it would usuallyfly approximately 10 million a month. It said it would significantly cut flight schedules from 21 January so there would be few, if any, flights to or from Ireland or the UK “until such time as these draconian travel restrictions are removed”. The carrier warned last week it would post its first annual loss since 2009, when the financial crisis struck. It said the cancellations would not further affect its results as the flights would have been largely loss-making. Ryanair urged the Irish and UK governments to accelerate vaccination programmes, contrasting in particular Ireland’s current vaccination rate with other countries. An airline spokesperson said: “The WHO have previously confirmed that governments should do everything possible to avoid brutal lockdowns. Ireland’s Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the north of Ireland.” The World Health Organization’s guidance in fact states that lockdowns can slow Covid‑19 transmission and while it warns that “such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees”, it says it recognises that “some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures: and is “hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed”. Ryanair added: “The fact that the Danish government, with a similar 5 million population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than Ireland shows that emergency action is needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland.” The Irish airline has been advertising flights while highlighting the availability of vaccines, calling on customers to “jab and go” – a campaign that drew more than 1,600 complaints, according to the Advertising Standards Authority, which is investigating. Ryanair said all customers affected by further flight cancellations and restrictions would be emailed on Thursday to advise them of free rebooking or refunds. It has previously not offered to refund passengers when flights operated, regardless of lockdown rules. EasyJet, which carried most UK passengers pre-Covid, said on Monday it would be reviewing its schedules and probably operating only domestic and limited international flights while lockdown lasts. Meanwhile, the Hungarian airline Wizz Air said it was cancelling flights as a result of the latest lockdown. Capacity in January is expected to fall to 25% of 2020 levels from the 35% level it flew in December."
"Percy Pig has emerged as one of the first casualties of Brexit red tape, with Marks & Spencer warning that its famous pink sweets could be hit with new import taxes in Ireland. The sweets are among the more than 2,000 products sold in M&S food halls that are affected by the “rules of origin” regulations set out in the trade deal struck with the EU. The rules dictate whether import taxes, called tariffs, must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. Steve Rowe, the chief executive of M&S, gave the example of its bestselling Percy Pig sweets, which are manufactured in Germany and brought to the UK before being re-exported to Ireland – a journey that would now be subject to import taxes. “About a third of the products in our food business are subject to complex rules of origin around componentry and how much has been altered in the UK,” Rowe said. “Depending on that, there is a variable rate of tariff on goods. Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print.” The UK’s free trade agreement has spared Marks & Spencer’s domestic business from tariffs but would “significantly impact” the retailer in Ireland, where it has 18 stores, as well as in the Czech Republic and France. The “scope and complexity” of the new rules meant many retailers would have to “find an expensive workaround”, Rowe said. The rules of origin do not affect products sold in its stores over the border in Northern Ireland. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said at least 50 of its members were facing potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU. William Bain, the BRC’s trade policy adviser, said it was trying to come up with short-term options and “seeking dialogue with the government and the EU on longer-term solutions to mitigate the effects of new tariffs”. He added: “We need a solution which genuinely reflects the needs of UK-EU supply and distribution chains for goods.” "
"Thousands of British Gas engineers and call centre workers will down tools from Thursday as part of a national five-day strike in response to the energy giant’s “fire and rehire” plans. The GMB trade union called the strike after 89% of its 9,000 British Gas members voted in favour of industrial action following the breakdown of talks with executives at Britain’s biggest energy supplier last year. The union expects the majority of the 7,000 engineers and 2,000 call centre workers who are part of its membership to take part, but will limit picketing due to coronavirus restrictions.  The strike marks the end of months of tense negotiations between union representatives and energy company executives over plans to reduce the workforce and shift employees on to new contracts. The union has accused Centrica, the embattled owner of British Gas, of “bullying” its 20,000 employees to accept worse employment contracts or lose their jobs as part of a so-called “fire and rehire” plan. The FTSE-listed company, which has lost more than three-quarters of its market value in the last five years, said it has asked all employees to sign up to new employment contracts to help simplify the business. A similar approach was proposed by British Airways last year, alongside staff cuts, but the airline dropped the controversial plans after negotiations with trade unions. Justin Bowden, GMB’s national secretary, said: “British Gas boss Chris O’Shea’s attempts to bully workers into accepting cuts to their pay and terms and conditions has provoked this inevitable outcome – massive disruption to customers in the depths of winter and a stain on the reputation of an historic company and brand.” About 7,000 frontline office workers represented by the Unison trade union accepted the energy company’s new terms last month, and 4,000 non-unionised staff also agreed to sign new contracts. A spokeswoman for Centrica said: “We’ve done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action.  “Whilst we’ve made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown.” The company said it has “strong contingency plans in place” and will “prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies”. British Gas has lost about 1 million customers in recent years due to fierce competition in the energy market from a string of cut-price energy supply startups.  As a result, Centrica reported a £1bn loss for 2019 before scrapping its shareholder dividend and warning investors there would be a steep slump in revenues in 2020."
"Flatowners who have struggled to sell their homes because of fire safety risks, despite not having any cladding on their building, could soon be able to find buyers after surveyors proposed changes to how the properties are valued. Following the Grenfell fire tragedy banks and building societies have taken extra steps to ensure buildings have passed fire safety checks before offering mortgages on homes within them. Since December 2019, surveyors working for lenders have relied on proof of an inspection by an expert outlined in an ESW1 form to show that a building does not have any dangerous cladding and will not need expensive works to put right. However, some homeowners have been asked for a form when selling or remortgaging flats where there is no cladding in place, and found that their properties are effectively worthless without one. Last year, the government said 450,000 flatowners had been “stuck in limbo” in properties with no cladding which might be deemed unmortgageable and lifted its requirement for checks on these buildings. Now a consultation from the surveyors’ group Rics has proposed new guidelines for its members to decide whether an EWS1 form is needed. For buildings below four storeys it says it is unlikely that an EWS1 is needed if there is no aluminium or metal composite (ACM or MCM) cladding in place. On higher buildings, it has outlined rules on balconies, and when other kinds of cladding should prompt an inspection. Ben Elder, head of valuation standards at Rics, said government advice and lending criteria had changed since the form was introduced. “EWS1 was never intended to hold up the market, indeed without it, no one would be moving,” he added. The National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents housing associations that own some of the buildings in question, said the proposals were encouraging. Victoria Moffett, head of building and fire safety programmes at the NHF, said: “This situation is now critical, with many leaseholders, also affected by the pandemic, at serious risk of losing their homes or becoming bankrupt because they cannot remortgage or sell.” However, she said upfront funding for safety work was needed from the government. “This is the only way to satisfy lenders that leaseholders will not face large bills for potential safety work in the future, and ultimately allow people to sell and remortgages.” The consultation will close on 25 January 2021, with the new guidance given to surveyors in the spring."
"Boeing has been fined $2.5bn by the US justice department after being charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection with two fatal crashes of its 737 Max airliner. Boeing’s employees chose “the path of profit over candor by concealing material information” from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US’s top airline regulator, David Burns, the acting assistant attorney general of the justice department’s criminal division, wrote in a release. Burns said the company had also engaged “in an effort to cover up their deception”. The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. A March 2020 congressional investigation concluded that Boeing promoted a “culture of concealment” and was “grossly inefficient” in its oversight of the Max’s development. At a heated congressional hearing in October 2019, Senator Richard Blumenthal accused Boeing of selling “flying coffins” as a result of its decision to conceal issues with the planes from pilots. “The tragic crashes of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world’s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,” said Burns. Boeing admitted that two of its technical pilots deceived regulators about the safety of the Max’s MCAS stall prevention software, implicated in both of the fatal crashes. In both cases, the planes crashed shortly after takeoff when their pilots were unable to regain control of the planes after they went into a nosedive. The settlement includes $2.2bn in compensation to the families of the people killed in the two Max crashes and a $243m fine. In a statement, Boeing once more blamed its former employees. The “agreement is based on the conduct of two former Boeing employees and their intentional failure to inform the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group (AEG), the group within the FAA responsible for making pilot training determinations, about changes to the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS)”, the company said. David Calhoun, Boeing’s president and chief executive officer, said: “I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do – a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations. “This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations.” Boeing has now addressed concerns about the Max and the plane returned to service in the US in December. Lawyers for the families lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash dismissed the settlement and said they would continue their litigation against Boeing. “The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing’s wrongdoing – a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court. This agreement, including the ‘crash-victim beneficiaries fund’, has no bearing on the pending civil litigation against Boeing, which we plan to prosecute fully to ensure the families receive the justice they deserve,” Clifford Law Offices said in a statement. They said the 737 Max should not have been returned to service “until all of the airplane’s deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews – which to date still has not occurred”."
"What is $900m to a Wall Street giant like Goldman Sachs? Relatively little, when it counts the drop in profits for a year of record-setting market swings and economic turmoil, all sparked by a pandemic. The firm should regard itself as lucky to be poised for profits of about $7bn (£5bn) for the whole of 2020. That average analyst forecast, compiled by Refinitiv, is a mere 11% drop from the $7.9bn it made in 2019, a year when the phrase “Covid lockdown” had never been uttered. The projected decline is smaller than the $2.8bn it put aside to cover a potential jump in defaults within the first nine months of the year alone, a number estimates suggest could rise to $3.1bn for the 12 months to December. Those provisions pale in comparison with those of European peers such as HSBC, which already put by $7.6bn to cover Covid-linked loan losses by the third quarter. The bank’s results will emerge unscathed from the $2.9bn settlement it reached in October with global regulators and the US Department of Justice, over its alleged role in the 1MDB corruption scandal. The announcement came just months after Goldman agreed to pay $3.9bn to the Malaysian government, amid claims it allegedly turned a blind eye while $4.5bn was looted from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Goldman bosses, including chairman and chief executive David Solomon, will feel the pinch of a $31m cut to their combined 2020 pay over the scandal, but hefty provisions previously put aside for the 1MDB case will largely cover the settlements. All this means Goldman’s full-year earnings – released on Tuesday – will make headlines for less scandalous reasons. For one, its fledgling consumer bank, Marcus, has made further headway as customers lucky enough to keep their jobs or benefit from government Covid support programmes spent less and saved more during lockdowns. Marcus savings accounts were in such high demand in the UK – thanks to a pocket of cash-rich and interest-hungry savers – that in July it was forced to close to new British accounts to avoid breaching regulatory limits. But the 150-year-old lender’s bread-and-butter services will have proved its saving grace in 2020. The asset management business, fixed income division, and investment bank – which earns fees for advising clients on deals and corporate fundraising – produced a near doubling of third-quarter profit to $3.6bn. Those divisions have benefited from a recovery in merger and acquisition activity, which stalled at the start of the pandemic, and from US stock markets hitting fresh record highs in the latter half of 2020. It has given Credit Suisse a reason to be bullish on Goldman’s earnings, with that bank’s own analysts recently upgrading profit forecasts to $7.4bn. If JP Morgan’s results last Friday are any indication, the market rebound could also help Goldman beat forecasts. Its Wall Street rival reported a 42% jump in profits to $12.1bn for the fourth quarter, leaving full-year profits down 20% at $29bn. A strong performance could raise pay for Goldman traders, who are reportedly set to see 2020 bonuses rise 20% compared with 2019."
"The British footwear brand Dr Martens is planning a £3bn flotation, more than 60 years after its first pair of boots were stitched together in Northamptonshire. Best known for its 1460 boot featuring its trademark yellow stitching and chunky soles, the company expects to float at least 25% of the business on the London stock market. It comes nearly seven years after Dr Martens was bought for £300m by the private equity group Permira. Sales under its ownership have surged, rising from £160m in 2013 to £672m in the year to March 2020. Sources close to the plans said the shoe company expects to seek a valuation of about £3bn. The brand, which sells 11m pairs of shoes and boots a year across more than 60 countries, managed to grow throughout the pandemic, despite lockdowns that forced its 130 high street stores to close. Dr Martens reported an 18% rise in sales to £318m in the six months to September, while profits grew by a third to £86.3m. The majority of sales come from the wholesale business, which sells to third-party retailers. The first pair of Dr Martens made in the UK was in 1960 at its original factory in Northamptonshire, where one of its two main offices is still based. The boots grew in popularity over the following decades, first adopted by skinheads in the 1960s, and later becoming fashion staples among punks, goths and schoolgirls. However, Russ Mould, the investment director at broker AJ Bell, said there were some “red flags”, including consumer complaints over the quality of Dr Martens footwear. “Could it be that the business has suffered under private equity ownership? Many investors are sceptical about backing companies that are being sold by private equity, for fear they might have suffered from underinvestment and subjected to a ‘quantity over quality’ approach for production,” Mould said. However, some critics have said the alleged deterioration came after it shifted the bulk of its production from the UK to Asia nearly 20 years ago, he said. Dr Martens said it rejected allegations of declining standards, and said Permira had continued to invest in the business since its takeover. The footwear firm also said on Monday it had diversified its supply chain, and reduced the proportion of shoes made in China from 46% to 32% between 2019 and 2020, but did not link the changes to quality concerns. Mould said Dr Martens’ IPO was coming at an interesting time for UK markets, hot on the heels of a Brexit deal and the best-ever start to a calendar year for the FTSE 100. “If ever there was a good time to market a well-known British name to investors, it is now,” he said."
"A surge in online shopping helped to push up the Post Office’s income over Christmas, as web-based retailers escaped the Covid-19 restrictions that bedevilled the high street. In the four weeks to 27 December, the Post Office recorded 51.3m customer transactions, just 0.5% below the same period of 2019, with sales up 17% to £66.3m. Mail and parcel services increased “significantly”, boosted by the soaring growth of Drop & Go, the Post Office’s fast-track service for businesses and online sellers, which boosted sales by 87%. Cash and banking services declined only slightly, down 10%, despite the restrictions affecting thousands of small businesses that bank at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches, the largest retail network in the UK. The biggest negative impact of Covid restrictions was on travel money transactions, where like-for-like sales dropped by 69%, as holidays were rendered near-impossible for most of the period. The Post Office’s chief executive, Nick Read, hailed the contribution of postmasters, the people who run individual branches. The company was forced to apologise last year after a landmark legal case ruled it had wrongly accused dozens of postmasters of criminal activity, resulting in multiple convictions. “After a very challenging year for much of the retail sector, I am pleased to see 17% growth in network income over the Christmas period thanks to the hard work of postmasters,” said Read. “Our physical presence has been vital across the UK, with customers enjoying the convenience, expert advice and safe hands that our postmasters offer, in addition to the invaluable support they have provided to local communities during the pandemic, with 99% of the network remaining open.” Variable income for postmasters rose 20% during the year. Despite milder-than-usual weather over the four weeks to 27 December, income from bill payment was up after the Post Office won a contract with British Gas to process top-ups."
"For the past year Britons have been told to stay home and save lives but while tabletop gamers have been stuck at home they have been busy fighting bloodthirsty wars from the safety of their bedroom or garden shed. Sales at Games Workshop, which sells fantasy miniatures and toy soldiers, soared by a quarter at the end of last year as fans escaped the grim reality of 2020 by losing themselves in its games, including its bestselling space fantasy game Warhammer 40,000 – or 40K as it is usually known. Given the human misery created by the pandemic the appeal of “the grim darkness of the 41st millennium” where “there is only war” can be hard to see. But Warhammer counts its fans in millions. Its Warhammer community webpage has 4.7 million users, its YouTube page has 400,000 followers and there are 280,000 on Instagram. Nonetheless Kevin Rountree, Games Workshop’s chief executive, said there had been a “step change” in demand over recent months for the figures and weaponry players used to build their armies. The company sold nearly £187m of games, figurines and paints in the six months to the end of November, up £38m on the year before, and profits were up more than 50% to £92m. Rountree described it as a “cracking performance”. The devotion felt by Games Workshop’s fanbase is likened to the cult following enjoyed by the likes of Lego, which has also enjoyed a sales boost as children and adults look for ways to entertain themselves at home during lockdowns. Games Workshop, however, is seen to attract an older, more male following. Its figures cost anywhere between £10 and £100-plus, while tiny pots of paint, with names such as “plaguebearer flesh”, start at about £3. Over the past five years the Nottingham-based company has become a stock market sensation as investors woke up to the might of the Warhammer games franchise. Five years ago the shares were worth about £5, but today they change hands for more than £100 as the growing army of hobbyists pick up their paintbrushes. The company is now valued at £3.6bn – or £1bn more than Marks & Spencer. Games Workshop shuns publicity but on its website 50-year-old Rountree, who has worked for with the company for more than 20 years, says its mission is simple: “We make the best fantasy miniatures in the world and sell them globally at a profit. We intend to do this forever.” The company was started more than 40 years ago by three school friends: John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. The gaming fanatics shared a flat in west London where they started out selling handmade, classic wooden games before going on to open stores. After a management buyout in the 1990s the company listed on the stock exchange in 1994. The business is also clear, that despite running 529 stores, it is first and foremost a manufacturer. The shops, it says, are a recruiting ground for people with “our particular hobby gene”. Its factory in Lenton, Nottingham, pumps out tens of million of miniatures a year with the stores, which are often run by a single employee, used to show customers “how to engage with our hobby of collecting, painting and playing with our miniatures and games”. Games Workshop’s success during the pandemic, despite the turmoil caused by on-and-off store closures, has seen it repay the taxpayer support extended in the early days of the crisis. With its shops closed for long periods the company’s online sales were up 87%. “People have a lot more time on their hands and these models take a lot to time to do well,” says GlobalData retail analyst Zoe Mills, who points to high levels of engagement on Warhammer’s social media channels where fans share pictures of their painted miniatures. “In many ways Games Workshop is unique; there isn’t really another brand out there that offers the same sort of experience.” The huge lifestyle changes brought about by the pandemic have seen lots of Britons take up new and old hobbies, from baking to crafting to learning a language. “Warhammer is ultimately just another sort of hobby, although some people might see it as a more serious thing than that,” said Mills. “People are spending more time away from their phones and because are we not going into offices some people have got some extra time in the evenings that they don’t necessarily want to spend in front of the television.” With the nation on lockdown for much of the last year the games sector received a pandemic boost as bored Britain stumped up a record £4bn-plus to keep entertained. The amount spent on digital gaming, from casual mobile phone gamers to hardcore players, hit £3.6bn last year. More than the amount spent by the record number of subscribers to services such as Netflix and Amazon, and triple the size of the UK music streaming market. Many gamers had also been conserving their cash for the arrival of new consoles from Sony and Xbox, which launched late last year and helped the spend on physical video games surge to £600m. By far and away the biggest selling game of last year was FIFA 21, at 2.2m copies, well ahead of second-placed Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which sold at 1.4m, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. The other titles in the top five were by Grand Theft Auto V, Fifa 20 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Beyond the predominantly male-skewed list of the biggest titles there was also big demand for family fare, with cutesy Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players become animal villagers to make an island paradise, proving a surprise hit. It ended the year as the UK’s sixth biggest-selling game. Sales of board games and jigsaw puzzles have also soared as traditional pursuits made a comeback to while away hours stuck at home. Early in the pandemic, the best-selling game was Monopoly Classic with Cluedo, Scrabble and card games UNO and Dobble also in the top 10, according to market research firm NPD."
"The UK economy is facing its “darkest hour” due the latest Covid-19 lockdown, which is likely to delay the recovery, the Bank of England governor has warned. In comments on Tuesday that echoed warnings from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak a day earlier that the economy “is going to get worse before it gets better”, Bailey said the UK would bounce back, but only after the lockdown had ended and concerns about the spread of the virus had receded. Referencing Winston Churchill’s use of the phrase in 1940 following the evacuation of Dunkirk, he said: “There’s an old saying about the darkest hour is the one before dawn.” He added: “[We’re] in a very difficult period at the moment and there’s no question that it’s going to delay, probably, the trajectory.” In an online speech to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce he said the shape of the recovery, while delayed, would broadly follow the forecast made by the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) last November. Bailey said the unemployment rate, which he previously expected to peak at about 7%-8% in the summer, would now be lower after the government extended its job protection scheme and other measures to safeguard household incomes. However, the rate remained likely to rise above the 4.9% that official figures estimate for the three months to October. Amid concerns that the UK will suffer a double dip recession after expected falls in GDP during the last quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, Bailey said the figure was already higher despite the extra measures that Sunak has announced, including a further £4.5bn last week for the hospitality sector. “Our best guess nationwide is probably it’s around 6.5%,” Bailey said. The MPC meets early next month to discuss how the central bank can help to protect the economy during the lockdown, including whether interest rates should be cut to below zero – a move that could ease borrowing costs on households and businesses. Bailey said he was sceptical that a cut from the current all-time low of 0.1%would be painless, arguing it could make the situation worse. He said there were “lots of issues” with cutting interest rates into negative territory and such a move could hurt banks. “In simple economics and maths terms, there is nothing to stop it at all,” he said. “However there are a lot of issues with it.” At its meeting in November, the nine-strong committee voted to launch a fresh £150bn stimulus package in response to the economy’s flagging recovery, taking the total amount of electronic money pumped into the economy to £895bn. In December the committee said it would wait for further evidence of a downturn – and consider the impact of a Brexit trade deal – before committing extra funds to the stimulus package. Bailey said the Bank had seen anecdotal evidence of disruption caused by Britain’s departure from the European Union at the turn of the year, but it was unclear how persistent the delays would prove beyond the first month of the year. On Monday, one of the MPC’s nine committee members said she believed the likelihood of a further downturn following the third lockdown meant negative rates would benefit the UK economy and help it make a faster recovery. Silvana Tenreyro said central banks in Japan and the eurozone had cut rates to below zero to support borrowing and she was likely to vote for the UK to follow suit when a review by the Bank was completed. Bailey said negative rates – the subject of a feasibility review by the central bank – would complicate high street banks’ efforts to be profitable and force them to restrict lending. Officials at the central bank fear that negative rates will trigger a flight of savings, depleting the reserves of commercial banks and forcing them to cut back lending. Bailey argued that it was not easy to draw a direct parallel with similar action in the eurozone, where banks have mostly passed on the benefits to large businesses while keeping household savings and mortgage rates at higher levels."
"The Hut Group, the recently floated online retail company run by billionaire Matthew Moulding, has upgraded its profit forecasts after strong sales at its beauty and sports nutrition brands during the coronavirus pandemic. The Manchester-based company which floated on the London Stock Exchange in September, said sales rose 51% to £558.7m during its fourth quarter, beating previous expectations of an increase of between 40% and 45%. The Hut Group (THG), which runs the websites Lookfantastic, Glossybox and Zavvi as well as beauty brands such as Espa and Illamasqua and the sports nutrition company Myprotein, said sales had benefited from strong demand for beauty products including self-tanning kits, vitamin tablets, Myvegan supplements and hand sanitiser during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, THG said it was expecting 2021 revenues to be 30% to 35% ahead of last year’s, up from its previous estimate of 20% to 25%. Matthew Moulding, the co-founder who serves as executive chairman and chief executive, told analysts and investors that the “key standout was the beauty division”. He said the company had hired 3,000 people, largely within the UK, taking its global workforce to 10,000, and opened five new warehouses across the world. Black Friday had been strong, he said, and the firm’s websites typically got 20 times their usual orders in a day. The Hut Group made a strong stock market debut in mid-September, when its shares rose by a quarter to 625p. After the success of the stock market debut, Moulding was handed one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history – an £830m share award. The shares rose 1% to 798p on Tuesday, giving the firm a market value of £7.75bn – up from £5.6bn on the first day of trading – and valuing Moulding’s 25% stake at nearly £2bn. Last month, THG bought the US beauty website Dermstore and it has struck partnerships with the fragrance brand Creed, and GlaxoSmithKline for its vitamins portfolio in the UK. The Hut Group was founded in 2004 by the former Phones4u executives Moulding and John Gallemore to sell CDs online, and expanded rapidly by exploiting a now closed tax loophole that allowed companies to avoid VAT on small goods, including CDs and DVDs, by posting them to the UK from the Channel Islands. The firm sought to improve corporate governance by appointing another independent director, taking the number of independents on the eight-member board to four. The Hut Group has been criticised for handing Moulding both the executive chairman and chief executive roles, along with a “golden share” that allows him to block hostile takeover attempts for three years."
"A surge in sales of makeup and jogging bottoms over the Christmas period has boosted sales at the online fashion retailer Asos, which is expecting to make bigger full-year profits as a result. As Christmas parties were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and many office workers now work from home, shoppers splashed out on comfortable leisure wear including tracksuit bottoms, rather than party frocks. Health and beauty products – “makeup, lotions and potions of all sorts” – were also popular, said Nick Beighton, the Asos chief executive, as customers focus more on their wellbeing and improving their looks for video calls. The number of regular shoppers at the online firm rose by more than 1 million to 24.5 million. UK sales rose by 36% over the last four months of 2020, as Asos benefited from a surge in online shopping since the coronavirus outbreak last March, while Covid-19 restrictions forced high street rivals to shut non-essential retail stores. Total retail sales worldwide advanced 23%, including 18% growth in the EU and 13% in the US. Asos also benefited as customers returned fewer items, due to tighter restrictions across the UK, and the November lockdown in England. With England and Scotland entering new lockdowns in the new year, and restrictions likely to last until at least mid-February, Asos expects a Covid boost to pre-tax profits of at least £40m in its first half. As a result, it said pre-tax profits would hit the top end of City forecasts for the year to 31 August 2021, which range from £115m to £170m. In the previous year, profits more than quadrupled to £142.1m. Even so, Beighton highlighted an uncertain outlook. “Looking forward, given the uncertainty associated with the virus and the impact on customers’ lives, our cautious outlook for the second half of the year remains unchanged.” Asos also said that Brexit “country of origin” rules, which cover the shipment of products between the UK and the EU, would result in tariff costs of £15m. It announced earlier this week it would build a £90m distribution centre in Lichfield, Staffordshire that will handle parcels for its online clothing and beauty business and hire 2,000 people over the next three years."
"The boss of Unilever, one of the UK’s biggest companies, has said his office workers will never return to their desks five days a week, in the latest indication that coronavirus will transform modern working life. Alan Jope, the chief executive of the consumer goods group, said the company would also encourage all of its employees to receive vaccinations against Covid-19, but would stop short of making jabs mandatory. Employees who opt not to be vaccinated, however, will face mandatory testing. Jope said the company would look at different working patterns after it saw during the pandemic that it could adapt and make big changes far more quickly than previously thought. Unilever, the third most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange, is the maker of brands including Dove soap, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Marmite. It also owns Hellman’s, Knorr, Lipton and Persil. The pandemic has forced office staff to work from home in most of Unilever’s main markets, including the US and UK. Factory workers in most economies have been exempt from stay-at-home orders. Speaking on Wednesday at a Reuters conference, Jope said he did not expect office workers across western Europe and north America to return to work until at least April, and added that Unilever would use a “hybrid mode” of working between homes and offices after that. Permanent changes are expected for many of its 150,000 global employees, 7,000 of whom are in the UK. “We anticipate never going back to five days a week in the office,” Jope said. “That seems very old-fashioned now.” He also said the pandemic had made it clear that the company did not need to be as hierarchical. However, he added that Unilever was still keen to return to offices after seeing a “slow erosion of social capital” as working from home prevents colleagues from meeting in person. Many business leaders have voiced concerns about lack of innovation and the impact on training younger staff when workers do not congregate. Several large companies have said they intend to keep some of the new ways of working forced upon them by the pandemic. Twitter last year said it would allow employees to work from home “forever”, while the owners of empty city-centre offices are nervously hoping that economists are incorrect in predicting a sustained increase in homeworking. Morgan Stanley last summer predicted 30% of US workers would work from home after the pandemic, double pre-Covid estimates. Unilever is already experimenting with working practices. In New Zealand, its staff are trialling a four-day week, making it one of the biggest companies to consider reducing the hours its employees work, after a number of smaller firms found it helped productivity and employees’ wellbeing. The 81 New Zealand staff will continue with the four-day week until December, when Unilever will assess its performance and consider whether to extend it around the world. As well as bringing changes to working life, the pandemic has altered spending patterns, hitting sales of products such as ice creams but helping sales of cleaning products and food for home cooking. Jope highlighted the “rise of e-everything” during the pandemic, referring to increased online shopping from consumers stuck at home, as well as increased concern from consumers on environmental and social sustainability. “People are e-browsing, e-buying, e-paying, e-media-consuming and we expect that will continue,” he said. “We can rely on people’s use of technology to stick around.” The pandemic will continue to disrupt European and American economies during the first half of 2021, depressing spending, Jope said. However, he said east Asian economies such as Singapore and China – which have effectively suppressed viral outbreaks – were almost back to normal . On vaccinations, Jope criticised “vaccine hesitancy” and said Unilever would try to ensure access to vaccines for all of its workers. But, he added: “I don’t want any of my employees to be jumping the queue on frontline medical workers or vulnerable people.” "
"Lidl has celebrated a record Christmas in the UK as customers switched to the discount supermarket for festive treats including panettone and pink prosecco. Sales at the chain rose by 17.9% in the four weeks to 27 December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The increase was larger than those at the nation’s four biggest supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and the fellow discounter Aldi. Customers’ taste for premium food and drink over the Christmas period boosted their spend, and sales of Lidl’s Deluxe range climbed by 22%. Lidl shoppers bought more than 1m bottles of pink prosecco during the festive period, as well as 2.7m servings of panettone. An average of 17,000 Deluxe mince pies an hour were sold during December. The store’s first branded Christmas jumper, featuring the logo as part of a festive design, was popular, with one sold every minute in the month to 27 December. British supermarkets notched up their biggest month on record in December, spending £11.7bn on take-home groceries, according to analysts at the research group Kantar, as coronavirus restrictions led to the closure of many restaurants, pubs and cafes during the key trading period. Lidl said shoppers bought more goods – with basket size increasing by almost 25% year on year – and British households switched £34.7m of spend to Lidl from other supermarkets. Christian Härtnagel, the chief executive for Lidl GB, said its record sales and basket size growth demonstrated the strength of the chain’s appeal. “Despite this Christmas being a difficult time for many across the country, we are pleased to have been able to help our customers enjoy themselves by offering high-quality food at the lowest prices on the market,” he said. In December, Härtnagel joined the ranks of supermarket bosses who said they would return the government’s business rates relief. The privately owned German chain said it would give back more than £100m. Lidl opened four new stores in the UK in December, including in Southampton and Nottingham, creating 120 jobs. It is investing £1.3bn over the next two years to help to reach a target of 1,000 stores in the UK by 2023."
"Locked-down consumers across Europe ordered 57% more takeaways from the continent’s biggest delivery group in the final three months of 2020 than a year earlier. The huge leap in trade reported by Just Eat Takeaway.com was a further acceleration in growth from the 46% jump in the third quarter, as surging coronavirus cases resulted in countries across Europe reintroducing strict restrictions, keeping people at home. In the UK, delivery orders surged by almost 400% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period of 2019, as many consumers were once again asked by the government to stay at home. Just Eat Takeaway, based in the Netherlands and one of the world’s largest online food delivery firms, said it had put “tremendous effort” into improving the Just Eat UK business. It said it had doubled its UK sales force compared with the previous year, driving increased choice of restaurants for customers. Food delivery groups have been a clear winner during the pandemic because restrictions have often prevented restaurants, pubs and cafes from serving diners on their premises. The group now expects Just Eat’s delivery orders in the UK market to overtake the total food orders of the third-largest firm. Jitse Groen, the chief executive of Just Eat Takeaway.com, said the firm’s investment programme had been successful and led to significant gains in market share in most countries. “The progress in the UK is particularly exciting: order growth of 58%, and we have increased our delivery orders nearly fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019,” he said. “In 2021, we will continue to invest in price leadership, improving our service levels and expanding our offering to restaurants and consumers.”  The results come just over a year after shareholders in Just Eat approved a £6.2bn merger with the Dutch food delivery firm Takeaway.com, creating one of the largest food delivery groups in the world, serving customers in 23 countries from Europe to New Zealand. In June, Just Eat Takeaway agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn (£5.8bn) in a deal that created the world’s largest food delivery service outside China. Just Eat Takeaway said it had obtained all regulatory approvals relating to the Grubhub transaction, as well as shareholder approval, and it hoped to complete the deal in the first half of 2021. Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub together processed 593m orders in 2019 and have more than 70 million active customers globally."
"Burberry has reported a near 40% drop in sales in European markets on the back of store closures and fewer tourists but is experiencing a strong rebound in other parts of the world. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa slumped 37% in 13 weeks to 26 December, a major contrast with the Asia Pacific region, where sales jumped 11% on strong demand from Chinese and Korean shoppers. With 15% of its stores closed and about a third operating under reduced trading hours or restrictions, Marco Gobbetti, Burberry’s chief executive, said the British luxury brand faced an “uncertain trajectory, given the spread of the more transmissible new variants of Covid-19”. He said: “Given this outlook, we expect trading will remain susceptible to regional disruptions as we close the financial year.” However, Gobbetti struck a positive note on the new future as new collections, and advertising featuring people such as the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, attracted younger customers to its designer clothes and accessories. Shoppers were embracing the designs of its creative boss Riccardo Tisci with sales of leather handbags and outerwear up in the “low teens”. Gobbetti said: “While the short-term outlook remains uncertain due to Covid-19, we are well placed to accelerate when the pandemic eases.”  Burberry is working through the implications of the Brexit deal. Based on its preliminary analysis, the company expects a “modest increase in border trade compliance costs as well as some incremental duty under the rules of origin”. Third-quarter sales in established stores were down 9% overall, with the figure pulled down by the company’s decision to reduce the volume of end-of-season discounts, as well as reduced tourist numbers. Online sales were up by more than 50% in the company’s third quarter and by more than 100% in mainland China."
"After months of tortuous negotiations between the UK and the EU, a Brexit trade deal was agreed at almost the last minute. But how prepared are UK businesses for the significant changes that will come into force on 1 January? Are they happy with the terms of the agreement? A shock rise in high street prices caused by billions of pounds of new import taxes on everyday goods has been avoided thanks to the new trade deal. Four-fifths of UK food imports come from the EU, and the British Retail Consortium has told shoppers they can heave a “collective sigh of relief”. Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim, said: “Two weeks ago there was a risk that Brexit could be catastrophic. The deal has provided certainty in terms of what retailers need to do. What we are facing now is at the lower end of the scale in terms of the potential for disruption.” John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, who had warned that import tariffs would have triggered higher food prices, said he was now “relatively calm” about the impact of Brexit on retail, and food retail in particular. But he cautioned: “If we don’t do something very positive to counteract it in terms of the national economy in the long run, we will be a bit worse off than we would have been if we’d stayed in the EU.” Zoe Wood The chaos caused by last week’s French travel ban, which left thousands of truckers stranded in Kent and supermarkets flying in fresh fruit and vegetables, means we have already seen what the worst-case scenario for 1 January could look like. Could those scenes be repeated? The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has already predicted “bumpy moments” for companies navigating the new customs procedures, and analysts think tailbacks at the ports are inevitable in the early days. However, the government’s decision to temporarily waive most of its border checks takes some of the pressure off. The initial focus is on imports of “controlled” goods such as alcohol and tobacco, but controls will ratchet up in April and again in July. After the frenetic stockpiling before Christmas and the Brexit deadline, the volume of goods moved in January is lower, which will also help if there are hiccups with new systems. But any disruption to the flow of cross-Channel trade caused by new Brexit bureaucracy would soon be felt on British shores. With 3,500 trucks a day using the Channel tunnel, the Eurotunnel terminal is an obvious bottleneck if businesses struggle with new customs paperwork. Border delays would be disastrous for exporters of perishable goods, such as Scottish seafood, which were badly hit last week. ZW Given that UK haulage companies had feared having to fight over a small number of annual permits to carry on sending lorries across the Channel, for most the agreement is a significant improvement on the no-deal scenario. However, their operations will be constrained in terms of cabotage (ie moving goods within an EU country) and cross-border deliveries within the EU. That could pose a headache for some, and could prove insurmountable for specialist companies providing logistics for events such as music tours through several countries. The deal still means an enormous amount of red tape for customs and borders, and while the haulage sector itself will not be responsible, lorries could be held up or stopped if their importing/exporting companies have not got the new paperwork correct. Gwyn Topham Drugmakers have long been preparing for Brexit by stockpiling more medicines to ensure there are no shortages of vital drugs and by planning alternative supply routes away from the busy Dover to Calais straits. The industry is confident that medicines will reach patients come 1 January and beyond, but says some things are out of its control, such as delays at borders due to new customs and border checks. Under the Brexit deal, inspections of drug manufacturing facilities are recognised by both sides, but the text does not mention mutual recognition of medicine batch testing. Additional safety tests on medicines made in the UK before they are sold in the EU and vice versa would lead to delays of several weeks. For Northern Ireland, the UK and EU have agreed a one-year phase-in period to implement medicines regulation. Julia Kollewe UK airlines had long been resigned to losing some of their freedoms to operate throughout Europe, such as flying between two EU member states, with easyJet having already hived off part of its operations into a new company in Austria to tackle potential losses from its route network. Meanwhile, contingency measures had guaranteed that flights could continue between the UK and EU in the event of no deal. The structure of International Airlines Group, the Madrid-based owner of British Airways, was questioned before the deal. A clause now allows UK carriers to be controlled by a combination of EU and UK shareholders, which should avert any obligation for BA or other airlines to be split off from owning groups or for shareholders to divest. GT While the Brexit deal says very little about financial services, it has been broadly welcomed by City firms whose business borrowers and corporate clients could have suffered from tariffs and quotas on cross-border trade. But industry groups including UK Finance are calling for an equivalence agreement on financial services – which would give similar access rights to City firms after the end of the transition period – as soon as possible. The lobby group TheCityUK has said that while there are agreements covering basic banking transactions, there are up to 40 treaties affecting cross-border activities for the financial industry that need to be renegotiated. However, reports suggest an agreement on equivalence may not come until spring or summer 2021. TheCityUK’s boss, Miles Celic, said: “While a deal is welcome, financial and related professional services are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to continue to develop the relationship in services in the years ahead.” Most City firms – investment banks, asset managers and insurers – had not expected a deal covering financial services to be struck before the transition deadline, and prepared accordingly. Firms have spent the last four years applying for licences with local regulators, revising client contracts, and shifting more than 7,500 roles and a combined £1.2tn in assets to the EU, to ensure they could continue serving continental customers by the time the UK left the bloc. However, areas that have not yet been granted equivalence, such as derivatives trading, are facing disruption despite the deal. Traders and brokers will have to make alternative arrangements, bypassing the London market to use derivatives trading platforms in countries such as the US that have already been granted equivalence. If traders and brokers get used to rerouting their business through different countries, it could threaten London’s dominance as a financial centre, and make trading less efficient and more costly for users. Kalyeena Makortoff UK manufacturing firms were overwhelmingly in favour of a deal that avoided tariffs and quotas that would have destroyed the business models of many companies importing or exporting materials, parts or goods from Europe. However, new customs and rules of origin checks at the border mean parts will be slower to enter the UK, which in turn means carefully planned “just-in-time” supply chains for companies will have to cope with longer import times, adding billions of pounds of extra customs costs for EU and UK businesses. Manufacturers have called for a significant adjustment period to allow them to continue to trade freely while they adjust to the new rules. One of the trickiest issues for advanced manufacturers is around complex rules of origin. For instance, Japan’s Nissan or Toyota will only be able to source 45% of their car parts from Asia to avoid tariffs. However, the deal means parts sourced from the EU and vice versa will not be affected, and there will be leeway with electric car batteries until 2023. Jasper Jolly The trade deal’s energy chapters have a notable emphasis on the climate crisis, including commitments on using more renewables and avoiding a race to the bottom on climate regulations. In fact, the trade deal could be suspended entirely if either side reneges on the 2015 Paris agreement. The deal includes a new commitment for both sides to work together in the North Sea on big offshore windfarms linked to both the UK and the EU. However, there are large gaps remaining on how exactly existing trade in gas and electricity across interconnectors will work, with only a commitment to sort technical details by 2022. The energy industry is particularly keen for the deal’s parallel UK and EU carbon pricing schemes to be joined together, which it says would avoid extra costs. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the lobby group Energy UK, said that agreeing to link carbon markets in 2021 would be “a great demonstration of collaboration on decarbonisation” before the UK hosts the Cop26 climate talks in the autumn. On nuclear power, the UK and the EU have agreed to continue cooperating, including on the safe movement of nuclear material, equipment and waste. The UK will still be part of various nuclear research programmes. And as with many parts of the deal, the agreement heralds the start of rolling negotiations: the energy chapter will cease to apply in June 2026 – potentially a worry for investors looking at the big energy projects that will be needed to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. JJ Taking back control of the UK’s waters was a rallying cry for the Brexit campaign, even if fishing’s contribution to the UK and EU economies is small relative to other sectors. The deal transfers 25% of the value of fish caught by EU boats in UK waters back to the UK over five years – considerably less than the 80% originally demanded by the UK. UK vessels will catch about two-thirds of fish caught in UK waters, but EU boats will be able to operate as close as six miles from the UK’s coast. Fishers’ lobby groups were aghast that the deal will end the practice of quota swapping between British and EU vessels, meaning that in some cases UK fishers may be limited to smaller catches. And the deal is by no means an end point: instead, the EU and the UK will conduct annual negotiations on catch size. Some UK fishers hope the UK will continue to push for further increases in their catch. JJ"
"UK technology companies attracted a record $15bn (£11.2bn) in venture capital funding in 2020, including the creation of seven “unicorn” firms valued at more than $1bn. The firms raised more money from VC investors than the rest of Europe combined, according to research by the data provider Dealroom. The $15bn total compares with the previous record of $14.8bn in 2019. The investments helped create seven unicorns – : the electric vehicle startup Arrival, the recipe box company Gousto, the green energy provider Octopus Energy, the e-commerce platforms Gymshark and Cazoo, and the cloud communications platform Infobip. The UK is now home to more unicorns than any other European country, and as many as Germany, Netherlands and France combined, according to the research. Oliver Dowden, the digital secretary, said: “It’s fantastic to see the UK’s tech companies flourishing, despite all the challenges of 2020. The thousands of high-skilled jobs they are creating will be a crucial part of our economic recovery and the government is committed to supporting the tech sector through an unashamedly pro-tech approach.” The venture capital investment in UK companies was lifted by a series of “mega-rounds” of funding raised by companies including the challenger financial technology company Revolut and the digital insurance provider Ki, which both secured $500m. In the final weeks of December significant fundraisings included $95m for GoCardless, while Octopus Energy raised $200m. The investment from a Japanese utility firm valued Octopus, which was founded little more than five years ago, at $2bn. The 7.4% stake of the founder, Greg Jackson, is worth an estimated $155m (£115m). Oxford overtook Cambridge to take the number two spot in terms of VC investment in tech firms behind London. Oxford’s startups and “scaleups” raised $532m in investment this year, led by the city’s health-related companies such as the biotech unicorn Oxford Nanopore, which raised $84.4m in October. Companies based in Leeds, Newcastle and Glasgow also raised more money than last year. The digital minister Caroline Dinenage said: “Despite the challenges of 2020, the UK tech sector has had one of its strongest years yet, creating seven new billion-dollar companies and achieving record levels of investment. “The success of our regional tech hubs is something to celebrate, as is the industry’s resilience by offering high levels of employment opportunities across a variety of disciplines. Over the upcoming months, we will work closely with the sector to support tech firms and ensure this momentum can be maintained.”"
"2020 has been the most remarkable year for the global financial markets. After the Covid-19 pandemic triggered the worst crash in a generation, unprecedented stimulus measures and vaccine breakthroughs have sent stocks roaring back to record highs. In a year in which at least 1.7 million people died from coronavirus and unemployment soared in a global recession, world stock markets are ending 2020 up 13% – despite the latest surge in cases forcing further lockdowns this winter. The year began with immediate drama, when the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed in a US drone strike at Baghdad airport, sending oil prices higher and markets lower. But fears of Middle East conflict soon took a back seat as troubling reports of an unidentified pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China, emerged. By the start of the Lunar New Year in mid-January, at least 26 people had died. Beijing’s stock market plunged 8% in its worst rout in more than four years when it reopened after the holiday, amid a scramble to shut cinemas, suspend travel, close factories and make people work from home. Weeks later, as the virus spread, the shock that the Lombardy region in Italy was imposing its own lockdown triggered Europe’s worst stock market meltdown in decades. The realisation that politicians would deliberately freeze economic activity to try to slow the virus and prevent health systems being overwhelmed created a month of unprecedented financial turmoil. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, says that as a working investment manager, 2020 was both scary and fascinating. “We were facing a disease that we didn’t understand, and which could have been the equivalent of medieval plague. We now know that it’s really unpleasant but not nearly as bad as it could have been, but we didn’t know that at the time,” Miller explains. “Plus, governments had stopped the global economy – something that had never been done before. Would that lead to an economic depression that would make the 1930s look tame?” Heavy falls in the last week of February were followed by a massive selloff on the bourses in March as investors braced for a global recession and Donald Trump shocked the markets by banning flights from Europe. The UK’s FTSE 100 suffered its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis on 9 March, falling 7% on “Crash Monday”, followed by a horror show three days later when London and New York both posted their worst days since the 1987 crash, shedding a further 10% each. Wall Street’s long bull market died, not with a bang but a wave of selling that briefly saw the Dow lose all its gains under President Trump. At its worst, the selloff wiped out a third of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index’s value. Having started the year at 7,542 points, it had fallen to about 5,000 points by mid-March – its lowest level since 2011 – during its worst quarter since 1987. The pound was also hammered, falling below $1.20 to its lowest level since 1985 amid a wild scramble for US dollars. Sterling was no one’s idea of a safe haven in a pandemic. But what felt like economic Armageddon in March was actually the buying opportunity of a lifetime – if you had the nerve to pile into the stock market in the early stages of the lockdown. The cavalry had arrived, with central bankers slashing borrowing costs to record lows and launching massive new asset purchase programmes, while governments tried to prop up their economies with packages such as the UK’s job retention scheme. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank Berenberg, says central banks, finance ministers and regulators deserve praise for acting fast and effectively. “Despite a plunge in output by up to 30% within two months and a bout of serious financial turmoil in early March, the world did not descend into a genuine financial crisis,” Schmieding says. Miller agrees that those support packages for businesses and households were vital. “No one has ever stopped economic activity and locked down a country like we did this year. This is a first.” As the Covid crisis escalated, the financial sector was in better shape than before the 2008 crisis. So in 2020, although there were queues outside the supermarkets, there was no repeat of the run on Northern Rock 13 years ago. Miller says his experience of previous recessions over a 40-year career in the City gave “useful perspective” for 2020’s drama, but this year’s events were still unprecedented. But hard on the heels of cratering equities and the ailing pound came another shock – Saudi Arabia and Russia launched an oil-price war. With air and road travel in deep freeze, an oil glut was already filling up every spare tanker. Riyadh dramatically turning the taps up, not off, sent US oil futures plunging below zero as investors scrambled to offload contracts. The spring also brought grim economic news – more than 20.5 million Americans lost their jobs in April alone, sending the US unemployment rate soaring to 14.7%, its highest level since the second world war. But the markets were recovering much faster than the real economy, thanks to those huge stimulus programmes. Some analysts and investors were cautious, fearing the consequences of a second wave of Covid-19, but the rally had legs. After its worst quarter in over 30 years, the FTSE 100 posted its best three months since 2010 between April and June, as global markets staged a rapid rebound. Tech companies were the clear early winners – as the pandemic pressed the fast-forward button on the move towards digitisation, video-conferencing and online shopping. “The speed of the recovery caught everyone off guard,” explains Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at Axi. “The pandemic has compressed what we thought was going to happen over the next five years into three or six months.” By the summer, economies were emerging from their deepest peacetime recessions, and attention turned to the recovery. Talk that frenzied money-printing by central banks would lead to an inflationary boom swept the gold price to $2,000 per ounce for the first time ever in August. Global markets recovered their pandemic losses as investors began to price in a return to economic normality in 2021, and the prospect of yet more stimulus measures. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says there hasn’t been the same sense of panic as in 2008, apart from the rapid slide in February and March. “Even though this year has been difficult for many, I wouldn’t say investment-wise it’s been more challenging than 2008-09. Back then, the crisis felt much closer to the financial markets, and unlike the credit crunch, the pandemic has always seemed like a problem with a solution, namely the vaccine,” Stevenson explains. 2020 also brought a fresh wave of retail investors to the market. The FAANG technology titans of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet helped the Nasdaq to jump more than 40% this year. Tesla enjoyed the most astonishing run, up almost 700% in 2020. Those stock market gains boosted the wealthiest the most, intensifying the economic inequality created by a pandemic that hit lower-paid workers in areas such as hospitality particularly hard. “The people who most need the money don’t have it to invest, unless they took a flier on Amazon or Tesla, but most didn’t,” Innes points out. The London market lagged behind the wider rally, though, hamstrung by its lack of big tech firms, and abundance of miners, oil giants and banks, all bruised by the global downturn. By the autumn, a resurgence of Covid-19 cases and new restrictions pushed the FTSE 100 back down to a six-month low. But then came a record-breaking November for global markets. Many on Wall Street had started 2020 quietly expecting Donald Trump to be re-elected. Never mind the unpredictability and trade wars, went the theory, just enjoy the promise of lower taxes and deregulation. But by the time Joe Biden had triumphed, money had already poured into renewable energy stocks, along with cyclical companies, in anticipation of increased spending on infrastructure and new stimulus moves from a Democratic White House. Biden’s win prompted a rally after a weak October, which accelerated when Pfizer brought the news everyone had been hoping for – successful vaccine trial data. Global stock markets surged to new record highs, with a frenzy of buying lifting beleaguered “value” stocks such as airlines and hospitality firms, on optimism of a better 2021. The year wrapped up with fresh records, as the Federal Reserve pledged to keep monetary police very loose until the US economy had recovered. First the Dow hit 30,000 points, then bitcoin broke through to $20,000, and raced to $28,000 days later. Quite a revival, given the cryptocurrency had slumped to $6,000 during the March crash. The tech boom refused to abate, with Airbnb’s share price doubling as it floated on the Nasdaq. As the year ends, MSCI’s All Country World index of global shares is more than 13% higher for the year, and two-thirds higher than its March lows. Innes says 2020 was the toughest of his 30-year career. “I’ve never seen anything like it, both the pace of the compression, and then the rebound. Things happened 20, 30 times faster than ever seen before, and I’ve never seen such a strong, concerted, reaction from central bankers either.” Brexit also weighed on UK stocks this year, and was one reason the FTSE 100 fell behind other markets – and is still down 12% for the year. As negotiations reached a climax in December, the pound hit a 31-month high over $1.36, then suffered a late wobble before the final deal was agreed. Although the agreement is thinner than hoped, particularly for services, UK stocks still rallied to a nine-month high once fears of a disorderly Brexit abated. Those huge stimulus packages also drove government bond yields to fresh record lows – the UK can now borrow for free for five years. While welcome news for finance ministers facing huge deficits, such low returns also push investors into riskier assets like equities in search of returns. But it was another rough year for those who trusted their savings to the bank, rather than risking the ups and downs of the financial markets. With interest rates at record lows, cash savings have languished again. “Deposit rates at high street banks are barely above zero and even tying your money up for 10 years in UK government bonds [gilts] will currently earn less than half a per cent per annum, if held to maturity,” says Simon Young, portfolio manager at AXA Investment Managers."
"The owner of Primark has revealed that the latest wave of Covid-19 lockdowns cost the fashion chain £430m in lost sales but that it has experienced a “phenomenal” jump in sales this week since stores were allowed to reopen. The finance director of Associated British Foods (ABF), John Bason, said that trading across reopened Primark stores in England, Ireland, France and Belgium had been better than predicted. “Our trading before the lockdown and now our trading these first few days after lockdown [is] way higher than we had previously expected,” Bason said. “It is phenomenal, in some cases we haven’t seen anything like it,” he said. Primark reopened all 153 of its English stores on Wednesday after a month-long lockdown, with extended trading hours in an attempt to recoup some of its lost sales. Eleven stores stayed open overnight, resulting in a 40-hour trading marathon, with hundreds of shoppers queueing to get into the shops in the small hours of Thursday morning. The company said 34 of its stores – including all those in Northern Ireland and Austria – are still temporarily closed, accounting for 7% of its total store footprint. That compares with the closure of 62% of its store space in November. The jump in pre-Christmas sales is expected to help Primark offset the £430m it lost over England’s second lockdown. The estimated loss, which was released in a trading update on Friday, is larger than the £375m hit it predicted at the start of November. ABF still expects Primark to beat sales and profits recorded for the past financial year, when sales fell 24% to £5.9bn and profits slumped 62% to £362m in the 12 months to September. The company said that some stores were still facing restrictions on trading hours and the number of customers allowed in stores, and that there was still “uncertainty” about further lockdown closures in the short-term. In a week when two of the UK’s biggest retailers – Debenhams and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia empire – have collapsed into administration and amid growing concerns about the future of the high street as a result of the switch to online shopping, the Primark owner struck an optimistic tone, saying it remained committed to expanding its shops. Primark does not sell online. The news sent ABF shares up 2% on Friday morning. The company also said it was fully prepared for the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of December. As companies await news of a potential UK-EU trade deal, ABF said: “Our businesses have completed all practical preparations for the end of the transition period this month and contingency plans are in place should our businesses experience some disruption at that time.” "
"The Spanish owners of TSB are considering putting the UK bank up for sale, in what could lead to the third major ownership shakeup for the loss-making lender in seven years. Sabadell has asked Goldman Sachs to launch a review of TSB that could result in a sale of the entire bank, which it bought for £1.7bn in 2015. However, the Guardian understands Sabadell is open to other options including selling a partial stake, floating TSB on the stock exchange, or maintaining full ownership of the UK lender. The news emerged hours after Sabadell called off merger talks with its larger Spanish rival BBVA, after the two banks failed to agree on a price. Sabadell said it was launching a new strategy that “will prioritise its Spanish domestic business”. “Sabadell will also analyse strategic alternatives for creating shareholder value with regard to the group’s international assets, including TSB,” the Spanish bank added. Goldman Sachs was originally hired by Sabadell to explore various options for TSB back in July. It has now been given a mandate to pursue a sale, according to Reuters, citing a source. It is the latest UK lender to be the subject of a possible sale. Sainsbury’s Bank has also been approached by NatWest, while the Cooperative Bank has received a bid from US private equity fund Cerberus. A sale of TSB would mark the third major ownership change for the UK bank, which was hived off from Lloyds in 2013 as part of efforts to boost competition following its £20.3bn government bailout in 2008. TSB returned as a standalone high street bank nearly 20 years after it was snapped up by Lloyds in 1995. Led by chief executive Paul Pester, the new TSB spanned 631 branches and boasted 8,500 staff. It eventually floated on the UK stock exchange in 2014, but was bought by Sabadell a year later, marking one of the biggest cross-border banking deals since the financial crisis. However, the lender’s reputation was tarnished after the botched launch of a new IT system in 2018 that left millions of customers locked out of their bank accounts for weeks. Pester resigned as chief executive within months of the meltdown, following intense criticism from regulators and MPs. The bank had been rushing to push through the new system, which meant it would no longer have to rely on Lloyds’ IT infrastructure, or pay for the privilege of using it. An independent investigation later concluded that TSB’s board lacked “common sense” and was shifting customers to the new platform before it was fully tested. The incident cost TSB £366m, including customer compensation. Sabadell appointed CYBG executive Debbie Crosbie as CEO to push ahead with a three-year turnaround plan that recently resulted in plans to cut nearly 1,000 staff and close 164 branches. It will leave TSB with 290 branches and about 6,000 staff. TSB’s profits have also been hit by the Covid crisis. TSB reported a £65.5m loss for the first half of 2019 compared with a profit of £21.1m a year earlier, after setting aside £111m to cover the cost of potential defaults linked to the economic downturn. TSB, Sabadell and Goldman Sachs declined to comment."
"Retail sales on Black Friday have fallen sharply despite a boom in online spending as non-essential shops remain closed on England’s high streets during the second coronavirus lockdown. Retailers said online sales hit record levels on the pivotal discount day to soften the blow from the closure of stores. However, UK figures from Barclaycard, Britain’s biggest credit card provider, show payments made in physical stores and online fell by more than a 10th comparedwith Black Friday a year ago. John Lewis said Friday would break all of its previous records for online spending, with sales up by 35% compared with its busiest day during the same period a year ago. It said 2.5m products had already been shipped since it started offering Black Friday offers on 20 November – up 67% on last year – and that record searches had been made for new games consoles, beauty products and Lego kits. However, the boom comes at a time when the company will record zero sales at all 38 of its shops in England, and at its Glasgow store, where government restrictions have forced the closure of shops. Cardiff, Aberdeen and Edinburgh remain open. Barclaycard, which processes nearly £1 in every £3 spent in the UK, said most Black Friday sales typically take place in physical shops, underscoring the potential hit to retailers struggling during the pandemic. It warned that overall payments made to retailers between midnight and 4pm on Friday had plunged by 16.7% compared with the same time a year ago. In a typical year, about two-thirds of the transactions processed by Barclaycard on Black Friday come from in-store sales, with the rest coming from online. The research provider Springboard, which monitors retail footfall, said visits to shopping destinations were down by 58% across the UK by 3pm on Friday compared with last year. Footfall was down most on high streets and at shopping centres. The biggest fall was in central London, with a drop of 82.9%. However, the decline in footfall was far lower in Wales and Scotland where Covid restrictions allow more shops to open. Footfall in Wales was down by a third across the country compared with Black Friday a year ago, while retail visits were down by 50% in Scotland. Separate figures from Nationwide show total spending by its debit card holders – which unlike Barclaycard do not specify whether payments are being made to a retailer – increased by 21% compared with the same day a week ago, as Black Friday provided a boost during lockdown. However, it said transactions were 1% down on Black Friday a year ago. The figures underscore the challenge facing Britain’s retailers in the run-up to the key Christmas shopping period, when more than a fifth of annual sales usually take place. The British Retail Consortium estimates that shops that were forced to close over the past month have lost a combined £8bn in sales. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show online sales accounted for about 28.5% of all spending in October, compared with 19% in January before the emergency struck. Online food sales have nearly doubled. Clothing stores have managed to drive up online sales by 17.1%, but these gains have been outweighed by a 22.1% fall in spending in physical stores. Rob Cameron, the chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said: “Despite the fall in transactions, the silver lining remains the growth of e-commerce. Already this month Barclaycard has seen a 32% increase in the value of online transactions processed, and this is even higher in key ‘gift’ categories such as electronics, cosmetics and jewellery. “This growth signals both a change in consumer behaviour, with people unable to buy gifts in-store, and the fact that many retailers have been spreading out their discounts throughout November, meaning shoppers can take advantage of early bargains.”"
"Sir Philip Green’s retail empire is on the brink of administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk and threatening an end to the tycoon’s high street reign. Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Evans, Outfit and Burton, was struggling before the coronavirus hit and is set to seek protection from creditors after months of Covid shutdowns took their toll. It is understood that Green is considering a process known as a light-touch trading administration, in which management would retain control of the day-to-day running of the business while administrators seek buyers for all or parts of the company. The process, currently being used by ailing retailer Debenhams, protects the business from creditors while options for its future are considered. Administrators could be appointed as early as Monday next week with Green, 68, thought unlikely to attempt to buy back the assets of his 500-store group. Industry watchers said Topshop and Topman would still attract interest from suitors but the smaller brands would be less appealing, with Boohoo, the online specialist, one of a few likely buyers of those assets. ITV News reported that Mike Ashley, the entrepreneur behind Sports Direct, was interested in all of Arcadia’s brands. Responding to a Sky News report that Arcadia was set to appoint administrators from Deloitte, the company said in a statement: “The forced closure of our stores for sustained periods as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has had a material impact on trading across our businesses. “As a result, the Arcadia boards have been working on a number of contingency options to secure the future of the group’s brands. The brands continue to trade and our stores will be opening again in England and the Republic of Ireland as soon as the government Covid-19 restrictions are lifted next week.” Arcadia has been suffering from heavy competition from new rivals such as Boohoo and Asos for some time. It follows years of underinvestment in online selling under Green’s stewardship. In July, the group announced 500 job losses at its head office after it narrowly staved off administration in June 2019 through an agreement with creditors that involved 1,000 job losses and about 50 store closures. Early in the Covid crisis it asked landlords for rent cuts and temporarily paused payments into its pension scheme. It has recently been searching for £30m in funding to help it through the peak trading period. The collapse of the group would leave a pension deficit estimated to be as much as £350m by John Ralfe, a pensions expert. On administration, the group’s schemes will fall under the auspices of the industry-funded pensions lifeboat. The move could cut pay-outs for staff members by 10% when they retire. Last year, Tina Green, 71, the wife of Sir Philip and ultimate owner of Arcadia, pledged to pay an extra £100m into the funds over three years and signed over rights to property worth £210m. However, according to Raife, the fall in the value of retail property means a sale of those assets is unlikely to fill the pension black hole. The pensions issue is likely to cause controversy after BHS collapsed into administration in 2016 with a £571m pension deficit only a year after Green sold it for £1 to a former bankrupt. Green eventually paid £353m to support the BHS scheme after pressure from the pensions regulator. Like all fashion chains Arcadia has suffered heavily from a slowdown in spending on fashion as pubs, clubs and many workplaces have been closed for much of the year. Groups that are heavily reliant on their stores have suffered further as sales lost during the high street lockdowns have not been made up online. The potential collapse into administration of Green’s empire comes only weeks after rival Philip Day’s Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group called in administrators leading to about 1,000 job losses so far with thousands more at risk. Department store Debenhams is also fighting for survival as it aims to secure a rescue deal with JD Sports. The problems at Debenhams, which has closed more than 40 stores in the last 12 months, have had a knock-on effect at Arcadia because it is one of the department store chain’s biggest suppliers. Insolvency experts said both companies were under pressure from creditors who want to call in debts while the retailers are cash-rich during the peak Christmas trading period."
"The Labour former business secretary Peter Mandelson has described the government’s national security and investment bill as “a powerful deterrent to foreign direct investment”, amid warnings that its introduction could be chaotic. In a webinar discussing the impact of the new legislation, Lord Mandelson argued that “in those halcyon New Labour days, such a system of state screening would have been unthinkable.” Introduced by the Conservative government this month, the bill contains sweeping powers to block takeovers and other deals involving Chinese and other foreign firms, and even UK businesses, on national security grounds. The existing regime was introduced by Labour in 2002, and the Conservative government now believes is too light-touch. It is expected to increase the number of takeovers and other deals that are security-screened from one a year to around 1,000. That prompted Mandelson, who had two stints as business secretary, to query how the system would be handled. He said: “What will notifiers be doing. Simply forming an orderly queue … crossing their fingers and hoping for the best?” John Fingleton, a former chief executive with the Office of Fair Trading, a predecessor of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), estimated that the business department could require “potentially 500 to 1,000 people” to handle the national security caseload. He said the CMA, which examines whether mergers pose a monopoly risk, had a staff of around 100 and took on a similar number of cases each year. “I think it’ll be quite chaotic in the beginning and it will take time to set up a new unit like this,” the former regulator said, adding that early cases referred could take longer to process as staff built up confidence and expertise. The bill envisages that transactions in critical industrial sectors will have to be notified to the unit in the business department that will scrutinise deals. Other transactions could potentially be called in and reviewed up to five years after they are concluded. Ministers would have the power to void deals on security grounds. Fingleton said the bill could create too much pressure on the government, and argued that “to protect ministers from themselves” any remedies proposed should only be related to national security. He added: “What will happen is that any vested interest, whether it is a competitor or a group of workers or anybody that has been disaffected or a former owner … who doesn’t like a deal will launch a campaign to lobby a minister to call something in.” The bill has been drafted at a time of growing concern on the Conservative benches about China, and how far Chinese companies should be allowed to invest in the UK’s critical infrastructure, following Downing Street’s announcement that all Huawei 5G kit would be removed from phone networks by 2027. However, it has been carefully written so that no one country is singled out. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said at the time the bill was launched that while ministers were keen to ensure the UK remained attractive to inward investment, “hostile actors should be in no doubt – there is no back door to the UK”."
"Families are preparing for a home-baked Christmas as they tackle the boredom of lockdown restrictions by making their own puddings, mince pies and cakes. Retailers are reporting a surge in sales of festive favourites such as dried fruit, marzipan, candied peel and mincemeat while first-time bakers have also prompted a rush on sales of pudding bowls and baking trays. Waitrose said sales of homebaking goods were up by a fifth including a 70% jump in sales of mincemeat, the key ingredient in mince pies, and a 77% rise in marzipan, which can be used to make stollen as well as a topper for cakes. Sales of chocolate chips have more than doubled. Another main supermarket said sales of sugar, marzipan, cherries, candied peels and chocolate drops were up by more than a quarter on previous years with some shelves looking bare as stores struggled to keep up with demand. The therapeutic power of baking has been a theme of pandemic life, from experimenting with homemade sourdough bread, to trying to recreate takeaway favourites. Such was demand for flour in the spring that supermarkets ran short and flour mills struggled to keep up with demand. The homewares shop, Lakeland, said it had seen a 47% rise in sales of mixing bowls this year. There has also been a leap in sales of bowls for a Christmas pudding and a more than 80% increase in bun tins suitable for making mince pies. Sales of Christmas cake decorations – such as model Santas, holly and robins- are also up on last year. Natalie Breslin, home baking buyer at Waitrose, said many customers were baking their christmas gifts this year: “We know that our customers are looking to add a homemade touch to the gifts they give. Putting time and effort into a bake or making a special gift is a way of showing those around us how much we care.” Research by One Poll for Waitrose and sister chain John Lewis found 42% of people are planning to be more creative with homemade gifts this year than previous years. Katherine Paterson, customer director at Hobbycraft, said the festive DIY trend was not just about baking. Its bestselling products this year includes fillable advent calenders and baubles as families seek to personalise decorations: “It’s going to be the biggest handmade Christmas ever with people making and creating with the passion and skills they’ve learned throughout the year,” Paterson said."
"Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group has collapsed into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk as the retail tycoon’s high street career ends in failure. The owner of household names including Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton appointed administrators from Deloitte on Monday. No immediate redundancies were made as a result of the appointment and the group’s stores and websites will continue to trade. The move will protect Arcadia from creditors while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Green, 68, is not expected to bid for any of the assets. Arcadia’s management will retain day-to-day control of the business under the light-touch trading administration, the same process operating at the troubled department store chain Debenhams. Ian Grabiner, the chief executive of Arcadia, said: “This is an incredibly sad day for all of our colleagues as well as our suppliers and our many other stakeholders. “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands. Throughout this immensely challenging time, our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side. Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.” Arcadia stores will reopen in England on 2 December when the coronavirus lockdown is lifted. Arcadia has about 450 directly leased stores in the UK and 22 overseas, as well as dozens more concessions in department stores and other outlets including Tesco. Its entry into administration is the biggest British corporate failure of the pandemic, and the latest blow to an already battered UK high street. Arcadia has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs since its parent company, Taveta, slumped to a £177.3m loss in the year to 1 September 2018 – Taveta’s last published set of results – with sales over that period slipping nearly 5% to £1.8bn. The collapse not only brings to an end Green’s decades-long presence on the British high street, but appears to have been the final straw for JD Sports’ potential rescue of ailing department store Debenhams, where Arcadia is a big supplier. The sports retailer looks likely to pull out of talks, raising the prospect of thousands more job losses at the department store group if an alternative rescue plan cannot be secured. Matt Smith of Deloitte, the joint administrator, said the coronavirus lockdowns, combined with “broader challenges” for high street retailers, had resulted in a “critical funding requirement” for Arcadia, forcing it into administration. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, offered Arcadia a £50m emergency loan, but that offer was turned down on Monday before administrators were called in. Smith said: “It is our intention to continue to trade all of the brands, and we look forward to welcoming customers back into stores when many of them are allowed to reopen. We will be rapidly seeking expressions of interest and expect to identify one or more buyers to ensure the future success of the businesses.”  Retail analysts say that some of Arcadia’s more popular brands, such as Topshop and Topman, could appeal to potential buyers, although the administrators may struggle to raise interest in some of the group’s other assets. The group’s brands had been suffering from years of underinvestment before the Covid pandemic and had failed to keep up with the switch to online selling and digital marketing. More than 10 buyers are thought to be lining up for Topshop, including online specialist Boohoo, Frasers Group and a number of private equity players. Industry insiders said big chains including Marks & Spencer and Next, which has been expanding its portfolio of brands as a way to utilise its strong online infrastructure, might also be interested in taking on the fashion brand, which would give it better access to a younger market. While Ashley has made no secret of his interest in Arcadia, his capacity to take on the business is in doubt. He is also casting an eye over both Debenhams and some brands that formed part of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, while struggling to revive House of Fraser and update his main Sports Direct chain. As workers hope a deal can be done to rescue jobs, the administration also raises concerns for members of Arcadia’s pension fund, which has an estimated deficit of £350m. The pension fund will be assessed for entry into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-backed pensions lifeboat. However, the move to the PPF could mean members who have not yet reached the scheme’s normal retirement age lose 10% of their benefits, even if they have already started taking the pension. MPs and trade unions have called on the Green family, who have benefited over the years from huge Arcadia payouts, including a £1.2bn dividend in 2005, to plug the pension fund’s shortfall. The family agreed to contribute £100m of additional funds earlier this year as part of a deal with the regulator and signed over security on property assets, but the scheme is still thought likely to be short of funds. In 2017 Green agreed to put £363m into the pension fund for BHS, which he had sold for £1 in 2015 only for it to collapse a year later. Stephen Timms MP, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: “There is unquestionably a moral case for the Green family to do the right thing and guarantee Arcadia’s hardworking staff what is rightfully theirs, whatever happens this Christmas. But the Pensions Regulator must also ensure that it is doing everything in its power to fight the corner of the pension scheme members. “This is a crucial moment for the regulator to show that it has learned the lessons of previous corporate collapses, such as those of BHS and British Steel.” "
"For as long as Anna-Jane Casey can remember she has spent the run-up to Christmas on the stage in the West End. But this year Casey is joining a growing army of workers from Covid-blighted industries to deliver an unprecedented volume of parcels across the UK. “It’s gone bonkers. Last week both myself and my husband were doing 180 to 200 parcels a day,” she said. “People are so lovely when they get their things but I want to scream in their faces ‘stop ordering stuff’!” Casey, 48, who has appeared in shows including Chicago and Billy Elliot, and her husband, who is also an actor, were forced to search for work when all the theatres closed in March. “I have a mortgage and two children to support. I have responsibilities,” she said. “What do you do when your earnings have literally gone? We had to find work where we could.” Home deliveries are one of the few growth sectors of the struggling British economy. The pandemic has accelerated existing trends, with more people than ever ordering goods and groceries online, while delivery companies and supermarkets strain to keep up with demand. The latest figures collated by internet industry body IMRG show online sales are up by more than a half in the middle of November from the same point last year. “It will be a record-breaking Christmas online - though retail overall will have a tough period,” said Andy Mulcahy, IMRG director. Online groceries sales now account for 13% of all food sales, up from 7.4% in March. Analysis by Metapack, which provides software linking most of the country’s high-street brands, including John Lewis and M&S, with hundreds of delivery firms, reveals the parcel volumes going through its systems last week are 70% higher than the corresponding week in 2019. “We are having an online Christmas,” says Bruce Fair, Metapack executive. “The combination of another lockdown and a sustained shift in the behaviour of consumers is creating a peak wave.” He adds the top four carriers in the UK – Yodel, Royal Mail, Hermes and DPD – have already reached capacity and are not taking on new customers. Delivery companies have responded to the online boom by hiring thousands of new drivers, often from the parts of the economy hardest hit by the pandemic. DPD is recruiting 3,500 new drivers and Hermes is taking on 9,000 new self-employed couriers, who can opt into holiday pay contracts negotiated with the GMB union. “We have seen an increase in couriers from hospitality, aviation, retail and the arts,” said a Hermes spokesperson. “Courier work suits lots of people because it is so flexible, it becomes a great lifestyle choice.” Recruitment agency, Manpower, has placed 3,000 new drivers in the last few months, with an estimated 30% turning to driving because of the pandemic. Jason Greaves, Manpower’s brand leader, says: “This year, entrants to the driving labour market are from a much broader range of sectors than normal; former cabin crew, publicans, live music support crew to name just a few.” Delivery firm Yodel has recruited 2,950 drivers and seen a 200% increase in applications for its seasonal jobs. “Demand for our seasonal jobs has always been high but this year we’ve been inundated, says Mike Hancox, boss of Yodel CEO. However, unions argue that many of these new jobs are self-employed franchises where drivers have to pay for their own vehicles and cannot claim sick pay. Matthew Draper, Unite’s logistics organiser, said the bulk of the new jobs were precarious, with no guarantees about work levels or income in the long term: “It’s great the parcel sector is a growth industry but many of these jobs are insecure. Companies should be creating full-time, secure jobs.” Mick Rix, GMB organiser, said workers were being cheated. “Apart from those employed by Royal Mail and a few couriers in some companies, 90% are so-called self-employed, either using their own vehicles, providing their own insurance, taking all the risk,” he said. “That is why other companies’ parcel distribution costs are cheaper than Royal Mail. They are not paying employment costs and the rest of the package that would go with employing people.” Casey and her husband are classed as self-employed. They used the last of their savings to buy a £3,000 second-hand Vauxhall Vivaro van and have been making deliveries across Kent since June. “We are hanging on by our fingernails, covering our costs,” she said. “We get paid £1 per parcel but out of that we’ve got to insure our van, pay for our petrol, put away for tax, as well as provide for our children and keep our house going.” She is also worried about falling ill. “We’ve been around hundreds and hundreds of people. Thankfully Covid has not got us but if it does and we can’t go to work, then we don’t earn,” she said. “We are praying we don’t get ill.” According to Equity, which represents people working in the arts, 40% of its members have had no financial support from the government’s furlough or self-employed grant schemes. They have either been forced on to universal credit or taken work outside the industry. “Those seeking work in other sectors such as logistics are disproportionately more likely to be from working-class backgrounds or marginalised groups. The end result will be an ever more elitist creative industry,” said Paul Fleming, Equity general secretary. Arts workers are not the only ones dropping off parcels or supermarket shopping. Bill Stephens worked for many years in the oil and gas industry until Covid hit. “I tested subsea valves. There has been a decline however and the pandemic sealed the future of the company I was working for and sadly they had to let over 70% of the workforce go,” he said. “I do miss it – I miss the salary.” Stephens, not his real name, is now working full-time as a driver on a minimum 20 hours-a-week contract. “I wanted to be kept busy and it was a job that interested me and was easily available. I also thought it would be something I could always return to in the future [and it] looks like there will always be a need for delivery drivers.” Wasim Salam teaches English, maths and IT in a private Bristol college helping vulnerable adults and the unemployed gain qualifications but he has been forced to take four other part-time jobs, including delivering for a major supermarket, to support his family during the pandemic. “Tesco is the only place that is booming at the moment. They just can’t keep up. It is very busy,” he said. “We’ve had a range of people joining the workforce, including builders and actors. Like myself it’s not something any of us wanted to do. It’s not something we see a professional future in but Covid has made us do all kinds of jobs that we wouldn’t otherwise do.” The relentless routine has left Salam, 44, with barely enough time to see his wife and three children or wider family. “When I was full-time and teaching, I had a better quality of life,” he said. “I’m not able to spend the time I would like with my family. I’m always rushed on the phone. “Nobody seems to know me any more. I feel completed exhausted and completely out of touch.”"
"Caffè Nero has rejected a takeover bid by the billionaire brothers behind EG Group, a chain of petrol stations, as the struggling cafe chain insisted it would continue with a separate restructuring process.  Caffè Nero on Monday revealed that the last-minute offer had been rejected because Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who are also in the process of buying Asda, had not engaged with the company and did not understand its financial situation. The EG Group founders wrote to Caffè Nero at the weekend to offer to buy the chain from its founder and main shareholder, Gerry Ford. The business has 800 cafes and employs more than 6,000 people in the UK. Under the EG Group proposal, which was first reported by Sky News, EG would have paid in full the rent owed to Caffè Nero’s landlords in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Like other hospitality firms, the chain has been hammered by the forced closure of the business during the first Covid-19 lockdown and the conversion to a takeaway-only business in parts of the UK through the autumn. The firm, which owns 650 Caffè Nero-branded stores, 40 Harris + Hoole cafes and 100 Coffee#1 sites, appointed KPMG in September to help it negotiate rent cuts with its landlords. Landlords are due to vote on a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) later on Monday – a form of insolvency that allows retailers to reduce rent and shut shops. Results of the vote, which ends at midnight on Monday, are expected on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement on Monday evening Caffè Nero said the “clear intention” of the bid was “to disrupt the CVA process currently under way as a precursor to opportunistically acquiring the company at a later date”. It added that a takeover would be unlikely to be completed because it would need the support of lenders. Caffè Nero said the CVA proposals would allow it “to withstand the devastating impact of the current pandemic, and any further subsequent lockdowns, and emerge strongly to regain previous trading momentum once restrictions are lifted”. Caffè Nero added that it had tweaked the terms of the CVA so that landlords will receive their full rent arrears if EG Group does later manage to take over the cafe chain. The Issa brothers, from Blackburn in Lancashire, made their fortunes building EG Group (founded in 2001 as Euro Garages) into a big business that runs 6,000 filling stations in Europe, the US and Australia. It has partnerships with Starbucks and KFC. Backed by the private equity firm TDR Capital, the billionaire brothers are buying Leeds-based Asda, Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain, from the US retail giant Walmart for £6.8bn. Walmart will retain a minority stake. However, questions were raised over EG Group’s finances when its auditor Deloitte suddenly quit in October, reportedly because of governance concerns, and was replaced by KPMG. EG Group posted revenues of €20bn (£18bn) and a pretax loss of €82m last year. Caffè Nero was founded in 1997 by Ford as an Italian-style coffee chain in London. Before the pandemic, it had more than 1,000 cafes in the UK and 10 other countries ranging from the US and Sweden to Oman, and served 135m customers a year. Ford, who is also chief executive of the chain, recently said that Caffè Nero had worked hard to adapt to the situation by expanding its coffee at home range, launching click and collect via its app and offering a delivery service through Uber Eats. EG Group declined to comment on the bid’s rejection."
"Financial markets are braced for a plunge in the pound and a sharp fall in UK company share prices if a no-deal Brexit is triggered on Sunday evening. As the chances of a deal appeared to fade, the pound came under renewed selling pressure on Friday, falling by more than 1% against the dollar as post-Brexit trade talks enter a crunch weekend. Sterling was heading for its worst week since September, slipping to a low of about $1.3135, before recovering slightly after Germany’s foreign minister suggested that negotiations could possibly continue beyond the Sunday deadline. The FTSE 100 tumbled by 0.8%, ending the week down at 6,546. Analysts warned that ending the talks on Sunday without a deal would trigger a fresh sell-off, which could sink the currency close to parity with the dollar, and a rout in UK company share prices when the London stock market reopens on Monday morning. “If we get a hard Brexit on Sunday evening the market will be shocked,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. Shares in UK company shares could fall by as much as 7%, he said, led by bank stocks. “Market participants are used to politicians reaching a deal in the last minute, but the UK and EU are far from each other in terms of reaching a trade agreement.” Faced with the prospect of a no-deal departure crystallising on Sunday evening, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley warned the UK-focused FTSE 250, which tracks the value of the UK’s largest 250 companies outside of the FTSE 100, could fall by as much as 10%. Share prices in big UK banks would plunge by up to 20%, it said, because the Bank of England might respond to a no-deal departure with negative interest rates to cushion the economic fallout from disruption at UK ports from 31 December. Under the policy of negative rates, Threadneedle Street would cut its base rate from a record low level of 0.1% to below zero, meaning commercial banks would need to pay interest to place deposits with the central bank. Although designed to encourage lending to the economy, experts warn it would hit banks’ profits and could undermine financial stability. Morgan Stanley said most economic forecasters had factored in some kind of free trade deal from the start of January, meaning a no-deal Brexit “would represent a genuine and negative ‘surprise’ that markets are likely underprepared for” that could cause severe turbulence. The Bank of England warned on Friday that failure to agree a deal before the end of the Brexit transition could unleash volatility in financial markets and disruption for customers of UK and EU banks. Threadneedle Street said that Britain’s biggest banks were adequately prepared to withstand any shocks that could be triggered by the end of the transition at 11pm on 31 December, when UK access to the single market and customs union expires. It said UK banks could sustain losses of £200bn while continuing to operate safely – far higher than the expected economic fallout of no-deal Brexit and the Covid crisis. “However, financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise,” the Bank warned. Publishing its regular financial stability report, the Bank said large UK firms were generally well prepared to continue making cross-border payments. However, it said there was less clarity about the progress of EU companies. “To the extent that gaps remain at the end of the transition period, they are likely to result in some disruption to both EU and UK customers and businesses.” The pound fell by about 10% after the EU referendum in 2016 and has remained low on the global currency markets since, reflecting the uncertainty for the economy over the UK’s post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU. Trevor Greetham, the head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, said much of the bad news was already factored into the currency this time around, but that sterling could still tumble by 5% in a no-deal scenario. “We are hopeful, though not confident, that a political compromise will be found to enable trade UK-EU talks to continue beyond the weekend but it would be rash to base an investment strategy on the basis of one outcome or the other. Both of the arrangements under consideration reduce the growth prospects for the UK economy,” he said."
"Forget nut roast, or boring old vegetable wellington. From so-called “veganettone” to sticky toffee pudding and even meat-free whole “no turkey” crowns, retailers and food manufacturers are pulling out all the stops to offer a dizzying range of plant-based options for the traditional Christmas spread. As research reveals that more than one in four Britons plan to eat more vegan food at Christmas this year, supermarkets are reporting strong sales of alternatives to festive staples, with some “limited edition” alternatives to the turkey centrepiece already selling out. Tesco is tempting taste buds with a record 10 plant-based “centrepieces” – up from six last year – including its new Wicked Kitchen “no turkey roast crown”, which has already sold out online. Derek Sarno, a US chef and self-proclaimed “plant pusher” hired by the supermarket as its “director of plant-based innovation” to overhaul and bolster the entire range, said: “It looks like turkey, carves like turkey and even tastes like it. It has taken us two years to bring this to market and it’s the first of its kind, and what I believe will be a game-changer for the industry. Made of wheat protein and soy, we also worked with a specialist flavour house to create a natural plant-base turkey flavouring that gives the full experience of the real thing.” According to research carried out for the Vegan Society, 26% of Britonsplan to eat more plant-based foods this Christmas, continuing the trend of eating less meat during lockdown. That reflects people paying closer attention to what they eat on health and environmental grounds, with increasing numbers adopting “flexitarian” diets – cutting down on meat and dairy while eating more plant-based foods. Waitrose says pre-orders of vegan Christmas foods are up by 700% comparedwith last year while searches on Waitrose.com for “vegan cheese” increased by 76% on the same period in 2019. Its Vegan Festive Filo Swirls are proving a popular main dish,. It is also is offering the first supermarket dairy-free vegan fondue. Charlotte McCarthy, vegan buyer at Waitrose said: “We anticipate this Christmas will be the biggest ever for vegan food. We’ve worked really hard to ensure that there is an exciting range available for our customers that is delicious, whether they follow a vegan diet or not.” The grocery chain Planet Organic has recently expanded its online business to go fully nationwide, with a new website allowing customers to shop by ‘‘lifestyle” – gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, vegetarian and vegan – with the last category enjoying highest online traffic. Shoppers have a choice of nine different Christmas hampers, three of which are specifically branded as vegan (vegan snack attack, vegan chocolate lover and ultimate vegan) and together account for more than half of all hamper sales. Within its general seasonal range the overall best-seller is veganettone; vegan panettones made using traditional sourdough starters and leavening techniques, but without butter and egg yolks. Montezuma’s dairy-free “Like no udder” chocolate bars are also flying off the shelves. Al Overton, Planet Organic’s buying director, said: “Countless Christmas vegan items are selling well, including dairy-free chocolate and cheese platters, Christmas cakes and wine; traditional items made to vegan recipes so nobody has to miss out. The seitan roast – an alternative to turkey – has recently sold out, as has the truffle and mushroom faux gras pate, but there will be more available at least a week before Christmas.” Lakeland said it had sold 65% more vegan hampers in October than last year as customers shopped earlier, and while now sold out online they are still available in store. Marks & Spencer is rolling out more than 30 new vegan foods for Christmas under its Plant Kitchen brand in its biggest festive collection to date. Its Plant Kitchen vegan festive wreath – named BBC Good Food’s best vegan main course at this year’s Christmas Taste awards – goes on sale in stores next week; a pastry main course stuffed with roasted mushrooms and chestnuts and topped with a cranberry and orange glaze. M&S said its Plant Kitchen frozen sticky toffee pudding – launched last month – was now selling three times as much as the standard dessert. Its plant-based frozen party food range now accounts for 30% of its frozen party food sales, with the top-selling line its mini “no chicken” kievs."
"Before the pandemic hit, 34-year-old Andrew Perry of New Orleans worked in bars and did live sound engineering for shows. But now, with venues closed, Perry has struggled to find another job, even at minimum wage, while his unemployment benefits have been reduced to just $90 per week. He’s worrying about losing his home. The temporary federal moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on residential evictions is set to expire on 31 December, leaving millions of Americans like Perry at risk of being evicted from their homes even as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to rise. An estimated 12.4 million individual adult renters have reported they are behind on rent payments, based on the latest US census survey data, while nearly 83 million adults have reported struggling to afford expenses for basic necessities such as rent, mortgage, food, car payments, medical expenses or student loans in the past seven days. According to Moody’s Analytics, nearly 12 million renters in the US will owe an average of $5,850 in rent and utilities by January. Perry’s landlord has already given notice they will evict him from his apartment when the CDC eviction moratorium ends. “I had to sell my car for a fraction of the asking price so I could keep the power and water on in my house. I can’t afford new clothes or shoes for winter. I’m not eating three times a day,” said Perry. “I don’t see an end to this any time soon, and with no stimulus being announced, I’m starting to wonder if I will lose everything and be homeless again, the last time after Hurricane Katrina in 2006.” The CDC moratorium on evictions is limited, and based on income eligibility and inability to pay rent. Landlords have continued to file eviction cases to be implemented once the moratorium ends and have engaged in other tactics to try to force those who are behind on rent out of their homes. “There are holes and flaws in the order, and renters are suffering because of those flaws,” said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Yentel said the moratorium is not automatic and requires tenants to take action to be eligible for protections under it, but she said the federal government has done little to inform renters or enforce the moratorium’s protections, while rental assistance programs are widely depleted or non-existent. “Rent is still due, and that rent is accruing along with utility bills and, in many cases, fees and penalties landlords are charging. That is why it is essential the eviction moratorium be paired with substantial emergency rental assistance,” Yentel added. Dess Reign of Greensboro, North Carolina, just gave birth to her second child, but is currently facing eviction, even as her landlord refused to accept payments from North Carolina’s Housing Opportunities and Prevention of Evictions (Hope) program. She lost her job as a call center representative when the pandemic hit in March, but it took until July to start receiving her first unemployment payments. When her initial unemployment benefits expired, her transition to pandemic unemployment assistance was initially denied and she’s still in the process of appealing it. Meanwhile, she hasn’t received any income since October. “This system has completely failed us,” said Reign. “Nobody cares about the people in need. Landlords don’t care about evicting families, especially people with kids, and it’s sad. I have no family here. Where would I go if I get evicted with a newborn and a two-year-old?” In St Augustine, Florida, Nicole Strunk and her husband have been in and out of court with their landlord, who managed to obtain a writ of possession on their home for 1 January, when the CDC moratorium ends. Strunk, who lost her job as a restaurant server when the pandemic hit, is still trying to obtain back pay owed to her from unemployment during the first few months of the pandemic, and recently claimed her last week of unemployment benefits that have now expired. Her husband lost his job in construction in June, and only receives $125 a week in pandemic unemployment assistance, which is set to expire on 26 December. “What we’re figuring will happen is we’ll be served with the 48 hours’ notice to surrender the property, then store our belongings if we can,” said Strunk. “Then we’ll break our hearts by giving up our pup to a shelter, where he probably has no chance of survival due to his health issues, and we’ll live in our car, which is 26 years old, until something changes. That’s what we’re facing now.” Kerrie Welch of Trenton, New Jersey, a mother of a four-year-old, lost her job in food service when the pandemic started. Her unemployment benefits pay just $231 a week now, and she hasn’t been able to find another job. She missed rent in November, and her landlord has told her he intends to file for eviction when the CDC moratorium expires. “We will be homeless as soon as the CDC moratorium expires,” Welch said, who can’t afford to give her daughter Christmas gifts this year. “I had to draw a Christmas tree on the wall. How do I explain to my daughter I had nothing – nothing – to offer? It’s terrible and no one cares.” In Wisconsin, Chris Donahoe, litigation and advocacy director of Legal Action Wisconsin, explained dozens of families have been evicted in the Milwaukee area despite the federal moratorium. “They not only face all the collateral damage, the further descent into poverty, families being separated, school districts changing, but it also means they are at significant risk of contracting Covid,” she said. A recent study published by researchers led by Dr Kathryn Leifheit at UCLA found over 10,000 deaths and as many as 433,700 coronavirus cases were caused by evictions from the beginning of the pandemic to early September, when the CDC eviction moratorium was enacted. “Without further eviction moratoriums or rental assistance, families will have no options. It will be the middle of winter, in the worst stages of this pandemic, and they will be out on the streets, with an eviction on their record,” added Donahoe."
"BDO, one of the UK’s leading accountancy firms, is refusing to pay back £4.5m in furlough money it received from taxpayers despite paying its 264 partners an average of £518,000 each. In total the company paid its partners £137m. Paul Eagland, the firm’s managing partner, said there had been a “moral debate” at the firm about whether or not to pay the money back, but that the firm believed it had a greater responsibility “to invest in jobs”. Eagland said the furlough money BDO received early on in the pandemic had helped the company save 700 people from possible redundancy. He said BDO partners had also taken a hit, as their pay had fallen from an average of £602,000 they collected a year earlier. BDO rivals Deloitte and PWC did not receive any money from the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, also known as the furlough scheme. But BDO did take advantage of the emergency funding to subsidise the pay of 450 first-year recruits and 250 administrators. BDO received £2.7m of furlough support in its financial year to June 2020, and the firm said it had received £4.7m in total. He said the firm had topped up furloughed staff’s wages to 100% and had not made anyone redundant. In a statement, Eagland said: “The government took bold action with its emergency funding measures which undoubtedly saved many jobs and businesses across the UK. We would ask the government to ensure future policies also support mid-sized businesses, which are vital to the UK but can be overlooked and undervalued despite providing around one in three UK private sector jobs.” Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “It’s pretty shameful for an organisation to take millions of pounds of public money while paying such vast sums to its senior management. “The defence that they need it to protect jobs is risible when a small sacrifice from each partner would comfortably cover the costs of repayment, and would still leave the partners earning over £500,000 a year, putting them comfortably inside the top 0.1% of UK earners.” BDO reported a £25m decline in underlying profits to £137m for the year to June. It blamed the drop in profits on the pandemic. Under the coronavirus job retention scheme the government paid 80% of furloughed staff’s wages up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. The amount paid was reduced from August, but then increased again at the time of the second national lockdown in November. The total cost of the scheme to the taxpayer was £43bn by the middle of November."
"Britain’s largest banks will be allowed to restart limited dividend payments and banker bonuses in the new year, after regulators determined that lenders were strong enough to weather the remainder of the Covid pandemic. The Bank of England said on Thursday it was lifting a temporary ban on shareholder payouts, but warned that dividends distributed for full-year 2020 should be capped, and that cash bonuses for bankers would be closely scrutinised in light of continued uncertainty. “Notwithstanding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy, banks remain well-capitalised and are expected to be able to continue to support the real economy through this period of disruption,” the central bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) said. It comes more than eight months after the central bank ordered lenders to scrap nearly £8bn worth of dividend payouts due for the 2019 financial year in light of the Covid crisis. It also ordered banks to pause dividend payments throughout 2020, and put a temporary halt on share buybacks and cash bonuses for executives. The Bank of England said it was easing the dividend ban on Thursday, after putting the banks through two separate stress tests that proved the sector was “resilient”, even in severe economic scenarios. Lenders have now been urged to limit payouts to either 25% of profits over 2019 and 2020 combined, excluding previous dividend payments, or 0.2% of the value of their riskiest assets, whichever is highest. “Expect a high bar for justifying any exceptions,” the PRA said. Banks were also warned that the regulator would be paying close attention to bonus payouts in the new year. The PRA said it expected firms to “exercise a high degree of caution and prudence in determining the size of any cash bonuses granted to senior staff given the uncertain outlook and the need for banks to deploy capital to support the wider economy”. It added: “The PRA will scrutinise proposed payouts closely to ensure large banks have applied the PRA’s rigorous remuneration regime in an appropriate fashion.” The regulator explained it was otherwise up to bank boardrooms to determine the size of dividend payments covering the 2020 financial year onwards. The announcement will be welcome news for bank shareholders, who expect regular income from dividend payments. Major lenders including NatWest and HSBC previously said they would restart payouts as soon as possible after regulators lifted the ban. Bank share prices have plunged this year in light of the Covid crisis and dividend ban. NatWest shares have tumbled 34% since the start of 2020, while Barclays lost 23%, Lloyds has dropped 44% and HSBC shares have fallen 32%. Eurozone banks are still waiting for a decision on dividend payouts from the European Central Bank, which has urged lenders to halt dividend payments and share buybacks until at least 1 January 2021.

"The UK’s largest listed financial firms have handed their board members a near-80% pay rise since 2009, prompting shareholder advisers and high pay campaigners to call for greater transparency on director fees. Data gathered by the Guardian shows median pay for the three highest earning non-executive directors (NEDs) in each of the FTSE 100’s 17 financial firms surged from £90,700 in 2009 to £162,000 in 2019. It means board members overseeing the UK’s largest banks, insurance and investment firms are earning 79% more than they did a decade earlier, despite being in part-time roles. The largest increases have been at Lloyds Banking Group, where top NEDs are earning 257% more than in 2009; the London Stock Exchange Group, where there has been a 219% rise; and investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, where fees have jumped 170%. Headhunters said the rise was partly due to strict regulations introduced after the financial crisis, which meant NEDs had to keep closer tabs on operations, and take greater responsibility when things went wrong. However, there is no precedent for UK NEDs having their pay docked for company misconduct. The insurance company Aviva is considering clawing back director pay after a row over how it announced a plan to cancel its preference shares in 2018, but blame for corporate failures has historically been laid at the feet of company executives. It is also difficult to confirm directors’ workloads beyond what is disclosed in annual reports. Data suggests the highest-paid NEDs were attending just five more committee and board meetings a year in 2019 than they did in 2009, with the median number of meetings now sitting at 26 compared with 21 a decade earlier. The busiest among them sat through 48 meetings last year. Reacting to the Guardian research, the High Pay Centre thinktank and influential shareholder adviser PIRC called for more detailed information about top earners like NEDs, whose ballooning fees have flown under the radar over the past decade. While criticism has been aimed at multimillion-pound pay packages granted to company executives in recent years, the High Pay Centre said some board members were already earning more than 99% of the UK workforce, despite committing just a fraction of the hours. “On balance, NED pay should require greater scrutiny, expecting the same rigour as executive pay and linked to demonstrable peer-group benchmarking in terms of fees, workload and meetings and items discussed,” said Francesco Navarrini, PIRC’s head of research. He said companies should consider the pay ratio between NEDs and a company’s rank-and-file employees when considering further pay rises. NEDs at financial firms could face greater pressure over fee transparency, since they are earning significantly more than their UK peers. On average, NEDs at financial firms are now earning £210,019 a year, which is more than double the average £99,139 earned by NEDs across all of the UK’s 150 largest listed firms, according to separate figures gathered by headhunter Spencer Stuart, which did not include median pay. While the median captures the middle of the range, the mean or average captures the typical figure when dividing fees equally between the entire group. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “Paying out such lucrative sums for part-time work does create a damaging public perception of directorships and the way businesses are run, and potentially attracts people to the roles for the wrong reasons.” “Pay for high earners, particularly in financial services, amounts to a significant cost for businesses, and there should probably be more detailed disclosure requirements on what companies are spending on those making six figures and upwards,” he added. Board members are usually paid a so-called base fee but earn extra money for sitting on key committees that help decide executive pay, oversee financial reporting and governance. Both have jumped over the past decade, with base fees rising by nearly 20% to £75,000 on a median basis. Committee membership earned NEDs 55% more in 2019 than a decade earlier, while chairing those committees will mean pocketing 71% more in fees. While none of the financial company NEDs from 2009 are still in their post – owing to a nine-year-limit – many serving on financial services boards have seen their fees double or triple during their tenure. Among them are HSBC’s board member Heidi Miller, who has received a 204% pay rise from £206,000 to £627,000 over four years, after she was appointed as non-executive chair of HSBC’s North American operations – earning her an extra £431,000. Meanwhile, NatWest’s Frank Dangeard has seen his pay rise 91% from £138,000 to £264,000 since 2017, having since taken over as chair of the group’s investment bank NatWest Markets. However, NatWest does not break down his fees. While a handful of NEDs included in the data do hold additional non-executive roles within their businesses like Dangeard and Miller, not all firms will disclose how much they are paid for each position, strengthening the argument for further transparency and more rigorous standards around NED fees. Jenni Hibbert, a global managing partner at executive search firm Heidrick and Struggles, said directors put in more time than is disclosed in company reports. She estimated that NEDs for complex, FTSE 100 financial firms will usually be putting in about 80 to 100 days a year, including time spent preparing for meetings and getting to know the business. “We have to remember that being a NED is a huge responsibility – the Companies Act does not differentiate between an executive and a non-executive director when it comes to fiduciary responsibilities,” Hibbert said. “An NED is therefore required to take the same level of care as an executive, and they cannot do this by just turning up to board meetings – it takes many hours of reading, investigating and getting under the skin of things, to do their job well.” But with roughly 250 working days a year, NEDs are still working part-time while earning significantly more than most employees within the business. “Many financial services firms paying six-figure sums to their NEDs will also have low-paid staff in branches, call centres or administrative roles struggling to make ends meet,” Hildyard said. “The UK should be debating what we could do more generally to achieve a more even income distribution.”"
"It is known throughout the world as a byword for security. But the Bank of England is evidently a tad unclear on the whereabouts of £50bn of banknotes, and it doesn’t seem to be overly concerned about it, a powerful group of MPs has said. In a stiff rebuke for Threadneedle Street, the Commons public accounts committee said the money – equivalent to a stack of £5 notes more than 800 miles high – had essentially gone “missing” because the Bank did not keep close enough tabs on cash usage in modern Britain. Despite walls 8ft thick and an imposing reputation for guarding billions of pounds of gold bars in its vaults, the PAC said the Bank had nonetheless displayed a “lax attitude to whereabouts of bulk of sterling cash supply”. However, banknotes by their very design are not traceable, making it hard for the Bank to follow the money and know exactly where its notes end up. According to a report from the National Audit Office, there are about £50bn worth of issued banknotes that may be being used overseas or in the UK, a tiny fraction of the trillions of pounds in money circulating in the UK economy in physical notes and by digital transfers. The PAC speculated that this money could be stashed away under mattresses as unreported household savings, may have been taken abroad, or used in the shadow economy. “The Bank of England doesn’t know,” it said. The value of banknotes in circulation has shot up this year, which the Bank has said is probably because more people started hoarding cash during the Covid-19 pandemic in case they needed it. Coin use has declined over recent years, with the production of new pennies and pounds by the Royal Mint falling by about 65% in the last decade, a trend that could be accelerated by the pandemic as more people move to using contactless debit card payments. Meg Hillier, the chair of the PAC, said: “£50bn of sterling notes – or about three-quarters of this precious and dwindling supply – is stashed somewhere but the Bank of England doesn’t know where, who by, or what for, and doesn’t seem very curious. “It needs to be more concerned about where the missing £50bn is. Depending where it is and what it’s being used for, that amount of money could have material implications for public policy and the public purse. The Bank needs to get a better handle on the national currency it controls.” A spokesman for the Bank said: “It is the responsibility of the Bank of England to meet public demand for banknotes. The Bank has always met that demand and will continue to do so. Members of the public do not have to explain to the Bank why they wish to hold banknotes. This means that banknotes are not missing.”"

"Lloyds Banking Group is redeploying 700 staff into full-time homeworking roles from 2021, in the latest sign that big banks are embracing remote working even as vaccines put the end of Covid restrictions in sight. The UK’s largest domestic lender – which has 50,000 of its 65,000 employees working from home because of the outbreak – temporarily shifted about 1,000 workers from Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland branches to customer service teams, in order to cope with a surge in demand in areas such as telephone banking and video chats during the outbreak. The Guardian understands about 700 staff will be permanently moved, making it the largest tranche of Lloyds workers to ever be shifted into homeworking roles full-time. “All colleagues will need to be able to work from home for the customer services role,” Lloyds documents explained. Staff may still be asked to travel into an office for special events or occasional team meetings, including with their remotely based line managers. However, the bank warned: “Your eligibility to meet the criteria needed to work from home will need to be met on an ongoing basis, please consider this carefully when making your preference.” Lloyds documents said it presented “opportunities for colleagues to help better manage their work-life balance.” It also means staff will not have to live near one of Lloyds’ call centres in cities including Leeds, Liverpool or Belfast, in order to apply for any of the roles. Lloyds is among the 75% of City firms reviewing their real estate footprint after the boom in homeworking during the pandemic. Barclays also confirmed this summer that it was reviewing the amount of office space it uses after seeing how 30,000 of its 50,000 UK staff had been able to work from home effectively during the crisis. NatWest has told employees that 50,000 of its roughly 60,000 staff will continue working from home until at least April, when it plans to allow for more flexible working. In the meantime, the bank is developing an app that will allow whole teams to book seating when they want to come into the office – rather than dedicating entire floors to certain divisions. The London-headquartered lender Standard Chartered is also shifting to flexible working on a permanent basis. It followed a pan-bank review of all jobs that showed 80% across the business are suitable for “hybrid” working. Staff will be able to formally apply for their preferred way of working, starting in early 2021. That will apply to its 2,000 staff in London – where about 10% of staff have been going into the office since the coronavirus hit. Some big banks such as JP Morgan – which has 19,000 employees in the UK – have raised concerns about the impact of homeworking, including the lack of mentoring for young staff, and a small drop in productivity on Mondays and Fridays. However, the Wall Street lender is still expecting up to 30% of its almost 257,000 global employees to work remotely in future, at least part of the time. One of the Lloyds Banking Group’s staff unions, Accord, welcomed plans to redeploy branch staff to homeworking customer service roles, saying it would help save jobs. Lloyds has announced about 2,000 staff cuts since September as part of its restructuring programme. “Working from home in the long term isn’t suitable for everybody but we’ll work to ensure that there are support services in place to help everybody to make a success of this positive initiative,” Accord said. It is understood that some of those staff may eventually be allowed to work from the office part-time, depending on their circumstances and how government guidance evolves in the long term. A Lloyds spokesperson said it was shifting staff in response to customer behaviour. “We are asking our branch colleagues if they would like to make a move from their branch role to one in our customer services teams. This means we can have the right amount of support in the areas our customers want it.”"
"Gyms, crazy golf, student flats, hotels or even a whisky-based tourist attraction: the future of many department store sites is unlikely to involve shopping. More than 200 of them are now empty or closing next year, and property experts say the shift will prompt a reinvention of malls and town centres on a scale not seen since the postwar years. Last week’s decision to wind down Debenhams is likely to see the closure of 124 stores – or just over a million square metres of retail floor space – in England and Wales. That’s the equivalent of 148 Premier League football pitches seeking a new purpose, according to property advisory firm Altus Group. Before the latest closures, Debenhams had already shut more than 40 stores in the past two years. Meanwhile, at least 11 House of Fraser sites have closed since August 2018, and more are expected to bring down the shutters next year. John Lewis has also recently closed eight outlets: half of these were full-scale department stores and are now standing empty. That, in turn, followed the collapse of the Beales chain, which left its 22 stores vacant. Only one has since reopened. “This is apocalyptic. We are going to see the biggest change in urban grain [the pattern of streets] since the second world war,” said Mark Robinson, chair of the government-backed High Streets Task Force. “Department stores have supported the footfall that drives people through the doors. We are going to have to evolve a whole new way of looking at the purpose of towns and centres,” said Robinson. There will be no single solution. What works in Hull will not suit High Wycombe. “Putting a chi-chi food market like Altrincham’s in every department store is not the answer,” said Robinson. “Public consultation is key. You have to look for the answer within places and take local communities with you.” A look at what happened to BHS’s 164-strong chain, which collapsed in 2016, highlights the scale of the challenge. Four years after its demise, just over a quarter of former BHS stores remain empty, according to analysis by the Local Data Company. Less than half continue to trade as large stores and the remaining 30% have been redeveloped – either by demolishing or completely rebuilding the interior, splitting them into smaller stores or merging them into neighbouring buildings. Primark took on about five stores, B&M and Sports Direct took on three each, while others now house TK Maxx, Metro Bank or H&M. In 2020, there are likely to be few retail takers for large stores. Chains such as Marks & Spencer and Next are also closing outlets, while Primark has largely completed its UK estate. Some department stores will switch to leisure use, such as cinemas. The former BHS on Oxford Street, for example, has been split into a Swingers golf centre, a food hall and the UK’s first outlet for Reserved, a Polish fashion brand. In Reading, Hammerson has won planning permission to turn a House of Fraser outlet into a food hall, bowling alley and crazy golf course. Edinburgh’s House of Fraser on Princes Street is being developed by drinks firm Diageo into a tourist attraction promoting Johnnie Walker whisky. Several other House of Fraser outlets, including those in Birmingham, Lincoln and Exeter, are set to become hotels alongside shops and offices, as is Debenhams in Manchester. West London’s Westfield shopping centre has permission to turn two-thirds of a House of Fraser into a co-working space, while at least one department store in Bristol may become student accommodation. Elsewhere, local authorities may play a more central role in reinventing the space for civic amenities such as health centres, nursery schools or libraries, if the cash can be found. In Folkestone, one option for the former Debenhams site, which has been bought by the local authority, is a mix of retirement homes and a healthcare centre alongside leisure facilities such as a cinema. Another part of the jigsaw will be homes. Where once they were citadels of shopping, out-of-town malls are now looking to reinvent themselves as new towns, with homes alongside retail and other services. At Lakeside in Thurrock, Essex, there is a plan to create more than 1,000 homes. Some authorities see an opportunity to use similar ideas to bring people back into city centres hit hard by the pandemic. David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisory firm Colliers, thinks that the landlords of three-quarters of Debenhams’ current sites will already have a plan for the future that may involve a mix of smaller stores and other uses. But some older stores may be harder to reinvent. The cost of stripping out asbestos is prohibitively expensive, and holds up refits or even demolition. For some, the answer could even be goingback to nature. In Stockton-on-Tees, the local authority is set to turn a moribund 1970s local shopping centre into a park, and a similar plan is now being floated in Nottingham."
"Ryanair has ordered a further 75 Boeing 737 Max planes worth up to $9bn (£6.7bn), defying aviation industry pessimism over coronavirus and concerns that the public may avoid the model due to safety fears. Europe’s biggest short-haul airline has now ordered a total of 210 of the aircraft that its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has described as a “gamechanger” for the carrier’s business model. The airline is likely to have negotiated a substantial saving on the planes. O’Leary said he obtained a “modest discount” on the fleet, as well as compensation for the delay in delivering the original order of the 737 Max, which was grounded after two crashes caused by its automated systems killed a total of 346 people. First deliveries of Ryanair’s 737-8-200 Max variant are expected in the spring, and O’Leary said he hoped to have up to 30 of the planes in service in time for the summer 2021 peak season. Speaking as the contract was formally signed in Washington DC, he said the Max was the “most scrutinised and audited aircraft in history”. He said the European regulator, Easa, had done an extraordinary review of all aspects of flight control systems, and all Ryanair pilots would have mandatory training on three Max simulators the airline had already bought and installed. “I cannot tell you how confident we are in the safety … Passengers are going to love it.” He dismissed the suggestion that many would avoid it on safety grounds, adding: “Any customer who doesn’t want to fly on the Max can offload and fly on the next NG, no problem.” The 737NG is an earlier variant of the aircraft that the airline operates. O’Leary said the Max was quieter, 16% more fuel efficient, and had more legroom than the current fleet, despite incorporating more seats per plane. “This aircraft is going to transform Ryanair’s future … our passengers will be travelling with lower fares and in more comfort. We believe the combination of vaccines and these new planes will lead us back into a period of growth.” Traffic has slumped since the pandemic but O’Leary forecast customer numbers would surpass the 149 million from 2019 by 2022, rising to 200 million customers annually by 2026. Ryanair’s order is the largest for the Max since 2018, before the disasters in Indonesia and Ethiopia resulted in the plane being withdrawn from service worldwide. IAG, the owner of British Airways, also made a public show of faith in the Max last year with a “letter of intent” to buy up to 200 of the model, at a substantial discount. The US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, certified the Max last month as safe to fly and other regulators around the world are expected to allow the plane back in the skies soon. Dave Calhoun, the president and chief executive of Boeing, said it was “gratified that Ryanair is once again placing its confidence in the Boeing 737 family”, and that it was focused on delivering delayed plane orders to the airline and others in the new year. He said: “We firmly believe in this airplane and we will continue the work to re-earn the trust of all of our customers.” Calhoun said it had been “one rough year” for the US aircraft manufacturer, but it had worked with regulators to “dot every i and cross every t” in examining the 737 Max, and was “utterly confident in the product”. The plane has been redesigned after investigators pointed to problems with sensors and the anti-stall software known as MCAS as causes of the Lion Air crash in October 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March 2019."
"Hopes that the world will bounce back from the ravages of coronavirus in the new year have been buoyed by strong growth in output from Asia’s huge manufacturing centres, led by an accelerating post-pandemic boom in China. China’s factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in a decade in November, a closely watched survey showed on Tuesday, in the latest sign that the world’s second-largest economy is recovering to pre-pandemic levels. China’s Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 54.9 from October’s 53.6, marking the highest level since November 2010. The gauge stayed well above the 50-level – which separates growth from contraction – for the seventh consecutive month. A steady recovery in global demand also helped Japan’s factory activity move a notch closer to stabilisation in November, while in South Korea the same metric grew at the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI hit 49.0 in November, up from the previous month’s 48.7, and South Korea’s IHS Markit PMI rose to 52.9 in November.Factory activity also grew in Taiwan and Indonesia, a sign the pick-up in Chinese demand was underpinning the region’s economy. The strong showing of the region’s factories, allied to widespread optimism about the potential positive impact of Covid-19 vaccination programs in developed countries, also helped to boost stock markets fresh from the best November for 19 years. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.26% on Tuesday after closing the month 9% higher. Japan’s Nikkei was 0.9% higher on Tuesday while the Kospi index was up 1.4% in Seoul. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.72% higher on Tuesday, In Australia, the central bank held rates at near-zero amid signs the country’s easy monetary and fiscal policies have helped it weather the pandemic. Figures released on Tuesday showed that house prices, one of Australia’s favourite economic indicators, have begun to rise again, bringing the promise of greater consumer confidence and more building work. The benchmark ASX200 index was up more than 1%. “We’ve seen clearly a huge wave of liquidity coming to equities in response to the vaccine news and in response to US election news,” said Hamish Tadgell, a portfolio manager at SG Hiscock & Company. “But there are still risks, and as a result we could see the market pull back, I think, particularly as we come into sort of the Christmas period.” Capital Economics said that the boom in China could fade a little in the coming months, but it was expected that the government in Beijing would continue to offer plenty of policy stimulus while strong global demand for Chinese-made consumer goods also provided a good impetus. “In the near term, we think supportive fiscal policy and strong foreign demand should keep industrial growth robust,” said China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard in a note on Tuesday. “The economy is likely to remain above-trend in the coming months. Although Wall Street closed weaker on Monday as investors cashed in their November gains, the S&P500 looks set to start Tuesday up by 0.8%. In London the FTSE100 is expected to open up 0.56% at the bell after its best month since 1989. “There was profit taking around the world so we ended a record month with a whimper not a bang, and you know, taking a little bit of a breather,” said Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick. “I think that markets are pricing in, if not fully pricing a recovery, they are pricing in the vast majority of it [and] it’s very hard to meet these elevated expectations.” The US dollar was under pressure on Tuesday, after closing out its worst month since July with a little bounce and as investors anticipated that the US Federal Reserve would have to produce yet more monetary easing. Oil prices were slightly lower on uncertainty about whether the world’s major oil producers would agree to extend deep output cuts at talks this week. Brent crude futures were largely unchanged at $47.86."
"Britain’s manufacturers have enjoyed their best month in almost three years as firms cranked up production in case knife-edge Brexit trade talks with the EU ended in failure. The latest survey from IHS Markit/Cips found the industry was unaffected by November’s four-week lockdown in England, with output at its highest since December 2017. While large chunks of consumer-facing sectors of the economy were shut or heavily restricted last month, the latest purchasing managers’ index showed a strengthening of the manufacturing sector as factories stayed open. The final PMI rose from 53.7 points to 55.6 points in November and was higher than the flash estimate of 55.2 points published last month. It has now been above the 50 level indicating that the sector is growing for six months. Yet with only a month to go before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union, the report said many firms were seeking to insure themselves against a no-deal outcome by stockpiling raw materials and bringing forward export orders. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “Growth of the UK manufacturing sector picked up in November, temporarily boosted by ‘Brexit-buying’ among clients and the ongoing boost from economies reopening following lockdowns earlier in the year.” Dobson added that the boost to manufacturing had been concentrated among firms supplying other companies and from investment goods. Production of consumer goods had been weak due to low levels of confidence and rising unemployment.  “Whether the upturn of manufacturing production can be sustained into the new year is therefore highly uncertain, especially once the temporary boosts from Brexit purchasing and stockbuilding wane,” Dobson added. Fhaheen Khan, a senior economist at the manufacturers’ group Make UK, said the survey pointed to a continued, yet subdued expansion of the sector as orders slowly returned following the easing of restrictions. “It also appears the alarm bells that took hold of manufacturers just before the first EU-exit deadline have returned in some capacity as businesses sought to stockpile. While it may be rational in today’s uncertain environment, it is creating the impression that manufacturing is performing well just before the transition period ends. “It is clear the uncertainty is felt by both sides as EU manufacturers are also stockpiling to some degree resulting in a short-term boost to business for UK manufacturers too. However, such actions are generally followed by a period of depressed activity as manufacturers begin to service future orders using these very stockpiles.”"
"The outgoing boss of Lloyds Banking Group is taking over as chairman at Credit Suisse, where he will deal with the fallout of the Swiss lender’s spying scandal. Credit Suisse announced on Tuesday it had chosen António Horta-Osório to replace chairman Urs Rohner, who promised to step down earlier this year after the bank ousted ex-chief executive Tidjane Thiam after the corporate espionage row. The 56-year-old Portuguese banker, who will take over in May, will face the challenge of boosting Credit Suisse’s image following the scandal, which has sent shockwaves through the country’s secretive banking industry and is being investigated by Swiss regulators. Credit Suisse admitted to hiring private detectives to track two of its executives last year. While it blamed – and sacked – its former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouée over both incidents, lawyers hired by Credit Suisse have reportedly uncovered two previous incidents in which the bank separately had staff followed in Asia and New York in 2017 and 2018. Credit Suisse said it does not condone spying on staff. “Due to the ongoing enforcement proceedings by [Swiss regulator] Finma, with which Credit Suisse has been cooperating since the beginning, we are not commenting further on the matter at this time.” Thiam’s ousting has also raised concerns about alleged discrimination in the Swiss banking sector. In one incident, Thiam, who was the only black boss of a big global bank, reportedly walked out of Rohner’s Studio 54-themed birthday party last November when a black performer dressed as a janitor danced on stage. Rohner’s friends also performed a number, all of them wearing afro wigs. Credit Suisse later apologised for “any offence caused”. Horta-Osório will leave behind a separate scandal at Lloyds Banking Group, which is still dealing with a compensation programme linked to a £245m loan scam at the HBOS Reading branch that pre-dated his appointment in 2011. Six people were jailed in 2017 over the scam. Lloyds – which rescued HBOS from collapse in and subsequently took a £20.3bn state bailout in 2008– is also awaiting the results of an an inquiry into issues including whether Lloyds tried to cover up the scandal. Horta-Osório also had to handle the aftermath of the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which cost Lloyds around £22bn. However, Horta-Osório has gained accolades for returning the bank to profit and private ownership during this near-decade-long tenure at Lloyds, which is the UK’s largest domestic lender. Lloyds could temporarily be led by its finance chief William Chalmers until Horta-Osório’s replacement – incoming chief executive Charlie Nunn – completes his notice period and garden leave at rival HSBC. Credit Suisse has not disclosed the size of Horta-Osorio’s pay packet, but is expected to reveal the terms of his contract by the end of April when the bank holds its annual shareholder meeting. Horta-Osório – who was the UK’s highest-paid banker until earlier this year – earned £4.7m in 2019. However, he could take a pay cut at Credit Suisse, which paid its outgoing chairman 4.7m Swiss francs (£3.9m), including 1.5m Swiss francs worth of shares, last year."
"The UK’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will lag behind every other major economy apart from Argentina, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Warning the UK and other countries to resist cutting government spending in order to ensure a stronger rebound, the club of 37 rich nations said severe risks to growth and jobs still remained despite the prospect of a vaccine being deployed earlier than first anticipated. In its latest economic outlook report, the Paris-based organisation said it expected the UK economy to contract by 11.2% this year, compared with the 10.1% fall in GDP it was forecasting in September. The OECD also sharply downgraded its forecasts for UK growth next year, to 4.2% from 7.6% three months ago. It said world GDP was on track to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year fuelled by the rollout of vaccines and strong growth in China. However, it warned the UK economy would still be 6% smaller compared with its late-2019 position at that stage. Only Argentina fared worse among 20 nations and the eurozone. In an assessment of the UK that warned the country was at a “critical juncture”, the OECD said there was a double threat to growth from the second Covid wave and Brexit, with less than a month before the EU transition period expires at the end of December. Urging both sides to reach an agreement, it said a deal was essential for economic prosperity, and that failure was among the large downside risks to its forecasts. “The failure to conclude a trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 would entail serious additional economic disturbances in the short term and have a strongly negative effect on trade, productivity and jobs in the longer term,” it said. Against a backdrop of heavy government borrowing to assuage the economic impact of the pandemic, the OECD said nations needed to continue to make use of record-low borrowing costs to spend on protecting businesses and households. This would help pave the way for faster and more sustainable growth in future, the organisation added. In a clear warning to nations contemplating spending cuts or tax rises, including the UK, the OECD said there was a risk that the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis would be forgotten – when government austerity drives choked-off growth and entrenched inequality. It comes after the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, used his spending review to impose a pay freeze on public sector workers outside the NHS and slashed the overseas aid budget to tackle record levels of government borrowing this year. Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the OECD, said: “We made the mistake in 2010; we need to learn from the mistake. We need to keep up the support for the people and those in and out of jobs. We must make sure income is supported.” Urging governments to continue spending while awaiting a vaccine, she added: “When you’re in a battle and you know the cavalry is coming, you don’t stop fighting. In fact you keep fighting until the cavalry is around. In fact you keep fighting while the cavalry is there.” Updating its forecasts from previous estimates made in September, the OECD said the global economy was now set to shrink by 4.2% this year, slightly below a previous forecast of 4.5%, before rebounding by 4.5% next year as vaccines are deployed around the world. However, it said the second wave of the pandemic continuing into the start of 2021, before immunisation programmes could get under way, meant its forecast for next year was below its September estimate for 5% growth. Angel Gurría, the secretary general of the OECD, said: “For the first time since the pandemic hit in early 2020, we have hope. The good news about vaccines has instilled a degree of optimism and somehow dissipated the fog of uncertainty that has covered us all. “There is hope but we’re not out of the woods yet.”"
"JD Sports is set to pull out of talks over a rescue deal for Debenhams on Tuesday, putting thousands of jobs at risk at the struggling department store group. Last-ditch negotiations to secure a deal were continuing but the news on Monday night that Debenhams’ major supplier Arcadia had collapsed into administration, as well as uncertainty about conditions on the high street and negative reaction from shareholders, are thought to have cooled JD’s interest. A near 6% rise in JD’s share price on Monday amid speculation that it might be backing away from Debenhams was one major influence on the group’s management team led by Peter Cowgill, the executive chairman. The rebound came after millions of pounds were wiped off the company’s value last week when it emerged it was considering buying Debenhams. Debenhams, which employs about 12,000 people, has been considering a potential sale since the summer after it went into administration in April for the second time in a year. JD is thought to have been mainly interested in the Debenhams website but analysts said it was hoped it could take on almost half the group’s 124 outlets. The group saw a chance to move into a broader market and sell homewares, beauty products and smarter clothing to its existing customers. If JD does pull out of rescue talks, the only remaining suitor likely to take on a significant number of stores is Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group. Ashley has made no secret of his interest in the ailing department store despite seeing a £150m stake he built up in the then-listed company wiped out last year in a debt restructuring deal with the department store’s lenders. Frasers could save costs for the department store group by merging it with its House of Fraser chain. However, Ashley’s offers for the business have so far not exceeded half of the £300m hoped for by its owners. Other potentially interested parties, including the online specialist The Hut Group, which is understood to have been interested in just the website, and India’s Reliance Retail, appear to have melted away. Other retailers may be interested in Debenhams brands including Maine and Mantaray, or some of its prime sites. Restructuring firm Hilco has been lined up to sell off stock and other assets if no buyer can be found. Debenhams’ current owners are not expected to hold on to the group. Debenhams and JD Sports declined to comment."
"US rating agency S&P Global is to buy London-based market data and research company IHS Markit in an all-stock deal worth $44bn (£33bn) that will be the biggest corporate acquisition of 2020. The deal, which IHS Markit’s chief executive, Lance Uggla, told employees in a memo had been in the works for the last few months, will create a heavyweight in the increasingly competitive market in financial information. It highlights the growing importance of big data in financial markets governed by information-hungry trading algorithms. It is expected to close in the second half of 2021 if it can pass reviews by antitrust regulators who have been showing increasing interest in the sector. “The next steps will be to receive regulatory approvals both in the US and the EU, which we expect to take between six to nine months, and receive approval by our respective shareholders,” Uggla said in the internal memo. S&P Global is best known for providing debt ratings to countries and companies, as well as data on capital and commodity markets worldwide. It became a standalone business in 2011 when its then parent McGraw-Hill separated S&P from its education business. IHS Markit was formed in 2016 when US company IHS, whose businesses include data on automotive and technology industries, bought British rival Markit for around $6bn. Markit, founded by former credit trader Uggla, provides a range of pricing and reference data for financial assets and derivatives. IHS Markit has a market value of about $36.88bn based on the stock’s last close on Friday, according to a Reuters calculation, with its share price up around 22% so far this year. As part of the deal, which includes $4.8bn of debt, each share of IHS Markit will be exchanged for a ratio of 0.2838 shares of S&P Global stock, the two companies said. S&P Global shareholders will own roughly 67.75% of the combined company and the rest will be held by IHS Markit shareholders. Douglas Peterson, chief executive of S&P Global, will lead the combined firm, while Uggla will be a special adviser for a year after the deal closes. Global merger and acquisition activity touched a record high in three months to the end of September, with more than $1tn worth of transactions, mostly focused on coronavirus-resilient sectors such as technology and healthcare, according to Refinitiv data. The London Stock Exchange is in the final stage of trying to win clearance for its planned $27bn acquisition of Refinitiv, which has been through a long review process by the European Union’s competition commissioner."
"A historic shipbuilding yard in north Devon is to reopen after it was bought by the natural gas storage company InfraStrata in a £7m deal on Tuesday. The Appledore Shipyard, in Bideford, closed in March 2019 after its owners, Babcock, said its future was not secure, despite the offer of a £60m Ministry of Defence contract. InfraStrata, which also owns Belfast’s Harland & Wolff (H&W), said the Appledore yard’s ability to cater for smaller vessels was “a market segment that cannot be ignored”. Boris Johnson visited the site on Tuesday and said ithad a “massive history but it’s also got a great future”. “What we want to do is to ensure that there’s a good enough stream of contracts coming through to drive jobs and growth here in Devon,” he said. Unions welcomed the deal and urged the government to give the yard, which will be renamed H&W (Appledore), more orders. InfraStrata said while the yard had been dormant in recent months and the acquisition came with only one employee – the site manager – the workforce could be “very quickly ramped up” if contracts for work were secured. Discussions were under way with the government and private vessel owners, InfraStrata said. John Wood, the company’s chief executive, said: “The acquisition at this point in time is opportunistic for the company and one that should not be missed. It not only gives us a strategic foothold in mainland UK but also makes the overall business highly competitive in the smaller and higher ends of the shipyard market, respectively.” The Appledore Shipyard dates back to 1865, and has built more than 300 vessels, including some of the Royal Navy’s latest aircraft carriers.Ian Waddell, the general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: “The prospect of Appledore being reopened is great news for British shipbuilding and we welcome its purchase by InfraStrata. “Appledore played a vital role making the complex bows for the aircraft carrier and it could play a similar role building the future solid support ship which the government must build in Britain in order to invest in our regional economies and get the economy back up and running.” The GMB’s union regional organiser, Matt Roberts, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the confirmation that the yard will reopen. We have always firmly believed that the yard can be viable and thrive in the right hands.”"
"Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19 gathered pace in the past month, fuelled by consumer spending and people taking advantage of the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme, despite fears mounting over rapid growth in unemployment. On the Guardian’s latest monthly tracker of economic news since the pandemic spread to Britain this spring, the release of pent-up demand with the easing of lockdown is driving the sharpest rebound in economic growth among the G7 advanced economies, while retail spending has returned to pre-crisis levels. However, after the country plunged into the deepest recession on record in the three months to June, companies have started making job cuts at a faster pace than during the 2008 global financial crisis, with hundreds of thousands of redundancies announced in the past few weeks alone. Sounding the alarm as the UK government prepares to remove its furlough job retention scheme this autumn, Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, warned that continued support would be required to avert a jobs catastrophe and long-term damage to the economy. Writing in the Guardian, she said: “Without urgent action we face the prospect of mass unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1980s.” Issuing an appeal to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, she said: “There is still time to stop mass unemployment. We worked together once before as this crisis began: I will work with you again if you are serious at stemming the haemorrhage of jobs.” The Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, the Covid Crisis watch will also monitor how the UK is faring compared with other countries. In the past month, private sector business activity has risen at the fastest pace in seven years as companies race to catch up on work put on hold during lockdown. The increase in demand for services and manufactured goods, which followed the easing of restrictions during the summer, sent the IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index to 60.3 in August, up from 57 in July. On a scale where a figure above 50 indicates expansion, the latest figures suggest the UK is recovering faster than the US, China and the eurozone. The recovery comes after Britain was officially confirmed to be in the deepest recession since modern records began in the 1950s, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling by 20.4% in the second quarter. In the deepest decline of any nation in the G7 and the EU, the slump was worsened by the later launch of lockdown and prolonged use of controls to limit the spread of the virus. In a reflection of the deeper downturn for Britain, non-essential shops were closed for just 50 days in Germany, compared with 84 days in the UK. Retail sales jumped above pre-pandemic levels in July during the first full month since the relaxation of restrictions, as shoppers gradually returned to the high street. The hospitality sector also received a shot in the arm from the “eat out to help out” scheme, with a Monday-to-Wednesday boom at restaurants, pubs and cafes in August. More than 64m discounted meals – the equivalent of one for almost every person in Britain – have been claimed by venues taking part in the scheme so far. However, significant pressure remains for firms, threatening a sharp increase in unemployment this autumn. Online spending remains higher than before the crisis struck, footfall remains down in several big cities amid the continued absence of office workers, and demand remains weak in certain sectors more reliant on social interaction or travel, such as entertainment, aviation and tourism. Millions of workers have been brought back from furlough as firms gradually reopen with physical distancing measures in place, with the total number of people on the government’s wage subsidy scheme down from a peak of about 9 million in May to about 4.5 million at the start of August. However, more than half of the workforce in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry remains furloughed, compared with only 13% still away from work for the economy as a whole, according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite the government scheme protecting millions of jobs, official figures show almost three-quarters of a million jobs have been shed from company payrolls since March. Economists say unemployment is set to more than double as the government rolls back the furlough scheme this autumn and as firms cut their costs amid weaker levels of demand while Covid-19 remains a risk to health. Warning that the crisis is far from over, O’Grady said employers would need continued government support to protect jobs and create new ones as the risks from the pandemic gradually recede. “Mass unemployment is not inevitable. If the government acts fast to keep people in work, our economy will recover faster and our country can build back better,” she said."
"The house always wins, even in the midst of a pandemic. In the early days of lockdown, as the stock market lurched into stomach-churning freefall, the share prices of Britain’s gambling powerhouses also tanked. The cancellation of sports events cut off the steady revenue stream that many had come to enjoy, not just from horse racing but, increasingly, from football betting, which typically involves small stakes but extremely high volumes. With no certainty over the return of sport – and of the football cash cow in particular – the immediate future looked bleak. Since then, two things have happened. First, football has returned – behind closed doors – and the fixture calendar boffins are making up for lost time by scheduling games more or less every day, with more of them televised than ever before. Second, firms with a strong offering in areas such as online poker and casino games have enjoyed a significant uptick in website traffic, as the boredom of lockdown helped spur new account sign-ups. On Thursday, the world’s largest online gambling firm, Flutter Entertainment, will update the market on its performance in the six months to the end of June. Flutter – the owner of Paddy Power Betfair – has been one of the most resilient performers in the sector, thanks to its scale and diversification in both geography and the products it can boast since its $6bn mega-merger with Canada’s The Stars Group, which includes Sky Betting and Gaming. While some UK rivals such as William Hill still rely all too heavily on UK sports betting customers, Flutter has an array of impressive arrows in its quiver. The deal with Stars saw it acquire PokerStars, one of the leading global brands, as well as a sizable presence in Australia and an improved casino range. This, according to Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, made Flutter one of the firms “best-suited to helping or entertaining the UK’s population while it was under lockdown”. Flutter also owns FanDuel, a fantasy sports betting site used by more than 8 million sports fans in the rapidly expanding, newly liberalised US market in which Flutter – like every British gambling company – is trying to establish a beachhead. “Covid-19 will probably result in a faster rate of US sports betting legalisation, potentially followed by online casino legalisation, in our view,” say analysts at Jefferies. All of this helps explain why Flutter Entertainment is valued at more than 40% more now than it was at the start of March, while rivals GVC (owner of Ladbrokes Coral) and William Hill have struggled to make up the ground they lost during lockdown. Industry insiders say management at Flutter have also put in a more impressive performance than their rivals, particularly after GVC’s veteran boss, Kenny Alexander, announced his intention to step down. Any signs in Thursday’s numbers of a stronger-than-expected recovery in sports betting could provide a further shot in the arm, not just for Flutter but for some of its more sport-focused peers, too. And yet not all is rosy in the gambling garden, and 2020 could prove to be one of the most important years in the history of the UK industry, a sector which is genuinely world-leading. So far, firms including Flutter and casino-focused rivals such as 888 have navigated the choppy waters of the pandemic adroitly. But this year will also see the government kick off its review of the 2005 Gambling Act, the legislation introduced by Tony Blair’s government that gave Britain one of the most liberal gambling markets in the world, and created the industry we see today. There is a broad cross-party consensus that the regulatory pendulum must now swing back in the other direction. If that happens, as with the pandemic, Flutter’s size and diversification will serve it well. But it will also make the stakes for its US expansion much higher, and with no shortage of competition for American punters, that is going to be a fierce battle. Flutter – and the broader industry – have ridden out the coronavirus pretty well but the real dangers still lie ahead."
"Nothing like the recovery in the US stock market has ever been seen before. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the time it took for shares to regain their previous peak was measured in decades. After the global financial crisis of 2008, it was measured in years. This time it has taken less than five months – from a low on 23 March – for the S&P 500 to regain all its lost ground and hit a new high. At the time, not even the most bullish trader would have been bet on such a rapid recovery, but five factors explain the remarkable turnaround. Even while the market was crashing in early March, America’s central bank was acting to reassure investors that it would go to any lengths to support the world’s biggest economy and prevent a financial crisis. As in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Fed moved swiftly: it cut interest rates to zero; it promised to pump $5 trillion into the troubled money markets; it created lending programmes to help the cash flow of US businesses big and small; it bought corporate bonds; and it has given the impression that it may buy stocks as well. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global, says the rally on Wall Street and the recent fall in the US dollar are “being driven primarily by central bank policies of adding unprecedented liquidity to markets through renewed quantitative easing and ultra-low rates.” The lockdown has been disastrous for some sectors, notably hospitality and airlines, but people stuck at home have been spending more time online, shopping, watching, socialising and working. That has been good news for the five big US tech giants – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix. Dhaval Joshi, analyst at BCA research, says the S&P 500 should be renamed the S&P 5 because it is now so dominated by a handful of companies. Likewise, about 10 stocks – mostly in finance and energy – drive the UK’s FTSE 100. “A crucial defining feature of a stock market,” Joshi says, “turns out to be its exposure to healthcare and technology – whose profits are in major structural uptrends – versus its exposure to financials and energy, where profits are in major structural downtrends. He points out that healthcare and technology businesses account for 40% of the total value of the US stock market, compared with 12% for the UK. The US economy contracted by almost 10% in the second quarter of 2020, but on Wall Street that is now ancient history. What matters is that activity is picking up and unemployment is coming down, albeit in fits and starts – as shown last week, when new unemployment claims rose back above 1 million. Traditionally, Wall Street looks beyond the short term and anticipates that a company’s earnings – on which its stock market valuation ultimately depends – will recover. However, some investors, including Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund, say this is risky at a time when Covid-19 is not beaten. Trond Grande, the fund’s deputy chief executive, said markets did not reflect the real economic impact of the virus, which was not under control “in any shape or form”. The devastating economic impact of Covid-19 has meant a worldwide race to find a vaccine. Normally this takes years, but there are hopeful signs – including from researchers at Oxford University – that the process could be speeded up. Wall Street has proved highly sensitive to reports of a possible breakthrough, from either US biotech companies such as Gilead or foreign rivals. But even on the most optimistic assumption, a vaccine will not be widely available until 2021 at the earliest, and the chances of failure are high. But for the past few months, vaccine optimism has helped boost not just pharma shares but Wall Street stocks generally. In the early stages of the pandemic, investors dumped shares and parked their money in traditional safe havens such as cash and US treasury bonds. But the actions of the Fed and other central banks have made these options less attractive. Interest rates for savers are barely above zero, and in some countries the interest rates (yields) on government bonds have turned negative, which means investors have to pay the state for the privilege of putting their money in a safe asset. For investors who believe shares are overvalued, there is gold, whose price has risen by almost $400 an ounce in the past six months. 2008 After Lehman Brothers collapsed, banks the world over stopped lending amid panic over losses on speculative investments, and were saved from collapse by massive governments bailouts. From spring 2008, in the deepest recession since the war, GDP fell by 6% over five quarters. Growth returned in late 2009, but unemployment hit 8.5% in 2011. What happened to stock markets? The FTSE 100 suffered its worst ever calendar year in 2008, plunging by 31% as the global banking system went into meltdown. It took until 2013 for it to regain its pre-crisis high. Early 1990s recession The classic example of boom and bust came in the early 1990s as Britain lurched into recession after stellar economic growth in the late 1980s. GDP fell by 1.9% for five consecutive quarters before a return to growth in the fourth quarter of 1991 and unemployment peaked at 10.7% in December 1992. What happened to stock markets? The FTSE 100 lost 20% from January to September 1990 but the market rallied through 1991, rising by 16%. 1970s oil shock Oil prices rocketed fourfold as Arab states embargoed crude exports to the US, UK and other nations after the Yom Kippur war. This and other problems for Britain led to the three-day week in early 1974. The economy shrank 4% between autumn 1973 and spring 1974, then fell into a double-dip recession in 1975, with six more months of decline totalling 1.9%. What happened to stock markets? The oil crisis triggered the longest stock market slide since the 1929 Wall Street crash, with a near two-year decline. In New York, the Dow Jones lost almost half its value. The London Stock Exchange’s FT 30 – predecessor of the FTSE 100 – collapsed by 73% between spring 1972 and the end of 1974. Richard Partington"
"Cinema owners will be holding their breath next Wednesday when  Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi film Tenet becomes the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released since March as it is the first test of whether movie fans are ready to head back to big screens in their masses. The UK cinema industry, destined for the worst year at the box office in almost three decades, has been struggling to get back on its feet since the government gave the green light to reopen theatres last month. In the past week the top 10 films in cinemas in the UK and Ireland made just over £800,000 at the box office. Last year, an average week notched up £24m. With a schedule devoid of new Hollywood blockbusters, cinema operators have had to fall back on low-grossing classics and old hits, from Inception and The Empire Strikes Back to franchises including Twilight and Harry Potter. Earlier this month, cinema owners were dealt a blow when Disney pulled its new blockbuster Mulan from schedules, in favour of a release on the streaming service Disney+, leaving the Warner Bros’ Robert Pattinson-led Tenet as the great hope to reignite their year. “There is no getting away from it, it’s the first big commercial release,” said Crispin Lilly, chief executive of the boutique chain Everyman. “Tenet will be a very important step. This is the one that could get it all going. The uptake, the interest, the buzz is that it is going to do what we need it to do, which is re-kick cinema to the wider audience.” Tickets went on sale last week and Lilly said the rate of sales pegs Tenet at a box-office take similar to the Elton John biopic Rocketman or Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which took about £25m, or possibly even The Joker, which notched up £50m. “That would be superb,” Lilly said. “It is looking incredibly encouraging, it really is.” Tim Richards, the founder of Vue, one of the largest cinema operators in Europe, delayed reopening its 91 cinemas in the UK and Ireland until this month. Early ticket sales look strong, at levels matching Nolan’s Inception (£40m) to potentially as high Sam Mendes’s 1917 (£60m). “We have done a staggered opening over three weeks to make sure we are game ready when Tenet comes out,” said Richards. “Pre-bookings right now are really strong. With Warner Bros’ marketing and promotion muscle behind it, expectations are that it is going to do pretty close to pre-Covid levels of business.” The pre-sales figures suggest that the government’s regulation that cinema-goers must now wear face masks hasn’t deterred the majority of fans. But the physical distancing required means that cinemas are only able to run at about 60% capacity. Cinema owners, however, believe the distance rules will not have a big impact on ticket sales, because the pandemic has led to a step change in habits with the overwhelming dominance of weekend movie-going now at an end. “People are being cautious … many are now going on a Tuesday afternoon or a Wednesday evening instead of the traditional Friday and Saturday night,” said Richards. “Capacity restrictions are not such a big issue as we move to a true seven-day-a-week business.” However, one source cautioned that with the industry so badly needing Tenet to be a hit, the film may be in danger of being overhyped as it is unlikely to be to everyone’s tastes. “I think it will do well, but this is not Avengers we are talking about, and I am a little concerned that because it is the first big movie release it is being turned into something it is not,” said the source. If Tenet pulls in the crowds, and a second wave doesn’t result in a renewed shutdown, there are still plenty of box-office pounds to be salvaged this year. Marvel’s Black Widow, The New Mutants, the next instalment in the Kingsman franchise, Bill & Ted Face the Music starring Keanu Reeves and, of course, James Bond: Never Say Die are all set for release in the coming months. “If Tenet proves that the broader audience is there to come back and there is business to be done then that’s really powerful,” said Lilly, who opened three new Everymans in Chelsea, London and Lincoln during the pandemic. “Then [the year is] there to be recovered to be honest.” Top 10 films in the UK and Ireland (week starting 14 August) 1.

"The coronavirus pandemic has driven Australia’s flagship carrier, Qantas, to declare its worst financial result for a century – a $2bn loss – amid widespread devastation in the travel and tourism industries. Despite concerns in the market that the airline is bleeding cash as much of its fleet remains grounded, the company declared on Thursday that it remains a going concern and its chief executive, Alan Joyce, took a swipe at stricken rival Virgin Australia by declaring that after the crisis Qantas would be “the only Australian airline that can fly long haul”. Joyce also said he thought flights to and from the Covid-19-ravaged US, which is one of Qantas’s key international destinations, would be up and running within three years. State and national border closures have crippled the operations of Qantas, its smaller rival Virgin Australia, which is in administration, and smashed travel agencies and tourism operators across the country. In a sign of how deeply the travel bans are biting, Joyce on Thursday attacked the governments of Queensland and Tasmania for closing their borders and suggested there should be a national set of rules governing state border closures. The call was immediately rejected by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who said she was “not going to bend to anyone” on border closures and would instead follow the advice of the state’s chief health officer. Qantas’s record loss sparked renewed calls from unions for a comprehensive government rescue package for the air travel sector. “The shocking Qantas losses are an indication of just how sick our industry is,” the Transport Workers Union’s national secretary, Michael Kaine, said. “It must surely be only a matter of time before Qantas follows Virgin in requesting help from the federal government to stay alive.” He said the Morrison government should take measures including buying equity stakes in struggling businesses, ending a policy that stops employees of ground services business Dnata from getting jobkeeper income support payments because it is owned by the government of Dubai and capping executive pay in the sector. Qantas’s record loss came after online flight booking site Webjet reported a $143.5m loss late on Wednesday. Airports are also bleeding. From this weekend, the family-owned Canberra Airport will close its doors on Saturdays, and it is also considering closing on another weekday. Traffic figures released on Tuesday show just 317,000 passengers passed through Australia’s busiest airport, Sydney, during June – down 92% from the same time last year. With passenger numbers for the year down 62% for the year so far, the airport is deep in the red, declaring a loss for the year of $52m last week. It is currently trying to raise $2bn from its shareholders in order to pay off some of its crippling debt load of $9.1bn. On Thursday, Simon Westaway, the chief executive of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, told a parliamentary inquiry that his industry has halved over the course of the year, shrinking by $80bn. He said state border closures were costing the industry $84m a day and backed Joyce’s push for a national framework governing when they should be opened or closed. Qantas said that it made a profit on an underlying basis of $124m, before tax – down from $1.2bn the previous year. However, this figure excluded items including redundancy costs and the airline’s decision to slash the value of its airline fleet by $1.4bn. Qantas has also had to borrow more money to meet the costs of running the company while flying is heavily restricted. Total borrowings rose from $5.1bn to 6.7bn. The Australian Services Union seized on the positive underlying result to insist Qantas pay bonuses of between $1,500 and $2,000 owed to about 6,000 workers. “Announcing a $124m profit while still withholding money from workers who can’t even pay the rent is just plain wrong,” the ASU’s assistant national secretary, Linda White, said. Qantas announced the payments in 2018 when it unveiled a bumper profit of $1.4bn. The 2018 result also marked the first time since 2009 that Qantas has paid company tax (of $4m), due to losses it had carried forward over the period. Thursday’s gargantuan loss means Qantas will have more tax credits available to reduce its bill in coming years."
"Retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July, the first full month non-essential shops were allowed to reopen, officials figures showed. Indicating an increased appetite since the easing of the lockdown in May to travel to work and shop on the high street, sales increased to higher levels than in February. The value of sales increased by 4.4% and volume sales by 3.6% compared with June despite a fall in the sale of food that the Office for National Statistics said could be attributed to shoppers switching from buying dinners at the supermarket to purchasing restaurant meals. Internet shopping also suffered a slight monthly dip, in response to many high street shops opening for the first time in July, but sales online remained more than 50% higher than in February and helped push overall retail sales above pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Household goods stores and other non-food stores experienced the sharpest recovery, increasing sales by 6% and 2.2% respectively above their February 2020 levels. The ONS said: “Retailers told us that DIY products sold well as people carried out home improvements during lockdown.” When compared with February 2020’s pre-pandemic level, total retail sales were 1.7% and 3% higher in value and volume terms respectively. However, sales in the three months to July remained below the same period last year, with a fall of 5.3% for value sales and a fall of 4.1% for volume sales. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “Retail sales clearly benefited in July from a full month of non-essential retailers being allowed to open. Retail sales were also likely helped in July by the opening up of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers pushing up footfall. “However, the opening up of the hospitality sector and other consumer service sectors may have diverted some consumer spending away from retail sales towards services.” Retail sales, which account for 5.4% of GDP, have rebounded more robustly than many other parts of the economy, though mostly through online sales. Earlier this month, official figures confirmed that the economy was in recession after a slump in GDP of 20.4% in the second quarter that followed a 2.2% fall in the first."
"London’s suburbs are leading the capital’s economic recovery from the pandemic, as consumers shop and dine out locally, while the absence of office workers and tourists has kept city centre spending muted. Consumer outlay on clothes and hospitality in smaller local centres, such as Southall and East Ham, either matched or surpassed January levels by mid-July, according to a report from the thinktank Centre for London and King’s College London. The report tracked the impact of the pandemic on the capital’s economy five months after the coronavirus crisis began. Trend data from the credit card company Mastercard showed consumer spending had shifted from central London towards outer zones, as office staff continued to work from home even after lockdown restrictions eased, and international tourists stayed away. Three-quarters of London’s white-collar workers have not yet returned to their desks, according to data from the US bank Morgan Stanley, benefiting residential areas. By mid-July, restaurant transactions in Southall, west of the city centre, were 17% higher than in January, and clothes purchases were 10% up in East Ham, in the east, the Mastercard data showed. However, spending had not returned to pre-Covid levels in the capital’s larger town centres, including Stratford, Ealing, Bromley and Orpington, where transactions remained about a third lower in July than in January 2020. Consumer spending also remained persistently low in the centre of the capital, which the Centre for London attributed to its relatively small resident population of 330,000. Before the pandemic, this figure would increase by 80% every day, as office workers, shoppers and tourists travelled to the area for shopping, work, hospitality or cultural attractions. Retail spend in central London was 60% down in July, according to the Mastercard data, while restaurant spending was 80% lower. Transport for London data showed journeys to London workplaces remained at 50% of average levels in the first week of August, although driving and cycling rates had returned to normal. The pandemic had accelerated some existing social and economic changes, such as the shift to online shopping and remote working, said Mark Kleinman, professor of public policy at King’s College London’s policy institute. “We are now seeing some evidence of additional impacts, particularly on the balance of economic activity between the centre and other parts of the city, that are in part a consequence of these accelerated changes,” Kleinman said."
"Lego is to start phasing out single-use plastic bags used to package loose bricks in boxes from early next year, as it steps up efforts to make its products and packaging more sustainable over the next three years with a $400m (£310m) global investment. The Danish toymaker, which aims to make all its packaging sustainable by the end of 2025, will replace the clear plastic bags with easy-to-open recyclable, sustainably sourced paper bags – certified by the Forest Stewardship Council – as part of a new trial. Prototypes made from a range of different sustainable materials have been tested by hundreds of parents and children. Lego has already reduced the size of its boxes by 14%. Lego’s millions of younger fans across the world have been instrumental in helping to bring the move forward, said the Lego Group chief executive, Niels B Christiansen: “We have received many letters from children about the environment asking us to remove single-use plastic packaging. We have been exploring alternatives for some time and the passion and ideas from children inspired us to begin to make the change.” In 2015, the the family-owned toymaker, one of the world’s most popular brands, set a target to make its products from sustainable materials by 2030. Lego bricks have been made with a strong, oil-based plastic known as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) since 1963, although other pieces in its sets do not need such strong materials. Two years ago the first Lego pieces made from plant-based bio-plastic sourced from sugar cane went on sale, initially more “flexible” pieces such as green leaves, bushes and trees, although since extended further to cover dragon wings and carwash brushes. The company has pledged to expand its use of this material, which currently accounts for less than 2% of all pieces. It is continuing to search for a replacement for ABS in the majority of its bricks. Earlier in September, Lego reported a 7% global sales rise in the first six months of 2020 due to more families playing together during lockdown and “more adults than ever before” buying its harder-to-build sets. Among other targets announced on Tuesday, Lego aims to achieve zero waste to landfill by the end of 2025 and carbon-neutral manufacturing operations by the end of 2022."
"Stock markets have lost some of their spectacular gains made over the past several months, as investors sold off high-flying tech companies and worried about the continuing crisis in the US jobs market. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 808 points, or 2.78%, after passing 29,000 for the first time since February on Wednesday. The S&P 500 was down 3.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.9%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had set their latest record highs a day earlier, and the latter index is still up nearly 28% for the year. The S&P 500 had been up nine of the last 10 trading days and posted its fifth straight monthly gain in August. In London, the sell-off ended a rally on the FTSE 100, which closed 90 points lower at 5,850. The index is now down 22% for the year. Markets across Europe also ended the day lower. Big tech companies have seen huge gains in their share price in recent months as investors bet the firms would continue posting huge profits even with many coronavirus restrictions still in place, as people might spend even more time online with their devices. Market watchers have questioned recently whether those gains were overdone. Apple’s 8% share price fall knocked $180bn off its value. Other hot stocks fell further with Tesla dropping 9% and video conferencing company Zoom falling 10%. Randy Frederick, the vice-president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, said: “Some of the stocks have gotten a little pricey, and what the actual cause is to spark this sell-off is difficult to say. The leading sector for quite a long time has been the Nasdaq, which is very heavily weighted in technology stocks so people just saw this as an opportunity to take the profits off the table.” Investors were also taking into account the latest economic figures. The number of US citizens who applied for unemployment benefits fell last week to 881,000, a sharp drop after weeks of 1m plus claims and slightly better than economists had expected. The figures have been adjusted to take account of the extraordinary impact of the coronavirus on the US job market, a move economists expect will reduce the number of weekly claims. However, the numbers remain four times higher than the average before the pandemic. Edward Moya, a senior market analyst for Oanda in New York: “Too many Americans need benefits and this will likely remain the case for the rest of the year. “The US trade deficit also expanded to the widest level since 2008, a troubling sign that US-China tensions are about to heat up even further. President Trump campaigned in 2016 [saying] that trade wars are good, and easy to win, so financial markets will look to see if he turns up the pressure against Beijing.” The stock markets in the US have rallied since plunging in March. Most of the rally has been on strong performances from tech stocks, but also a hope that the worst of the pandemic is over, despite rising infections in schools and the possibility of a second surge of infections in the autumn. Huge amounts of support from the Federal Reserve and Congress have also helped bolster the US economy. Investors will be paying close attention on Friday when the US labour department releases its August job report. Economists surveyed by the financial data company FactSet forecast that the US economy created 1.4m jobs last month, down from 1.74m created in July. Tens of millions of US citizens remain unemployed however. A report by payroll processor ADP, widely watched as a forerunner of government employment data due out Friday, showed the private sector added 428,000 jobs in August, less than half the 1m expected by forecasters. If Friday’s jobs numbers do not deliver, it is unlikely the stock market will rise much higher, analysts said."
"Ocado has temporarily suspended deliveries to its employees as the online grocer battles to clear a backlog following a new tie-up with Marks & Spencer. Ocado said the move would free up space for customer orders, after apparent teething problems in the newly launched partnership caused it to cancel customer deliveries on its first day on Tuesday. An Ocado spokeswoman could not say how many staff orders were affected. Employees of the company usually receive a 15% discount on grocery orders, among other benefits. The spokeswoman said: “The M&S launch has been incredibly popular. To help minimise the impact of the surge in demand on our customers, the deliveries for Ocado colleagues were paused for the first few days.” The M&S launch has been closely followed by the retail industry after Ocado ended a 20-year partnership with Waitrose. Waitrose has launched a marketing push to persuade customers to move to its website, rather than remaining with Ocado and switching to M&S products. The Ocado deal is also an important move for M&S, whose grocery delivery services were previously limited to party food. M&S last month announced it was cutting 7,000 jobs in management and stores as it tried to reduce costs. Lockdowns prompted a surge in demand for online shopping across the retail industry, but growth in online orders of essential grocery shopping in particular has accelerated far beyond what analysts had expected. The consequent increased investor interest propelled Ocado’s share price to record highs above £25 per share on Wednesday, compared with below £13 at the start of the year. The pause on staff orders was first reported by Retail Week."
"The scale of the downturn hitting the coffee industry is reflected in figures from the countries with the biggest markets. The world’s biggest cafe market, the US, expects sales at specialist tea and coffee shops fall nearly 11% in 2020 after years of strong growth, according to Euromonitor International. In China, now the world’s second-biggest market for coffee, sales growth is expected to slump from just over 40% to just 1.6%. The rise of international chains such as Starbucks and the UK’s Costa, which now operates in more than 30 countries, had spurred strong growth in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and across eastern Europe. But that is set to go into reverse this year. Southern Europe, especially Italy and Spain, with its traditional coffee culture and a busy tourist industry, has also recorded a big drop in consumption. As the market has contracted, net imports by coffee-buying countries were down nearly 6% in the three months to the end of June compared with the same period last year, with figures for the US and Japan particularly poor, according to Rabobank, a leading financial services provider for the food sector. Its analyst Carlos Mera said the market was “not the bloodbath it could have been” with major chains hopeful of a rebound in trade while sales of coffee capsules have grown. But the pandemic has sent an already volatile coffee market on a deeper rollercoaster ride. Prices on the global commodity market climbed steeply in February and March as the world stockpiled under the coronavirus threat. Prices then plummeted by more than a quarter in mid-June, when many of the world’s coffee shops closed, before rising sharply again. The price changes are not only affected by changing demand and fluctuations in the dollar, in which coffee is usually traded, according to Mera, but also as a result of investment funds piling into commodities as an alternative to plunging equity markets. Those changes are likely to have a wide-ranging impact on producers who are already struggling to cope with depressed coffee prices and the effects of climate change which has made growing crops more difficult by, for example, increasing incidence of disease in some regions. Becky Forecast, supply chain manager at ethical trading group Fairtrade, said: “Volatility of coffee prices has been a big problem and the Covid crisis has exacerbated that.” She added that the changes in price made it difficult to plan ahead and cover costs, making the Fairtrade way of conducting business, which guarantees a minimum price for producers, more important than ever. “That safety is not only crucial for farmer but for the long-term sustainability of coffee. If they are not covering the cost of production there is little incentive to carry on [farming].” The good news for producer countries is that most of the world’s biggest coffee growers, including Brazil, were able to harvest their crops despite the crisis which slowed down transport links. The effect on roasters has been mixed with those supplying retailers or selling direct online faring much better than those more reliant on the hospitality industry. Small roasters such as Grind and Ozone often buy beans direct, rather than relying on commodity markets, so these relationships have protected their supply chains during the crisis. But Forecast said: “There is a big concern that demand won’t pick up again or what people are consuming domestically won’t balance out what they were buying out of home.”"
"Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin is to have a say in the running of the brand for the first time since departing over a year ago under a new “relationship agreement”. Kelvin, who owns nearly 12% of the fashion company, will have his interests represented on its board by a non-executive director – corporate financial adviser Colin La Fontaine Jackson – with immediate effect. Once known as “the man closest to Ted”, Kelvin resigned in March last year following allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staff. Kelvin’s departure came after a voluntary leave of absence from December 2018 when allegations of misconduct, including “forced hugs” and ear-kissing, were made against him. Kelvin has denied all allegations of misconduct. The group’s share price slumped to less than a tenth of its value before the allegations emerged. In July, Ted Baker said it would cut 500 jobs after a torrid few years including the “forced hugs” allegations, a string of profit warnings and an auditing error, and the coronavirus pandemic which caused sales to slump by more than a third. An investigation into the audit error in which the company overestimated the value of clothes in its warehouses by more than £30m is ongoing. In June, Kelvin slashed his stake in Ted Baker by more than half, handing control of the company to an investor known as “the Rottweiler” as part of an emergency £105m fundraising to get the business through the pandemic. In a statement to the stock market, Ted Baker said the agreement “brings the benefits of access to Ray’s unique brand experience and insight, while at the same time introducing clear guidelines that will ensure board independence is maintained and that the interests of shareholders are prioritised and protected”. It said the agreement formalised Kelvin’s relationship with the company. A source close to said Kelvin: “Ray will do anything to help the company.” John Barton, chairman, said: “We are pleased to welcome Colin to the board and to be able to access Ray’s great experience in building the brand over the last 30 years as we continue to make progress with Ted’s new formula for growth.”"
"Employers need more help to prevent a “lost generation” of young people affected by the Covid-19 recession, despite the launch of a £2bn Treasury scheme to boost job creation for under-25s, a lobby group has warned. Against a backdrop of rapid unemployment growth across the country, ministers announced details on Wednesday of how companies can use the “kickstart” programme, which aims to create thousands of new jobs for 16- to 24-year-olds. Under the scheme, first announced by the chancellor Rishi Sunak in the summer statement, employers can offer young people who are claiming universal credit a six-month work placement funded by the government. However, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said more action was needed to support employers, warning that urgent steps were required to prevent a “lost generation of young people”. As schools in England reopen and pupils return to classrooms for the first time in months, the lobby group said clarity on the government’s plans for apprentices and a renewed focus on technical education and skills were needed. “More must be done to ensure small firms have all the support they need to survive and then thrive after this pandemic,” said Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB. “If more small businesses are unable to afford an apprentice, without the means to offer an industry placement for T-level pupils or provide a traineeship or kickstart role, we will be letting down the next generation.” Under the kickstart scheme, the government covers 100% of a young person’s pay on their relevant minimum wage, national insurance and pensions contributions for 25 hours a week. Employers can top this up further, while the state will also pay £1,500 to set up support and training for people on a kickstart placement. Sunak said the scheme, which will run until the end of next year with an option to extend it further, would “open the door to a brighter future for a new generation and ensure the UK bounces back stronger as a country”. The Treasury said businesses of all sizes, including household names such as Tesco, were looking to use the scheme and create quality jobs for young people. While there is no cap on the number of places the scheme can support, as many as 538,000 young people aged 24 and under were on universal credit as of July, while 700,000 young people are expected to leave education this year. Jane Gratton, the head of people policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the scheme would help firms take on young workers at a time when cashflow was tight, but that support would be needed for struggling firms. “To be successful, kickstart needs to create long-term, quality employment opportunities and ensure that both businesses and employees are fully supported throughout the placement,” she said."
"HSBC has become the latest bank to restrict sales of its low-deposit 90% mortgages in a move that will leave many first-time buyers struggling to find a loan. While HSBC has stopped short of pulling 90% mortgages off the shelf, it said it was “temporarily reserving” mortgages worth more than 85% of the value of a home to customers switching interest rates. It is meant to help the lender process a backlog of low-deposit mortgage applications. Michelle Andrews, HSBC UK’s head of buying a home, said it was “not a decision we have taken lightly but one we will be reviewing regularly”. The bank’s 400 mortgage advisers are currently flooded with applications from buyers, with customers forced to wait as long as three to four weeks to be interviewed by HSBC. Meanwhile, the bank has only opened a daily window of as little as half an hour in the morning for brokers to apply for loans before the daily allocation of money runs out. HSBC – which accounts for about 6.8% of the UK’s mortgage market – had been reviewing the issue on a daily basis as it tried to find a responsible way to curb high demand for its low-deposit mortgages. “The recent significant uptick in applications has meant that we have not been able to consistently meet the high standards we set ourselves, which is not always a positive experience for our customers and can delay and put a property purchase at risk,” Andrews said. Typically, banks wanting to reduce demand either raise interest rates or change product criteria, such as requiring a higher deposit or by toughening up affordability constraints.  Since lockdown, other major mortgage lenders have shied away from 90%-plus lending, fearful of falling house prices and arrears. However, the surprise rise in the market has caught lenders unaware, with HSBC faced with many more applicants than expected from first-time buyers. The introduction of HSBC’s restrictions – which were first reported by the Guardian – will leave many first-time buyers with only Nationwide as an option. But Nationwide has strict criteria for its 90% loans, which will leave many potential buyers unable to find a loan. There was a glimmer of hope for first-time buyers, with Virgin Money relaunching into the low-deposit market – but only if customers agree to a minimum seven-year fixed period. “We can’t carry the market on our own, the operational strain on us is huge,” one senior HSBC banker told the Guardian. However, the banker insisted that the mortgage market remains sound, with arrears and defaults still low.   Sam Harhat, the head of financial services at Andrews Property Group, said: “For 75% loan-to-value mortgages and below, there is a huge amount of lender competition but at higher LTVs finding a lender is like looking for a needle in a haystack.” Chris Sykes of the brokers Private Finance added: “Given the restrictions at this end of the market, it is no surprise that those lenders still offering higher LTV products are facing overwhelming levels of demand. If buyers require a mortgage at that level and need to move quickly they may struggle at this point in time or may face higher rates.” "
"Last week, as Louis DeJoy testified before the House of Representatives about mail slowdowns around the country, the Republican congressman Jim Jordan praised the embattled postmaster general’s career as the chief executive of New Breed Logistics, saying DeJoy had an “amazing record in business”. But court documents reviewed by the Guardian allege that as DeJoy expanded his father’s shipping company into a logistics empire, he alienated his own family, pushing his brother Dominick out of the company and triggering an acrimonious legal battle with long-lasting consequences. The lawsuit and its outcome provide new insight into how Louis DeJoy came to control the company that made him wealthy and put him in a position to become a top Republican donor and, later, the postmaster general. A complaint filed by Dominick DeJoy in North Carolina state court in January 2000 alleges that Louis DeJoy: Family patriarch Dominick DeJoy Sr founded New Breed in 1968 as a small-time trucking concern in New York and New Jersey. After suffering a debilitating injury in 1977, he passed control of the company to his sons Dominick Jr and Michael; Louis, the eldest, was in college at the time, studying to become an accountant. Dominick did not go to college, instead taking over New Breed’s operations after graduating from high school. Louis graduated the following year and became a certified public accountant shortly after, and returned to New York to join his brothers at the helm of their father’s company. For the next decade, Louis was New Breed’s chief financial officer, handling the company’s bank accounts and tax filings. Together, the three brothers reincorporated New Breed with Louis as president and each brother owning a third of the company. They then pushed business outward from the New York area, expanding operations nationwide and moving the headquarters to North Carolina; according to the court filing, the brothers only held one in-person board meeting over the course of more than 15 years, despite Dominick and Louis living just a few miles apart in Greensboro. “Dominick Jr trusted Louis, believed he was a capable [accountant], and believed that Louis would responsibly look after all three brothers’ interests,” said the court filing. Some time in the 1990s, Louis and his brother Michael allegedly executed a kind of financial shell game to deprive Dominick Jr of his stake in the family business, according to the complaint. Michael established a new set of holding companies that did business with New Breed’s clients, and Louis allegedly told his brother Dominick multiple times that he would be entitled to a third of the proceeds from these new companies. In fact, according to Dominick’s complaint, the new arrangement gave Dominick no equity in the companies whatsoever. It wasn’t until April 1998, when Louis undertook to reorganize the entire company once again, that Dominick alleges he became aware of what he claimed was a scheme to defraud him. The ownership structure of the reorganized company would reduce Dominick’s share in New Breed by more than half, giving him a 15% stake instead of the one-third stake he thought he had. According to the court documents, Louis and Michael “conspired and did force” Dominick to sign the agreement. The following year, according to the court documents, Dominick made an even more shocking discovery: Louis had established multiple accounts in his name at local banks and investment trusts, forging Dominick’s signature in order to set up accounts of which they were supposedly the joint owners. Louis then deposited Dominick’s New Breed earnings into these accounts and either spent the money on his own personal expenses or funneled it back into New Breed, according to the court documents. When certain employees tried to send evidence of these fake accounts to Dominick, Louis allegedly sent his own employees to intercept the documents and prevent Dominick from seeing them. No sooner did Dominick sue Louis than New Breed sued Dominick on Louis’s behalf, demanding Dominick drop his lawsuit. Court records show that the cases were consolidated in a state business court later that year. Records also show that the presiding judge arranged in January 2001 for Dominick to depose an employee of Wachovia Securities, a bank that was considering an outside investment in New Breed. But later that month, just two days before the deposition was scheduled to take place, the brothers reached a confidential settlement and the judge dismissed the case. Even before Dominick’s departure from the company, his relationship with Louis was a contentious one, with the brothers often getting into heated arguments during meetings, according to two people who worked at New Breed. As tensions rose, Louis and Michael held a board meeting where they voted Dominick out of the company, and later had security escort him from the building. One person remembered a group of police officers standing outside the door of New Breed headquarters the next day to bar Dominick from coming back into the office. According to a person familiar with the family, Dominick has not spoken with either of his two brothers since he left New Breed. He now lives in La Jolla, California, and leads a small company that produces an “inertia drive” propulsion technology that creates a “constant steady state acceleration force due to an imbalance in angular momentum”. Another person familiar with the lawsuit who declined to be named said the resolution of the lawsuit was favorable to Louis. This person also said that the dispute behind the lawsuit had to do not just with Dominick’s financial stake in New Breed but also with the brothers’ competing visions for how the company should grow. “I think in the end Dominick wanted to cash out, and Louis was happy for him to cash out, they were just arguing over the price,” this person said. But another person who was familiar with the situation said that while Louis was the “brains” of the company, Dominick had been the one who had been in charge of building dozens of equipment sorting centers around the country. It was these centers that made the company so valuable to the US Postal Service, which awarded it millions of dollars in logistics contracts over the years. “Dominick spent years building out the logistics side, and then once we rolled out all those sites, it was like we didn’t need him any more,” this person said. “He was gone pretty soon after that.” After Dominick’s departure, Louis became the controlling shareholder of New Breed rather than one partner among three. As a result, when Louis sold New Breed to XPO Logistics more than a decade later, for a reported price of $615m, he got the lion’s share of that payout. If Dominick had still been an equal partner in the company the brothers would have had to split the sale price between them. It is unclear whether Michael received any money as part of the XPO deal, but for Louis the windfall helped catapult him into the top ranks of Republican donors. He funneled at least some of this payout to Republican candidates and pacs, donating almost $3m to the Trump campaign alone over the next five years and endearing himself to the party establishment. The Postal Service’s board of governors nominated DeJoy to serve as postmaster general in May after a months-long search spearheaded by the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, according to the New York Times. Robert Duncan, a former Republican National Committee chairman who Trump appointed to the board of governors in 2017, was the first to suggest DeJoy for the position. The board’s vice-chairman, longtime postal executive David Williams, told Congress in a testimony earlier this month that DeJoy “didn’t strike [him] as a serious candidate” for the job. Williams resigned from the board, whose members are all Trump appointees, when it became clear that the board intended to approve the selection of DeJoy. Since taking office, DeJoy has been criticized by postal workers, union leaders and Democratic politicians for implementing policies that have slowed down mail delivery, including by limiting overtime work and removing mail-sorting machines from postal stations. Amid intense public pressure, DeJoy recently said he would suspend some of these changes until after the election, and recent data suggests that service has rebounded in recent weeks, but Democrats in the House of Representatives this week announced their plan to subpoena DeJoy over the changes. A spokesperson for DeJoy’s family foundation said that the postmaster general “is extremely proud of the logistics and shipping company that he and his leadership team, including family members, built over decades of hard work”. The spokesperson said: “The DeJoy brothers amicably settled these issues and all civil actions were dismissed by agreement of all the brothers. Mr DeJoy continues to honor the terms of the agreement to not disclose additional details. “Immediately following the settlement, New Breed began a 15-year period of substantial growth supported by both public and private investors who embraced the company’s commitment to the highest standards of financial discipline and ethical operations.” Dominick declined to comment for this article. Michael did not respond to multiple requests for comment."
"Ahead of the 2020 election, Donald Trump and administration officials have claimed the era of offshoring American jobs and factories is “over”, but even through the pandemic US corporations have continued to lay off employees and send their work abroad. Petitions for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) – a government scheme designed to soften the blow from jobs sent overseas – shows that about 37,000 workers had their positions sent overseas between 15 March and 31 July 2020, , a nearly identical rate to the same timeframe in 2019. Bed, Bath & Beyond shut down a call center in Layton, Utah, last month, displacing 286 workers and sending the work abroad to the Philippines through a contractor. “They actually tricked people into training these other people. The way they worded it was they’re bringing the contractor to help out with the overflow. I was never told in any form I was training people to take my job,” said a laid-off call center employee who requested to remain anonymous due to a confidentiality agreement. “For them to make the change with the layoffs, when they did, was the biggest slap in the face for employees. There was no need to do it in the middle of a pandemic.” Bed, Bath & Beyond did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Workers were told in an email the layoffs were part of a restructuring plan. Since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January 2017 to 31 July 2020, over 308,000 workers have been certified for trade adjustment assistance benefits. Trump campaigned on promises to stop offshoring, and workers at companies that have shut down or scaled back operations, including AT&T, Carrier in Indiana, Siemens in Iowa and Nabisco in Illinois, have criticized the lack of support for workers once he took office. As part of restructuring ahead of bankruptcy, Brooks Brothers decided to shed their “Made In America” commitment and shut down three clothing factories in the US in July 2020. The company will rely on production abroad, displacing up to 700 workers in the US. “It’s tough for everybody. We didn’t expect the company to close it. People have been here for 30 to 40 years,” said Pedro Lopez, president of Unite Here local 187 who worked at the Brooks Brothers’ Southwick factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for over 10 years. He hasn’t found other employment out of fear of making his 92-year-old mother, who he cares for, sick from coronavirus.  In a recent policy paper, Owen Herrnstadt, the IAM’s chief of staff to the international president and director of trade and globalization, disputed claims from the Trump administration that current trade policies were bringing back jobs to the US, citing the continued influx of TAA petitions, the lack of progress in reversing job losses abroad, and promised jobs from corporations such as Foxconn in Wisconsin that never panned out. “We cannot simply turn around offshoring by doing what the current administration has done: tweeting out tariffs and issuing executive orders ‘encouraging’ companies to use domestic sourcing,” Herrnstadt argued. A report published in August 2020 by the Economic Policy Institute noted that between 2016 to 2018, the latest year of available data, nearly 1,800 manufacturing factories in the US had disappeared. The report notes coronavirus has further hit manufacturing with the loss of 740,000 jobs this year, and trade deficits that drive offshoring, particularly with China and Mexico, have continued to increase under Trump. Among the TAA petitions filed during the pandemic are 403 workers in Buffalo, New York, at Panasonic who will be displaced at the end of September 2020. The petition says Tesla and other companies are switching to purchase solar products from China and existing production will be sent overseas to Malaysia. On 15 September, 500 workers at the Asarco copper processing plant in Hayden, Arizona, will be displaced as the mining company plans to ship concentrate that was to be processed in Arizona to Mexico. Some 110 workers at an Amarillo, Texas-based Asarco refinery are also being impacted. The displacement comes shortly after Asarco workers ended a nine-month strike in July 2020 after a NLRB ruling in their favor over new contract negotiations. Winoa USA shut down its Redford, Virginia-based steel abrasive plant in June 2020, sending the production equipment abroad to Canada and France. Thirty-eight workers were affected by the shudown. “It was very sudden. We didn’t have a lot of notice. Obviously the market had been up and down prior to that due to Covid, but we were all optimistic up until the decision was made to close the doors to the plant,” said a worker at the plant who requested to remain anonymous due to a confidentiality agreement. “I’m currently still unemployed, searching for work. Hopefully I can change that in the near future. It’s put me in a tough position.” Brooks Brothers and Winoa USA did not respond to multiple requests for comment."
"Citigroup has appointed the Scottish-American banker Jane Fraser as its next chief executive, the first time a big Wall Street bank will be led by a woman. Fraser, who has worked for the lender for 16 years, will take over from Michael Corbat in February. Fraser was born in Scotland and studied economics at Cambridge University and Harvard Business School before starting her banking career at Goldman Sachs in London. Since then she has worked in roles across the world for a range of companies. Citigroup is one of the world’s biggest banks, with assets worth more than $2.2tn (£1.7tn) on its balance sheet at the end of June. The promotion will make Fraser one of the most prominent women in US business. Only 38 of the Fortune 500, which tracks the US’s biggest listed companies, had female chief executives at the start of August, according to CNN. Fraser will also be one of the few women at the top of the global banking industry. In the UK, NatWest Group – formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – appointed Alison Rose as its chief executive in September 2019, while in the public sector Christine Lagarde was made head of the European Central Bank in July 2019. Fraser was appointed as president of Citi last year when she took control of its global consumer banking division. Before that she had senior leadership roles for the bank in Latin America and in its US mortgages and mergers and acquisitions divisions. Prior to Citi, Fraser worked at the management consultancy McKinsey. Corbat will retire after eight years as chief executive and 37 years at the US bank. He took over in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when Citi received a $45bn government bailout, one of the biggest given to any bank. Since Corbat took over the bank’s share price has increased by more than 40%, although it has struggled to make up ground lost to rivals. Fraser’s first job will be to guide Citi through the extended period of economic weakness expected by many economists as the US and other major markets struggle to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. In July, the bank reported that net income in the second quarter of 2020 fell by 73% on the same three months last year as the bank set aside billions of dollar to cover bad loans. Fraser said: “I am honoured by the board’s decision and grateful to Mike for his leadership and support. We will invest in our infrastructure, risk management and controls to ensure that we operate in a safe and sound manner and serve our clients and customers with excellence. “Citi is an incredible institution with a proud history and a bright future.”"
"Hotels and restaurants have been hit by a wave of cancellations as new coronavirus restrictions throw the country’s Christmas celebrations into doubt and raise the prospect of a fresh setback for the high street. If new rules banning gatherings of more than six people remain in place over the festive season, analysts say, the absence of Christmas parties and big family get-togethers could cost retailers billions of pounds in lost clothing and food sales. “I think that this could reduce retail spending by billions,” said independent retail analyst Richard Hyman. “Toys and presents will obviously be bought, but I think clothing sales will be hit.” “Clothing retailers need the fillip that is triggered by going to parties and family gatherings, and that’s clearly going to be very significantly curtailed. Why bother [buying something new]?” The festive season is when many retailers bank the lion’s share of their annual profits, and many stores are desperate to make up lost ground after being forced to close their doors for months during the lockdown. The weeks of frenetic socialising in the run-up to Christmas and new year are also extremely important to Britain’s pubs, restaurants and hotels. Some venues bank as much as 40% of their annual profits between Halloween and January. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the industry trade body, said its members had experienced an immediate drop in bookings, with tables even cancelled for Wednesday night after Boris Johnson announced the clampdown. The new rules threatened to undo the work of the government’s recent “eat out to help out” scheme, which had encouraged Britons to venture out of their homes and helped rebuilt confidence in the sector, she said. “The fear is that, having built momentum over August and brought back two-thirds of our workforce from furlough, consumers get nervous and feel they can’t go out,” explained Nicholls. “There was a very clear ‘Don’t socialise’ message [from the government].” The new restrictions in England and Scotland pose a fresh threat not only to restaurants and pubs that had started to get back on their feet, but also to nightclubs, events venues and hotels, whose livelihoods rely on the large gatherings that have not yet been allowed to resume. “We’ve seen lots of cancellations already and then there’s the question of what it means for planning for the October to December period,” said Nicholls. “You have still got a million people whose jobs are being subsidised. Those employment levels are looking unsustainable unless you are able to guarantee that you can open.” After what has been a year to forget for many people, Christmas was the one date people had to look forward to in their diaries. John Lewis opened its Christmas shop early after it found that searches for festive products had nearly quadrupled compared with last year. Last week online marketplace Notonthehighstreet said searches for “Christmas” on the gifting website were running at double last year’s level. The usual Christmas shopping jamboree was already under threat owing to the recession and the financial uncertainty faced by furloughed workers as the government scheme is withdrawn. Retailers also face the headache of adhering to social distancing rules at a time of year when stores usually throng with shoppers. The retail sector itself also remains in turmoil after the lengthy lockdown accelerated the transfer of sales from physical stores to the digital realm, contributing to a wave of store closures and administrations that has led to the loss of nearly 125,000 retail jobs. While DIY and homeware retailers have reported bumper sales as the shift to working from home, coupled with cancelled holidays, sees consumers spend money on sprucing up their homes, fashion retailers in particular have struggled. With nowhere to go, consumers have shunned their usual wardrobe updates and the absence of Halloween and Christmas parties will provide another excuse to cut back. “Clothing is the part of the retail sector that remains under the most amount of pressure by far,” said Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim. “There have been significant changes in consumer habits, we’re still not going out and socialising with the frequency that we were previously.” Lim added: “It’s about the feel-good factor, and this year, perhaps more so than in any other year in living memory, Christmas is going to be hugely important for many households and families. But people will be nervous about these restrictions and the last thing that retailers need at the moment is to put a dampener on Christmas spirits.”"
"Scottish Power’s wind and solar farms will soon help produce green hydrogen to run buses, ferries and even trains as part of a pioneering strategic partnership to develop the UK’s nascent hydrogen economy. The renewable energy company, owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, will work alongside companies that specialise in producing and distributing the zero-carbon gas. Hydrogen is expected to play a major role in helping the UK to meet its climate targets. Scottish Power will use the clean electricity generated by a major new solar farm planned for a site near Glasgow to run an electrolyser, owned by its project partner ITM Power, which will split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. The third company within the partnership, BOC, specialises in compressing and distributing gases and will help transport the hydrogen gas to councils, factories and transport depots across the country. “Green hydrogen is something that everyone is talking about,” said Lindsay McQuade, the head of renewables at Scottish Power, “but we wanted to do something about it. This is a pioneering partnership which brings together skills from all the companies involved.” The hydrogen gas can be used in place of methane-rich North Sea gas to run power plants, heavy machinery and transport vehicles without adding to the greenhouse gas emissions that are accelerating the climate crisis. Scottish Power’s first project will be based near a new solar farm that it plans to build near the site of the largest onshore windfarm in the UK: Whitelee, south of Glasgow. The site is also expected to be equipped with a “super battery”, which can store and release clean electricity when it’s needed. The plans are expected to be replicated across the country using Scottish Power’s windfarms, solar panels and battery installations to use renewable energy when it is at its cheapest to run the electrolysers that create hydrogen. “Our revolutionary approach – which really will be a game-changer – fully supports the large-scale transformation needed to replace heavy diesel vehicles with cleaner, greener alternatives,” McQuade said. She said that by working with industry leaders such as ITM Power and BOC the partnership would be able to offer the operators of heavy vehicle fleets and industry “a packaged solution that brings all of the pieces of the jigsaw together – production, distribution, supply” from as soon as 2022. “All they have to do is provide the vehicles,” she said. "
"Governments must resist imposing spending cuts and hefty tax rises before their economies have recovered from the effects of coronavirus lockdowns, a leading global thinktank has warned. In its quarterly health check of the global economy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said it would be necessary to continue borrowing extra funds into next year to support the worst-hit households and businesses despite concerns about mounting public sector debts. In a clear shot across the bows of governments contemplating tax rises, including the UK, the OECD said public spending was needed to support a rebound in growth that had begun to slow in many countries since June, mainly on fears of further lockdowns this winter. “The aim must be to avoid premature budgetary tightening at a time when economies are still fragile,” said the organisation, which advises 36 mostly wealthy countries from its headquarters in Paris. Rishi Sunak has come under pressure from several Conservative backbenchers to quickly reduce spending and increase taxes to cap the UK’s borrowing, which is expected to hit almost £300bn in this financial year. On Tuesday, the chancellor refused to rule out tax rises in the next budget, which is expected in November, following questions in the Commons by the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. Speaking this week at the TUC conference, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the chancellor needed to pump further funds into the economy to replace the job retention scheme and “develop those sectors where it is most needed” – such as retail, hospitality and aviation. The OECD’s chief economist, Laurence Boone, said governments could revise the support they offer households and businesses as the needs of the economy shifted with a focus on higher welfare and training for those made redundant. She highlighted moves by the Netherlands government to pay a supplement to workers forced to take part-time jobs while also offering new forms of online training. However, she stressed that governments would need to continue running spending deficits next year while local lockdowns limited a rebound in GDP growth. “This is not asking governments to be profligate or calling for a spending spree when we say that support is needed next year. We are concerned about the people hit hardest by the pandemic and how they need support to find a new job,” she said. Since the OECD’s previous assessment in June, most developed countries have bounced back quickly and without the high levels of unemployment that were expected. Boone said the global economy would shrink by 4.5% this year, which was 1.5 percentage points less than was predicted in June, before rebounding by 5% next year. The UK’s growth forecast was revised upwards by 1.4 percentage points to -10.1% this year, which she said would be followed by a 7% increase in 2021. The largest revision was to US GDP, which three months ago was expected to contract by 7.3% in 2020 but is now forecast to shrink by only 3.8% before growing by 4% next year. Boone said the stimulus package agreed by Congress and the dramatic easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which cut rates to zero from last year’s 2.5% and expanded its quantitative easing programme by $700bn, helped boost growth. The report said: “The extensive policy actions undertaken as the pandemic developed have helped to prevent an even larger collapse and buffer the incomes of households and companies. “With the recovery remaining hesitant, sporadic outbreaks of the virus still occurring, and many sectors still struggling to adjust, fiscal and monetary policy support needs to be maintained to preserve confidence and limit uncertainty. “At the same time, a delicate balance has to be struck between facilitating the immediate recovery by supporting viable jobs and companies and ensuring that policy allows sufficient flexibility for necessary reallocation across sectors to occur over time. This calls for flexible and state-contingent policy support that can evolve as the recovery progresses.” Boone repeated the OECD’s call for greater cooperation to support countries that lack the infrastructure or borrowing capacity to offset the worst effects of the pandemic. India, South Africa, Mexico and Argentina will contract by more than 10% this year, she said, and only India will return to strong growth in 2021. Mexico will grow by 3%, Argentina by 3.2% and South Africa by only 1.4% in 2021."
"The value of “buy-now pay-later” finance group Klarna has soared past $10bn after investors pumped $650m into the Swedish payments company. The company said a new round of investor funding valued the company at $10.6bn (£8.1bn), a blockbuster figure that makes it the fourth-largest private fintech in the world. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, said the worlds of retail and finance had reached an “inflection point”. He added: “The shift to online retail is now truly supercharged,” adding that there had been “a very tangible change in the behaviour of consumers who are now actively seeking services which offer convenience, flexibility and control in how they pay”. Klarna is among a wave of fintech firms seducing shoppers on tight budgets. It bills itself as offering a “healthier, simpler and smarter alternative to credit cards” as shoppers can spread the cost of purchases over interest-free instalments. However, some financial experts fear easy-access digital loans could turn into a debt trap. Unlike traditional high-street credit products, Klarna earns fees from the retailers rather than from charging shoppers interest although some fintech companies, including Klarna, also offer interest-bearing products. Klarna now has more than 200,000 retailers on its books, including Asos, JD Sports and H&M in the UK, and 90 million customers worldwide. Retailers like the plans because shoppers using them typically spend more, more often. Investors clearly think the “buy-now pay-later” model has big potential, with the US private equity firm Silver Lake, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and BlackRock among the new investors. Indeed, Klarna has doubled in value over the past year as a 2019 investment round valued it at $5.5bn. Klarna’s growing worth comes despite the 15-year-old company making its first annual loss in 2019 as a result of a rising number of bad debts – a trend that has continued into this year. Andrew Quartermaine, of payments firm ACI Worldwide, said Klarna’s soaring valuation reflected the growing consumer demand for alternative ways to pay as well as altered shopping habits “as an increasing number of consumers choose to shop online due to the ongoing pandemic”."
"Kim Roe, 57, managing director of Circa Group, a conferences and events business based in Tunbridge Wells, was elated when she heard about the high court judgment in the Financial Conduct Authority’s test case on business interruption policies. “It’s a great relief,” she said. “It could save mine and hundreds of smaller businesses around the country.” Roe set up her business, which organises conferences and charity events, in 2009. The firm has been insured with Hiscox ever since. Hiscox was one of several insurance firms which had refused pay out on business interruption insurance claims caused by the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. “When the judgment came out, I checked and we are in the categories of those that should be covered,” she said.  Roe said it was “extremely frustrating and disappointing” to learn during the Covid-19 lockdown that Hiscox was refusing to acknowledge legitimate claims on the business interruption policy. “I feel the wording was clear on the policy. We’ve paid for it every year and that’s what insurance is for. If we’re covered, we’re covered. I feel they have to step up to the mark,” she said, adding that Hiscox’s refusal to pay out on it business interruption insurance policies was particularly disappointing because the insurer had a reputation for being good for small businesses. Before the pandemic, Circa Group employed eight people and also used a host of freelancers. Now it’s just Roe and one part-timer. “We lost all of our business for this year, every single event. A lot of things have been postponed into the second quarter of next year,” she said. Roe estimated that Circa lost £500,000 in business this year and will lose a further £1.5m next year, because of the cancellation of major events. She hopes to claim for those losses on the business interruption policy, and potentially future losses because the events and hospitality industry will take a long time to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. She believes the Hiscox policy provides cover for up to five years of losses. “We won’t be anywhere near our normal trading levels for three to five years because the conference and events industry has been massively hit,” she said."
"Costa Coffee is to cut up to 1,650 jobs in its cafes – more than one in 10 of its workforce, as it said trading remained challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, which was bought by Coca-Cola two years ago, said it had now reopened 2,400 of its 2,700 UK outlets – all of which closed for six weeks during the lockdown. It plans to reopen the remaining stores over the next month. All Costa staff were put on the furlough scheme with full pay but as that scheme winds to a close the coffee shop group said it would remove the assistant store manager role across all shops to cut costs. “While trade is returning, helped by the government’s VAT reduction, which Costa passed on to customers in full, and the recent [eat out to help out] scheme, there remain high levels of uncertainty as to when trade will recover to pre-Covid levels,” the company said in a statement. Costa’s move comes as service-sector companies in Britain cut jobs at a faster pace than in the 2008 financial crisis, according to a closely watched survey of business activity. Despite the return of economic growth as lockdown controls have been relaxed, IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply said the rate of redundancies accelerated in August. It said as many as one in three companies in a survey of 650 service sector firms had reduced their staffing levels last month, with businesses putting redundancy measures in place as their usage of the government’s furlough scheme winds down.  The job cuts at Costa come after rival coffee shop chain Pret a Manger said last week it planned to cut nearly 2,900 jobs after its sales plummeted. Airport and train station specialist SSP, which owns Caffé Ritazza and Upper Crust, said in July it would cut 5,000 jobs because of dwindling passenger numbers, while the high street cafe Le Pain Quotidien shed 200 staff and closed 11 of its 26 sites after falling into administration. In July, Coca-Cola said its sales of tea and coffee had fallen by nearly a third in the three months to June, largely due to the temporary closures of nearly all its Costa cafes in western Europe. Neil Lake, managing director for Costa Coffee UK and Ireland, said: “We have had to make these difficult decisions to protect the business and ensure we safeguard as many jobs as possible for our 16,000 team members, whilst emerging stronger ready for future growth.” Costa said it would seek to find those whose jobs were at risk alternative roles within the business where possible and provide support to help for those leaving the business."
"Willie Walsh is not quite enjoying the retirement he had planned. When his departure was announced in January, he had just led British Airways owner IAG to a €2.3bn pre-tax profit for 2019, its share price was moving back towards all-time highs, and as one of the FTSE 100’s longest-serving chief executives, he was preparing to step down in March. Fast-forward eight months and the world looks very different. After pushing back his leave date when the severity of Covid-19 became clear, Walsh will finally hand over the controls at IAG’s delayed annual meeting on Tuesday, at a time when the airline industry appears permanently changed by the pandemic and British Airways is flying only a fifth of its pre-crisis schedule. Instead of churning out profits, IAG made a €4.2bn loss in the first half of 2020, and Walsh himself will leave under the cloud of a potential shareholder revolt about his big pay packet at a time when the company is laying off thousands. Walsh is a rare thing in the airline industry: a former pilot who made it to the top of the boardroom. Starting at Aer Lingus before moving to British Airways in 2005, Walsh engineered BA’s 2011 merger with Spain’s Iberia to create a new, unorthodox group with separate management teams but shared costs in some central services. At Aer Lingus he earned the moniker “Slasher Walsh” after cutting thousands of jobs and selling off the company’s art collection. That approach has continued right until his last days in the job, with British Airways alone announcing plans to cut 12,000 jobs during the pandemic. It has made 6,500 voluntary redundancies so far, to the anger of unions, which argue that the company is taking advantage of the crisis. Investors at Tuesday’s meeting, to be held in Madrid, will have the chance to give Walsh a final bloody nose before his departure: the influential adviser Institutional Shareholder Services is urging investors to reject an £883,000 bonus to be awarded to the chief executive for 2019 in a non-binding vote on its pay report. Several major investors are said to have indicated that they will vote against the report. The company argues that the bonus relates to pre-pandemic performance and that Walsh’s pay has been cut by a fifth since April. However, there is little sign that the company’s at times uncompromising style under the chief executive will be abandoned. Walsh’s notoriously tough style has its advocates. John Strickland, who runs aviation analyst JLS Consulting, said that Walsh understood the importance of cost management to airlines even before the crisis, as budget airlines took market share. He adds that Walsh’s legacy is evident in IAG’s large cash reserves, which have allowed it to avoid government bailouts through the pandemic. Walsh will on Tuesday hand over to new chief executive Luis Gallego, the lieutenant whom he trusted to oversee Iberia’s turnaround in 2012. Chairman Antonio Vázquez last month announced his intention to retire in early January 2021, so the company’s recovery from the pandemic will be overseen by a new team. Gallego’s attention will be focused for months on the recovery effort – helped by a €2.75bn fundraising call, also to be voted through on Tuesday. But beyond the pandemic lies arguably a bigger challenge for an industry still hooked on fossil fuels: the climate crisis. Walsh has talked a good game, committing the company to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But aircraft technology lags far behind green ambitions, so Walsh leaves IAG with few clues to its long-term future."
"The Co-op is to create 1,000 jobs as it opens 50 new stores, becoming the latest supermarket to expand during the coronavirus pandemic. The jobs will be spread across the new shops and another 15 stores that will be enlarged as part of a £130m investment, the company said. Another 12 franchised stores, run with Co-op branding but owned by others, are also planned for 2020. It is the Co-op’s second hiring spree during 2020; it gave permanent jobs to 1,000 of 5,000 workers brought in to cope with an increased workload at the height of the UK’s lockdowns. The Co-op employs 55,000 workers across the UK, with 2,600 stores. While employment in high-street retail and hospitality sectors has been hit hard by the pandemic, supermarkets have had to contend with extra demand and new costs as the pandemic altered customer shopping habits. The pandemic has prompted a rapid acceleration in numbers of customers using supermarkets’ online grocery delivery services. A report by Waitrose has found that the number of UK consumers in the UK doing a weekly grocery shop online has doubled since the coronavirus lockdown, in a trend it described as “irreversible”. While the latest hiring by the Co-op will occur across the stores, many of its new workers are employed on online orders. Co-op workers collect orders within individual supermarkets for distribution, rather than rely on central fulfilment warehouses. The Co-op also has a distribution deal across 400 stores with Deliveroo, the delivery app that has expanded from takeaway food to groceries."
"It is almost 30 years since Australia last slid into recession, a now distant time when no one had heard of the internet and the Property Council had just appointed a young researcher called Scott Morrison. The then treasurer, Paul Keating, famously said it was the “recession we had to have”, but the slump prompted structural reforms and the economic scars were quickly healed as Australia rode the Chinese tiger to unprecedented prosperity. Fast-forward three decades and the path out of recession does not look so simple with unemployment climbing to more than 1 million. One expert says “nobody is safe” from redundancy. The combination of a recession and the coronavirus lockdown laid over the top poses a profound economic challenge for the future labour market. Low-hanging fruit such as productivity improvements and the transition to a service-based, global-facing economy have been plucked from the tree. The Reserve Bank was able to slash interest rates to stimulate growth back in 1991-92, but this time around borrowing costs are already at a record low and households are among the most indebted in the world. The entire shutdown of once thriving sectors in a matter of days gives this economic crisis a particularly vicious edge, with consumer-facing workers in the hospitality, entertainment and hotel industries the first to bear the brunt. Jobs that once looked future-proof were the next to go as the contagion spread throughout the economy. Qantas has gone from making record profits two years ago to its worst ever loss and thousands of redundancies last month. Its rival, Virgin Australia, collapsed altogether. Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, says “nobody is safe” and warns that we could end up in a widespread slump that could last several years. “Companies laid off workers because they can’t see customers coming back, such as Qantas and universities,” he says. “There will be more of that as we go along and as the government pulls back employee support such as jobkeeper.” Economists and consultants believe the double whammy of the current crisis will rapidly accelerate structural changes in the labour market that were already under way. Peter Wheeler, a partner in people and organisation at consultancy PwC, says challenges facing workers such as productivity, technology and gaps in skills already existed before the pandemic brought on the recession. “Covid and the recession has accelerated these things,” he says. “So while the change might have taken five years before, it is now happening in a matter of months.” Prof Jeff Borland, Truby Williams professor of economics at the University of Melbourne, agrees and says history shows the recession will “bunch together destructive forces” and spell bad news for some sectors. “During past recessions, manufacturing was very vulnerable as many jobs could be automated. It accounted for more than 20% of the workforce in the 70s but now represents just 7%. “I don’t see any reason why we won’t see this occurring again. Jobs that involve tasks that can be codified will slowly disappear such as machine operators or clerical jobs,” he says. The hollowing out of middle-income jobs is also a threat, Borland says, as the crisis speeds up what he calls “job polarisation” whereby the middle decline as low-skilled jobs and high-skilled jobs increase. Manufacturing is not the only sector that has declined in the last 30 years. Back then, 21% of the working population was employed in the retail and wholesale sector, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, compared with 13% in 2019. Agriculture has also halved from 5.5% to 2.6%. Construction, which expanded to employ 13% of the workforce by 2019 (15% of all men) from 9%, is in the doldrums thanks to a slump in building approvals, but is likely to benefit as governments throw money at infrastructure schemes to keep people in work. Stanford argues that only massive government intervention to support industry and create jobs in infrastructure projects and other programs could avert the disaster facing workers in many sectors who may never return to their jobs. “The public sector will expand in the coming years,” he says. “Government is the only actor with sufficient resources and authority to make things happen. It has incredible resources as we have seen and can roll things out super-quick. We’ve seen why we need strong government to protect people and the economy.” Another clear growth area that experts agree on is healthcare as the pandemic reshapes community priorities and the way we all live and work. Liam Harrison, a healthcare analyst at market research firm IBISworld, says the rollout of contact tracing to counter Covid-19 could be here to stay as it becomes more financially viable in future to track regular flu outbreaks. The need for more so-called telehealth, where contact between doctors and patients is minimised, will leave healthcare technology companies well placed to benefit and create jobs. “Demand is way up,” he says. As well as increased health spending across the board to deal with the pandemic and an ageing population, the aged care royal commission is likely to lead directly to higher staffing and more regulation in homes. Last year, a report by the consultancy McKinsey on the future of work in America identified the changes on the horizon in an analysis that can also be applied to some extent to the Australian economy. It said that while employment in office support and food service may decline, “healthcare, STEM occupations, creative and arts management, and business services” would see strong growth. The prediction about the arts industry now looks terribly wrong to the thousands of people left unemployed by Covid-19, but it illustrates a point by PwC’s Wheeler that we never really know everything about the jobs of the future, just that they will exist. Key transferrable skills such as digital literacy, data analytics, cybersecurity, robotics and AI will be crucial for young people to develop. But he also argues that soft skills such as emotional intelligence, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration and creativity will also be crucial to the future of work. “New jobs will arise,” he says. “We don’t know the jobs of the future. We never did. But we know young people will have multiple careers and jobs and experience lifelong learning. Learning on the job will be more important than ever.”"
"Consumers are being asked to rifle through their bins in order to weigh and record their daily food waste, in an ambitious trial that aims to reduce the 6.6m-tonne mountain of food thrown away by UK households every year. The UK’s largest supermarket, Tesco, has linked up with the environmental charity Hubbub to run the six-week experiment in which families will receive advice on meal planning and food storage along with recipe tips for using up leftovers. The results from 55 households will be used by Tesco and Hubbub to offer advice and practical steps to help cut food waste, which on top of its negative environmental impact typically costs a family of four about £60 a month. The UK has signed up to a global sustainable target of halving food waste by 2030. The trial takes place at a time when the UK lockdown has led to a dramatic change in the nation’s shopping and cooking habits. New polling of about 2,000 adults for Tesco found that 67% now felt differently about food. Almost a third of respondents (29%) said the pandemic had made them value food more. “Lockdown has driven the biggest change to the nation’s food habits in generations, and many of us have experienced shortages for the first time,” said Aoife Allen of Hubbub. “Cutting food waste has proved a stubborn challenge and we are a long way from the goal of halving food waste.” Supermarkets have been criticised for wasting food in their supply chains that could be diverted to food banks. Tesco was the first to publicise its figures.  In 2018 Sainsbury’s abandoned a £10m scheme to halve food waste after a year-long trial in a Derbyshire town produced disappointing results. The Waste Less, Save More experiment fell far short of its 50% target, with households thought to have cut waste by only 9% while telling Sainsbury’s the issue was not a priority for them. However, lockdown has thrown up new challenges and in July the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, said self-reported food waste was up by 30%, reversing progress made at the start of the pandemic as consumers threw away less food while confined to their homes. In Tesco’s research, 35% of people said they reduced their food waste during lockdown and 75% said they had kept this up since restrictions were lifted. Nearly two-thirds (61%) were cooking with leftovers every week, while 32% were planning meals and almost a quarter (22%) were batch-cooking and freezing more.  Only 3% of those who cut food waste during lockdown said they did not plan to continue these new habits in future."
"Nottingham city council’s failed energy supplier, Robin Hood Energy, has agreed to sell thousands of customer accounts to British Gas, and will make hundreds of employees redundant before closing later this year. The council-run energy company, one of the first in the UK, informed staff on Thursday that 250 people would lose their jobs following a deal to sell its customer base to the UK’s biggest energy supplier. The deal will result in 112,000 households and 2,600 business customers being transferred to British Gas, five years after Robin Hood Energy was set up to challenge the dominance of the UK’s big six energy suppliers. The closure of Robin Hood Energy follows a damning report from auditors at Grant Thornton this summer which found that the not-for-profit company had lost a total of £34.4m by March 2019 despite receiving £43m of public cash and £16.5m of loan guarantees. The report dealt a severe blow to the UK’s experiment with council-run energy suppliers, which had previously won the support of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Nottingham council leader, David Mellen, said: “We know this is a very sad day for the business and its employees who have played a part in creating a more dynamic and customer orientated market for all energy consumers.” Nottingham city council launched Robin Hood Energy in 2015 with the intention of offering customers green electricity at an affordable price. Bristol city council followed suit with Bristol Energy the year after. But both council-run suppliers have struggled to stay afloat as a deluge of investor-backed challenger brands entered the market. Robin Hood Energy reported a writedown of £24m on its loans this year, and a financial loss of £22.5m for the financial year ending in 2019 before putting its customers up for sale. The deal comes weeks after Bristol Energy put itself up for sale after reporting a loss of £10m for the 2018-19 financial year. Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas parent company Centrica, said all customers joining the supplier from Robin Hood would be offered a green electricity tariff at the same rate as they paid before. “We are delighted to welcome Robin Hood customers to British Gas,” he said."
"Three million fewer passengers travelled on Britain’s trains on Tuesday than a year ago, with only a slight increase in commuters rather than the widespread post-Covid return to offices that the government had urged. Figures from train operators indicated that total journeys were just 38% of the equivalent day in 2019, a proportion that had been steadily increasing over the last two months but is only marginally higher than last week. An average 5 million passengers a day were travelling by rail in late 2019. Network Rail said footfall in its managed stations, the busiest in London, England and Scotland, was 6% higher than the same day last week but still 60% lower than usual. Separate figures for transport use last week, published by the Department for Transport on Wednesday, showed train journeys on Monday 24 August at 38% of 2019 levels (averaging 33% for the rest of the working week, in provisional figures that are expected to be revised upwards). The train operators’ figures are consistent with data from Transport for London on Tuesday that showed only a negligible increase in tube and bus journeys in the capital, amid increasing concern for the economy and future of cities, with Britons lagging behind other countries in returning to the office. In the Canary Wharf financial district of London, and Manchester’s Spinningfields, the start of the post-bank holiday working week brought a “trickle, not a torrent” of employees making it back into offices. The rail industry is regarding next Monday, 7 September, as a key marker, a day when more train services will be restored, including a full timetable in some commuter networks, after many operators ran a reduced service during the lockdown. There is growing pressure to overhaul rail fares, as part-time working makes season tickets unviable, while the cost of individual peak-time tickets is a prohibitive daily expense for many living in commuter belts. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the Commons that the government was “working at pace with rail companies to try to deliver new products in terms of ticketing that would ensure better value and enable people to get back to work in a flexible way”. Most train operators remain locked in negotiations with the DfT over the renewal of emergency agreements, due to expire later this month. The government suspended franchises in March after advising the public, apart from key workers, to stay at home and avoid public transport due to the pandemic. The Treasury expects to have spent an additional £3.5bn by September 21 in underwriting the rail network. "
"Businesses are offering incentives such as free food, extra childcare and even executive parking spaces to coax staff back into the office but could fall foul of employment law if perks aren’t distributed fairly, according to experts. While many companies and trade bodies have cautioned against putting pressure on staff to return, some firms have come up with offers for those that do so. Bankers at Goldman Sachs’ London office have been given free takeaway breakfast and lunch, having previously had to pay for food. Before the pandemic, they were entitled to 20 days of free childcare at an onsite creche, but can now claim an extra 10 days as they try to juggle childcare and work. Rival bank JP Morgan built an internal smartphone app that allows senior bankers who are on holiday to donate their parking spots at Canary Wharf, east London, to more junior staff willing to come into the office but worried about travelling on public transport. The bank has also opened up the changing rooms at its pay-to-use gym for staff who want to change after cycling or jogging to work. But employment lawyers said firms needed to be careful about ensuring they did not discriminate against staff who stayed at home, including those with disabilities. “There is a risk in offering an incentive to someone who comes into the office and not to someone who doesn’t,” said Rustom Tata, an employment law expert and chairman of the City law firm DMH Stallard. “If an employer is offering a policy such as free meals, they may have to consider whether they offer an equivalent benefit to someone who isn’t coming into the office for reasons to do with a disability. “Administering all of that is a nightmare. You’re almost better off giving it to everybody or nobody.” Several employment lawyers said firms should also check whether perks such as parking spaces or offers to fund congestion charge payments would be treated as a taxable benefit by HM Revenue & Customs. Tata said: “The other thing they have to do is not appear to be placing undue pressure on the employee to come in, particularly if they haven’t properly done their risk assessment and consulted with employees as part of that. “You can see some employers saying we’ll bung you a meal and hope you turn a blind eye to that.” Despite the government’s push to convince people to come back to offices, David Wreford, a partner at global human resources firm Mercer, said most firms were focusing on helping staff who did not want to or could not return. “I haven’t heard of a single company – and we’ve talked to a hell of a lot – who say it hasn’t worked,” he said, of people working from home. “I don’t think companies are in the mindset of hurrying people back to the office.” Employees have also enjoyed working from home, with nine out of 10 keen to continue doing so, according to a survey of more than 20,000 people conducted by Cardiff and Southampton universities. Workspace, a property firm that makes money by leasing office space, has been less keen on home working, telling staff to come to the office where possible. A company spokesperson said staff who were unable to do so for health reasons could work remotely and flexible working patterns had been created. But they added: “We have already seen the benefits of this return and believe the office fosters strong collaboration and a unified company culture.” The Health and Safety Executive continues to advise that “everyone who can work from home should do so”."
"Locked-down punters swapping sports betting for online poker and casino games during the coronavirus crisis helped the Paddy Power and Sky Bet owner, Flutter Entertainment, to report better-than-expected profits in the first half of 2020. The world’s largest online betting company, created via the $12bn (£9.1bn) merger of Flutter and Canada’s The Stars Group, said pre-tax profits fell by 70% to £24m in the six months to the end of June. The decline was largely because of costs and accounting changes associated with the merger. Flutter’s chief executive, Peter Jackson, lauded a performance that resulted in the enlarged firm brushing off the effect of the pandemic lockdown, which led to cancelled or postponed sports events and the closure of its network of high street bookmakers in the UK and Ireland. Jackson said the impact of the pandemic on sport was “more than offset by an increase in the number of recreational customers playing our poker and gaming products globally, as people sought new forms of home entertainment”. The group managed to increase revenue from sports betting in the US and Australia, where horse racing has continued during the pandemic and enjoyed greater television prominence as other sports stopped. Analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies described Flutter’s performance as “another upbeat gambling sector update”, with the rise of online poker and casino games largely cushioning the blow of the pandemic for the industry. The merger with The Stars Group has increased the company’s spread across regions and forms of gambling, particularly poker. PokerStars, acquired as part of the merger, increased its revenue by 40% in the first half to £697m. Gaming grew by 43%, with overall poker revenue up 38% and casino growth of 51%. Jackson said Flutter was in good shape coming out of lockdown, as the online gaming customers picked up during lockdown appear to have stuck with the company, while sports revenue had returned as sports such as football pick up where they left off. “Looking ahead, we have identified promising opportunities to increase investment across the group and, while the outlook with respect to Covid-19 remains highly uncertain, the diversification of our group means we approach the future with confidence,” Jackson said. The group has also built a promising business in the US market, which has been rapidly expanding after sports betting regulations were relaxed. Flutter has established a beachhead in North America via the acquisition of the fantasy sports betting platform FanDuel and the Fox Bet brand."
"The jet engine maker Rolls-Royce gave a stark warning about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the business as it reported a record £5.4bn loss for the first half of the year. The company does not expect orders to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2025. The pandemic led to a slump in demand for its engines as airlines reduced flights and aircraft manufacturers slowed production. Rolls-Royce originally expected to make 450 engines during 2020 but now plans to deliver just 250. It continues to burn through cash, and expects to have burned through £4bn by the end of the year, and said it may not be able to find enough funding to cover its needs. Announcing its results for the first half of the year, it said: “The inherent uncertainty over the severity, extent and duration of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore the timing of recovery of commercial aviation to pre-crisis levels and the availability of sufficient funding, represent material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.” Rolls-Royce is undertaking the largest restructuring in its history and, as a result, will close several production sites, including Barnoldswick, in Lancashire, and Annesley, in Nottinghamshire, as it consolidates its operations. Rolls-Royce previously announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs globally, more than 15% of its workforce, because of the pandemic, with UK staff making up two-thirds of the total. The company said 2,500 of its UK workers had applied for voluntary redundancy or agreed to take early retirement, substantially reducing the need for compulsory redundancies. To date, 4,000 people in its civil aerospace business have left the company, reducing its global workforce to 48,000; a further 5,000 are due to leave before the end of the year. Rolls-Royce predicts pre-tax savings of at least £1.3bn by the end of 2022 from its restructuring programme. As part of the attempts to shore up its balance sheet for the longer term, it is looking to sell at least £2bn worth of assets, including the Spanish engine maker ITP Aero. The company said it had taken decisive action when the pandemic began to affect its business, such as its restructuring programme, but it only expected deliveries of large engines to increase from 2022. Alongside its results Rolls-Royce announced that its finance chief, Stephen Daintith, was leaving after less than four years to join Ocado, the grocery delivery company. The company said its defence business had remained resilient during 2020 and demand from its key government customers was unchanged. Covid-19 has had an “unprecedented impact on the civil aviation sector”, said the Rolls-Royce chief executive, Warren East. The restructuring “will significantly reduce our cost base, which, combined with recovery in power systems and continued resilience in defence, will help us to deliver significantly improved returns as the world recovers from the pandemic,” he said. The amount of cash Rolls-Royce is burning through is “simply unsustainable”, said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at aviation consultancy StrategicAero Research. “Its strategy to sell off assets to generate cash is a limited option – what will they do when there’s nothing left to sell?” Managing the fallout from the coronavirus crisis will be East’s greatest challenge at the jet engine maker, said Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. “With its reputation currently diminishing, shareholders starting to bail out and the full force of Covid headwinds yet to come, East still has a lot of work to do to make sure Rolls-Royce can ride out the storm,” she said. The company said it would scrap its dividend while the economic outlook remained uncertain."
"The annual Davos gathering of world leaders, billionaires and business executives on a mountain in Switzerland has been delayed by Covid-19 until the summer of next year. Announcing the move because of health and safety concerns, the World Economic Forum – which has been putting on the meeting of the global elite at a Swiss ski resort for half a century – said it would hold several virtual events in January instead. Regarded as a cornerstone event for international relations, business and the world economy, the event normally takes place at the end of January each year and is attended by heads of government, company chief executives, celebrities and activists from across the globe. “The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the ‘Great Reset’ in the post-Covid-19 era is so urgent. However, the advice from experts is that we cannot do so safely in January,” the WEF said. The dates and location of a rescheduled 2021 annual meeting will be made available as soon as the health and safety of guests and the host community high in the Swiss Alps can be guaranteed, it added. Almost 3,000 people head to Davos each year, with many of the world’s super-rich flying in by private jet to discuss issues ranging from global heating to inequality, technology and business. At its 50th annual meeting earlier this year, as many as 53 heads of state from around the world joined the event, including the US president, Donald Trump, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel."
"The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has renewed his attack on HSBC for the bank’s alleged treatment of pro-democracy customers in Hong Kong, saying that China is “bullying” the UK. Pompeo, who in June accused HSBC of a “corporate kowtow” to Beijing, cited reports of Hong Kong-based executives at Next Media being unable to access their bank accounts. He accused the bank, which is based on London but makes most of its profits in Hong Kong and China, of “maintaining accounts for individuals who have been sanctioned for denying freedom for Hongkongers while shutting accounts for those seeking freedom”. “Free nations must ensure that corporate interests are not suborned by the CCP [Chinese Communist party] to aid its political repression,” Pompeo said on Wednesday. “We stand ready to help the British government and its companies resist CCP bullying and stand for freedom.” HSBC, which is struggling to balance its need to stay in favour with China while the US and Britain remain critical of Beijing’s handling of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, declined to comment. The bank has also come in for criticism from Aviva Investors, one of Britain’s biggest investors and a top 20 shareholder, after Peter Wong, HSBC’s Asia-Pacific chief executive, signed a petition that backed China’s plans to enact a sweeping security law in Hong Kong. Last month, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, reprimanded HSBC and other banks for supporting the controversial security law, saying the rights of the people of Hong Kong should not be sacrificed for bankers’ bonuses. HSBC’s chief executive and his counterpart at Standard Chartered – which is also London-based but also one of Hong Kong’s biggest banks – have already been censured in a letter from Labour frontbenchers. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, and the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, urged both CEOs to withdraw their support for legislation. The members of the shadow cabinet warned the banks in a letter that they could face a boycott and urged them to uphold Britain’s democratic values. The US has criticised Beijing’s crackdown against pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong after the security law was imposed on 30 June. The move by Beijing has also been widely condemned by other western nations. The Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy activist and top executive at Next Digital, was arrested this month under the law, further stoking concerns about media and other freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to China in 1997."
"New Look is seeking a three-year rent holiday on 68 of its stores and big rent reductions on hundreds of others as it battles to stay afloat and save the jobs of its 11,200 employees. The fast-fashion chain is attempting to secure its second  rescue deal in 18 months and, along with the payment holiday, is asking landlords to slash rents to between about 2% and 12% of sales – on a further 402 of its shops. Such rents are not only likely to be lower than current levels but more flexible in the event of further high street lockdowns.  New Look said its debt holders had agreed to inject £40m in new cash into the business and cut debts by about £440m to about £100m if landlords would agree to the rent cuts. In return, landlords will be able to exit leases more easily if they can secure better terms elsewhere, raising the prospect that dozens of New Look stores will close. Landlords and other creditors representing at least 75% of the value of the firm’s debts must vote to approve the rent-cutting deal, an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), at a meeting on 15 September. New Look has also given commitments not to drop the amount of rent paid by more than 15% year on year during the CVA period, no matter how stores perform, and to continue to pay service charges, including business rates. If the deal does not go ahead New Look is at risk of collapsing, with the potential loss of more than 11,200 staff jobs and hundreds more agency workers at its warehouse. The company’s banks and other lenders have promised to swap most of its debts for equity in the business in order to help keep New Look afloat. A buyer is being sought as an alternative source of new funds but it is thought unlikely one will be found in the current climate. Nigel Oddy, the chief executive, said New Look was launching the latest CVA “out of absolute necessity”. He said sales in stores that had reopened after lockdown remained down by more than 30% on average. The high streets remained quiet and it was not clear how long it would take for shoppers to return, he added. Oddy said New Look’s latest ranges were doing well online and its strategy to broaden its appeal and offer good value on local high streets could succeed. “I firmly believe there is still a place for New Look in the retail market,” he said. However, he said New Look could not continue to pay rents at historical rates. “[The] magnitude and speed of the shift in consumer behaviour and confidence nationwide requires a change in the way leases are structured in order to manage uncertainty so that stakeholders share both risk and upside, and to ensure continued business viability,” Oddy said. “Covid-19 has changed the retail environment beyond recognition, accelerating the permanent structural shift in customer spend and behaviour from physical retail to online, which we have seen in recent trading. Despite this, we still fundamentally believe the physical store has a significant part to play in the overall retail market and our [online] strategy.”"
"Brands often outsource their manufacturing processes – but they need more than their suppliers’ reassurance that the conditions and practices in their factories are up to scratch. Regulators usually go into such sites only if they have reason to suspect wrongdoing. Auditing is supposed to ensure that workers’ rights are routinely respected – and give brands an ethical “seal of approval” to reassure investors and customers. In reality, there is huge variation in standards and approaches. While some audits entail genuine scrutiny, critics say others can be seen as tick-box exercises designed to give brands deniability if problems later emerge. There are hundreds of factories In Leicester’s sprawling textiles industry, many of them subcontractors making clothes for a brand that might not even know they exist. Standards, output and even the locations of these businesses are notoriously hard to track, and whistleblowers who may not have the right to work in the UK themselves but are prepared to go to the authorities are few and far between. Social audits look at issues from fire safety to workplace discrimination to standards at subcontractors – and, crucially in Leicester, whether workers are paid the minimum wage. Audits are a hoop that factories typically have to jump through if they want to get a contract with a particular brand. If they refuse to do so, they won’t get the orders. But if they participate and the results are positive, they may then wish to share the audit with other prospective buyers. It depends on the brand. Some companies, such as Primark, are understood to have in-house teams that work exclusively on their behalf. Others, such as Asos, River Island and Marks & Spencer use a combination of their own teams and external specialists.  Definitely not – but there are some common practices and benchmarks. Many fashion and textile companies have signed up to the Fast Forward programme, which means that auditors use a shared methodology and assess factories against set criteria. This will potentially identify compliant or leading practices, raise areas for improvement, or uncover serious issues. They may also be signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative, an umbrella group that has a base code founded on the International Labour Organization’s benchmarks. Then there is the Smeta system, a template for audits that are then put on to the widely used Sedex platform for suppliers to share as they wish. Boohoo has resisted membership of the ETI and does not subscribe to the Fast Forward programme. It has also refused to publish a list of its suppliers. It contracted the external auditors Verisio and Bureau Veritas in 2019 and has increased inspections in Leicester in recent weeks.  Audits can be a critically important tool for businesses with a genuine interest in ensuring they have an ethical supply chain. It is important to note, though, that they provide a snapshot of issues at a particular time and may not account for subsequent changes in practices. Done badly, they can be a smokescreen for companies that have no serious intention of changing their ways. Reformers are particularly critical of what they see as superficial tick-box audits carried out by inspectors under time pressure, and conducted at significant expense. These may, for example, examine a set of payslips and conclude that minimum wage is being paid, but fail to interview the workers who might tell them otherwise. In these cases, critics say, audits can be a lucrative whitewash, and there may be no incentive to report negative findings. This means that while audits are vital, they may not be enough to gain a clear picture of the fair treatment of workers on their own. "
"I am 20 minutes into my scheduled 30-minute call with Shivani Maitra when I start to freeze. Maitra, a partner at global consultancy firm Deloitte, is leading the firm’s post-Covid-19 research into the future of work, and is giving me a seamless analysis of what business is about to look like: more autonomy, more remote work, happier workers, more accessible leadership – all facilitated by technology. But I can’t get Skype for Business to function. It’s a hot day and the connection comes and goes, leaving me contorted and sweating over my laptop. Maitra is not necessarily wrong, but as my kids (aged three and five) thunder into the room, I can’t help but think we have some way to go. Los Angeles-based tech company PORTL Inc has promised that, in five years’ time, we will all be able to beam life-sized, talking holograms of our colleagues into our homes; right now, I think an impenetrable forcefield around my desk would be more useful. “Technology is going to be key to how we work in the future,” Maitra concedes. “But it’s going to be an enabler – it’s not going to be an answer.” It is too early to know exactly what Covid-19 will do to office-based work (you can’t “WFH” – work from home – on a factory line, or as a surgeon, obviously). But many businesses are predicting that whatever happens next – even if there is a vaccine – this moment could represent the end of the nine-to-five as we know it, and in particular the end of vast corporate offices with banks of identikit desks. According to a recent study by Morgan Stanley, only 34% of UK workers who could go back to the office have actually done so, and many businesses have publicly stated that they will extend the option to WFH indefinitely. Facebook has said that 50% of its jobs will be remote within 10 years; Twitter is letting almost all its global workforce WFH forever, if they like; global law firm Slater and Gordon has given up its London office; fund manager Schroders says staff can continue to work flexibly for an indefinite period, as have investment bank JP Morgan and legal firm Linklaters. Work that would previously have been considered impossible to do remotely moved online within a matter of weeks of the UK going into lockdown.  But this doesn’t mean all business districts are going to remain ghost towns. Organisations can’t just tear up their leases, and many are wary of going completely remote. They want to keep a space to bring teams together, if only occasionally. How to do this safely, without encasing everyone in Perspex or turning office blocks into hundreds of self-contained pods is the critical question. (Multimillionaire Xu Weiping plans to release prototype cube offices this autumn, as he redevelops part of London’s Royal Albert Dock.) Darren Comber is chief executive of Scott Brownrigg, an international design practice specialising in the built environment, which not only shifted to remote working at the beginning of the pandemic, but also shifted the focus of its 300 staff to looking at ways of minimising contagion. “One of the biggest things that has to happen is access to fresh air,” he says. “At the moment, only 10% of the air, typically, in an air-conditioned building is fresh, and 90% is recirculating. We’re going to see that flip around completely, because people want cleaner, healthier environments, and are less tolerant of somebody getting a cold at one end of an air-conditioned space, and then everyone getting it. That technology already exists. It’s more expensive, but what’s the human cost? Your staff will simply say, ‘I’m not going to go in.’” Instead, Comber is looking at the introduction of hydroxyl radicals into indoor air. “These occur naturally outside, and are one reason your chances of catching something outdoors are less. UV lighting is making a massive difference, too.” He is keen on giving buildings, including offices, health badges, “in the same way that you have a hygiene rating system for restaurants”. Other tech solutions include contactless facial recognition to gain access to a building; voice-activated doors, windows and blinds; app-controlled vending machines; and smart wearables that detect signs of illness, or alert you whenever someone strays into your personal space. (Raising the question of how much personal data we might be prepared to hand over to our bosses, just to get back to the daily grind.) “We have all just been through the biggest work-life experiment in decades,” says Emma Morley, office designer and founder of trifle* creative, who has worked with companies including online stationers moo.com, Coco de Mer and Soho House. Despite having had to radically alter her latest project, a 40,000 sq ft, 500-person, 25-meeting room office building, she is excited about what this year might offer. (Social distancing means that, where there would have been six desks, there is now only room for two, with wider corridors, and far more circulation space.) “Rather than feeling hindered, let’s turn that around and say we’ve got the greatest opportunity to create a workspace design revolution. We can say to people: what do workspaces really need to be? Because if we don’t need all those desks, happy days. Desks take up 70-80% of space – and if we’ve all got a desk or table at home that we can work on, then when we go into the office it’s about collaboration, socialisation and sharing ideas. I’ve been talking about this for 15 years – about the importance of having different types of space to work, about not filling spaces with desks, because desks are not the best places to come up with ideas. And, now, all of a sudden, it’s here.” Morley has chosen a hybrid setup for her own team, which she plans to phase in this month, as long as it seems safe to do so. “We will be together two days a week, and three days a week from home,” she says. “As humans, we need to be together. Collaboration does not happen very easily over Zoom.” Even before the pandemic, the senior team at Awin, a global affiliate marketing agency with staff in 20 countries, was planning a major shift away from the office, having already experimented with remote working among its UK staff. When the crisis hit in early March, they were ready. “We didn’t want to take any risks – we shut everything down almost overnight,” says Adam Ross, COO, who was happy to take a breather after six years of constant travel between the UK and Berlin offices. “All 1,200 staff: one day they were in the offices and the next day they weren’t, and everything worked perfectly.” After a virtual workshop in which the board planned for a fully remote 2023, they realised that most of what they wanted to achieve in three years could be done now. When the staff were surveyed and found to be in favour, the board decided not only to move to an entirely remote workforce, but also to a flexible four-day working week (with no salary reduction), which they hope to introduce early next year. “We realised everyone needed more time, whether for home schooling, or younger kids and the nightmare of that. Or if you don’t have family, you need time for you – so we gave everybody Friday afternoons off. It was incredibly well-received, and it didn’t reduce productivity. So we thought, ‘How can we go one better?’” In order to implement a four-day week, “we are looking at automation, easing some of that grunt work. We believe this is the way forward,” Ross says. They intend to shrink their offices, keeping some space for collaboration, but with few or no desks. “We are going to actively discourage coming into the office every day,” Ross says. “We’re very conscious of the pitfalls that might come from having a hybrid situation, because you end up with a weird halfway house and nobody knows where they stand.” A 2019 study published in the academic journal Organization Science showed that remote employees have to do more than their in-house counterparts to get their achievements noticed, often making more personal sacrifices to do so. Although it’s too soon to have data on this, it seems likely that this will apply most to younger or newer remote employees. “Our younger staff, when we surveyed them, did report that they loved [office] culture,” Ross says. “We had a vibrant atmosphere and a beautiful space. But [the results] were still overwhelmingly in favour of more flexibility, depending on the age group – older staff were less keen on coming in at all, and younger people wanted to come in one or two days a week.” An Awin taskforce is now researching a package to help people work wherever they choose, potentially also contributing to home broadband or utility bills. “If you give people trust, and you respect that they need a work-life balance, then they give it back to you in spades,” Ross explains. At the award-winning architectural firm Selencky Parsons, most of the team are already – safely – back in their London office, with newly spaced-out desks all facing away from each other. “Most of our employees are young, and they don’t have massive homes to work in,” says co-founder David Parsons. The business managed lockdown by instituting virtual morning meetings and Friday beers (they got a local brewery to deliver to everyone’s home), along with Zoom quizzes. “And that was fine for about 10 weeks, but what started to worry me was a lack of enthusiasm in the team.” He also worried that some staff were very lonely. Although there was plenty of work coming in, productivity seemed to drop. “It wasn’t that people weren’t working as hard. It was that they weren’t getting to the answers as quickly – not feeling like they could call and ask any question, at any time, as they would if they were physically next to us.” His concern was that his younger team members were missing out on both formal and informal incidental learning. “The amount you learn from just listening to other people’s conversations is huge. To be completely isolated from all that, I think, is a big problem,” he says. This year’s abrupt shift to remote work has better suited more experienced workers, who are less in need of on-the-job training and career development, and who are more likely to live somewhere with room for a desk. A woman in her early 30s who works for a large organisation (and asked to be anonymous) told me, “It’s quite a shock, as when all this started we were told to expect a phased return in September, and then maybe not till next year. But now it’s pretty much: ‘Expect this indefinitely, with the odd day in.’ I am still coming to terms with it. I’m single, so it really is just me, all day long. Working from home suits middle-class families who have enough space and a garden. I worry about my future and meeting new people organically.” Another woman told me about a flatshare in which the living room had been repurposed as a bedroom, to lower the rent; as a consequence, four people were all working full-time in the kitchen. Untold numbers are perched at worktops, on their beds or, in the case of my friend Jo, an ironing board. Remote work may be very hard for some (it is also tough on carers of all kinds), but in the longer run, the tilt away from five days in the office may mean more choice about where to live. If you’re only visiting the office once or twice a week, you can live farther from it, perhaps somewhere more affordable. If you rarely visit at all, you can, in theory, live almost anywhere. And, as Maitra points out, this could create a more diverse workforce: “The most far-reaching effect is going to be [organisations saying]: ‘You can live anywhere you want to, but you could still come and work for me.’ People then don’t have to live in expensive city flats.” Will workforces move away from cities in general, and from overpriced London and the south-east in particular? The book publisher Hachette recently surveyed its staff about which UK cities they would like to live in, and is now hunting for regional hub offices in Edinburgh, Newcastle, Manchester, Sheffield and Bristol to match the results. The pandemic has opened up a home-buying rush in the countryside: inquiries from city dwellers across the UK who want to move to a village are up 125%, according to Rightmove – and one reason is the disappearance of the commute. Some of the downsides to remote working will take longer to reveal themselves. While people working from home may currently appear highly productive, pre-Covid research by Cardiff University, carried out in 2017, showed that they are also prone to longer hours, and struggle to set boundaries between work and home life. Even before the pandemic, remote workers reported comparatively high stress levels, according to a 2017 UN report (41% of remote workers compared with 25% of office workers). For every Awin, which has 70 volunteers working in five taskforces (known as Wherever/Whenever; Office Redesign; Four-Day Week; Change in Mindset and Culture; Ease Workloads), there is another organisation whose employees feel abandoned. “My company has decided to go fully remote and I am despairing about it,” says Paul, an IT developer. “I used to be notorious for how fast I worked, but it was because I’d give myself incentives – lunch with a colleague, or getting out on time for a drink. Now I mostly feel like I’m wading through treacle.” Some employees are working at an unsustainable speed because they don’t want to be forced back into an office, or because they are afraid they will lose their jobs. Juliet, who works in exhibitions, tells me: “Everybody is up for the chop. I’m trying to be as indispensable as I can. I find myself logging on at all times. The boundary between on and off is very blurred. We’re all vying to show how productive we are.” Laura, a manager who works in the energy industry, also struggles with virtual presenteeism. “Leading a team, I feel pressure to be available and online through extended hours. I need to believe it’s OK to close the laptop and switch off.” Lucy, who works in marketing and has small children, tells me she is at breaking point: “Every moment is interrupted or interruptible. My husband and I both work every weekday evening to keep up, despite not having a commute to eat into our time. There are no real breaks.” This autumn marks a critical moment in our work culture: could it be the tipping point where office work changes unrecognisably, and for the better? Or will less enlightened organisations see it as a chance to lower their overheads, encouraging staff to work remotely and then failing to support or nurture them? For now, a hybrid model, blending the best of both worlds, looks the best bet. If you eliminate the office completely, Emma Morley argues, you eliminate “the culture and community that a business creates, and the opportunities for human beings to thrive and grow”. Whatever they choose to do, employers need to embrace the fact that this has been a year of unimaginably rapid change for their staff. Getting work wrong could lead to an epidemic of burnout. But getting it right could have huge dividends, for everyone. All employee names have been changed."
"The former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has returned to his roots as an investment banker with a job spearheading environmental and social investing for a Toronto-based asset manager. Carney will join Brookfield Asset Management, which ranks as the world’s second-largest investor in climate-friendly businesses behind the US firm Blackstone with about $550bn in assets under management. Bruce Flatt, Brookfield’s chief executive, said Carney would join the firm as vice-chairman and steer its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment strategy, with the task of marrying double-digit returns with positive social and environmental outcomes. A Canadian who also holds Irish and British citizenships, Carney left the Bank of England in March just before the Covid-19 crisis hit the UK and the government forced the economy into lockdown. City analysts expected him to be courted by the world’s largest investment firms after a lifetime building up one of the most extensive contacts books in the finance industry. Blackrock, which employs the former chancellor George Osborne, was known to be interested. Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker who was governor of Canada’s central bank for five years until 2013 when he took over at Threadneedle Street, was also the head of the G20’s financial stability board for eight years from 2011, which put him in touch with a wide range of finance ministers, central bank governors and sovereign wealth fund bosses. He moved back to Ottawa, Canada’s capital city, fuelling speculation that he planned to go into politics. In January Boris Johnson appointed Carney his finance adviser for the flagship COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, but this was delayed by a year due to the Covid crisis. Carney is also a UN special envoy for climate and finance. “Based on our fundraising capacity, the operating businesses and background that we have, and Mark’s relationships and strategic knowledge of this area, I think we can become a category killer in ESG investing,” Flatt said. It is not known how much Carney will be paid at Brookfield, but while at the Bank, Carney was one of the world’s best-paid central bankers with remuneration of £882,885 including pension benefits and a housing allowance during the last financial year. He said last year in an interview: “The question particularly for asset owners, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others is: How are you oriented? Are you on the right side, or the wrong side, of history?” He added: “I didn’t want to just go back into the private sector, to straight commercial life. Having something where I could see the potential impact and the marrying of the commercial with the purpose was pretty important to me.”"
"The traditional end-of-summer commuter crush appears unlikely to materialise next week as companies and staff shun the office and embrace remote working, prompting a warning from the UK’s leading business body about the future of firms that rely on passing trade. Hundreds of thousands of mostly white-collar workers are expected to continue working from home, in some cases permanently, despite the reopening of schools in England over the next fortnight. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 firms, has called on businesses and the government to strike a balance to ensure outlets in sparsely populated city centres do not face oblivion. “Remote working has been a real success for many firms and employees, and none of the many benefits should be lost,” said the CBI’s deputy director general, Josh Hardie. “But there has also been a knock-on effect to our town and city centres, where many businesses dependent on passing trade face an uphill battle just to survive. “Both the government and business have a role to play in supporting more people back to the workplace safely and securely. Things won’t return to how businesses operated pre-Covid-19, nor should they. But there is a middle ground to find as the economy reopens.” Train operators said on Wednesday that they were beginning to ramp up services to normal levels, with capacity due to hit more than 90% from 7 September as school holidays come to an end and many parents go back to work. Passengers will be invited to use National Rail’s Alert Me app that will provide up-to-the-minute information about which trains are busy, to help people practise social distancing. But plans being drawn up by several major businesses indicate that the end of summer and the reopening of schools will not herald a return to the urban rush hour of old. Lloyds Banking Group has said it is reviewing its office space needs and exploring new ways of working after concluding that 50,000 of its 65,000 staff have worked from home effectively during the pandemic. It plans to distribute more equipment such as laptops to staff to enable them to work in a more agile way. The Wall Street giant JP Morgan, which employs 16,000 people in the UK, is expected to let investment banking staff rotate between the office and home working on a permanent basis. Around 20% of its UK staff have returned to the office, and the proportion is set to increase over the coming months. Junior recruits who are still in training are among the few staff required to show up in person from 8 September. NatWest – formerly Royal Bank of Scotland – will adopt a hybrid model, with 50,000 of its 65,000 staff working from home at least until 2021, with some element of the new working model retained beyond that. HSBC wants some of its 52,000 staff to start coming back to the office but will cap building capacity at 20%. The law firm Linklaters announced this week that all of its global staff could spend 20-50% their time working remotely from now on under its “long-term agile working policy”. Some firms are planning phased returns before the end of the year. Barclays will ask some of the three-fifths of its 50,000 staff still working from home to start coming into the office in waves from October.  Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the business leaders’ group the Institute of Directors, said there was no guarantee things would snap back to normal come the end of the summer holidays, even with schools reopening. “Many businesses have found remote working suits them and their people, with commuting costs cut to a minimum,” he said. “The benefits of the office for some firms shouldn’t be understated: it can often provide more informal development and a better working environment for staff. However, the pandemic could see a lasting shift for some office jobs.” The Trades Union Congress called on employers not to assume that parents were now able to come into the office. “Although schools are returning, employers must recognise that not all childcare settings will be open yet,” said its general secretary, Frances O’Grady. “They must be flexible where parents still need childcare, and make sure everyone can travel safely.” The TUC reminded firms of their duty to carry out risk assessments to ensure staff could return safely, and it called on employers to share the results with employees."
"British Gas is to pay out a total of £1.73m for failures in the way it handled a switchover of payment provider for its prepayment customers. The UK’s largest energy supplier has paid £1.48m in compensation to affected customers, who pay for their energy in advance through top-ups rather than bills, and £250,000 to the energy regulator Ofgem’s energy redress fund. The payments relate to British Gas’s failure to inform some of its most vulnerable customers about a change of top-up provider, from Paypoint to Payzone, and a change in minimum top-up spend from £1 to £5. The energy provider, which is owned by Centrica, informed most of its customers in December 2019 about the changes, which came into effect on 1 January 2020, but failed to notify around 270,000 people. As a result, Ofgem found that some customers could have had their energy supply cut off in the middle of winter, or could have made wasted journeys to shops where they were no longer able to top up their accounts. In addition, affected customers were not able to contact British Gas by telephone on its general enquiries line on the day the changes came into force. British Gas finally contacted some affected customers in late January, weeks after the changes were introduced. Ofgem found that the customers who were notified in advance were given insufficient time to switch energy suppliers if they found British Gas’s new arrangements to be unsuitable. The notice to customers contained only internet links to information about the changes rather than a telephone number, which could have disadvantaged people without internet access. Ofgem has decided not to take formal enforcement against the energy supplier following British Gas’s decision to make the payments. Philippa Pickford, Ofgem’s director of retail, criticised British Gas’s failure to inform its customers of changes during winter. “When such a fundamental change is being made, such as where meters can be topped up, energy suppliers need to communicate with their customers in plenty of time,” she said. “British Gas should have informed all of their prepayment customers, many whom are in vulnerable situations, of the change to how to top-up their meters.” All energy suppliers should learn lessons from this case, said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, and added it was “unacceptable” that people risked having their energy supply cut off in winter due to poor communications. “Households with pre-payment meters are disproportionately likely to be on lower incomes, have children or include people with health conditions,” Guy said. “It’s critical that suppliers take extra care and make sure changes like this don’t put people at risk.”"
"WPP has highlighted the glacial pace at which staff are returning to work as the coronavirus lockdown eases, with just 3% of UK employees regularly heading in to its offices. The world’s biggest employer in the marketing and advertising sector, which has clients spanning Ford to Facebook, has a workforce of about 10,000 in the UK. WPP revealed on Wednesday that just 300 staff are working in its British offices, as the company takes a cautious approach to health and safety and embraces the homeworking revolution. The UK is lagging behind WPP’s other most important European market, Germany, where 17% of staff are back in the office. However, in markets where the pandemic is still widespread the prospect of a significant return to work remains distant. In the US, where WPP employs 19,000 staff, office working is at 1%. And all WPP’s 8,000 staff in India are still working remotely. The sluggish rate of the return to work chimes with a report from the Centre for Cities, which found that overall just 17% of workers in British cities had returned to offices by early August. The data, based on mobile phone signals, showed no increase in the footfall of workers going to city centres between late June and the week starting 3 August. The new data underscore the challenge facing Boris Johnson, who is desperate to get people back to work to help reignite spending in towns and cities. “The costs of office closures are becoming clearer by the day,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry. “Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities.” PricewaterhouseCoopers, which employs 22,000 staff in the UK, said this month it had just a little over a quarter of staff spending time in one of its 20 offices. The “big four” accountancy firm is aiming to get to 50% capacity by the end of September, but returning to work will be voluntary. The Office for National Statistics has said footfall in mid-August in high streets, retail parks and shopping centres had only reached 70% of levels a year ago. WPP has issued guidelines to its agencies that limit office capacity to 20%, with the possibility of moving to 30% occupancy in the future if further health and safety requirements can be met. Returning to work is voluntary at WPP and the majority of those who have gone back to the office are younger staff members who have found remote working challenging because of a lack of space at home. Mark Read, WPP chief executive, said he expected the numbers of staff heading to work will increase as more offices are opened, but health and safety comes first. “While I am concerned about small businesses and footfall in central London, where most of our people work, there is a need to give people the confidence that it is safe as numbers returning rise,” he said. “We are going to think much more flexibly. I don’t think 99% of people working from home is sustainable in the long term, but neither do I think a 99% return to the office is.”"
"Australia’s biggest super fund, the $180bn AustralianSuper, has dismissed as inadequate Rio Tinto’s decision to strip bonuses from executives over the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Ian Silk, the chief executive of AustralianSuper, said a report into the debacle by Rio Tinto’s board “highlights profound systemic, operational and governance failings”. “AustralianSuper has met with the chair of Rio Tinto and expressed our view that the proposed penalties fall significantly short of appropriate accountability for those responsible,” Silk said. “We have asked the board to reconsider its response and are continuing to engage with the company on the matter.” Silk did not say what additional action AustralianSuper wanted. It is believed the fund, which owns about $1.3bn in Rio Tinto shares, is yet to receive a response to its demands from the company. Rio Tinto destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received five separate reports on the significance of the sites since 2013. On Monday, Rio Tinto said it would strip about $5m in bonuses from chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and about $1m in bonuses from iron ore boss Chris Salisbury after the company “failed to meet some of its own internal standards and procedures in relation to the responsible management and protection of cultural heritage”. The internal review has received criticism from industry and shareholder groups. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the review was “highly disappointing” and “little more than a public relations exercise.” “Tens of thousands of years of cultural significance get blown up and all that goes to show for it is $7m of lost remuneration,” ACCR’s James Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that was “pocket change for these highly paid executives” and that Jacques and Niven should lose their jobs. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors said the review “does not deliver any meaningful accountability”. “Remuneration appears to be the only sanction applied to executives,” the council’s chief executive, Louise Davidson, said. “This raises the question – does the company feel that £4m [about $7m] is the right price for the destruction of cultural heritage?” The $52bn super fund Hesta said investors are concerned risks aren’t being appropriately managed after the destruction of the Juukan Gorge. Hesta says it has outlined its investor expectations in a letter to 14 Australian mining and energy companies. “We are committed to engaging with companies to understand how they are managing these issues, and we will consider using our voting rights where we identify the need for improved practices and disclosure,” the Hesta CEO, Debby Blakey, said. Blakey said investors were dismayed at the destruction of culturally significant sites at Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto."
"The Treasury has told a new bank customer complaints body to prepare for an influx of grievances over government-backed Covid loans. The Business Banking Resolution Service (BBRS) – set to launch in mid-November - was preparing to tackle cases dating back to 2001. But its chair, Lewis Shand Smith, said the unprecedented surge in business lending during the pandemic – starting with the state-guaranteed coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) – had forced it to shift focus. “We’ve been certainly encouraged by the Treasury to be to be ready to deal with complaints that arise out of Covid loans,” Shand Smith said. “For example, it could be because somebody hasn’t been given a loan and they think they should have, or that the conditions changed, the regulations changed … and they wanted to change the loan into a different one.” The BBRS will give independent decisions on disputes between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and their lenders. It was the industry’s response to the 2018 Walker review into how the sector should deal with SME complaints around consumer lending, which is unregulated in the UK. Its services will be open to businesses with an annual turnover of between £6.5m and £10m whose claims cannot be handled by the Financial Ombudsman Service, which will be the first port of call for SMEs who applied to the smaller bounce-back loans scheme. It means the BBRS will be poised to handle disputes arising from a portion of the approximately £14bn worth of CBILS loans that have so far been granted to 60,000 businesses across the UK. Banks have received more than 123,000 applications for CBILS loans, which are worth up to £5m and come with an 80% government guarantee. The smaller bounce-back loans, worth up to £50,000, are not covered by the BBRS. Eligible businesses can also raise concerns with the BBRS over the terms of standard commercial loans issued outside of the government loan programme. Each claimant will be assigned a “customer champion” by the BBRS to help them assemble their case and prove they are eligible for the resolution programme. Efforts will be made to settle the case informally, but will otherwise go through mediation, and if necessary, formal adjudication. Seven of the UK’s largest banks have signed up to the BBRS and must pay up to £600,000 if a case is ruled in the customers’ favour.  However, borrowers who took out Covid loans with one of the other 90-plus accredited CBILS lenders will not have access to the BBRS. Shand Smith said his team was hoping to bring new lenders into the scheme. “Because it is a voluntary scheme we can’t force them to sign up. But I think – I suspect – if things go wrong with them, we’ll find exactly the same [thing] as what happened after 2008, there will be a huge level of political pressure because the businesses will go to their MPs.”  The Treasury said in a statement: “Our loan schemes have provided lifelines to hundreds of thousands of firms during the crisis. We’ve always been clear these are repayable, government-backed loans and that decisions around approvals are for lenders in accordance with the guidance.”  This article was amended on 22 September 2020 to note that the BBRS will handle disputes arising from a portion of the CBILS loans that have so far been granted to 60,000 businesses, not all as an earlier version could have implied, and to reinstate a quote from the Treasury that had been mistakenly removed during the editing process. In addition, after publication, the BBRS confirmed that each claimant will be assigned a “customer champion”, not a “consumer champion” as a spokesperson originally said. "
"The fast-fashion retailer Boohoo has been selling clothes made by at least 18 factories in Leicester that audits say have failed to prove they pay the minimum wage to workers, a Guardian investigation has found. Third-party audit reports produced over the past four years make claims of “critical” issues over record-keeping and working hours at the time they were written, suggesting that in parts of the supply chain workers may be paid as little as £3-£4 an hour. Disclosed alongside new whistleblower claims about Boohoo’s supply chain, the confidential reports provide a snapshot of alleged issues in a factory at a specific time. They pose a new challenge to the brand’s insistence that issues reported in July were simply evidence of “the actions of a few” and stood in contrast to “the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area”. Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, where many of the factories are based, said the allegations suggested “an unforgivable breakdown of our basic social contract” and called on Boohoo to urgently release a full list of its suppliers in the city. Boohoo said the documentation seen by the Guardian “appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed”. But it added that its own investigations “have highlighted similar issues” in some of the manufacturers identified by the Guardian and that it had suspended trading with them until its concerns were resolved. Claims in the documents, which were described by one expert as “a smoking gun” on Boohoo and other brands’ oversight of minimum wage issues, detail allegations of: The reports, which date from 2017 to just a few months ago, came alongside whistleblower claims of other violations in Leicester’s factories. Industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they had seen dozens more that raised similar concerns at other Boohoo suppliers. There is no suggestion that Boohoo had access to the reports, which were circulated to some factory managers and other brands. The company, which has been accused in the past of turning a blind eye to issues in its supply chain, has its own oversight process for factories in Leicester. On its own investigations, Boohoo said: “Due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers … we have immediately suspended orders with a number of suppliers whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the Guardian.” It added that it was “deeply concerned by these findings” but said that until its own investigations and an independent QC-led review were complete “it would be inappropriate for us to comment further”. The brand did not clarify which of the factories it had suspended. Eight of the 18 companies denied some or all of the claims set out in the audits, with some calling them historical or saying they did not represent typical standards. The other 10 did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Audit reports are a central part of how fashion brands assess working practices in factories before deciding whether to place orders. But while they may be circulated within the industry, until now the reports have not been released publicly, even when they raise concerns over possible minimum-wage violations. “We have long known these reports exist, but brands never release them,” said Nik Hammer, an associate professor in employment studies at the University of Leicester and author of a 2015 report on the city’s textiles industry. He said they appeared to be “a smoking gun on industry oversight of minimum-wage issues. These [findings] are classic signs of a risk of violations, and they are absolutely consistent with what I’ve heard over the years.” The reports came alongside separate claims from one worker at Pro Fashion Limited, a subcontractor making clothes for Boohoo and its sister brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal.  The worker showed the Guardian a recent “official” payslip. It showed them earning the £8.72 legal minimum wage. Separately, the worker had what they described as a “shadow” payslip which was handwritten and they said showed many hours more had been worked. That suggested the real rate was just £6 an hour. Pro Fashion denied the claims, saying it “follows the government guidelines of paying minimum wage … [and] does not issue any other payslip as you mention”. It said it “transfers wages to our employees direct to their bank account”. An estimated 70-80% of clothes produced in Leicester are for Boohoo, Nasty Gal and PrettyLittleThing. Concerns over the company’s supply chain have been raised repeatedly over the years by campaign groups, the media and MPs, including the Conservative Andrew Bridgen in a speech to parliament earlier this year. But the brand and the government have until recently largely ignored calls for reform. The scrutiny intensified again this summer after the Guardian revealed claims that Leicester textile firms had breached lockdown measures, and the Sunday Times reported that one Boohoo supplier had offered an undercover reporter £3.50 an hour. The Manchester-based brand had £1.5bn wiped off its share price in two days in July amid growing investor concern over practices within its supply chain. When the lockdown claims first emerged, Boohoo said they were inaccurate and that it “categorically does not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance … with our strict code of conduct”. With investors deserting the firm, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding the company do more to protect workers in its supply chain, it announced plans to set up a “model factory” in Leicester where workers would be treated fairly, and set up an independent review. It also said it would increase an inspection programme led by the third-party auditor Verisio. But critics say the whistleblower accounts and reports seen by the Guardian provide a worrying snapshot of the problems within the industry, particularly over alleged minimum-wage violations.  At Onyx Fashion, a Boohoo supplier, one audit claimed managers admitted full-time workers were being falsely recorded as working part-time hours – an allegation the company “vehemently denied”. A 2018 report on Ezili Dariyai, which mainly produced leisurewear, said timesheets were not signed by workers and minimum-wage payments could not be verified. The company then went into liquidation, owing more than £600,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, causing Mahomed Hanif Musa Patel to be struck off as a director. He did not respond to requests for comment. Another firm, Bux Clothing, was accused in a 2017 audit of failing to keep proper records of working hours, making it impossible to verify the payment of minimum wage. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Bux Clothing is one of five textile firms in Leicester to separately be issued with improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over hygiene and social distancing measures since the city’s second lockdown, alongside I Design Leicester, Clothing Pallet, VR Mode Limited and Smart Garments. All five complied with the notices. As well as Bux, the Guardian has established through worker interviews that Smart Garments is also a Boohoo supplier. Smart Garments did not dispute the HSE’s findings that it “failed to put reasonably practicable control measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19” but said the body was “satisfied with our risk assessment and how we managed the factory in the current Covid environment”. Boohoo did not comment on the improvement notices. Dominique Muller, whose report on Leicester factories in lockdown for the campaign group Labour Behind the Label prompted the recent Boohoo storm, claimed the range of the audits showed that “the idea that this could go on without Boohoo’s knowledge or tacit acceptance, it’s a complete fallacy. They hold the power in Leicester, and it’s disingenuous to pretend anything else.”"
"Qantas has rejected calls for its chief executive, Alan Joyce, to resign after the airline announced plans to cut almost 2,500 ground staff jobs in a move labelled “economic violence” and “an evil act of corporate bastardry”. The airline on Tuesday said it planned to hire an external company to provide services including baggage handling and plane cleaning at 10 large Australian airports. Its move comes just two months after it announced a “three-year plan to accelerate its recovery from the Covid crisis and create a stronger platform for future profitability” that included axing about 6,000 of its 29,000 workers. Together, the two rounds of axings are set to result in the company shedding about 30% of its workforce. Qantas last week blamed a loss for the year of $2bn on the coronavirus crisis. But Joyce maintained his aggressive attitude towards rival Virgin Australia, which is in administration, declaring last week that after the crisis ended Qantas would be “the only Australian airline that can fly long haul”. Tuesday’s move was immediately condemned by the union that covers ground staff at Qantas, the Transport Workers Union. Its national secretary, Michael Kaine, called on Joyce to resign, saying the airline boss had committed “economic violence” against workers and claiming Qantas had squandered more than $500m in government support. “Qantas has taken millions in jobkeeper wage subsidies, more than any other company, with the express intent of keeping people employed,” Kaine said. “But now Alan Joyce wants to destroy thousands more livelihoods. This is callous abuse of public money.” He called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to step in and take an equity stake in Qantas, which he said was floundering in a crisis that has gripped the entire aviation sector. “Scott Morrison, stop kow-towing to this corporate dictatorship,” he said. The Labor senator Tony Sheldon, who formerly occupied Kaine’s position, said the new job cuts were “an evil act of corporate bastardry from some of the highest paid executives in the world”. “They are cruelly axing the jobs of 2,400 people who stuck by them when times were tough only to find they are expendable,” he said. The chief executive of Qantas’s domestic division, Andrew David, said calls for Joyce to resign were “not worthy of a response”. Qantas said it received $515m from the government, of which $267m was jobkeeper payments to keep people employed. The remainder was a subsidy to run flights including a skeleton domestic schedule and repatriation flights. The airline said that its net benefit from the government subsidies was just $15m. “We’re very grateful for it [jobkeeper] here at Qantas,” David said. “We’re not looking to extend people’s tenure in the organisation artificially so they can receive jobkeeper and then make them redundant at that point in time. “It’s certainly not fair to the Australian taxpayer to do that. “This is a terrible situation, these are very hard decisions to make.” Joyce has previously lashed premiers for closing borders to protect their states from the spread of coronavirus. David said that border closures, along with the lack of a vaccine and the certainty of a “deep recession”, were among the reasons why Qantas had decided to make a second series of job cuts. But Gareth Evans, the head of Qantas’s budget division, Jetstar, said it would have made no difference if premiers had agreed to open their borders at a national cabinet meeting last week. “We’ve seen examples where borders have opened and then closed again,” he said. “The uncertainty that is wrought by the way that this disease is playing out is having a huge impact on the business and we just don’t know how long this is going to last.” The cuts will hit Qantas and Jetstar staff at airports in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin, Cairns, Townsville, Alice Springs and Canberra. Qantas said it already outsources ground services at 55 other airports. The company estimated the cuts would save the company $100m a year in wages and equipment maintenance costs. In a letter to staff, obtained by Guardian Australia, it also said the cuts meant it would not have to spend $80m on a planned equipment upgrade. “Due to the significant financial impact Covid has had on our business we no longer have access to the cash to invest in modernising this equipment,” Qantas said in the letter. Under an enterprise agreement with the TWU, ground staff at Qantas will be able to make a counter-bid to keep their jobs. However, they face an uphill battle as Qantas estimates it can save as much as 40% by outsourcing the work to an external company. Employees are to submit their bid by 16 October, according to a schedule distributed to workers by the company. Jetstar workers have no such agreement and do not have the ability to submit a bid of their own. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia’s administrators have told unsecured creditors of the airline, including bondholders owed about $2bn, that they stand to receive as little as 8.4c in the dollar. But they will receive less – or nothing at all – if they attempt to knock back an offer to buy the airline put forward by US private equity group Bain, administrators from Deloitte said in a report to creditors circulated on Tuesday. The report came ahead of a meeting of creditors set for 4 September at which they are to vote on the Bain proposal. But creditors, who also include aircraft financiers, suppliers and staff, have little chance of stopping Bain taking control of Virgin because the administrators have the power to sell the assets of the company without approval. Employees are to get everything they are owed under the Bain deal, at a cost of about $448m. Bain has also agreed to take on responsibility for about $600m in travel credits and booked flights that haven’t been taken yet. Key suppliers to the airline fare a little better than bondholders – they are to receive around 14c in the dollar. But the most bondholders can hope for is 12.8c in the dollar, according to modelling conducted by Deloitte. A group of bondholders had hoped to put an alternative proposal to the meeting, but this now appears unlikely to happen. “We have set out our opinion to creditors that it is in their interest to approve the deed of company arrangement proposed by Bain Capital as it provides for the best return to creditors in what are extraordinary circumstances, and that were impossible to foresee,” the lead administrator, Vaughan Strawbridge, said. “This will provide certainty for the business under new and committed owners. It provides certainty for employees and customers, a return to creditors, and it can be completed sooner, and at less cost than other alternatives.” “It achieves all the objectives of the voluntary administration process that we sought from the outset. Now we just need to bring the airline out of administration as soon as possible.” Virgin Australia’s board of directors put the group into administration in April after the company’s repeated requests for a government bailout were refused."
"Tesco is to permanently employ 16,000 extra staff taken on during the pandemic to help support a surge in online grocery trade. The roles include 10,000 pickers, who select and pack grocery orders for home delivery, and 3,000 drivers, as well as a variety of other roles in stores and distribution centres. Tesco’s move comes after the electrical goods specialist AO.com, the DIY chain Kingfisher and the delivery firms DPD and Hermes hired thousands more workers combined to cope with the rise in home deliveries. However, the shift online has hit high streets hard, with Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Boots among the chains shutting stores and cutting jobs. London department store Liberty is also planning redundancies via a voluntary scheme under which at least 50 of its 550-plus UK team are expected to go. The UK’s biggest supermarket said it had already hired 4,000 other permanent staff since the start of the pandemic, during which it took on more than 40,000 temporary workers to help cope with higher demand and to cover for those forced to self-isolate. Some of those workers, who included pilots, pub staff and others put on furlough from their usual jobs, have now returned to their posts or found new work elsewhere. The hiring comes as online groceries have risen to 16% of Tesco’s sales during the pandemic, up from about 9% at the beginning of the year. The supermarket is expecting online sales of £5.5bn this year, up from £3.3bn last year. The supermarket’s experience reflects rapid growth in online sales across the UK so that home deliveries now account for 13.5% of the grocery market, up from 7.4% before lockdown. Overall grocery sales are also up strongly as the move to working from home and closure of schools prompted a switch to home cooked meals and away from meals at restaurants, coffee shops and canteens. The growth in the online market has prompted Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose all to expand their delivery networks. Amazon has also stepped up its activity, offering its Prime subscription customers free grocery delivery. The supermarkets are also gearing up to make the most of Ocado’s switch from partnering with Waitrose to Marks & Spencer next week which could prompt some shoppers to change provider. Online growth is not expected to be particularly helpful for profits at the supermarkets, however, as the need to take on new staff, buy vans and add other equipment for delivery systems all add to costs and potentially take sales away from stores. But retail analyst Clive Black said that a move towards larger online orders and better efficiency was helping. “The step-up in the overall value of the UK grocery market, in revenue terms, and the migration from modest loss-making to marginal profitability [online] means that we see the UK supermarkets as emerging butter side up from the step-change in online grocery activity,” he said. Tesco brought in 400 extra vans and changed shopping hours so more orders could be picked in stores to help expand its service to almost 1.5 million customers a week online, up from about 600,000 at the start of the pandemic. Jason Tarry, the head of Tesco in the UK and Ireland, said: “Since the start of the pandemic, our colleagues have helped us to more than double our online capacity, safely serving nearly 1.5 million customers every week and prioritising vulnerable customers to ensure they get the food they need. These new roles will help us continue to meet online demand for the long term.” Alongside creating the permanent roles, Tesco said it planned to support the government’s Kickstart work placement scheme by offering places to 1,000 young people. More than 80 young people will join internship schemes in stores, distribution centres and offices next month. Almost 50 students also joined Tesco’s summer internship programme this year, which was delivered virtually."
"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund the US Postal Service, amid ongoing complaints by Democrats that the Trump administration is attempting to sabotage the delivery of mail-in ballots ahead of the presidential election in November. The Democratic bill, which passed on Saturday despite opposition from Republicans, would provide $25bn in aid for the USPS and prioritize election mail as “first class”, to ensure ballots arrive in time to be counted in an election in which the coronavirus pandemic will cast a shadow over in-person voting. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, said the bill was necessary to “reject the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the critical mission of the postal service”. On the floor of the House, James Comer of Kentucky, the ranking Republican on the oversight committee, said the Democrats’ bill was the “result of a legislative process only slightly less absurd than the conspiracies, insinuations, and fabrications that gave rise to the purported need for it”. The bill is unlikely to progress further, with the Republican-held Senate unwilling to pass it. After Saturday’s vote Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the Senate would “absolutely not pass” the stand-alone bill.  The White House has also signalled it would veto the bill, with Republicans claiming the postal service has plenty of cash on hand and is being used by Democrats for political purposes. Democrats have accused Louis DeJoy, a major donor to Donald Trump who is now postmaster general, of implementing cost-cutting measures meant to slow the mail, with the intention of aiding Trump in the election. Trump has falsely claimed there is widespread fraud in mail-in ballots, stating that “nobody knows what’s happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots”. Experts have pointed out there is no evidence to support these claims and Trump himself has voted via the mail multiple times himself. On Friday, DeJoy conceded that mail delivery had slowed down but refused to reinstate hundreds of mail sorting machines that have been removed, ostensibly because of a decline in deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic. He has, however, reversed a plan to remove hundreds more of the machines ahead of the election. On Saturday the Democratic chair of the House oversight committee, Carolyn B Maloney of New York, released internal USPS documents from a briefing to DeJoy on 12 August. Maloney said DeJoy had been warned of “steep declines and increasing delays nationwide over the last two months as a result of his drastic operational and organizational changes”. In a statement, Maloney said: “To those who still claim there are ‘no delays’ and that these reports are just ‘conspiracy theories’, I hope this new data causes them to re-think their position and support our urgent legislation today. “We have all seen the headlines from every corner of our country, we have read the stories and seen pictures, we have heard directly from our constituents, and these new documents show that the delays are far worse than we were told.” Later on Saturday, after playing golf, Trump weighed in again on Twitter with a rambling complaint including more claims regarding voter fraud. “This is all another HOAX by the Democrats,” the president wrote, “to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes, without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam … Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!” As has been pointed out repeatedly, mail-in ballots and absentee ballots are the same thing. Trump is opposed to the practice of proactively sending ballots to voters, which many states are pursuing during the coronavirus pandemic."
"Treasury predicts Australia’s effective unemployment will top 13% before the end of the year, with the Covid outbreak in Victoria hampering the recovery which saw real unemployment fall to 9.8% in July, down from a peak of 14.4% in April. The sobering figure is contained in the treasurer’s July employment analysis, which also shows the Northern Territory registering the highest effective unemployment rate in the country at 12.1%, followed by Queensland at 11.4% and Victoria at 10.5%. The ACT recorded the lowest unemployment rate, at 5.2%, followed by Tasmania at 7.9% and New South Wales at 8.5%. South Australia and Western Australia finished in the middle at 9.8%. Effective unemployment is the number of unemployed people looking for work, combined with the number of people who are still technically employed, because of stimulus measures such as jobkeeper, but working no hours, and the number of unemployed people who have given up looking for work. Last month, the official unemployment rate released by the ABS, which does not count people who have dropped out of the labour force or people who have worked zero hours and are on jobkeeper – recorded Australia’s jobless rate as 7.5%. In his analysis, treasurer Josh Frydenberg was looking for the positives. “We know the road to recovery will be bumpy as we have seen with the setback in Victoria, however, the jobs recovery across the rest of the country gives cause for optimism that through containing the spread of the virus and reopening the economy we will get through this,” he said in a statement. “Treasury estimates show that nearly 700,000 people have gained effective employment since April recovering more than half of the jobs lost or those who were stood down on zero hours at the start of the crisis. “There is still a long way to go through this crisis and high frequency data is showing signs that the jobs recovery may be slowing as state border closures have been tightened.” The nature of the pandemic’s impact on the workforce, along with the government’s stimulus responses, has made measuring unemployment in the usual sense more difficult. Analysts have begun looking to the hours worked measure in the ABS statistics to get a better idea of who remains working, in the workforce. Last month, the employment data showed a record 1 million Australians were now without a job but were actively looking for work, while another 165,000 people worked no hours, but were counted as employed because of jobkeeper. Jobkeeper will be extended until March next year, as part of legislation introduced to the parliament this sitting, but Labor is already pushing for further clarity on what will happen beyond the new end date, when the impact of the global recession begins to bite. On Sunday, outgoing finance minister Mathias Cormann said the nation needed to prepare for a time when businesses were weaned off the stimulus packages. “Clearly we need to transition out of this,” Cormann said. “… the appropriate period we are proposing jobkeeper is to the end of March, and that is another six months beyond the original timetable. “At some point, we need to get back into a situation where viable profitable businesses pay for the wages of their employees out of their income, rather than on the bias of taxpayers support.” Frydenberg too, was turning toward recovery. “Our jobmaker plan is designed to rebuild our economy and includes the $1bn jobtrainer fund we announced last month to help create 340,700 new training places and a further $1.5bn in support for small and medium businesses to retain their apprentices,” he said. “We will continue to do what is necessary to contain the spread of the virus and support the recovery, with the Morrison government’s unprecedented level of support totalling $314bn supporting millions of Australians through this challenging period.”"
"News that STA Travel has become the latest to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted an outpouring of sadness and nostalgia from former customers and staff. Known for its enthusiastic staff and its budget round-the-world plane tickets, generations of students would flock to STA Travel stores to book gap years and summer breaks through the company – or simply to gaze longingly at the adventures it promised. Its bright yellow and blue signage has been a familiar sight on high streets and university campuses for decades, but now after it confirmed it had ceased trading on Friday, 54 UK stores look set to close their doors, putting 500 jobs at risk. Lowri Lloyd Owen from near Aberystwyth worked for the company for 10 years, first as a travel expert and then as a store manager. She said she felt “extremely saddened” when she heard the news. The job enabled her to move to Australia, where she lived for eight years and started her family. “The 10 years I spent working for this company taught me so much, took me to places far and wide and I met lifelong friends along the way, many of whom are still employees and will be facing very difficult times ahead,” she said. “Selling travel is the most awesome thing you can sell someone.” She was not surprised by the reaction to the news. “Whether you were an STA customer or an employee, it was a company that supported young people often at the start of their travels or career and that stays with you,” she said. Tim Walker, who runs Beaumont Music and lives in West Sussex, was one of the company’s loyal customers when he was a student in the early 2000s. He used the travel agent from the age of 18 to 22 to book his gap-year adventure as well as summer trips while at university. “I remember booking flights to Mexico and the staff member calling over a colleague who had just returned from their own trip. We were excited anyway but as this guy launched himself over the desk towards us, his enthusiasm was ridiculously infectious and all they wanted to do was to make sure we had a fantastic time.” Walker says the demise of STA Travel was a “real loss” to future students wanting to go on their first big trips abroad as they won’t be able to benefit from STA’s experienced staff. Ronke Adewa-Faboro, a wedding planner from Essex, was an international student studying at De Montfort University in Leicester in the 90s when she went to STA Travel to book her dream holiday. “I booked to spend Christmas in New York. I had always wanted to do it and I asked a couple of friends to go but they didn’t want to. So I was a little discouraged, but decided to go anyway.” STA Travel made her feel more comfortable about going on her own. They produced flyers about solo travel for women, which Adewa-Faboro studied before going. “I was a solo traveller, aged 19, and my family in Nigeria thought I was crazy. But I thought I only live once so I just decided to do it. STA made me feel really safe about it. I had six magical days there. “The team were amazing in making a foreign student from Nigeria’s dream come true. Money was tight so they booked me into two separate hostels to save me money. They were brilliant.” It wasn’t just students booking gap years and post-university travels. STA Travel, founded by two Australian backpackers in Melbourne in 1979, originally stood for Student Travel Australia, but it branched out to a wider customer base and rebranded itself to become Start the Adventure. Sophie Butler and her husband, Nick, booked their honeymoon with STA Travel in 2012 and have used them for other holidays since, including a trip to New York. “We chose them [for the honeymoon] because we were going to Australia so knew they would be experts. Also, for me, I never did the whole gap-year thing so it was my chance to travel as much as possible. “I remember going to their store in Covent Garden and a lovely lady – Annie, I think – helped us plan out the whole trip.” Butler, who runs the Sugar Tea Room in north London, said: “We were both sad to hear about STA travel closing because it wasn’t just for students, they had the best prices for long-haul travel.” Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne, the founder of the period product brand Freda, who lives in London, has fond memories of using STA Travel to go to the Gambia, Senegal and Guinea Bissau when she was a student more than 30 years ago. She said: “We used to have an STA in the University of London Union in the 80s when we still had holiday brochures and you could discuss your trip in person with someone who’d probably done that trip already. It wasn’t just the student discount but also the student perspective and tips in a non-internet era. I’m so sad to see it go.” Another former customer, Ellie Dix, a board game designer from Hertfordshire, has been reminiscing about Camp America, which she booked through STA Travel in the 90s. “I was at Birmingham University from 1994 to 1997 and we had an STA Travel on campus. I remember going and just gazing at the options as a sort of escapism from student life. I did Camp America for two years running in 1996 and 1997 and STA dealt with the travel. “I don’t remember actually thinking there was any other way to travel as a student other than with STA. It was STA or nothing.”"
"The government response to the coronavirus pandemic is on track to cost the public purse £210bn for the first six months of the crisis, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has said. Reflecting the scale of the emergency since March, the National Audit Office (NAO) said ministers had instigated more than 190 measures in response to the crisis so far, including emergency job support, additional NHS funding, and business grants. Equivalent to almost a quarter of the government’s annual budget for running the public sector, making welfare payments and investing in infrastructure, the £210bn sum, the NAO said, was the office’s latest cost-estimate of the government response. The analysis covers spending promises made by ministers up to 7 August, indicating that the final costs of the Covid-19 crisis for the public purse could be much higher. The NAO had previously estimated a price tag of more than £120bn for the period up to 4 May. Releasing details of the projects in a new “Covid cost tracker” keeping tabs on government spending announcements, the NAO said £70bn of the promised funds had been spent, and there were a number of measures still to be fully implemented. The analysis comes as pressure mounts on ministers to reveal the details of contracts awarded to private firms worth billions of pounds, including for the purchase of personal protective equipment and for the government’s virus test and trace system. According to the NAO, £1bn of the promised £10bn funding package for test and trace had been spent by the end of July. The government has awarded contracts for the scheme to private-sector firms, including Serco and Capita. The organisation said about half of the £15bn earmarked for personal protective equipment (PPE) had been spent by the end of July. The Treasury’s furlough scheme, with a price tag of £47bn, was the single most expensive intervention in the NAO tracker. With more than 9.6m jobs furloughed since March, at a cost of £35.4bn so far, the scheme has been widely credited with preventing mass unemployment during lockdown. However, there are growing calls on the government to extend furlough beyond its end date in October to prevent a spike in redundancies this autumn. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is weighing options for scaling back the government’s emergency pandemic response and raising taxes to combat a sharp increase in public borrowing. Driven by the sharp increase in spending and weak tax revenues amid the decline in economic activity, public-sector net debt has increased by £227.6bn over the past year to more than £2tn for the first time. National debt is at 100.5% of GDP for the first time since March 1961."
"Willie Walsh faced down a pay revolt on the final day of his 41-year career in aviation, bowing out as chief executive of British Airways owner IAG with a warning that the industry faces the gravest crisis in its history. Almost 30% of shareholders failed to back the company’s remuneration report, which awarded Walsh an £833,000 annual bonus that took his total earnings for 2019 to £3.2m. The deal was agreed before coronavirus sent the company’s finances into freefall and thousands of pilots, crew and ground staff were either sacked or forced to take substantial pay cuts. Provisional numbers issued at the end of IAG’s annual shareholder meeting in Madrid on Tuesday showed only 71.6% of investors had voted to approve directors’ pay awards, with about 20% voting against. IAG said it was “disappointed” by the vote and would engage with shareholders to understand their concerns. However, shareholders overwhelmingly backed one of Walsh’s final acts as IAG boss, the €2.75bn (£2.49bn) rights issue announced in July to shore up the company’s balance sheet during the Covid-19 crisis. Walsh issued a stark forecast as he departed, warning IAG could not expect 2019 levels of passenger demand to return until 2023 or even 2024. The IAG chief executive had delayed by six months his handover to Luis Gallego, the boss of BA’s sister airline Iberia, after the impact of thepandemic on aviation became clear. The 58-year-old Irishman said he was both retiring from IAG and leaving the aviation industry, where he started 41 years ago as a trainee pilot. He said he was leaving with the industry in “the worst crisis we have ever faced, far worse than both 9/11 and the financial crash in 2008”, and highlighted the change in the latest quarterly financial results – a swing of nearly €2.4bn for April-June from 2019 to 2020, when most planes were grounded and passenger numbers fell by 98.4%. He defended controversial moves to cut 12,000 BA staff and move others on to inferior contracts. He said: “We were quick to take action not only to address the immediate challenge we face from the pandemic but, critically, to enable us to emerge from the crisis in a strong position … ensuring that our businesses are the correct size and structure for the new operating environment in which they will find themselves.” Walsh also renewed his attack on the government’s quarantine rules for their “huge impact on an already troubled aviation industry”, calling for a more constructive approach from the government.  Heathrow airport has proposed cutting quarantine periodsby imposing a regime of airport testing and establishing air corridors with parts of the US that have recorded lower rates of Covid-19 infections, a plan Walsh said he backed. The outgoing IAG boss, who took control of the newly formed company in 2011 after plotting its creation via a £5bn merger with Iberia, said it had been “one hell of a journey since then”. He grew IAG with the acquisitions of Spanish no-frills airline Vueling and Aer Lingus – the Irish carrier where he had earlier made his name as a chief executive, slashing jobs to make it profitable. The group also launched a low-cost subsidiary, Level, to fend off the challenge of budget rivals, but it has failed to grow and Walsh said it would be pared back to a Barcelona base. He has become one of the global aviation business’s most respected figures, having led moves to industry consolidation and established IAG – until Covid-19 – as a highly profitable firm in an industry notorious for losses. However, he will leave with little love lost among thousands of BA employees, and cabin crew in particular. Unions fought a bitter dispute to preserve terms and conditions when he was running the airline directly, from 2005 to 2010. Now many long-serving staff have lost their jobs or been forced onto lower-paid contracts as BA, as Walsh has told politicians, “embraces reality” after coronavirus."
"US stock markets fell sharply again on Friday then rebounded in a volatile day of trading as investors soured on the high-flying tech companies that had driven markets to record highs. The S&P 500 fell 3% at the low point on Friday but ended down 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen 850 points, ended down 0.56%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 1.27% after regaining morning losses of 5%. All three indexes had dropped significantly on Thursday, their biggest one-day declines since June. In Europe stock markets also closed down. In London the FTSE dropped 0.88%, Germany’s DAX dropped 1.65% and in France the CAC dropped 0.89%. Asian markets had also closed down after Wall Street’s fall. The falls in the US were led by the technology sector, whose share prices have soared during the coronavirus pandemic as investors have bet more business will move permanently online. Tech’s soaring share price has reportedly been fueled by a $50bn bet on the sector by Japan’s SoftBank. The huge buying spree helped drive tech stocks and stock markets to new highs, The Wall Street Journal reported. And the unwinding of those trades may have contributed to the dramatic sell off. Shares of Apple fell 7%, while Facebook and Amazon slid more than 6%. Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft both fell at least 4%. Zoom, the video conferencing company whose shares were up 400% before the fall, lost another 4%. The share prices of all the companies still remain sharply up for the year and before Thursday the S&P 500 had been up in nine of the last 10 trading sessions. Michael Antonelli, the managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W Baird in Milwaukee, said the selloff so far appeared to be driven by profit-taking as investors cashed in some of the huge gains they have made on tech stocks. “Apple was going up 3-4% a day recently. I don’t know a world where people would not take some profits in that situation,” he said. “The air started coming out of the tires yesterday and that seems to be continuing today.” Friday’s selloff came as the US announced employers had added another 1.4m jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, the first time it has dipped below 10% since the pandemic hit the US economy. Antonelli said the figures were slightly better than expected but that, for now, it was the tech sector rather than the jobs figures that were driving the selloff. “I would get concerned if this starts to bleed into other sectors,” he said. But for now, he said, the selloff was about the tech companies going “too far, too fast”."
"Name: Windsor. Age: Yeah, quite old. There was almost certainly a settlement there before William the Conqueror showed up and built a castle in 1070. Location: On the Thames in Berkshire, about 20 miles west of central London. And FYI, it’s twinned with Goslar in Lower Saxony in Germany and Neuilly-sur-Seine in France. Yes, yes, very interesting, but this is a news-based column. Presumably there is a story? Yes, it’s the tax-dodging capital of the UK. Really? Meaning what exactly? Of all the 279 areas in the UK, Windsor has the highest concentration of tax avoiders. Analysis carried out after freedom of information requests to HMRC has revealed that there were 23 disclosures per 100,000 people of unpaid tax in Windsor (and neighbouring Maidenhead). How does that compare with the rest of the country? The average is seven per 100,000. So Windsor is more than three times as dodgy as the average place? Tax-wise yes, I suppose so. But in other ways, Windsor wouldn’t be described as dodgy at all, would it? Not at all – quite the opposite, it’s jolly nice. It’s almost like the wealthiest people are ripping off everyone else. I suppose you could look at it that way. What about other hotspots? St Albans (20 per 100,000), Guildford (17) and Tunbridge Wells (15) all do well. Though I’m not sure you mean “well”. While tax avoidance is legal, it can be open to abuse. Hang on, though, Windsor … it’s ringing a bell; doesn’t someone famous live there? Quite a few actually. It is, as already mentioned, jolly nice. No but really famous. You mentioned William I building a castle there, right? A timber one, motte and bailey, long gone. But another one was built in its place? I’m thinking the bell that’s ringing might be coming from St George’s Chapel … Hey, this is not that kind of story. It’s not a royal one, OK? The Crown is tax exempt though? True, but since 1993 the Queen and the Prince of Wales have voluntarily paid income tax. What does the HM in HMRC stand for then? Isn’t she effectively paying herself? No. But it was only after her castle burnt down in the annus horribilis and the following outcry that the taxpayer might have to foot the massive repair bill that she offered to pay tax, wasn’t it? Yes, but this isn’t about that! Windsor, tax avoidance, that’s near enough. Go on then, do say: “Philip! We’ll do one’s return online this year, it gives us an extra couple of months.” Don’t say: “Shall we just call it the Cayman Islands on Thames?”"
"The slow return of UK workers to their normal place of work will come too late to save hard-pressed city centre stores from going under, the body that represents retailers has said. Despite a pick-up in spending in August, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said sales were still below their pre-pandemic level and the lack of people was having a devastating impact on shops operating in places once thronged with workers. The latest health check of high street and online spending from the BRC warned that September would see more job losses, a gloomy view backed up by the latest survey of employment trends from the consultancy group Manpower. The BRC said total sales were up year on year by almost 4%, but reported a pronounced difference between booming digital spending and bricks-and-mortar outlets, particularly those selling clothes and beauty products. In-store sales of non-food items were almost 18% lower in the three months to August than in the same period of 2019, while online non-food sales were 42.4% higher last month than a year ago. The latest footfall figures from Springboard showed that the number of people visiting high streets rose by 2.6% last week, while Barclaycard said a 9% increase in transactions in restaurants and bars meant its measure of consumer spending had edged above pre-pandemic levels. But Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said there were signs of a structural change in spending patterns. “Remote working has continued to help sales in home goods, such as food, computing, furniture and TVs,” Dickinson said. “Lockdown also appears to have permanently changed some consumers’ shopping habits, with online sales continuing to boom despite shops reopening in June. Meanwhile, city centre retailers continue to be devastated by low footfall and poor sales, as office workers stayed away for yet another month.” Dickinson said many retailers were continuing to struggle, especially those that relied on high footfall. “With rents accumulating and the September quarter payment date fast approaching, many retailers are hanging on by a thread. Unless businesses and government can successfully persuade office workers back into city and town centres, some high street retailers will be unable to afford their fixed costs. Government will need to act fast or September will see more shops close and more job losses realised.” Manpower said stronger demand for construction, finance and manufacturing workers meant its jobs outlook had improved from a 28-year-low of -12 to -8 over the past month, but added that the tough employment climate for retail and hospitality workers had not changed. Mark Cahill, ManpowerGroup UK’s managing director, said: “The headline number illustrates just how tough the labour market is currently. This is still the second weakest outlook we’ve seen since 1992. But the four-point national increase from last quarter, along with a positive trend in several key sectors, is cause for some cautious optimism. “Despite the end of the furlough scheme in October and signs of a resurgence in the virus in some areas, employers expect the UK jobs outlook to be tentatively heading in the right direction as 2020 ends.”"
"Thomas Cook could make a comeback as an online travel agent before the end of the year, under plans drawn up by the Chinese conglomerate that bought the brand after the company’s spectacular collapse. Fosun, which was Thomas Cook’s biggest shareholder before its failure last September, has said repeatedly that it wants to relaunch the business as an online brand. It is trying to secure approval from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority but is reluctant to finalise its plans in case the UK government introduces further travel quarantines. By acquiring the 179-year-old Thomas Cook brand in an £11m deal last November, Fosun gained access to its trademarks, websites, social media accounts and software across most of the world. The group owns a number of other businesses including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC. Thomas Cook’s downfall was caused by a huge debt mountain, run up as it expanded through takeovers amid fierce competition from online rivals. Its collapse triggered the largest ever peacetime repatriation to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers from overseas."
"Tesco is to trial home deliveries by drone in a move that could allow small items to be despatched to customers within 30 minutes to an hour of ordering. Britain’s biggest retailer has teamed up with the drone delivery company Manna and will conduct the six-month trial next month delivering essentials from its Oranmore store in Co Galway, Ireland, where Manna has a licence to operate. The trial is aimed at “small baskets” – a market Tesco estimates will be worth £10bn in the UK in the coming years. Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, said: “They [Manna] have already proven the capability, the question is how do we take that capability and apply it to Tesco and that’s the detail that’s been worked on now before we get to the trial.” Claire Lorains, group innovation director at Tesco, said: “We are interested to see how drones could be part of the solution to deliver to our customers on-demand small baskets. If our trial with Manna is successful, we believe there is an opportunity to reach many customers through our stores, extending via our drone service.” Any expansion of Manna’s drone delivery services will require approval from the Irish Aviation Authority. Manna said that its drones fly at an altitude of 80 metres and a speed of over 50mph – delivering within a 1.2-mile (2km) radius in less than 3 minutes.​ Food retailers around the world have expanded their delivery services since the Covid-19 pandemic and several are following Amazon in trialling drones. The online retail giant started testing drones several years ago. Amazon claimed its first successful Prime Air drone delivery in Cambridge in December 2016 when it delivered a TV streaming stick and bag of popcorn directly to the garden of a nearby customer. Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer which owns the UK supermarket chain Asda, also said on Wednesday it would run a project to deliver grocery and household products via the drone delivery firm Flytrex."
"Demand for office workers in the UK is lagging behind other types of work, according to data that suggests the labour market is undergoing an “asymmetric recovery” after the near-total freeze in hiring during the coronavirus lockdown. The proportion of workers with new jobs in industries that mainly employ people in so-called white-collar roles – such as media, software and finance – has lagged behind other sectors despite the gradual return to workplaces, according to data from LinkedIn, the work-focused social network owned by Microsoft. The data suggests that hiring has risen steeply in some sectors that may be less affected by the pandemic. The new job rate for workers in transport and logistics has risen by 18% year on year, and delivery drivers were among the most popular new jobs, possibly reflecting the boom in online shopping during lockdown. New jobs in healthcare and construction are up by 12% and 9% respectively. However, the rate of new jobs in software or IT companies is down by 9% year on year, while the finance and legal jobs rate is down by almost a tenth each. The rate of new jobs in media is 17% lower than last year. The leisure industries are among the worst affected by the Covid-19 crisis, reflecting the continued restrictions on large gatherings of people. New jobs for entertainment workers have dipped by 30%, and the rate of new jobs for recreation and travel workers is down 31%. Many economists have predicted that unemployment is due to rise sharply towards the end of the year after the government withdraws wage support in November. Forecasters on average predict that UK unemployment will hit 8.3% in the fourth quarter, according to estimates collected by the Treasury. That compares with 3.9% unemployment reported in June. The LinkedIn data, shared with the Guardian, suggests that the total number of people reporting new jobs in the UK is 6% lower than the same point last year, compared to 49% lower in mid-May. The social network compares the number of members who added a new job beginning this month with the year before. Separate data from the jobs website Indeed suggests that new job postings are still far below last year’s levels, although improving steadily. By 21 August the seven-day moving average of new job postings on the site is still down 53% compared with 2019. Mariano Mamertino, an economist covering Europe at LinkedIn, said the data showed a steady improvement in the UK jobs market since the coronavirus lockdown froze hiring. However, he noted that there was “an asymmetric recovery across industries”. He said: “Industries like finance, legal, software and IT, corporate services and media and communications – which have largely white-collar roles – are facing stronger headwinds and are all below the national hiring rate.”"
"Pret a Manger is to cut nearly 2,900 jobs after the desertion of high streets due to the coronavirus pandemic sent its sales plummeting, fuelling concerns about the economic impact of sustained remote working. Hours after the business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry warned that cities could become “ghost towns” unless the government acts, the sandwich chain said it had been ravaged by the loss of passing trade. The group reopened 367 of its 410 UK shops last month but sales have been 60% lower than last year, leading to the expansion of a programme of cuts that was previously expected to affect 1,000 people, with 30 branches set to close. Pret’s chief executive, Pano Christou, said: “I’m gutted that we’ve had to lose so many colleagues. Although we’re now starting to see a steady but slow recovery, the pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret.” The chain is the latest in a long line of businesses to cut jobs in response to lower urban footfall, with only 17% of staff back in their workplace by early August, according to research by the Centre for Cities. The global advertising giant WPP said on Thursday that just 3% of its 10,000 UK staff are regularly in the office. Grab-and-go food outlets that rely on hungry office workers and commuters have been particularly hard hit by the shift in working patterns. The airport and train station specialist SSP, which owns Cafè Ritazza and Upper Crust, said in July it would cut 5,000 jobs because of dwindling passenger numbers, while the high street cafe Le Pain Quotidien shed 200 staff after it was bought out of administration. As Pret added to the pile of job losses, the Labour party urged Boris Johnson to come up with an urgent plan to save city centres. The shadow minister for business and consumers, Lucy Powell, called for a package of financial support to make up for lost footfall, including the relaxation of restrictions on which businesses can apply for £12.3bn in grant money. About £1.4bn of the grants, only available to businesses below a certain size, are set to be clawed back by the government because they are unused. “The bigger city centres are very, very hard hit,” said Powell. “It’s a double whammy. It’s not just the office workers, which is a big part of what makes up retail and hospitality, but also for somewhere like Manchester, all that is added to by the footfall from football matches, massive concerts, weddings, hen nights and conferences. “The government’s got to recognise that the economic support does need to follow whether companies are allowed to reopen or not,” she said. “We need a bigger plan for city centres. This is a whole ecosystem.” Earlier on Thursday, the CBI’s director-general, Carolyn Fairbairn, writing in the Daily Mail, called on the prime minister to do more to get office workers back to their desks to prevent cities from becoming ghost towns. Plans being put into place by large employers indicate that hundreds of thousands of mostly white-collar workers will continue working from home, in some cases permanently, despite the reopening of schools in England over the next fortnight."
"Britain loves a bargain – even, as it turns out, during a global health emergency. Dismissed as a gimmick at first, the government’s eat out to help out scheme has proved hugely popular, dishing up more than 64 million discounted meals so far – equivalent to almost one for every person in the UK – since its launch a month ago. When the scheme finishes on Monday, chancellor Rishi Sunak, will be able to say that his policy successfully encouraged people back into restaurants, pubs and cafes between Mondays and Wednesdays in August, serving up a much-needed boost to the economy, and to the embattled hospitality sector in particular. In a sign of the scheme’s success, data from Lloyds bank – the UK’s biggest current-account provider – shows spending in shops and restaurants was up 38% on days when the scheme was running. The figures – which include all types of activity, not just eating out – show spending was only 2% lower this August than in the same month a year ago. “It has been surprisingly effective,” said Mark Gregory, chief economist at accountancy firm EY. “People haven’t gone on holiday and, in a way, this hit the sweet spot. Fair play to the chancellor – it really did help give a short-term boost.” While the early signs are that, thanks to the scheme, businesses are bringing back staff and making money once more, it is still however true that a discounted Nando’s does not a comprehensive economic strategy make. The concern is that the scheme was just a snack, devoured in August on days when it was available, when what the hospitality sector really needs is the whole meal – sustained demand well into the autumn. As the nights draw in, job losses mount, and the furlough scheme closes, the meal deals of August could become a distant memory. Encouragingly, however, Saturday 22 August was the first weekend day since the outbreak of the pandemic when there were more people eating out than on the corresponding day a year ago – which indicates that eat out to help out could have encouraged a wider return to restaurants, regardless of whether there’s a discount on offer. Many restaurants and cafes are choosing to extend discount schemes after eat out to help out ends tomorrow because of their popularity with diners, but these places will have to foot the bill themselves. In a boon for hard-pressed consumers, chains that plan to continue cut-price offers into September include Harvester, Toby Carvery, Tesco Café, Bill’s, Pizza Hut and Prezzo. However, groups including the Federation of Small Businesses have called for the government scheme to be extended, given the less-than appetising outlook for the economy over the coming weeks. Unemployment is expected to rise sharply as more companies cut jobs, some sectors of the economy remain starved of demand, and the progress made in August risks being derailed by rising coronavirus infections. On Wednesday, MPs will have an opportunity to quiz Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, about just how sustainable the economic outlook might be. The chancellor’s other big success story, the furlough scheme, will be further scaled down from this week. Rather than paying up to 80% of a worker’s wage, up to £2,500 a month, the state will from Tuesday pay 70%, up to £2,187.50, for the hours an employee is furloughed. The chancellor’s next job will be to figure out how to consolidate the summer rebound. Concerned about the strength of the recovery, business groups and trade unions are lobbying hard for Sunak to provide further financial support to workers and firms in his autumn budget. “We need to see what the plan is for protecting economic capacity over the coming period,” said Gregory. “After the summer, he will probably have done the easy stuff, and now it gets to the hard bit.”"
"The former owner of Saga, who became a billionaire after selling the over-50s holiday and insurance group in 2004, is returning to the business by investing £100m to shore up the company’s finances. Sir Roger de Haan, who sold Saga for £1.35bn 16 years ago, will inject the funds in return for a stake in the company of around 20%, with the company seeking a further £50m from existing investors. Confirming the fundraising on Sunday, which had first been reported by Sky News, Saga said that De Haan would spend £60.6m buying 20% of Saga shares at 27p per share, a 98% premium to the 13.61p closing price on 28 August. He will also invest up to £39.4m in share placings at a maximum issue price of 15p per share and will join the board as non-executive chairman. A further placing at a maximum price of 15p a share to existing investors is expected to bring the total fundraising to £150m. In a statement, the company said: “The proposed equity raise is intended to strengthen the company’s financial position against the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak and the ongoing suspension of travel and to better position Saga for longer-term recovery and growth.” The company has been one of many in the travel sector hit by the global pandemic and in March was forced to cancel all of its cruises. In a trading statement in June, Saga said: “As at 31 May the group had cancelled all travel departures up to and including August and had refunded £44m of advance receipts to customers, mainly relating to the tour operations business.” De Haan, whose father Sidney founded Saga in 1948, took over running the business in 1984 before selling it to a management buyout team funded by the private equity group Charterhouse. At the time of the deal De Haan owned 70% of the shares outright, with the balance held in family trusts. The company said it had considered other options to improve its balance sheet and added: “In determining to proceed with this capital raising and place the company on a stronger financial footing, the board considered a number of options and also recently evaluated and rejected an unsolicited and highly conditional 33p indicative approach for the company from a consortium of two US financial investors. “This 33p offer followed several earlier indicative approaches from the consortium which commenced at a significantly lower valuation. The investors have since confirmed that they are no longer considering an offer for the company.”"
"The chancellor is urging UK consumers to continue eating out at restaurants, as he winds up the government’s subsidised dining scheme on Monday. The move comes after diners have claimed more than 64m meals – the equivalent of one for nearly every person in the country – since Rishi Sunak introduced his eat out to help out campaign to help preserve hospitality jobs in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The initiative was designed to entice consumers back to hospitality venues by offering a half-price discount up to a maximum of £10 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink from Mondays to Wednesdays in August. It has proved so popular that many restaurants have called for the government to extend it and some chains have decided to continue the offer into September at their own cost. Sunak said: “As the eat out to help out scheme draws to a close, I want to say thank you to the diners who have fallen back in love with their local, to the managers who have spent weeks ensuring their restaurants were safe and to the chefs, waiters and waitresses across the country who have worked tirelessly, sometimes with more customers than they’ve ever had before – all helping to protect 1.8m jobs in the hospitality sector.” He added: “The scheme reminded us why we as a nation love dining out and I urge diners to maintain the momentum to help continue our economic recovery.” The Treasury estimated the scheme would cost £500m, although the final bill for the Treasury will depend on the take-up for the last week in August and could rise beyond initial estimates. A paper published by the House of Commons library stated last week: “If claims continue at the level shown as of 23 August (£37m per day of the scheme in operation), the cost of the scheme would be around £485m. However, some businesses may not have claimed yet, so the final figure is likely to be higher. Claims have been increasing week-on-week and businesses have until the end of September to submit claims.” While the scheme has proved popular with diners and restaurant chains, it has attracted criticism over whether it would prove to be a sensible use of taxpayers’ money. There are concerns that some diners will have switched plans to dine out on full-price days in favour of government-subsidised days, with Jim Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, writing to Sunak last month to warn of “the uncertainty surrounding the value for money of this proposal”. However, some restaurant chains appear to believe discounted dining days are beneficial to trade, with a number announcing that they plan to continue with a version of the scheme after the government subsidy has been removed. Harvester, Stonehouse Pizza & Carvery and Toby Carvery, brands operated by pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers, will offer a 50% discount on main meals on Monday to Wednesday in the first two weeks of September. Revolution Bars, which has 74 outlets, is offering 50% off food and soft drinks including mocktails from Monday to Wednesday all day throughout September. The Prezzo chain is offering a two-course set menu for £10 from Monday to Wednesday in September, while Pizza Hut is offering two-for-one on main meals on those days for customers signed up to their database, and Tesco Café has 50% off its full menu Monday to Wednesday throughout the month, with no limits on the discount."
"London City airport is to make more than a third of its staff redundant in the latest job cuts in the battered aviation sector. The airport, situated in east London and serving a largely business clientele, has started consulting over up to 239 job losses in what it called a restructuring plan to safeguard its future. London City shut down for three months at the height of the pandemic and, after reopening in late June, is now operating only 17 routes. Most staff were furloughed and the airport has until now avoided the kind of widespread job cuts seen elsewhere. The chief executive, Robert Sinclair, said: “The aviation sector is in the throes of the biggest downturn it has ever experienced as a result of the pandemic. We have held off looking at job losses for as long as possible, but sadly we are not immune from the devastating impact of this virus.” He said the airport’s focus in the coming weeks would be to help its staff through this period, but added: “We believe that the difficult decisions we are taking now will enable the airport to bounce back in a better shape when growth returns.” Last month the airport suspended most of its £500m redevelopment programme, including an extended terminal, bar works already under way. The UK’s biggest airport, Heathrow, has already laid off a third of its managers and told frontline staff to accept pay cuts or further job losses, as its chief executive warned that the surrounding borough of Hounslow risked ending up like a mining town in the 1980s unless flying resumed. Gatwick said last month it would cut 600 jobs, amid calls across the aviation sector for government help. Airlines are now not expecting passenger demand to return to normal levels until at least 2023 or 2024. Aerospace group Airbus has also warned staff it may have to make compulsory redundancies after having signalled it would seek to shed up to 15,000 of its 130,000 employees through voluntary measures. The Toulouse-based manufacturer has already earmarked more than 1,400 job losses at its UK wing-making plant in Broughton, north Wales. The Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury, told staff on Friday: “We must now prepare for a crisis that will probably be even deeper and longer than the previous scenarios suggested.”"
"Domino’s Pizza, Britain’s biggest pizza delivery chain, is to create 5,000 new jobs and support more than 1,000 placements in the government’s fledgling Kickstart scheme as it gears up for its busiest time of year. The 5,000 new positions include pizza chefs, delivery drivers and customer service staff, and are in addition to the 6,000 new jobs offered since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has also pledged to provide more than 1,000 work placements for young people in stores across England, Scotland and Wales under theKickstart scheme. The successful under-25s taking up the places through the £2bn Treasury job creation scheme will receive on-the-job training and have access to new e-learning modules on key skills such as timekeeping and teamwork. “It was a privilege to keep our stores open during Covid-19 and to now be in a position to offer thousands more people the opportunity to become a Domino’s team member,” said Domino’s new chief executive, Dominic Paul, the former boss of Costa Coffee, who joined in May. “We’re also delighted to support the government’s Kickstart scheme, offering young people the chance to get back into work and to build lifelong skills through our training programmes. Together, these 6000-plus new roles will help Domino’s continue to safely serve our local communities as we head towards the busy festive period.” The chain said 80% of its store managers had started their Domino’s career as a delivery driver or pizza chef. Domino’s, which operates under licence from its US parent, has 1,184 stores across the UK and Ireland and employs more than 35,000 people. Most shops are run by franchisees, apart from 36 outlets in London that are directly owned by the company. The capital was more affected by the pandemic than the rest of the country, with a significant reduction in footfall and greater bias towards collection orders. Since the outbreak of the business it has taken steps to safeguards its customers and staff by introducing contact-free delivery and simplifying its menu. However, it suffered a drop in orders during the pandemic, as it stopped customers collecting orders and dropped popular choices such as the cheeseburger pizza, stuffed crust options and chicken wings from its menus. Last year the company sold almost 90m pizzas, and earlier this month launched a new vegan-friendly range."
"There’s a man sitting at the first-floor window of the house that lies on the other side of my back fence. It’s early August, the weather is sweltering, and his window is wide open. He’s talking on a hands-free phone, laughing in that ingratiating manner that suggests a large payday is at stake. He speaks in a fashionable sales patter that sounds similar to real conversation, but crucially isn’t, and he’s practically broadcasting his pitch to the neighbourhood. WTF? I want to shout, but I already know the answer: WFH. With the exception of Covid-19 itself, working from home has been the big story of 2020. I’ve been home-based for more than 20 years and for most of that time, before my neighbour began advertising his WFH status, I was a local exception, left to my own devices in tranquil isolation. No one was much interested in the emotional dynamics of my daily work regime. But since the lockdown emptied the nation’s offices, it’s become a national topic of conversation. Despite the government’s attempts to encourage white-collar workers to return to their workplaces, the stay-at-homes have continued to stay at home. Last month it was reported that only 34% of British white-collar workers had returned to the office, compared to 83% in France, and an average of 68% among major European counterparts. This month schools reopened but so far there has been no parental stampede back to the workplace. That resistance is partly down to concerns about the virus and confusion about conflicting government messages – if it’s not OK to see more than five friends, how is it OK to be around 20 colleagues? But it has also brought into focus a general dissatisfaction with the nine-to-five grind. A lot of people have realised that they have had enough of commuting, of office politics, the banality of open-plan offices, and the tyranny of crayfish and rocket sandwiches. It’s led to a belief that something more profound and long-lasting is under way, and raised fundamental questions about how we see work and where we do it. If you can work from home, for instance, does it matter where home is? Heather Trainer (not her real name) has taken remote working to its logical conclusion. A 57-year-old university administrator, she spent the lockdown working in the flat she shares with two friends – both of whom were away. She rather enjoyed the freedom and space that her isolation brought her. Then her friends returned and everything began to feel a little cramped and difficult. So she decided to visit a friend in Crete, where she has remained for the last couple of months, with plenty of space and the beach not far away. “You do have to manage the heat,” she says, mentioning that the temperature is 32C. “But I’m not complaining.” Not wishing to provoke ill-feeling among her colleagues, she hasn’t “advertised” her whereabouts. Only her immediate team knows where she is. “If I’m on a meeting with a wider group of people,” she explains. “I blur the background or use a photograph. I get the feeling that with Covid-19 I’m supposed to be more bunkered down.” Her boss was “a bit taken back” when she presented her plan, but wasn’t able to come up with any prohibitive objection. Her employer’s concern, she says, was that while it may be acceptable in her case, “what would it mean if everyone did it?” “It’s definitely something to be considered,” she concedes. Remote working changes not just our understanding of a working community and the company ethos, but also our very concept of physical reality. Suddenly, to misappropriate Gertrude Stein, there is no there there. But if there is no shared space, what’s to stop employers following the example of many customer-care call centres, and employ much cheaper staff based in the developing world? At the moment, stuck in the groundhog day of socially distanced uncertainty, few are thinking that far ahead. However, just as experts have been predicting a viral pandemic for many years, so too have other experts been forecasting the transfer to remote working. Back in 1973 a former Nasa engineer named Jack Nilles wrote a book arguing for remote work as a means of relieving traffic congestion. Entitled The Telecommunications-Transportation Tradeoff, it was not exactly a bestseller. But it planted a flag for staff dispersal despite the obvious limitations of technology at that time. It would be another two years before the term “personal computer” was coined, and another decade before affordable and easy-to-use home computers came on the market. Even then the necessary technological infrastructure – the internet, emails, mobile phones – were in their infancy. But by the 1990s working from home was a much more feasible ambition for a growing number of the workforce. Nonetheless only a small percentage did WFH. By 2001, 678,000 people were working mainly from home. Last year the figure had climbed to 1.7 million, out of a workforce of some 32.6 million (about 4 million were working sometimes from home). Come the lockdown and more than 46% of people in employment took to WFH. In London the figure was just above 57%. The age of remote working had finally arrived. One of those remote workers is William McCarthy (not his real name), a 40-year-old public servant employed by a large London concern “to liaise,” as he puts it, as vaguely as possible, “with a number of other public bodies”. For McCarthy remote working has not proved to be the great personal liberation that it’s sometimes trumpeted to be. He’s another who lives in shared accommodation, which has meant that he has been claustrophobically confined to his bedroom. It’s also the room in which he spends leisure time online. “What I was doing during working hours resembled very closely what I was doing in non-working hours, which was sitting in front of a laptop. The activity may have been different but it was quite difficult to achieve any psychological separation because the physical activity was pretty much identical.” Of course work has been seeping into the supposed sanctuary of the home for some time now. Many businesses expect their employees to respond in out-of-work hours to urgent emails, particularly if they come from other time zones. McCarthy says that he knows people who access work emails at 2am. Sometimes he feels the world has been reduced to the 10 x 7in dimensions of his laptop screen and the barrier between work and home is lost. “It’s easy to allow work to invade your imagination,” he says. “I keep very strict office hours. I don’t log on before 9am and I log off at the end of the day.” But while he is logged on, he’s expected to cram more in. It used to be that he would travel around town to different meetings. Now they’re all conducted on Zoom, one immediately after the other. “So you can just go from meeting to meeting all day with no time to reflect on what you’ve just heard,” he says. “I find that very challenging.” Efficiency gains are hard to quantify in these circumstances – as many of us could testify, more meetings do not necessarily mean greater productivity. And as with so many aspects of our working lives, productivity is the key corporate issue. It’s also the reason that the spread of remote working has, until the coronavirus, moved so slowly. The suspicion has long held that working from home is really a euphemism for taking it easy or, more specifically, nursing a hangover. Many industries and companies have preferred to have their workers where they could see them. Back in 1999, I decided that I wanted to work from home. At the time it was not possible to do so and remain a staff member, so I became a contract worker. Perhaps not the wisest move, given the choppy economic waters newspapers were about to enter, but I was a new father and I enjoyed the liberation from the office. Then came the cruel twist – a couple of years later, the rules changed and staff writers could work from home. But if old media became more flexible, some new media organisations took a more rigid line. In 2013 Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer banned remote working at the internet giant. In order “to become the absolute best place to work,” she explained, “communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side by side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices.” Apparently Yahoo’s network logs showed that remote employees spent more time logged off company servers than those in the office. An efficiency-boosting initiative operates at the organisation for which McCarthy works. A traffic light system shows whether he or any of his colleagues are busy – a red light for occupied, green for free. If he doesn’t touch his keyboard for a few minutes, the light will turn amber, signifying his possible absence. After a while it goes grey, which means whereabouts are unknown. “The purpose is to enable faster communication,” he says, but he thinks it adds to the “pressure to be seen to be working because there’s no other way but your output to indicate that you’re keeping your side of this home-working bargain. In a more punitive environment, it might feel quite oppressive.” Research suggests that people do work differently when they are alone. For one thing they appear to be less likely to email a colleague. That seems counterintuitive because you’d think there would be more reasons to communicate through electronic mail if you’re not in the same building. But one study showed that engineers who shared a physical space were 20% more likely to stay in digital touch than those working alone. Again, staying in touch doesn’t always mean greater productivity. Shonagh Murray lost her job as an underwriter at the start of the lockdown, then found a job invoicing for a company in Cardiff that does outsourcing for the government. To get it, she had to pass two Zoom interviews and then one interview on the phone. “It was obviously quite odd,” she says, “because you’re hyper-aware of what you’re saying but it’s intensified because you can see yourself in the corner of the screen, almost like a feedback loop.” By the second week she was busy doing work she’d never done before. “I shared a screen with my line manager and we’d go through how to process these invoices. But when no one is sitting next to you, it’s hard. You miss the nuance of things.” She also missed a community of colleagues. “I found it very lonely and isolating,” she says. Although there was a group chat on WhatsApp, she didn’t know her fellow workers and their in-jokes, and that only left her feeling more alienated. Then she was told by her supervisor that she had to action 400 invoices a day. “Is that feasible?” she wondered. “Is that reasonable? I didn’t want them to think I was slacking. If I was in an office, probably someone would have said 300 would be enough. I did 560. When you don’t have any distractions you sort of work all the time. Which is probably what the bosses want. But then you feel a bit burned out, because there are no natural breaks.” So far the studies that have been conducted on WFH productivity since the lockdown have not been conclusive. As one British self-report study found, 18% of those consulted felt they were more productive, and 22% felt less productive. Someone who is absolutely certain that she has been less productive is Nicola Palmer, a senior lecturer at the law faculty of King’s College, London. With her husband, a professor of international politics, she has three children – a four-year old and twins who are almost two. “Working from home is an entirely different experience if you have children, particularly during the lockdown,” she says. It’s no coincidence, she notes, that there has been a marked decline in submissions to journals from early and mid-career women. Palmer and her husband strictly and equitably divided childcare, but it made little difference. “The capacity to have that space for reflection has been severely constrained,” she says. “The possibility of doing sustained intellectual work was removed. Research or writing has been very difficult.” Without the responsibilities of campus life, academic friends of hers without children have spoken of an outpouring of writing. In return, Palmer and her husband have offered anecdotes about looking after the children. One of the things that drew her to academic life in the first place was its flexibility, that it was possible to move work quite smoothly between the office and home. And she believes that the pandemic has accelerated trends that were already under way. There will continue to be more online teaching, she says, while arguing for the advantages of in-person tutorials and the face-to-face meetings. “We would lose a lot if we lost the physical space of the university,” she cautions. “One of the things it should fundamentally change is the amount of international travel. I don’t think we can flit around the world as an elite any more attending conferences.” The webinar, then, is here to stay. There are also other underlying developments in the culture of work that the move to home seems likely to hasten. Since the advent of personal computers, white-collar jobs have grown to look more alike, as everyone ends up staring at the same kind of computer screens. And because homes are mostly similar and, critically, private, WFH has even removed the differentiating quality of the office, further blurring professional and personal identities.  In his new book Work: A History of How We Spend Our Time, the anthropologist James Suzman points out that throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the work we did formed the bedrock of our identities. We are, as it were, what we do. There is an obvious public and imitative element to our work identities, and the personas we build on them, that are inevitably weakened if people are out of sight at home. If the presiding professional philosophy since the Victorian era is that the more we work, the more we realise our personal “potential”, the next question is what effect will a less visible identity have on our appetite for work? Although the advent of a radically shortened working week has been predicted for a century or more, the time we devote to work, including commuting, has remained stubbornly around the 45 hour per week mark. Suzman estimates that the work of our hunter-gatherer forebears took up no more than a third of that, which makes our prehistory appear like a prelapsarian idyll. The lockdown created a yearning to return to a less frenetic time, and for many it proved, in spite of the death toll and health anxiety, to represent a kind of mass exodus from the rat race, an escape to an idealised past. In this romanticised past, the countryside – historically the scene of backbreaking agricultural work – represents freedom and leisure. By the same token, cities have come in recent months to be seen as dysfunctional and unhealthy. In Metropolis, his history of the city, Ben Wilson writes that at the beginning of the 20th century “the traditional city was a place of pessimism not hope”. As he argues, that changed towards the end of the last century, when cities came back into fashion. All the major recent infrastructure initiatives of recent times – Crossrail, HS2, the “northern powerhouse” – have been predicated on urban expansion. An urban business model saw the regeneration of inner cities by making them more appealing to skilled workers. It’s the cafe culture principle, by which rundown industrial areas have undergone an artisanal makeover, followed by gentrification, and intense commercialisation. But now, with all the recent social restrictions and distancing, that model is under threat. As Trainer says: “Under normal circumstances I really enjoy living in London but a lot of the things I enjoy doing in London have been diminished.” Cafe culture doesn’t work without cafes, and cafes need customers. One recent survey found that 88% who worked at home during the lockdown want to retain some capacity for doing so: those customers are in no great hurry to return. If they don’t, something less tangible but more significant than cafes will be lost. In an opinion piece for the New York Times last month, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld took issue with the idea of remote working: “Everyone hates to do this. Everyone. Hates. You know why? There’s no energy. Energy, attitude and personality cannot be ‘remoted’ through even the best fibre optic lines.” As much as I could do without my neighbour’s remoting, Seinfeld is right about the energy. It’s the lifeblood of great cites. But the genie of WFH is out of the bottle, and the early signs are that, no matter what Boris Johnson and his cabinet colleagues say, it isn’t going to go back in again."
"Cambridge-based Arm Ltd was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between Apple, Acorn Computers and VLSI Technology. It designs software and semiconductors – components of electrical circuits that are used to manage the flow of current. It is not just the UK’s largest tech company but a genuine global powerhouse that has, in the space of 30 years, grown into a $40bn (£31bn) business with more than 6,000 employees. Its semiconductor chips are the building blocks of a string of consumer favourites. Apple uses them in its iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch products, but you will also find Arm chips in the Playstation Vita and Nintendo DS and Wii gaming devices and Garmin satnavs, as well as Sony Ericsson and Samsung Galaxy phones. Its chips are increasingly used in the rapidly-expanding web of connected devices known as the “internet of things”. In short, unless you live off grid, there’s a good chance you have used Arm technology within the last week. The company has been described by its co-founder Hermann Hauser as “the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry”. It maintains independent relations with hundreds of customers around the world, many of which are rivals. Unlike some other firms in the industry, such as Intel, Arm does not manufacture, sell and ship its own products, preferring instead to license its intellectual property in return for a fee. This allows the British company to work with any chip manufacturer, including Nvidia’s rivals. Nvidia is a multinational US-based technology giant, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, but incorporated in the tax-light and secrecy-heavy state of Delaware. Founded three years after Arm, the company invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), which powers interactive graphics on computers and mobile devices, both for video gaming and for professional purposes. It is led by Taiwanese-American Jensen Huang, who is one of the company’s three co-founders. The Nasdaq-listed firm is valued at $338bn, more than twice the valuation of the FTSE 100’s largest company, the pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca. The sale of British firms to foreign buyers always raises concerns, particularly when targets are genuinely world-leading in their field. In this case, the horse had already bolted to some extent. The business, previously known as Arm Holdings, was sold to the Japanese asset-hoovering behemoth Softbank for $32bn in 2016. The Conservative government hailed the deal as a vote of confidence in post-Brexit Britain, although it was partly facilitated by the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum, which made Arm cheaper for Softbank. The Japanese investment firm’s sale to Nvidia for $40bn – for a cool $8bn profit inside four years – has sparked fresh anxiety about the loss of jobs, intellectual property and British ownership of a strategically important business. Fears have been also been voiced that Nvidia will abandon Arm’s neutral approach and keep new technological advances for itself. Some of the loudest misgivings come from Hauser: “It is very much in Nvidia’s interest to kill Arm,” Hauser told the Guardian, likening the deal to a sale of Trident, the UK’s nuclear capability. He described the takeover as an “absolute disaster” which would destroy the company’s business model and lead to job losses at its Cambridge headquarters and elsewhere in the UK. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said the government should seek “legally binding assurances” from Nvidia that it would not move Arm’s headquarters out of Cambridge. Nvidia boss Huang has sought to allay such fears, promising to keep the Arm brand and expand its Cambridge HQ. “We will expand on this great site and build a world-class artificial intelligence research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars and other fields,” he said. Under the Enterprise Act 2002, ministers can block deals that pose a threat to national security, media plurality and financial stability. Since the pandemic, deals that could threaten the UK’s Covid-19 response have been added to the list, via hastily-drafted legislation. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, is thought to be considering whether to “call in” the transaction, triggering a review of its implications by the Competition and Markets Authority. The government would have the final say over any intervention. If Dowden does call in the deal, it is likely to be on national security grounds, given Arm’s role in supplying the defence industry."
"The fate of Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sébastien Jacques is in the balance as shareholder pressure mounts for executive scalps after the global mining company destroyed a 46,000-year-old significant Aboriginal site at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia. Rio Tinto’s admission in a Friday night information dump that it hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction to stop it blowing up two caves at Juukan Gorge has added to investor pressure that has ramped up ahead of a meeting of the company’s board set for Thursday, Australian time. Guardian Australia understands Jacques met with representatives from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation this week. The PKKP would not comment on the meeting, saying in a statement that it was working to recover its relationship with the mining giant. “This includes private meetings and discussions with senior executives to share our feelings and attempt to establish a way forward to repair, rebuild and grow our relationship,” they said. “In the interests of maintaining integrity in this process, and in line with our approach to date, the PKKPAC would prefer to not offer further comment publicly at this time.” The company’s board cut millions from the bonuses of Jaques and iron ore head Chris Salisbury last month but investors have demanded more. Ian Silk, the chief executive of Australia’s largest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, said the “penalties fall significantly short of appropriate accountability for those responsible” and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors chief executive, Louise Davidson, said executive accountability needed to go “further than just a financial penalty”. On Tuesday, the UK-based Local Authority Pension fund (LAPFF), worth £300bn ($540bn), piled more pressure on the Rio Tinto board, with the chair, Doug McMurdo, expressing concern about the company’s continued insistence that senior managers did not know what was happening at Juukan Gorge. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said Rio Tinto’s behaviour “beggars belief”. “After blasting Juukan Gorge in May, Rio Tinto assured investors and journalists that the company would be seen in a better light once all the facts emerged,” its legal counsel, James Fitzgerald, said. “Precisely the opposite is proving to be true. The minutes show deliberate efforts to lawyer up and defend the destruction that hadn’t yet occurred. There is no record of surprise, shock, regret or remorse by Rio executives.” The mining company destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received at least five separate reports on the significance of the sites, both archeologically and to the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, since 2013. PKKP spokesman Burchell Hayes has previously said the corporation “only found out by default on 15 May when we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July”. The PKKP people said the destruction of the site – which has triggered global condemnation of the company, a review of WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage legislation and a federal parliamentary inquiry – was “soul-destroying”."
"Employment in Victoria, which is grappling with a second wave of Covid-19 infections, tumbled as jobs in the rest of the country made modest gains, new statistics show. The fall came after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, talked down the prospect of federal aid for Victoria, where the state government has ordered many businesses to close in an attempt to stem coronavirus infections. Weekly payroll job figures released by the Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed a fall of 2% in Victoria in the month to 22 August, compared with a rise of 0.1% in the rest of Australia. In Victoria, payroll jobs were 7.9% below levels recorded in mid-March, when Australia recorded its 100th coronavirus case, and down 2.9% for the rest of the nation. Economists caution that the payroll jobs figures are experimental. They record the number of jobs on the payrolls of employers, so some workers with more than one job may be counted more than once in the figures. Even so, economists expect the state’s recovery to be slowed after the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, on Sunday ordered an extension of a six-week lockdown of key industries for at least another fortnight. “We expect the employment market to remain weak in Victoria in coming months and the unemployment rate to peak higher than the national average,” economists at the Commonwealth Bank said in a note to clients. “Big employers like retail and hospitality are not slated to reopen til November under the reopening plans announced on 6 September.” Callam Pickerin, Asia-Pacific economist for jobs website Indeed, said the national economic recovery had stalled and more government support would be needed. “Obviously Victoria is at the centre of that, but given restrictions won’t be lifted in a meaningful sense for some time, the economic recovery for Australia will be slower than initially expected,” he said. “Policymakers will need to be proactive in the coming months and there should be concern that rates of jobseeker and jobkeeper are being reduced when unemployment remains so high. The transition to lower rates of support will surely be disruptive for some industries and, certainly for Victoria, may lengthen or deepen the economic damage of Covid-19.” However, Morrison on Monday said the Victorian government bore responsibility for supporting the state’s economy, saying Victoria was already drawing more support from the commonwealth than other states through jobkeeper and jobseeker payments. The prime minister is under pressure from a group of backbenchers who are concerned about increasing already record government spending to battle a coronavirus-induced economic recession. “The other thing that I’d be looking forward to seeing soon is the announcement by the Victorian government about … the economic support plan they will be delivering to Victoria to mitigate the economic consequences of the plan that they’ve outlined,” Morrison said. “It is right that the Victorian government make the first response to set out what [economic supports] they will put in place to deal with the measures that they have put in place. “The commonwealth government is already providing significant assistance to Victorians through the many programs we’ve had in place now for many months.”"
"Britons spent £155m less in supermarkets in August than in the previous month as many returned to workplaces and the government’s eat out to help out scheme encouraged visiting restaurants and cafes. Alcohol sales in supermarkets dipped month on month, with wine down 5% and beer down 10%, as the scheme encouraged people to swap Zoom catch-ups for trips to bars and restaurants, according to market research firm Kantar. The chance to see friends, colleagues and family in person also appeared to reignite interest in personal grooming with sales of hair styling products up 17% and hair-removal treatments up by 11% month on month. Online grocery sales continued to be more than 75% up in August compared with 2019, driving a near 11% increase in total sales of take-home groceries in the three months to 6 September. However, in another sign of the shift back to old habits, they slipped back to 12.5% of the total grocery market in August from 13.5% in the previous month. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “This is not just about people going out to eat in restaurants, August also brought shielding to an end for many vulnerable and at-risk people.” The overall growth in online sales helped Ocado, which launched its partnership with Marks & Spencer to shoppers on 1 September. It was the fastest-growing retailer over the 12 weeks to 6 September, with sales up by 41.2% year on year. But the online business of its former partner Waitrose grew even faster, according to Kantar, helping the staff-owned chain to increase overall sales by 7.3% year on year. While good news for some, the growth of online grocery shopping is putting pressure on physical supermarkets. Sales at bricks and mortar stores fell by almost 2% in the 12 weeks to 5 September according to analysts at Nielsen. Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer and business insight, said: “Food retail sales are still being boosted by households working from home, and such disruptions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. However, with more Covid-19 headwinds set to come and a fragile economy, a weakened shopper sentiment will likely start to impact consumer spend overall.” Despite those headwinds, Nielsen is predicting the UK’s grocery market will grow by 6% this year, making it more resilient than other types of retail."
"A legal battle has broken out between two of the world’s biggest luxury goods groups after LVMH ditched its planned $16.2bn (£12.5bn) takeover of the New York jeweller Tiffany. Bernard Arnault’s luxury goods empire, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moët & Chandon, said it could not go ahead with the the acquisition because it had been undermined by a “succession of events”. These include an intervention this month by the French government, which had asked for a delay to the deal until 6 January in the wake of a threat by the US government to impose import taxes on French products. LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods group, said Tiffany had also asked that the deal be completed by 31 December instead of 24 November as planned. It said that as the new date was later than that in the merger agreement it “will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co”. In return, Tiffany said it had launched a lawsuit in the US in an attempt to force LVMH to go ahead with the deal “on agreed terms” by the end of November. It said LVMH had failed to meet its promise to secure regulatory clearance for the deal in Europe or Taiwan. It also refuted LVMH’s suggestions that Tiffany had breached its obligations under the merger agreement or undergone a “material adverse effect”, relating to the US social justice protests and the Covid-19 pandemic, which would entitle the French company to pull out of the deal or reduce the terms. Tiffany said the lawsuit also challenged the suggestion that the “transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation.”. It said LVMH had assumed all regulatory risk and all “financial risk related to adverse industry trends or economic conditions” under the terms of the deal. Roger N Farah, the Tiffany chairman, said: “We regret having to take this action but LVMH has left us no choice but to commence litigation to protect our company and our shareholders. “Tiffany is confident it has complied with all of its obligations under the merger agreement and is committed to completing the transaction on the terms agreed to last year. Tiffany expects the same of LVMH.” He said LVMH’s unilateral discussions with the French government without consulting with Tiffany were a further breach of the agreement and accused LVMH of puffing up France’s battle over potential US tariffs as an excuse to pull out of the deal. The US has threatened to impose tariffs on French goods if Emmanuel Macron pushes ahead with a proposed tax on major tech companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook. “This supposed official French effort to retaliate against the US for proposed new tariffs has never been announced or discussed publicly; how could it possibly then be an effort to pressure the US into revoking the tariffs? Furthermore, as we are not aware of any other French company receiving such a request, it is all the more clear that LVMH has unclean hands,” he said. When it announced the deal in November 2019 LVMH said the move would transform its watches and jewellery division, which includes Bulgari, Tag Heuer and Hublot, and boost its presence in the US. Founded in 1837 when Charles Lewis Tiffany opened the first store in downtown Manhattan, New York, the US jeweller now has more than 300 stores worldwide and employs more than 14,000 people. Since November, luxury businesses have come under pressure from the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as a fall in domestic and tourist spending globally as countries entered lockdown and travel was restricted.  However, Tiffany’s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, a former LVMH executive, said the jeweller had already returned to profitability after one quarter of losses and expected profits for the fourth quarter of 2020 to be up on the same period last year. “The fundamental strength of Tiffany’s business is clear,” he said."
"Close to half a million redundancies are likely to be announced in the autumn, although the number could end up exceeding 700,000, according to a study that lays bare the scale of the Covid-19 jobs crisis facing the UK. These job cuts are on top of 240,000 redundancies officially recorded by the government up until June. That means the total redundancy figure for 2020 could top one million. In a bleak warning, the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), which published the analysis, said the number of jobs likely to be lost “will almost certainly exceed anything we have experienced in at least a generation” – far exceeding the peak reached in the last downturn just over a decade ago and the highest since at least 1995. With the autumn budget weeks away, it is calling for urgent measures to support those affected, stimulate employment growth and provide targeted help to viable firms. The figures come after official figures issued last month showed that Britain had entered the deepest recession since records began, with the UK economy shrinking by more than any other major nation during the coronavirus outbreak in the three months to June. So far, official data on redundancies is only available up to June and shows that 240,000 people were made redundant in the first six months of the year. The IES is predicting that there were 445,000 redundancies between 1 July and 30 September, with most of them occurring in August and September. It reckons there will be a further 205,000 between October and December. A figure of 445,000 would significantly exceed the highest quarterly figure recorded during the last crisis, when there were an estimated 305,000 redundancies during the first quarter of 2009. “It would also be comfortably the highest level since this data series began in 1995,” said the report, which is based on an analysis of the relationship between notified and actual redundancies. The IES said there was clearly a risk that job losses would exceed its central scenario and that its upper estimate was of 690,000 redundancies over the three months from July to September – rising to a peak of 735,000 in the three-month period from 1 August to 31 October. The study showed it was likely that up to half a million people, “and potentially significantly more”, were facing the prospect of losing their jobs. ”Sadly, much of this restructuring appears now to be inevitable and reflects both significant structural changes (either a result of, or accelerated by, the pandemic) and the damage already done to those firms most affected by the crisis,” it added. However, the IES director, Tony Wilson, said: “We can do a lot more to minimise the job losses and support those who are most at risk.” Not all of these redundancies were inevitable, he added. “Although most of those who were furloughed by their employers are now back at work, there are still many parts of the economy where perfectly viable businesses cannot bring people back because of the ongoing disruption caused by the pandemic. So we need tightly targeted support to help these firms ride out the next few months, where they can commit to not laying staff off.” The government’s furlough scheme is due to come to an end on 31 October, which could spark a fresh wave of redundancies. Pressure has been mounting on the chancellor to rethink this decision and delay the ending of the support scheme. Responding to the IES findings, the government highlighted its Kickstart scheme to incentivise training and apprenticeships, and the job retention bonuses to encourage businesses to bring back furloughed employees. “Supporting jobs is an absolute priority, which is why we’ve set out a comprehensive plan for jobs to protect, create and support jobs across the UK by providing significant, targeted support where it is needed the most,” a spokesman said. Meanwhile, insolvent companies across all sectors of the UK economy that were unable to pay their debts landed taxpayers with a bill for almost £250m during the first six months of 2020, despite the various government job support schemes, according to separate data. Between 1 January and 30 June, the Insolvency Service paid out a total of £244m to individuals after their employer went into administration, liquidation or another form of corporate insolvency, according to data obtained by the real estate adviser firm Altus Group via freedom of information rules. If someone has been made redundant and their employer is insolvent, they can apply to the Insolvency Service for the money they are owed."
"Tens of thousands of pubs, bars, nightclubs and gig venues will not survive increased coronavirus-prevention measures, such as local lockdowns and evening curfews, unless they receive fresh state support, the UK government has been warned. One in four of the 115,000 licensed premises in Britain still had not reopened by the end of August after restrictions were imposed to contain Covid-19, according to data from the analysis firm CGA and AlixPartners. With concern growing about rising infection rates, a ban on gatherings of more than six people comes into effect across England on Monday, while Scotland and Wales have their own amended restrictions. The measures, coupled with local lockdowns, have stoked fears that a fledgling recovery among businesses that have managed to trade will be nipped in the bud, particularly if rumours of a 10pm curfew in England – or even 9pm in Scotland – prove to be true. Richard Nattriss, who runs the Little Angel in Whitby, North Yorkshire, said a brief recent period of strong trading would grind to a halt in the event of a local lockdown, with government grants for affected businesses insufficient to pay staff. “Middlesbrough’s our worry because it’s had a large increase and lots of people come down from there for a drink,” Nattriss said. “If they bring it [coronavirus] to Whitby, nobody knows how much of a flare-up it’s got to be before we all get shut down. “If that’s after October [when the furlough scheme ends] they’re prepared to give us £1,500 every three weeks but that’s not gonna pay anybody’s wages. “That’s when you’d end up seeing redundancies and staff being laid off very quickly.” Liz Hind, the landlady of the Old Millwrights Arms in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said she was already feeling the pinch, with the the uplift from the eat out to help out scheme wearing off. “New rules come in on Monday and I’ve had parties who’ve cancelled because they can’t have any more than six people inside or outside,” she said. “We know we need to do our bit and we may need to close again for the good of public health but we shouldn’t be abandoned if there is that requirement. “I live above the pub, so if I lose it I lose my home because it’s a commercial premises, so I’m not even covered by the laws on evictions. It’s bleak.” Hind, a former Labour parliamentary candidate, called on the government to heed the opposition party’s call to extend the furlough scheme to support pubs and bars. Paul Crossman, who runs three pubs in York, backed the proposal. “People are at the limit of their reserves, so any more lockdowns now would be the nail in the coffin of the operators of those small pubs,” he said. The British Beer and Pub Association called for a sector-specific furlough scheme beyond October as well as extended VAT cuts, business rate relief and a cut to beer duty, which the chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said “remains punitively high”. Nightclubs have previously warned they face “financial armageddon” after being excluded from the relaxation of restrictions that allowed many pubs to open in July. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said: “With no roadmap for reopening or further indication of financial support, it’s causing quite a considerable level of distress and anger.” He pointed to a looming crunch point at the end of September, when state-funded furlough payments are reduced and a moratorium on forfeiture of commercial premises for non-payment of rent comes to an end. “People will have to make some quite drastic decisions,” Kill said. “At some point there has to be a realisation that there are going to be businesses and jobs lost.”"
"Hundreds of thousands of small companies that were forced to close during the Covid-19 pandemic will now receive payouts on insurance claims, following a high court judgment in the test case brought by the City regulator. About 370,000 firms are affected by the judgment and they should hear from their insurer within the next week, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It had previously estimated the value of claims affected by the test case at about £1.2bn. Many insurers had declined to pay out, arguing that the business interruption policies were not designed to cover a government-imposed lockdown. This prompted the Financial Conduct Authority to launch a test case in the courts to provide clarity on business interruption policy clauses.The case was based on a sample of 21 policies from eight insurers: Arch Insurance; Argenta; Ecclesiastical Insurance Office; Hiscox; MS Amlin; QBE; Royal & Sun Alliance; and Zurich. In the most significant insurance court case in years, the high court found in favour of the arguments advanced for policyholders by the FCA on the majority of the key issues, the watchdog said, although it cautioned that not all policies will pay out. The judgment was welcomed by the Hiscox Action Group, representing clients of insurer Hiscox, and the Night Time Industries Association ( NTIA), representing firms in the hospitality industry, which have been particularly hard hit by enforced closures. Hiscox Action Group and another group, the Hospitality Insurance Group Action, had joined the FCA test case as interveners. Michael Kill, the chief executive of NTIA, said: “This verdict is just what we’ve been waiting for. The night-time economy has been one of the hardest hit by lockdown measures during the pandemic, and many businesses are grassroots, family-owned venues … This verdict gives some reassurance that these businesses will get the payments they deserve to help them survive this period.” Richard Leedham, from Mishcon de Reya, which represents the Hiscox Action Group, said the judgment was “one of the most significant in recent years and will provide a lifeline for small businesses across the country”. He added: “I would hope insurers think long and hard about an appeal.” The FCA cautioned that although the judgment was welcome news for many policyholders, it did not say that insurers are liable across all of the 21 different types of policy wording in the representative sample considered by the court. “Each policy needs to be considered against the detailed judgment to work out what it means for that policy. Policyholders with affected claims can expect to hear from their insurer within the next seven days.” Any appeal by the insurance firms does not stop policyholders seeking to settle their claims with their insurer before the outcome of any appeal is known, the regulator said. It added that the judgment removes the need for firms to bring individual cases, at a time when many are struggling for survival. Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive of the FCA, said: “Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Our aim throughout this court action has been to get clarity for as wide a range of parties as possible, as quickly as possible and today’s judgment removes a large number of those roadblocks to successful claims, as well as clarifying those that may not be successful. “If any parties do appeal the judgment, we would expect that to be done in as rapid a manner as possible in line with the agreement that we made with insurers at the start of this process. As we have recognised from the start of this case, thousands of small firms and potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs are relying on this.” It remains unclear whether any insurance firms will appeal. Hiscox said it had not yet taken a decision, adding that the ruling on any appeal would likely come in October. It estimated it would pay out on fewer than one-third of its 34,000 UK business interruption policies, which will cost less than £100m after reinsurance recoveries. RSA has estimated the impact of the judgment at £85m. Huw Evans, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: “The judgment divides evenly between insurers and policyholders on the main issues. The national lockdown was an unprecedented situation that posed understandable questions of interpretation for some business insurance contracts.” It is the first action of its kind by the FCA since it was established in 2013, as well as the first time the financial markets test case scheme has been used. Some insurers did pay out under business interruption policies after previously arguing that the pandemic was not covered."
"A former Nissan executive who is accused of conspiring with the firm’s fugitive former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, to falsify financial statements has pleaded not guilty in the first hearing of his highly anticipated trial. American Greg Kelly, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of financial misconduct, faces a single charge – conspiring to under-report tens of millions of dollars in pay that Ghosn was allegedly due to receive after his retirement. Ghosn, whose long periods in detention prompted widespread criticism of Japan’s criminal justice system, dramatically jumped bail at the end of last year concealed inside a large audio equipment box before being flown out of Japan to Lebanon. Ghosn’s absence is likely to intensify interest in his former aide’s trial at the Tokyo district court, which is expected to last about 10 months. “I deny the allegations. I was not involved in a criminal conspiracy,” he told the court on Tuesday. Kelly, like his former boss, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, insisting no final agreement had been made on any post-retirement pay for Ghosn and therefore no disclosure was legally required. Kelly, who has spent his time on bail at a Tokyo apartment, described Ghosn as an “extraordinary executive”, adding that he and other executives had only ever used lawful means to offer him incentives to stay at the company rather than seek a higher salary elsewhere. “The evidence will show that I did not break the law,” said Kelly, who was hired by Nissan in the US in 1988. Dressed in a dark suit, red tie and wearing a surgical mask, Kelly, added: “Carlos Ghosn never got paid anything and he wasn’t promised anything.” Kelly, who turned 64 on Tuesday, is accused of illegally concealing payments of about ¥9.2bn ($87m) between 2010-18 that had been promised to Ghosn on retirement. Nissan, which is on trial alongside Kelly, is not contesting the charges and is to pay a ¥2.4bn fine. Despite problems gaining access to documents amassed by prosecutors, and confronted with a criminal justice system with a 99% conviction rate, Kelly’s head lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said he was “confident” his defence team could win the case. Ghosn’s arrest in Tokyo in November 2018 marked the start of a quick fall from grace for a man once hailed a corporate saviour for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. The 66-year-old faced four charges relating to accusations that he under-reported his salary in financial documents and used Nissan funds for his personal benefit. From his initial arrest moments after he stepped off a private jet in Tokyo in November 2018 and his re-arrest on three additional charges of financial misconduct, to his detention and bail conditions Ghosn portrayed himself as a victim – of “backstabbing” Nissan colleagues determined to loosen his grip on the company, and of Japan’s “hostage justice” system.  Ghosn has claimed a handful of Nissan executives were behind a conspiracy to have him arrested, allegedly over fears that he was planning to take Nissan into a merger with Renault that would weaken the Japanese company’s position. “This is a conspiracy,” he said in April last year. “This is not about specific events, or greed or dictatorship. This is about a plot. This is about conspiracy. This is about backstabbing.” The Japanese government has sought Ghosn’s extradition from Lebanon – he holds Lebanese, French and Brazilian passports – but it is unlikely that Beirut will comply. Kelly’s wife, Dee, told reporters outside the courthouse that her husband had done nothing wrong. “I’m very proud of him,” she said, “He’s an honourable man.”"
"Rising unemployment is a slowly unfolding crisis. For many employers, decisions about redundancies and hiring have taken a back seat while they consider how to survive the pandemic. The cushion of the government’s furlough scheme has also provided them with some breathing space, allowing them to send staff home and take a longer look at how many they think they might need. Yet with almost 700,000 people finding themselves out of work between March and July, it is clear the situation is already worsening. In a disturbing assessment of the outlook for jobs, the Institute for Employment Studies says the UK is on the cusp of suffering “a prolonged labour market shock”. This view follows not just the latest labour market figures, which give a picture of the first five months following the coronavirus lockdown, but the signals sent by employers showing how they plan to cope with the ending of the furlough scheme next month. They plan to cope by laying off hundreds of thousands more workers. The IES is predicting that there will be 445,000 redundancies between 1 July and 30 September, with most of them occurring in August and September. It believes there will be a further 205,000 between October and December. As with previous recessions, the pain will not be spread evenly. The Office for National Statistics said that between May and July, the north-west was the biggest loser after a 0.6 percentage point increase to an unemployment rate of 3.5%. The north-east remains the region with the highest level of unemployment at 5.2%. A long term trend for larger companies to cut administrative and “white collar” staff is also likely to accelerate. Recent data from LinkedIn, the work-focused social network owned by Microsoft, shows that the proportion of workers with new jobs in the media, software and finance has lagged behind other sectors despite the gradual return to workplaces. Meanwhile, the ONS found the number of young people in the UK without a job rose by 156,000 in the three months to July. This leap in unemployment for those aged between 16 and 24 resulted in the biggest drop in employment compared with other age groups. Concerns that the young are bearing the brunt of the crisis is recognised inside the Treasury. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has set aside funds for training to allow young people made redundant to acquire new skills. However, the sheer scale of job cuts to come is likely to dwarf these efforts. Dave Innes, the head of economics at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, echoed the calls by business groups and economists for an extension of the furlough scheme in some form when he said “avoiding entirely preventable mass unemployment and the long-lasting economic and social scarring that accompanies it should be a priority”. So far the Treasury has refused to budge, saying the furlough scheme must end on 31 October. How long it can stick to this deadline remains to be seen."
"One of Britain’s most successful tech companies, Arm Holdings, is being sold by its Japanese owners for $40bn (£31bn) in a deal that could reshape the semiconductor landscape. Nvidia, a US company, will pay SoftBank $21.5bn in shares and $12bn in cash for the chip designer, although the deal is still subject to regulatory approval in the UK and could face opposition from its new owners’ rivals and British politicians concerned about foreign takeovers. It is expected that Nvidia will face tough conditions on protecting jobs and the status of Arm’s headquarters in Cambridge as part of the deal. Arm co-founder Hermann Hauser described the takeover as an “absolute disaster” and said it would destroy the company’s business model and lead to job losses at its Cambridge headquarters and elsewhere in the UK. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning, he said any promises made on jobs were “meaningless unless they are legally enforceable”, pointing to the takeover of Cadbury by US company Kraft in 2010.  Mike Clancy, general secretary of science and technology union Prospect, called on the government to intervene in a deal he described as a “worrying development”. “If the UK tech sector is to flourish and create the jobs of the future here in Britain, then we need our crown jewels to be owned and managed in a sustainable way that prioritises investment in the workforce and in research and development. “It is not too late for the government to take a more hands-on approach to this deal and impose some binding conditions to secure a stable future for Arm that benefits the whole country.” SoftBank paid $32bn for the company four years ago in a deal that pledged to keep the headquarters in Cambridge. It also netted a fortune for Arm’s executives, and this time around Arm employees will share $1.5bn in Nvidia shares. Founded in Cambridge in 1990, Arm specialises in microprocessors, and dominates the global smartphone market. But its chips are also found in countless sensors, smart devices and cloud services. Nvidia, based in California, is best known for graphics cards that are favoured in the video game industry. It has seen sales skyrocket during the coronavirus crisis, with gaming a popular pastime in lockdown. Its products are also increasingly used for artificial intelligence and in data centres. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said the deal would create “the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence”, and promised to keep the Arm headquarters in Cambridge. “AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and has launched a new wave of computing,” he said in a statement. “In the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than today’s internet-of-people. Our combination will create a company fabulously positioned for the age of AI. “Arm will remain headquartered in Cambridge. We will expand on this great site and build a world-class AI research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars and other fields. And, to attract researchers and scientists from the UK and around the world to conduct groundbreaking work, Nvidia will build a state-of-the-art AI supercomputer, powered by Arm CPUs. Arm Cambridge will be a world-class technology centre.” However, his move for Arm is unlikely to go unchallenged in the industry. Arm licenses its technology to any company that wants to buy it and its customers include Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm, which in turn use it in their devices. The gives Nvidia control of technology from Arm that could be used to make its own central processor chips, doubling down on Nvidia’s strategy of buying up technologies in parts of the booming data centre business where it does not currently play. Nvidia’s deal would also put Arm under the control of a US-based combatant amid a trade cold war between the United States and China, which is rushing to develop a domestic semiconductor industry while US officials seek to stem its rise. Geoff Blaber, vice president of research for the Americas with CCS Insights, said the deal “will rightly face huge opposition” from Arm’s customers. “An acquisition by Nvidia would be detrimental to Arm and its ecosystem,” Blaber said. “Independence is critical to the ongoing success of Arm and once that is compromised, its value will start to erode.” Nvidia began as a graphics chip designer and has expanded into products for areas including artificial intelligence and data centres. The Arm acquisition will put Nvidia into even more intense competition with rivals in the data centre chip market such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices because Arm has been developing technology to compete with their chips. Softbank’s boss, Masayoshi Son, had lionised the potential of Arm but was slashing his stakes in major assets to raise cash. The deal will see SoftBank and the $100bn Vision Fund, which has a 25% stake in Arm, take a stake in Nvidia of between 6.7% and 8.1%. SoftBank could also be paid an additional $5bn in cash or shares, depending on the chip designer’s business performance."
"The number of redundancies in the UK has accelerated at the fastest pace since the financial crisis despite more than half of furloughed workers returning to their jobs after the lifting of lockdown. As concerns mount over a looming autumn jobs crisis when the Treasury’s wage subsidy scheme closes at the end of next month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 156,000 people were made redundant in the three months to July. This is an increase of 48,000 from the three months to the end of May, and the sharpest quarterly rise since 2009.  The ONS said early indicators from HMRC showed 695,000 workers had dropped from company payrolls since March when the pandemic struck, with younger workers bearing the brunt after the economy plunged into the deepest recession on record. Despite growing calls for an extension in the furlough scheme as the employment outlook deteriorates, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, released separate figures which showed large numbers of people returning to work. Heralding the scheme as a success, the Treasury said the share of the UK workforce on furlough had fallen by more than half since its peak, dropping from 30% in May to 11% by mid August, and said it probably declined further still as the economy builds momentum. Sunak said the government would continue to provide support to struggling firms to protect the jobs market through its £1,000 job retention bonus and £2bn kickstart job creation scheme for under 25s. Speaking after a visit to the Emma Bridgewater ceramics factory in Stoke-on-Trent, the chancellor told the BBC he was looking for “new ways” to support jobs. Saying it was his number one priority, he said: “As today’s official employment figures today show, the furlough scheme has done what it was designed to do - save jobs and help people back to work, where they want to be. “We were clear at the start of the pandemic that we couldn’t save every job, but the furlough scheme has supported millions of workers and we want to help employers keep people on.” The chancellor will, however, allow a crucial deadline to pass on Wednesday without taking action. Employers seeking to make more than 100 redundancies must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 16 September is the last point they could start this process before the furlough scheme closes at the end of October. Richard Churchill, a partner at the accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg, said the passing of the deadline meant businesses would no longer have time to plan for the furlough scheme being extended if the government U-turned on its future at the 11th hour, making a wave of redundancies this month more likely. Warning that businesses would make steeper cuts as rising numbers of Covid infections disrupt the economy, he said: “It appears little thought has been given to what happens from 31 October by government, presumably initially it was hoped that businesses would be able to trade normally from that point onwards which is now clearly not possible.” Despite the furlough scheme preventing a sharper rise in unemployment, the latest official figures from the ONS showed the unemployment rate increased to 4.1% in the three months to the end of July, representing about 1.4 million people out of work. Although a slight increase from 3.9% in the three months to the end of June, the Bank of England expects the rate to hit 7.5% before Christmas, which would mean about 2.5 million unemployed. Business leaders warned further support would be required to prevent a dramatic increase in job losses over the coming months. Adding to calls from the Labour leader, Kier Starmer, the Confederation of British Industry said a successor to the furlough scheme was urgently needed to protect businesses and jobs. Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the business lobby group, said: “Rising redundancies, rising unemployment and a record fall in the number of young people in work are clear warning signs of what is to come.” Despite the Treasury figures showing the share of the workforce on furlough has fallen to 11%, the proportion is significantly higher in sectors of the economy that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. More than 40% of workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation industries remained on furlough in mid-August, while almost a third of workers in the sector that includes hotels and restaurants are still away from their jobs. Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “All the evidence is pointing to a mounting jobs crisis across Britain. “The reopening of the economy this summer after lockdown may have boosted economic activity, but it has not spurred a recovery in the jobs market, with unemployment and redundancies rising sharply in July.”"
"BHP has established a heritage advisory council with Banjima native title holders to inform the design of its $4.5bn South Flank iron ore mining operation, just three months after the mining giant received government permission to destroy at least 40 sites against the wishes of the Banjima people. Guardian Australia revealed in June that the Western Australian government had granted BHP permission to destroy 40 Aboriginal heritage sites belonging to the Banjima people, in order to progress its South Flank development. A further 46 sites identified as sacred by the Banjima did not meet the threshold for the WA Aboriginal cultural materials committee to register them as a site, meaning they could be destroyed or damaged without permission. Within hours of the initial report being published, BHP had backed down and said it “will not disturb the sites identified without further extensive consultation with the Banjima people”. Ministerial consent to destroy the sites was granted by the WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, on 29 May, five days after the destruction of ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge by BHP’s main competitor, Rio Tinto, and three days after the incident had made global headlines. The announcement of the new heritage council comes as Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, is awaiting a board meeting that will decide his fate, as investors and Indigenous stakeholders call for heads to roll over the mismanagement of Aboriginal heritage. Jacques was criticised after telling a parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the 46,000-year-old rock shelters that Rio Tinto could have chosen a design for its Brockman 4 iron ore mine that would have left the sites undamaged, but chose to destroy them to access an additional US$135m in high grade iron ore. In a statement late on Thursday, BHP said it had agreed with the Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (BNTAC) to establish an advisory council made up of Banjima elders and senior BHP representatives “to provide input into mine planning at South Flank”. It follows the filing of a shareholder resolution, to be debated at BHP’s Australian and global annual general meetings in October, calling for an immediate stop to all mining that could “disturb, destroy, or desecrate” Aboriginal heritage. A similar resolution was filed against Fortescue Metals Group, the third of the big three iron ore miners in the Pilbara region, on Thursday. BHP said the heritage advisory council would “build on the long-standing partnership between Banjima and BHP”, which has involved 20 years of negotiation and includes the signing in 2015 of a 100-year deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. That deal prevented BNTAC from opposing an application under s.18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act of WA to destroy cultural heritage sites, even though they told the WA government, through an archeological adviser, that they would “suffer spiritual and physical harm if they are destroyed”. BHP manages more than 8,000 Aboriginal heritage sites on its Western Australian mining leases, but would not say how many it currently has permission to destroy. BNTAC chair and senior elder Maitland Parker said the heritage advisory council was “the next step in how Banjima and BHP seek to consider and communicate with respect to cultural heritage”. Parker said it would “open an important line of communication between Banjima elders and BHP,” and would help balance economic and social outcomes with the preservation of heritage. “The advisory council will comprise Banjima traditional owners that have an unbroken connection to this part of Banjima country,” he said. “We look forward to working in good faith with BHP with regard to heritage matters and mine expansion plans at South Flank.” The president of BHP’s Australian minerals division, Edgar Basto, said the advisory council “will ensure on-going high level dialogue between us on important cultural heritage and other matters. It builds on an already very strong partnership between Banjima and BHP”."
"Ryanair is to cancel almost one in five flights scheduled for September and October owing to a drop in bookings, as an increase in Covid-19 cases across Europe has triggered fresh quarantine restrictions on travellers. Europe’s biggest carrier said forward bookings had “noticeably weakened” in the past 10 days and that it would reduce capacity to reflect lower demand, mainly by cutting flight frequencies rather than entire routes. The airline said passengers affected by the hundreds of daily flight cancellations in September had already been notified of their options by email, adding that the rest would be told later on Monday. Ryanair said the biggest cuts in its flight network would be to routes to and from France, Spain and Sweden, as well as Ireland, which has imposed tight quarantine rules. It would not confirm the number of daily cancellations, but it is believed to be around 300-350 per day, as the airline had been planning to operate around 70% of its pre-Covid schedule, normally up to 2,500 daily flights in peak season. France was added to the list of countries on the government’s quarantine list with effect from 4am Saturday after a week of speculation, forcing returning passengers to self-isolate for 14 days. Spain was added abruptly at the end of last month. Demand for travel to countries subject to quarantine protocols has slumped, as tour operators were forced to call off holidays and air passengers sought alternative arrangements or cancelled their plans. Ryanair said Ireland’s quarantine rules were now the most restrictive of any EU country and called on Dublin to amend its “green list” of safe countries, which includes Germany. A spokesperson for the airline said: “Over the past two weeks as a number of EU countries have raised travel restrictions, forward bookings especially for business travel into September and October have been negatively affected, and it makes sense to reduce frequencies so that we tailor our capacity to demand over the next two months.” Ryanair last month said it hoped to be operating at about 70% of its normal capacity in September, but added that its “worst fear” was recovery being hampered by a second wave of Covid-19 outbreaks and ensuing travel restrictions. The airline plans to make up to 3,000 staff redundant, despite unions agreeing to swingeing pay cuts until demand for air travel revives. EasyJet, meanwhile, confirmed that three UK bases, at London Stansted, Southend and Newcastle, would close at the end of this month with the loss of 670 jobs. The airline said consultation with unions and the offer of enhanced voluntary redundancy and transfers meant it had “significantly reduced” the number of compulsory redundancies. Johan Lundgren, its chief executive, said easyJet was forced into the move because of the “unprecedented impact of the pandemic and related travel restrictions, compounded by quarantine measures in the UK, which is impacting demand for travel”. Airline and travel company stocks took a further hit in trading on Monday as confidence in prospects for foreign travel diminished. Ryanair shares fell 7.6%, while British Airways’ owner IAG was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 5%. EasyJet fell by 4.6%, while the holiday group TUI was down 5%. The falls followed a day of market carnage on Friday for the firms, with a collective £2bn wiped off the sector’s value after the UK announcement of quarantine rules on France – Britain’s second biggest holiday market – as well as Netherlands and Malta. The cross-Channel operator Brittany Ferries said it was lobbying the French government to avoid tit-for-tat measures that could dissuade more British holidaymakers from travelling. Christophe Mathieu, the company’s director general, said many were still planning to take trips despite the rules, but admitted that it had already been a disastrous summer season and cautioned against another “exercise in self-harm”. British Airways is starting to clear out its fleet of Boeing 747s, grounded because of collapsing demand since March. The first of its 31 redundant jumbos to depart Heathrow permanently will fly out on Tuesday for recycling and scrappage in Spain."
"Tuesday’s federal budget is expected to contain the largest deficit in decades – more than $200bn – and many big-ticket items to boost growth, including tax cuts, incentives for hiring and investment, and infrastructure spending. The government has already announced a series of initiatives that in any other year, outside the Covid-19 recession, might be bigger news. We’ve looked back at the flurry of announcements to see how the ideas landed and whether or not the Labor opposition and independent experts think they’ll be effective. What? An extra $1.5bn for manufacturing, including a $1.3bn fund for grants to companies that co-invest to boost production in six priority areas (resources technology and minerals processing; food and beverage; medical products; recycling and clean energy; defence; and space). Why? To improve self-sufficiency because global shocks such as Covid-19 interrupt global supply chains, and to create jobs in the manufacturing sector. Will it work? Simon Ringer, a professor of materials science at the University of Sydney, backs the policy, saying “to do nothing here is just not an option”. “Considering the long-term large-scale bipartisan government sponsored support for manufacturing by our major trading partners such as Japan, Europe and the US, it makes perfect sense that an Australian government would be jumping in, driving an initiative like this,” he said. “It’s impossible to imagine a thriving export-oriented advanced manufacturing sector and the national government is nowhere involved.” What? A $3.5bn upgrade to the national broadband network, including to take fibre deeper into neighbourhoods serviced by fibre to the node (FTTN) technology. Why? Although the commitment falls short of fibre to the premises, the closer the NBN gets to households, the better internet speeds they will get and the more competitive the network will be with 5G. What Labor says? Anthony Albanese said the Coalition had missed “the economic reform opportunity of a lifetime by trashing the former Labor government’s fibre-to-the-premises NBN” but had now “finally admitted they got it wrong”. Will it work? Experts such as independent telecommunications analyst Paul Budde have welcomed the move – the reaction has largely been one of better late than never. What? Remove the 47% fringe benefits tax on retraining provided by employers to redundant, or soon to be redundant, employees. Why? Remove disincentive for employers to provide or pay for training. More to come? The government has said it will also consult on allowing workers to deduct education and training expenses that are not directly connected to their current jobs. Will it work? Tanya Ross Jones, partner of people advisory services at Ernst & Young, said the fringe benefits tax (FBT) is a “real disincentive to employers”. Ross Jones said retraining could “easily cost several thousand dollars per employee” and “essentially doubling the cost” through FBT makes it less likely companies will do something “to ease the pain of making people redundant”. “This measure should certainly spur some action, we certainly see as a positive thing.” What? An extra $250m consisting of: $200m for a fifth round of Building Better Regions grants, of which $100m will be for regional tourism infrastructure; and $50m to assist businesses in regions heavily reliant on international tourism. Why? In March, the Coalition announced a $1bn relief and recovery fund, with tourism listed as one of its principal purposes. Although some funding went to major attractions such as the Great Barrier Reef and zoo animals, the rest went to purposes including seafood industry, forestry, airlines, airports and air freight. In August, Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, told the Senate Covid-19 inquiry there was “considerable concern” and it was an “ongoing bone of contention that it was not spent extensively in the industry”. This measure is best viewed as a top-up to help tourism operators, who have been hard hit by the ban on international travel. What? Remove the “sub-quota” mandating a minimum of Australian children’s content on television while retaining the overall quota for 55% Australian content (drama, children’s content, or documentary). Provide $53m for the development and production of local film and television, including $30m to Screen Australia and $20m to the Australian Children’s Television Foundation, both over two years. Increase producer offset to 30% for all domestic TV and film production. Why? Create incentives to commission bigger-budget drama, which is more likely to be sold globally rather than only be seen in Australia. What Labor says? “The Morrison government’s changes to content quotas will mean fewer Australian stories on our television screens and fewer job opportunities for local creators,” Tony Burke and Michelle Rowland said. “For commercial TV, children’s content obligations are watered down. For Foxtel, content obligations has been halved. For streaming providers, there remains no obligation at all.” What? Allow credit providers to rely on what they’re told by borrowers unless there are reasonable grounds to suspect the information they are providing is unreliable. Why? Improve the flow of credit by counteracting an atmosphere of excessive risk aversion among lenders. What Labor says? The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said: “I do understand that people want to see finance flowing freely in the economy … but I’m really concerned about people getting caught in debt traps. I’m worried about people getting in over their head. I’m worried about going against the recommendations of the royal commission.” Will it work? The measure was panned by consumer groups on the basis it will enable a return to the kind of misbehaviour that sparked the Hayne royal commission. Canstar group executive of financial services, Steve Mickenbecker, told Domain easing requirements for lenders to assess borrowers’ expenses could see an average buyer able to borrow $70,000 more towards the cost of a home. What? Expand the seasonal worker program and increase incentives for young Australians and jobseekers to pick fruit. That could include increasing the amount jobseekers can earn before income decreases their welfare payments – although more detail is needed on budget night. Why? Australia’s working holiday visa scheme allows an extension of time for tourists who do a rural stint but because of the ban on international travel there’s not enough people to pick fruit. Despite an effective unemployment rate of 9.3% in Australia, there are 26,000 fruit-picking jobs to be filled. What Labor says? Labor’s Amanda Rishworth has said the government has “done nothing to address” the structural challenge for many years. She took aim at the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, suggesting people go to the regions to find love or take photos for Instagram, as comments that “ignore the challenges around housing and the ability to find a place to stay, transport, a range of different, really important logistical issues that so far governments haven’t actually found the solution to”. Will it work? It will depend how large the incentives are. The Australian Council of Social Services chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said: “People on low incomes face insurmountable challenges in relocating for jobs – where people have family supports and have found affordable housing, which is incredibly hard to come by.” “They can’t give this up for a couple of months work with the prospect of returning to homelessness.” Goldie noted cases of people being overcharged for accommodation and being paid less than the minimum wage for farm work – both legally where piece-work rates apply, and unlawfully where the work is poorly regulated. “People should be paid at least at the minimum wage, not be forced into expensive accommodation, and the work should be better regulated.”"
"The US unemployment rate fell to 7.9% in September, the labor department announced on Friday, in the last snapshot of the jobs market ahead of the presidential election. Unemployment has fallen sharply since hitting a historic record of 14.7% in April after the coronavirus pandemic shut down the US. But the rate is still far higher than the 4.8% when Trump took office in January 2017 and the recent pace of recovery is slowing. The current level marks the worst job loss that any president has faced going into an election based on records going back to the second world war. Over the month of September, the US added just 661,000 jobs, down from the 1.4m jobs added in August, a month that was boosted by the temporary hiring of 238,000 people to conduct the 2020 census. About half of the jobs lost in the early months after the coronavirus hit the US have now been recovered. But the recovery in the jobs market has been uneven, disproportionately benefiting white men while young people, women, Latino and black Americans have continued to struggle to make up lost ground. The unemployment rate for white people was 7% in September, for black people it was 12.1% and for Latinos it was 10.3%. The teenage unemployment rate was 15.9%. Dedrea Perea of Bernalillo, New Mexico lost her job in telecommunications in August. Her unemployment benefits have been placed on hold because she is still considered employed in order to maintain her health insurance and can’t reach anyone through the state unemployment agency to address her dilemma. For now, state regulations have placed moratoriums on evictions and utility shut offs, but she is at risk of having her car repossessed and is struggling to cover her back payments on rent and utilities. “I’ve been donating plasma in order to make small payments to my utilities and my landlord so that I’m not too far behind until I can find a job,” said Perea. William Rodgers, former chief economist at the US Department of Labor, and one of the US’s most prominent black economists, said the jobs recovery seemed to have hit “a plateau” and continuing restrictions on how businesses operate, fresh outbreaks and the coming flu season could all slow further recovery. Rodgers, professor of public policy and chief economist at the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, said the current situation would likely hit minorities – and particularly young minorities – hardest. “This is a two-reality economy,” said Rodgers. “Going into this recession, inequality was, by many measures, at all-time highs. One group has faired OK economically and has worked from home while another has suffered economically, and in terms of health, to a far higher degree.” "
"Tesco is to join forces with the food sharing app and social enterprise Olio in a drive to stop edible surplus food from going to waste in the UK and help feed more people in crisis in the local community. Thousands of people regularly give away food and other household items to their neighbours for free through Olio, but this is its first national partnership with a major supermarket chain. Tesco is rolling out the scheme to all 2,700 branches of its UK branches, enlisting the help of Olio’s 8,000-plus local volunteers who will visit Tesco stores to collect surplus food nearing its sell-by date. The food is taken back to their homes, with the items immediately uploaded on to the Olio app, ready to be re-distributed free to households and community groups. Pick-up is then arranged via private messaging within the app, from an agreed, contact-free collection point. The partnership builds on Tesco’s existing food surplus donations programme, including its Community Food Connection scheme with the redistribution charity FareShare, through which it already donates 2m meals every month to charities across the UK. It follows a successful six-month trial, held earlier this year, at 250 Tesco stores which had the most surplus food, including fresh fruit and vegetables, and bakery items. That led to 36 tonnes of food being redistributed, with half of all food listings added to the app requested in less than one hour. Globally, a third of all food produced is wasted, and in the UK, households account for half of all waste – binning more than £15bn of edible food and costing families £730 per annum. Supermarkets have also been criticised for wasting food in their supply chains that could be diverted to food banks, amid record demand as a result of Covid-19. Earlier this week the UK’s largest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, warned that UK destitution rates will double by Christmas alongside an explosion in demand for charity food parcels, as coronavirus job retention and income support schemes are wound down. “We are very proud of our food waste work and our scheme with FareShare helps thousands of charities every week” said Tesco’s head of communities, Claire de Silva. “We want to make sure that any surplus food is being managed and people who need it have access to it. The results of our trial have allowed us to roll out the partnership in our commitment to make sure no good food goes to waste.” "
"British Airways may never be the same again after the coronavirus pandemic, according to the airline’s chief executive, who told MPs the industry faced permanent structural change from the worst crisis in aviation history. Álex Cruz said: “People are afraid of travelling … and we are having weekly changes to the quarantine list. We are taking every measure possible to make sure we can actually make it through this winter. We don’t see a short-term coming-back of our passengers.” He added: “There is no data to support that this is a temporary effect for the airline situation … Things have changed. The airline industry is fundamentally different.” He defended job losses and pay cuts at the airline, telling the transport select committee that BA was still fighting for survival. It flew only 187,000 passengers last week compared with 1 million during the same period in 2019, and was operating only 25-30% of its schedule. Questioned over the controversial treatment of BA staff – during which the committee called the airline a “national disgrace” in June – Cruz said he deeply regretted “that way too many loyal and hardworking colleagues are having to leave the business”. But he criticised the “optimism” in MPs’ questions, which suggested that pilots and crew could have been retained or have pay restored. He said: “We have lots of data showing this will be a long recovery process during which we will have structural changes to the makeup of our passengers and demand across the globe.” Cruz said the changes he was proposing were solely a consequence of the pandemic: “The job at hand is huge, it is structural, it is really long term.” He said Covid-19 was the worst crisis BA had faced, far exceeding the effects of its last big shock, the financial crisis. “In the first quarter of 2009 we lost £309m. This year in the first quarter we lost £700m.” Cruz said passenger numbers had taken four years to recover then but the impact on BA’s business-class revenue had remained: “The percentage of business passengers in premium cabins never recovered.” Airlines expect to fly ever fewer high-fare passengers as video conferencing becomes standard, while travel and quarantine restrictions have hit lucrative transatlantic routes. BA has permanently retired its Boeing 747s, jumbos with mass capacity and large business cabins. Cruz, meanwhile, said BA was close to reaching agreements with trade unions across the airline that would end its “fire and rehire” threat to 30,000 remaining employees. The transport select committee chair, Huw Merriman, said it was a “welcome development”. However, the Unite union accused Cruz of misleading the committee, saying the threat had only been partially lifted, pending ballots: “There are still too many BA workers facing threats to their wages and working life. These threats should be withdrawn today.” Staff are voting on whether to accept changes to existing contracts, which would worsen conditions in return for fewer redundancies. About 7,200 have so far been made redundant, while others who reapplied for jobs have been taken back on lower wages. Cruz said the process was ongoing but he forecast total job losses would be in the region of 10,000, rather than the maximum 13,000 the airline had proposed. “Fewer passengers means fewer flights, and fewer flights means fewer people required to actually service them,” he said. Cruz said he had taken a 33% cut to his £805,000 salary but did not answer when asked if it was permanent. He called for urgent trials of Covid-19 testing at airports and a more consistent approach to the government’s quarantine rules."
"Boeing jeopardised the safety of passengers by cutting costs on the development of the 737 Max and escaped scrutiny from regulators before software flaws contributed to two fatal crashes of the aircraft, according to a report by US politicians. The US manufacturer was forced to ground its bestselling plane after the crashes of a Lion Air 737 Max in 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines jet in 2019. The crashes killed 346 people. In a report published on Wednesday, the committee on transportation and infrastructure, made up of members of the US House of Representatives, said there had been “repeated and serious failures” by Boeing and its regulator, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in allowing the faulty aircraft to carry passengers. The committee’s chair, the Democratic representative Peter DeFazio, said Boeing and the regulator “gambled with public safety in the critical time period between the two crashes”. DeFazio said the committee found a “broken safety culture at Boeing” and “gaps in the regulatory system at the FAA that allowed this fatally flawed plane into service”. The report comes as Boeing hopes for the imminent recertification of the 737 Max after software fixes and a new round of testing. The return of the plane to service is a key target for the manufacturer, which is cutting about 16,000 jobs under the twin financial pressures of the 737 Max scandal and the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced it to cut production further. The report, the result of 18 months of investigations, found that Boeing pushed to cut costs in order to compete with its European rival Airbus. The report said: “There was tremendous financial pressure on Boeing and the 737 Max programme to compete with Airbus’ new A320neo aircraft. Among other things, this pressure resulted in extensive efforts to cut costs, maintain the 737 Max programme schedule, and avoid slowing the 737 Max production line. “The committee’s investigation has identified several instances where the desire to meet these goals and expectations jeopardised the safety of the flying public.” Boeing also made faulty design assumptions, particularly with regards to pilots’ response if a crucial system malfunctioned. The system, the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system, was designed to push the nose of the plane down under certain conditions to prevent it stalling, but it kicked in on both fatal flights shortly after takeoff because of a faulty sensor. The report was also scathing about Boeing’s relationship with the FAA, and about the regulator’s ability to scrutinise the US manufacturer’s actions. Boeing withheld information from the regulator, its pilots and the public, and the manufacturer had too much influence over the FAA, the report said. In its response to the committee’s report, Boeing said the 737 Max would – once it had regained regulatory approval – be “one of the most thoroughly scrutinised aircraft in history”. Boeing had “full confidence in its safety”, it said. “We have learned many hard lessons as a company from the accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, and from the mistakes we have made,” Boeing said. “As this report recognises, we have made fundamental changes to our company as a result, and continue to look for ways to improve.”"
"Tui UK has committed to paying any outstanding refunds for package holidays cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic by 30 September after the regulator received a deluge of complaints that the travel company was breaching consumer law. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said thousands of people had complained that Tui UK was not paying refunds within the 14 days mandated by consumer protection law. Tui, Europe’s biggest holiday company and the biggest tour operator in the UK, will also write to all customers who have accepted credit notes in place of a refund to give them the option of converting it into a cash refund. Tui has committed to regularly reporting the time it has taken to make refunds to customers over the coming year. The measures apply to all of Tui’s brands, including First Choice, Marella Cruises, Crystal and Skytours. The pandemic has caused chaos for the global travel industry and has put severe financial pressures on companies as they struggled to refund customers for holidays that were no longer possible. The CMA has received more than 25,000 complaints about cancellations and refunds across the travel sector, including those from Tui customers. Tui last month reported a loss of €2bn (£1.8bn) in the first nine months of its financial year after revenues crashed by 98% between April and June, the period of the most intense lockdown restrictions in its main markets. It is cutting 8,000 jobs and has closed 166 UK and Ireland stores to cut costs. However, the CMA has insisted that companies must abide by consumer protection laws. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said: “It’s absolutely essential that people have trust and confidence when booking package holidays and know that if a cancellation is necessary as a result of coronavirus, businesses will give them a full, prompt refund.” Coscelli also raised the prospect of further action against the package holiday industry as the CMA investigates its response to the Covid-19 crisis. The regulator has written to more than 100 package holiday businesses to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law and has opened investigations into a number of operators, it said. A Tui spokeswoman said: “We remain sorry that holiday refunds took longer to process during the height of Covid-19. The volume of cancellations and customer contacts was unprecedented and at a time when retail stores, contact centres and offices were closed because of the nationwide lockdown.”"
"Shares in Hut Group have jumped in value by a quarter at the start of trading on their first day on the stock market in a signal of strong investor demand for the British e-commerce company. The Manchester-based business announced at the beginning of the month that it would float its shares on the London Stock Exchange, with an offer price of 500p per share that valued it at £4.5bn. In its first day of trading on Wednesday shares changed hands for as much as 658p, 32% above the price of the initial public offering, taking its value as high as £5.9bn. The price then retreated to 625p at the close, up 25% for the day and valuing the business at £5.6bn. The biggest London stock market debut since 2013 has netted the company £920m, while shareholders led by the group’s founder, Matthew Moulding, and a group of retail veterans, will share gross proceeds of £961m. Moulding’s 17% shareholding in the company is now worth £950m. The former Tesco boss Terry Leahy is cashing in £17m of shares, the former Matalan and Asda boss Angus Monro £4.6m and the former Debenhams boss Terry Green £6.2m, with all three retaining multimillion-pound stakes. The Scottish retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter, a former House of Fraser investor who made millions from selling the Sports Division chain to the rival JJB Sports in the 1990s, is the biggest beneficiary among the Hut Group’s retail veteran backers, selling £52.5m of shares and retaining a stake worth more than £95m. Hunter said the majority of the proceeds from the shares sold on Wednesday would go to the Hunter Foundation, which backs charitable efforts including supporting, entrepreneurship, children and disadvantaged young people. Moulding has previously said the timing of the float was prompted by private equity backers wanting to sell their investments. The private equity firm KKR has sold all its shares, worth almost £450m, during the flotation. A fund linked to the Beano owner, DC Thomson, has also sold £1.5m of shares and retains a near £5m stake. Other investors include the investment funds BlackRock, Merian Global Investors and Balderton Capital, which also invested in Wonga and Betfair. The valuation propelled Hut Group into the ranks of Britain’s most valuable public companies. However, it does not qualify for the FTSE 100 index because of an unusual governance structure that prevented it from gaining a premium listing. Moulding has continued as joint chairman and chief executive of the company, and will retain a “founder’s share”, meaning he will retain control for three years. Moulding has defended the arrangement, which is more common in the US than in the UK, saying he wanted to protect against a hostile takeover. He is also in line for large bonus payouts of as much as £700m if Hut Group’s market value rises to £7.25bn in three years. Moulding also sold part of his shareholding in the flotation via a Guernsey-based investment vehicle to fund the acquisition of property from the group. Moulding will then charge the group £19m in rent per year. Moulding founded Hut Group in 2004, gradually moving the business from selling CDs tax free online to running websites for other retailers such as Asda, Tesco and WH Smith. The Hut Group provides technology for brands such as Nestlé, Unilever and Danone to sell direct to consumers. However, the majority of its £1.1bn revenues in 2019 still came from its own direct-to-consumer sales, through websites including Lookfantastic, Glossybox and Zavvi as well as beauty brands such as Espa and Illamasqua and the sports nutrition company Myprotein. It employs about 7,000 people around the world and has just built a new $1bn campus near Manchester airport, which it says has room for 10,000. The company previously planned to float in 2011 but it cancelled the share offering because of a fraud, according to court documents reported by the Guardian."
"Australia’s employment rebounded with 111,000 more jobs in August compared with July, but more Victorians are out of work due to the state’s second wave of Covid-19 and Melbourne’s stage-four lockdown. The Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force data, released on Thursday, confirms Australia’s two-speed economy, with unemployment falling overall by 0.7% to 6.8% but rising in Victoria to 7.1% after the loss of 42,400 jobs. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra that although the figures show Australia’s economy is “remarkably resilient” and “fighting back”, the road to recovery will still be “long, hard and bumpy”. The effective unemployment rate – including those who had left the labour market or worked zero hours – fell from 9.8% to 9.3% but “still remains high”, he said. Before the release Scott Morrison defended the government’s decision to reduce jobkeeper wage subsidies and the coronavirus supplement from late September, suggesting they would be boosted by new job creation initiatives in the October budget. Employment increased by 0.9% in August, the ABS found, but hours worked rose by just 0.1%. In Victoria hours fell by 4.8% compared with a 1.8% increase across the rest of Australia. The rebound in jobs was stronger for women, with 67,000 more in work compared with 44,000 men. Despite the improvement in unemployment, the underemployment rate remained at 11.2%, 2.4% above the level in March. The underutilisation rate, which combines the unemployment and underemployment rates, fell 0.7% to 18.0% but remained 4.7% higher than March. The 111,000 boost to employment in seasonally adjusted terms resulted from a net increase in employment of 44,500 between July and August. This was driven by a surge of owner-managers without employees returning to work (50,200), dwarfing the minimal growth in the number of employees (up 2,600). Employment grew in all states and territories except Victoria in August: Victoria also has the highest proportion of employed workers on zero hours (3.5%): At the Covid-19 Senate inquiry hearing, Labor targeted the government over its decision to cut jobkeeper and jobseeker by $300 a fortnight from late September, with bigger cuts for part-time workers. A Deloitte report released this week warned that reducing the coronavirus supplement would cost the economy $31bn and the equivalent of 145,000 full-time jobs over two years. According to the McKell Institute, cuts to jobkeeper will take $9.9bn out of the economy by Christmas with a $1.52bn reduction in fortnightly support. Earlier Morrison told reporters at BlueScope Steel in Port Kembla that jobkeeper needed to be reduced because “keeping the Australian economy on life support” was not sustainable, costing $11bn a month. The government would use next month’s budget to announce “a lot of new plans, a lot of new initiatives, that will see us grow out of this Covid recession”, the prime minister added. “We know the effective rate of unemployment is well over 10% and can peak a lot higher than that … Treasury advises it’s going to stay up around that 14% mark. “It was falling before the Victorian wave hit us, and with Victoria opening up again we would expect to see that fall again.” Labor’s shadow employment minister, Brendan O’Connor, said it welcomed the reduction in the unemployment rate but is concerned the figures “would convince the government not to do enough to help our economy and to help the almost 1 million Australian workers still out of work”. “The government is foreshadowing that in just 10 days time they’re going to rip billions of dollars out of the economy, which could have very adverse effects on businesses and indeed on employment.” On Wednesday, the OECD updated its forecasts for Australia’s economy, finding it is set to shrink by 4.1% in 2020, a 0.9% improvement on its June forecast, but grow by just 2.5% in 2021, down 1.6% on projections, indicating a slower recovery. Frydenberg said the government would outline “the next stage of the jobmaker plan” in the October budget with a focus on tax, industrial relations, cutting red tape, energy, skills and infrastructure. Luke Yeaman, the deputy secretary of Treasury’s macroeconomic group, told the inquiry that “in isolation” it was “undisputed” that tapering the jobkeeper and jobseeker rates “will take some income out of the economy”. But Yeaman argued that “across large parts of the country”, except Victoria, economic indicators including the labour market had improved."
"Mining giant BHP has told a federal inquiry it has found a way to save 10 of the more than 40 significant Aboriginal sites it has permission to destroy under Western Australia’s outdated heritage laws, by changing its plans for the South Flank iron ore mine extension, after consultation with the Banjima traditional owners. BHP said it is reviewing all 57 of the permissions it has been granted to destroy heritage sites in the Pilbara, in the wake of the Juukan Gorge disaster, in which Rio Tinto blew up a 46,000-year-old significant site to access higher-grade iron ore. Three of Rio’s senior executives, including the global chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, have been sacked after sustained global condemnation and shareholder revolt. BHP’s president of minerals Australia, Edgar Basto, told the inquiry the company will not act on any of the permissions it has “without further extensive consultation with traditional owners”. Under section 18 of WA’s heritage laws, mining companies can apply to destroy sites and are rarely refused. Traditional owners have no right of objection or reply. “Juukan Gorge has had everyone’s focus on cultural heritage,” Basto said. “It was a tragic event and we all need to learn from it, and we are determined to ensure that is the case.” But BHP’s WA heritage manager, David Bunting admitted the company was aware that the Banjima people did not want any of their sites disturbed, before the section 18 application was lodged. Bunting said a new heritage advisory council will work directly with Banjima elders on future mine plans. Not every s18 application was acted upon, he added. In June, Guardian Australia revealed that the WA minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, approved BHP’s South Flank expansion three days after the destruction of Juukan Gorge made global headlines. BHP “necessarily paused” at that point, the company’s head of Indigenous engagement, Libby Ferrari told the senate inquiry. “We made the decision quite rapidly,” Ferrari said. “It was perhaps within a week that I was in touch with the Banjima native title corporation and we made that decision very quickly. We didn’t have detailed consultation, we were treating it in the same way as we would treat a safety incident. “We had got this approval and we clearly wanted to make sure we stopped and thought clearly about what we wanted to do before we continued on.” BHP also said that if new information that materially changes the significance of a heritage site comes to light, it will “not undertake any activity that would disturb that site without agreement”, and will not enforce the “gag clauses” in its agreements that prevent traditional owners from speaking publicly about heritage concerns. “We cannot get this wrong and we are committed to doing anything we can to achieve that,” Ferrari said. But Kimberley Land Council (KLC) chairman, Nolan Hunter later said the issue was “not about consultation” between parties, but the lack of legislative protection for Aboriginal traditional owners under state and federal heritage regimes. When asked if the KLC would support laws giving traditional owners the right of veto over developments on their lands, Hunter replied: “In a word? Absolutely.” Hunter said the Native Title Act also needs reform because it forces Aboriginal people to go through the “trauma of having to continually prove their identity” and rights to country. “What does it take for Aboriginal people to get proper recognition of their heritage rights?” Hunter said. CEO of the WA Chamber of minerals and former NT chief minister, Paul Everingham, said the Pilbara is the “engine room” of the Australian economy, accounting for 70% of exports worth between $294 and $300bn in value. “Does it reflect poorly on us? Absolutely. Do we need to do better? Absolutely.” “[At Juukan] a very big mistake was made. We need to remedy that and be better and do better.” But Everingham said he did not consider a right of veto under the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act was necessary. “Veto is a contentious term,” Everingham said. “We believe the act that is out for circulation at the moment by Minister Wyatt strikes the appropriate balance. It provides a circuit breaker, where traditional owners can go to the minister to appeal.” He said there was “no evidence” that federal legislation would help prevent another Juukan Gorge, and might make heritage protection “more complicated”. The inquiry is ongoing and chairman Warren Entsch has said it is very important that they be able to travel to the Pilbara to meet and talk with traditional owners in person. It is due to report in early December."
"John Lewis is working on plans for a massive reduction in the size of its London flagship store, converting entire floors into offices, as shoppers switch to buying online and the crisis on British high streets turns into a fight for survival amid the Covid pandemic. The staff-owned department store has applied for planning permission to switch up to three floors of its landmark Oxford Street store – which currently house children’s ranges, electrical goods, kitchen and bathroom departments as well as dining areas – into office space for rent. The site on one of Europe’s most high-profile shopping thoroughfares has been of totemic importance to the retailer, at one point accounting for 10% of the department store chain’s revenues. Plans filed with Westminster council leave four floors of retail space below the three new office floors. The store’s topmost floors are already largely office and storage space used by the retailer. A new cycle parking area is planned in the lower basement, while the store’s roof garden dining area on the sixth floor would be retained. The potential changes, first reported by the London Evening Standard, come as John Lewis battles to stem losses in the face of heavy competition from online and other high street players. The chain is expected to crash further into the red at its half-year results on Thursday after permanently closing eight of its 50 outlets. Among the stores shutting is the vast Birmingham city centre store, which has only been open for five years. John Lewis said it had no immediate plans to alter the building on Oxford Street, where it has traded since 1864, but was seeking planning permission to give it options in the future. If approved, the planning permission would last 10 years. A spokesperson said: “Oxford Street is our largest and oldest shop and has a surplus of non-selling space compared to our newer shops. We have therefore made a planning application for the upper floors of the shop, to give us greater flexibility on how we use this space more efficiently in future, with the potential to have office space at the top of the building. “While no decisions have been made, any plans would look to further improve our customers’ experience.” Sharon White, the new chairman of the department store’s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, has said she would look at downsizing stores as part of plans to reshape the group for the future. She has floated the idea of turning all or parts of stores into housing. Profits at John Lewis fell 65% in the year to January, even before Covid-19 hit, and the group has said it is unlikely to pay any annual bonus for the year ahead as it tries to cut costs. Even before the pandemic spurred the trend for online shopping, department stores have faced particular difficulties as their large sites with long leases have been slow to adapt to changing shopping habits. John Lewis’s rivals Debenhams, House of Fraser and Beales have all gone into administration. Beales closed completely before at least one site relaunched under new owners, while Debenhams and House of Fraser have shut numerous stores. The coronavirus outbreak has put further pressure on city centres, particularly London, as the shift to working from home and disappearance of day-trippers and tourists has left formerly busy areas quiet. Government advice to avoid public transport put shoppers off travelling into central London, where the underground is a vital transport link, and they have so far failed to return to their old habits. The tube in London is currently moving only a third of the usual number of passengers. At the same time, the mayor, Sadiq Khan, approved an increase in the daily congestion charge for those who want to drive into the city centre to £15 a day, and extended it to seven days a week. Data last month from the New West End Company, which represents 600 businesses across Oxford Street, Bond Street, Regent Street and Mayfair, showed that footfall in the West End was still 63% down on 2019 levels. Khan warned that the capital faced an “existential threat” from the pandemic. One in 10 Londoners are employed in the West End area, and without a boost to consumer confidence, the capital’s premier shopping area is facing job losses of 50,000 and lost annual sales of more than £5bn, the NWEC has warned.  The Social Market Foundation has said the decline of the traditional high street could not be reversed by policies that “turn the clock back” and suggested more retail sites should be converted into homes."
"US airlines are facing what one leading analyst calls a “Thelma and Louise” moment as the industry approaches a government-funding deadline that could decide its future. On 30 September a government aid packages used to protect workers expires, the airlines have already announced huge layoffs but what comes next could be even worse. “I don’t think people get the Thelma and Louise analogy here. The car is up to speed, it’s headed toward the cliff and we know what happens next because you’ve seen the movie,” said industry analyst Robert Mann. Along with leisure and retail, the airline industry has been one of the most direly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Passenger numbers are down 70% and the loss of business and frequent flyer travelers has pushed revenue down by as as much as 85%. In March, airlines were offered two sources of money as part of the US government’s coronavirus stimulus package, the Cares Act. The act gave the industry $25bn in loans to cover general costs and $25bn to keep workers on payroll. The payroll cash is made up of grants that don’t need to be paid back but the loans come with strings attached. Airlines will have to give the US government some equity stake in return for the loans. Some airlines, including American, Hawaiian Airlines and Spirit Airlines have agreed to take the cash. Others including Delta, United and Southwest, have yet to decide whether they will tap the loans. The situation is dire. Over the summer, American and Southwest both posted quarterly losses, with American dropping more than 86% to $1.6bn from nearly $12bn a year earlier. Southwest’s sales fell to $1bn, a drop of 83% from $5.9bn last year. With passengers avoiding airline travel over the peak summer months, conditions have barely improved. Delta has warned that it may furlough more than 1,900 pilots, American said in July it could cut up to 19,000 workers and United could furlough 36,000 workers or nearly 40% of its staff, if enough employees do not accept buyout packages. “Travel since March has been subsidized and the activity that is out there is 70% down and at fares 30% lower than they used to be,” said Mann. “There are no business travelers out there because companies have told them they’re under a travel ban, and if you do then don’t come back in the office.” International travel is down even more dramatically, with carriers operating a reported 2% to 4% of their normal number of flights. As the deadline for accepting the loans approaches, and additional Congress still arguing over whether or not to extend payroll grants, airlines are facing a difficult proposition. “There are two theories,” says Mann. “One is that the industry goes over a cliff in October and it tries to tread water until there is a widely-administered vaccine and business travel comes back.” The second theory, Mann says, is that there will be some kind of last-minute reprieve and “governments decide to subsidize the industry until a vaccine is a reality. While that would be expensive, it would preserve a lot of employment and service, which will otherwise be immediately withdrawn starting in October.” Under a deal agreed with the department of transport, airlines were obligated to maintain their routes but permitted to cut back services. The obligation to maintain routes will also be withdrawn at the end of the month when support is lifted. “The service mandates that will expire will mean cuts in services to smaller communities and services by smaller regional airlines, which are often subsidiaries of the major airlines,” Mann said. “If you’re in a city that loses service that will have a major impact on your local economy. The only thing that will change that is the availability of a vaccine.” Until now, the major carriers have been trying to avoid taking out government loans. Cash-cushioned Delta Air Lines and Southwest, with around $19bn in cash-on-hand, have both declined. On Monday, Delta announced plans to raise $6.5bn in bonds and loans backed by its SkyMiles frequent flier program. That follows United, which used its MileagePlus program as collateral for a $5bn financing deal in June. Others may be forced to accept the government’s offer. American Airlines, which has raised $2bn privately, has said it will use its program to back a $4.75bn treasury loan. Last week, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told the Dallas Business Journal his guess is the industry will receive more financial support from the government. “My guess is that there is a Cares Act II, and I think as long as it has enough room, my guess is that there will be support for the airlines again,” Kelly said. The logic for it was simple, he continued: “The whole idea was to preserve the infrastructure and the jobs to get through this trough. And I think that that was a good idea. I think the only mistake was everyone underestimated how long that trough is going to take.” But without the support of a Cares Act II, Mann says airlines will have to try to summon “confidence they can continue to burn cash for as long as it takes for demand – in revenue terms – to return”. “If you’re Southwest with $19bn in cash, you can continue to burn $20m a day for three years. But what happens to competitors without that ability? What if we’re still talking about this in a year? We’re going to see some kind of industry restructuring, and given how concentrated the industry already is, it’s going to be problematic how that evolves.” As the cliff-edge approaches, there remains the crucial question of when passengers will feel confident to travel by air again. New rules – from mask requirements to temperature screenings – have been broadly enacted. But while some airlines have been keeping middle seats open, others have been packing existing flights. In March, entrepreneur Mark Cuban noted that how companies treat employees and customers during the pandemic will define their business. “Not only is it a safety issue, it’s a business issue,” Cuban said. “How companies respond to that very question is going to define their brand for decades. If you rushed in and somebody got sick, you were that company. If you didn’t take care of your employees or stakeholders and put them first, you were that company,” he added. Mann believes for the airlines facing an October crunch, that idea may be more critical now than it was even then. “Delta and Southwest have generally treated their customers well. They’ve kept the middle seats open, and tried to make it as comfortable and safe as they can. On the flipside, you’ve got airlines packing planes and who have no intention of providing any kind of distancing measures.” For those carriers, Mann says, it comes down to a fundamental question of aviation safety. The industry would be a fraction of its current size if people didn’t think flying was safe. That has seldom been more true than in the time of Covid-19. “Perception,” Mann points out, “is reality”."
"UK inflation dropped sharply to 0.2% in August after the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme pushed down restaurant and cafe prices. The fall in the annual consumer prices index (CPI) last month followed a rise of 1% in July, illustrating the dramatic influence on prices of the restaurant subsidy scheme that operated for a month to the end of August. Eat out to help out was hugely popular, with at least 100m subsidised meals eaten by diners in the UK during the month. With prices cut by 50% on eating out from Monday to Wednesday up to a maximum of £10 per head, the lower average price dragged down the overall inflation rate. The Office for National Statistics said the downward pressure on prices also came from falling air fares and clothing prices rising by less between July and August 2020 than between the same two months a year ago. However, the temporary drop is unlikely to influence Bank of England officials when they meet on Thursday to discuss the economy. Members of the central bank’s monetary policy committee, who have the task of maintaining inflation at about 2%, are expected to maintain the base rate at its all-time low of 0.1% and the quantitative easing stimulus programme at £745bn. They are expected to be influenced by figures for core year-on-year CPI, which was up 0.9% against expectations among City economists for a rise of only 0.5%. Thomas Pugh, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fall in inflation to 0.2% probably represented the low point. “But a sustained rise to 2.0% seems unlikely within the next few years,” he said. Neil Birrell, the chief investment officer at the asset manager Premier Miton, said the rise in core inflation was more indicative of the bounceback in economic activity during the summer months as the lockdown eased and more people went back to work from being on furlough. “Rising inflation has been much discussed as the inevitable consequence of all the stimulus being injected into the economy. Policymakers won’t be worried about this number; they are more likely to be pleased there is activity in the economy,” he said. The ONS said the largest upward pressure on average prices came from games, toys and hobbies, accommodation services, road transport services and secondhand cars, where there was a rise in sales and prices in August. Prices rose unexpectedly in July after the largest monthly increase in petrol prices for almost a decade and a lack of summer sales on the high street as non-essential shops reopened."
"Demand for will-writing services rose by 69% and divorce inquiries soared by 300% as the coronavirus lockdown led many to consider their mortality and their relationships, according to the Co-op. The mutual said it had shifted its legal services online during the pandemic when it had not been possible to meet clients face to face and that this had proved a popular move. “As Covid-19 took hold, people took their mortality more seriously than they previously had,” said Shirine Khoury-Haq, the firm’s chief financial officer. She said clients were seeking straightforward wills rather than more complex estate planning. As for the surge in demand for divorce advice, Khoury-Haq said the incentive was obvious: “If you didn’t like your spouse that much and got out of the house to avoid them, that’s something you could not do in lockdown.” Strong demand for legal work, funerals and the switch towards shopping for groceries locally all helped the mutual deliver a 7.6% rise in revenues to £5.8bn, while profits climbed 35% to £27m. That came despite a £54m rise in costs, £33m of which was offset by government support, including the business rates holiday and furlough payments. With death rates higher than normal levels during the spring, funeral bookings rose 22% to 59,000, boosting underlying operating profits for the division by 70% as many chose to attend via livestream services given limits on attendance under lockdown rules. Meanwhile, sales rose 5.2% to £3.9bn at the group’s food business, leading to a 46% rise in profits to £175m. That came before additional costs including protective equipment and extra staff to cover for those forced to isolate. The group took on 7,000 temporary staff at the peak of the pandemic as it attracted 1.7m new shoppers, while each visitor popped twice as much in their basket. Steve Murrells, the chief executive, said regional lockdowns and ongoing caution about the virus meant the the food business continued to benefit from a shift towards local shopping. He said the festive season was likely to be different from previous years, but might still work out well for the Co-op. “Clearly, people won’t be out partying and won’t be able to have groups larger than six in their house. What that could mean is eating in, treating yourself and watching great TV. Snacking will probably be very prevalent. People will be going out less, so we have got to bring great products to their door.” About 2,200 of the extra staff taken on remain in the business, including 1,200 who have been made permanent. The group is also aiming to move all frontline store and funeral staff on to the independently verified living wage by April. Murrells said he hoped there would be more new jobs as the company restarts its expansion plans after lockdown with the aim of opening 50 more stores this year. The company is also expanding its online services after grocery sales booked via the internet soared fourfold during the half-year to £21m. Murrells said the Co-op was now serving 100 towns online – through its own delivery service as well as partners including Deliveroo – and was aiming for £60m of online grocery sales for the full year."
"P&O Cruises has cancelled all its sailings until early 2021, further extending the suspension of its operations because of the continued spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The British cruise line, which is owned by the Carnival group, has repeatedly put its voyages “on pause”, most recently until mid-November. All P&O’s Caribbean cruises have now been cancelled until the end of January 2021, and all cruises from or to Southampton have been suspended until the end of February. The company had already cancelled its longer cruises, including a round-the-world voyage, which ordinarily would have departed from Southampton in January. P&O said that evolving restrictions on travel from the UK made the further cancellations necessary. Paul Ludlow, president of P&O Cruises, said the company was monitoring the situation closely and would reintroduce cruises when feasible. The company was working with scientists and government on new health measures for use on board when cruises resume. “We cannot wait for restrictions to ease, borders to open and for us to once again be able to set sail for a new beginning,” Ludlow added. Customers who have bookings on cancelled cruises will be notified, and will receive a full refund or a credit worth 125% of their booking for a future cruise. Cruising was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, when passengers on Carnival’s Diamond Princess were confined to their cabins after hundreds became infected with Covid-19, while other ships also became breeding grounds for the virus. Carnival cut hundreds of jobs in the UK in May. Earlier this week, the group reported an almost $3bn (£2.3bn) quarterly loss, as much of its global fleet remains suspended, including its other British cruise line, Cunard. However, earlier in September Carnival restarted its first cruise in months with a seven-day voyage operated by its Italian subisdiary, Costa. Its German cruise line, Aida, is due to resume sailings in the autumn."
"The job of harvesting cauliflowers could one day be in the mechanical hands of robots thanks to a collaboration between scientists and the French canned vegetable producer Bonduelle. Fieldwork Robotics, the team behind the world’s first raspberry-picking robot, is designing a machine in a three-year collaboration launched on Monday. An early prototype already exists, developed by Fieldwork’s co-founder Dr Martin Stoelen, lecturer in robotics at the University of Plymouth and associate professor at the Western Norway University of Applied Science. It has a gripper and a cutter that can neatly slice off a cauliflower head. “It works in a lab environment, where we put a lot of cauliflower heads in a row,” said Rui Andrês, Fieldwork’s chief executive. The robot is guided by sensors and 3D cameras and uses machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence. Cauliflowers are a current favourite of foodies who have rescued them from their traditional insipid cheese sauce and are using them as an alternative to rice and pizza bases, but the vegetables do pose a challenge for robot designers. Supermarkets and most consumers want white cauliflower, Andrês said. Cauliflower turns yellow in the sun, so self-blanching varieties have been developed with leaves that curl up over the head to shield it from sunlight. However, this makes it much harder for a robot to determine the ripeness. Bonduelle will provide the necessary know-how about the vegetables and harvesting conditions, as well as access to fields. Fieldwork Robotics, a spinout from the University of Plymouth, will collect data and feed it into computer algorithms that will power the robotic arms. Field trials are expected to start in early 2022. Stoelen originally developed the robot system in a project funded by the European Regional Development Fund and Cornwall council. Fieldwork envisages a modular robot system that can be adapted for different fruit and vegetables (it has also been tested on tomatoes). The UK’s departure from the EU has led to a decline in the number of seasonal workers coming to Britain to pick fruit and vegetables, and some growers looking to plug labour shortages have already expressed interest in the raspberry-picking robot. Fieldwork raised £298,000 in January from its backers to scale up the technology, and has also been supported by a £547,250 Innovate UK grant. It is looking to raise a further £500,000 from existing and new investors. The company has worked with Germany’s Bosch to improve the software and design of the robot arms. The robot is about to get two more arms, and should be able to pick a raspberry in 2.5 seconds next year (currently 2.8 seconds) while humans take two seconds to pick a raspberry on average. However, the robot will be able to work right through the night. Planned field trials in the spring could not go ahead because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the robot will be back for testing in greenhouses next month. Fieldwork hopes to have a raspberry-picking prototype ready for manufacture by next summer. "
"Britain’s financial watchdog has warned that hundreds of small and medium-sized City firms are at risk of collapse due to the economic pressures of the Covid-19 crisis. The Financial Conduct Authority also said it was concerned about the impact of home working during the pandemic, and that companies may struggle to supervise workers in highly regulated jobs, like trading, over the long-term. The regulator also took a swipe at internet giants such as Google, accusing them of earning money from investment scam adverts posted on their platforms. Speaking at the FCA’s annual general meeting on Thursday, the watchdog’s chairman, Charles Randell, said that Google and social media companies were also profiting from the regulator’s own counter advert campaigns meant to alert consumers to the scams. Turning to the coronavirus pandemic, one of the regulator’s executive directors, Megan Butler, said work was underway to get a better sense of which financial firms might go bust over the coming months, as cases continue to rise, putting the economy under further strain. “The financial pressures will also hit parts of the finance industry. Among the small and medium-sized firms, which we regulate for prudential standards, we expect to see a number of firm failures,” she explained. Over 14,000 companies have been surveyed by the FCA so far, and the regulator is now in the process of gathering data from a further 10,000 companies to find out how close they are to failing, and how harmful their collapse might be to consumers. Butler said hundreds of firms were at risk of collapse. “[The] bottom line is firms fail. They always fail, they always have failed. Our concern is that they can fail in an orderly fashion as possible,” she said. “What we’re asking firms to do, and to assess themselves against, is a plausible but severe scenario, and that is leading to hundreds of firms being considered in that first wave. We expect that number to get larger.” The FCA executive, who is the director in charge of the regulator’s investment and wholesale division, said she was also concerned about how City firms will manage to monitor staff in highly regulated roles now that the UK government has urged employees to continue working from home for longer. It comes as major banks like Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Barclays announced they were postponing plans to bring staff back to offices in England in light of the new government guidelines. Butler said that while most firms had managed to cope, some problems had already been identified in “particular sectors” and with “individual firms”. She added it would be much harder to establish a culture of trust if people are not meeting face to face, or were being hired during the pandemic via a remote process. “How do you train and develop your people? How do you assess their performance and make sure they’re behaving in the way that you would want them to do? These are all difficult questions that get harder over time, and it doesn’t look like anyone is going to be back in the office anytime soon,” she said. in his criticism of tech firms such as Facebook and Google, Randell said he was frustrated that platforms were allowing fraudsters to disseminate “scam marketing” cheaply and without confirming their identities, despite the regulator’s pleas for preventative vetting. “You can imagine how deeply frustrating I find it, that Google is not only earning money from these scam advertisements, but it’s also earning money from us, because we then have to try and post our own advertisements up on Google warning consumers about the consequences of following up these leads. “So it’s an area that needs urgent change – changed by Google, and if necessary, change through legislation.” Google said fraud and ad scam protection was a key priority for the company and that it had updated policies that force advertisers to go through a business verification programme. “This programme allows us to gain more information about the advertisers’ identity, business model and relationships with third parties to ensure users can trust the ads they’re seeing,” Google said. “This policy update follows months of engagement with and input from the FCA to ensure we’re effectively addressing the bad actors responsible for predatory financial ads.”"
"Britain’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic was showing signs of faltering even before the onset of a second wave in infections, a Guardian analysis of economic developments in the past month has shown. As the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, extends job support measures to tackle growing numbers of redundancies, early warning indicators for growth suggest business activity stumbled in September before a difficult winter ahead. Global financial markets have sold off sharply and the number of car journeys being made around Britain has cooled after a late summer boom for domestic tourism. Faced with rapid growth in coronavirus infections and tougher restrictions on business and social life introduced to control the pandemic, Sunak’s winter economy plan comes as the government faces a difficult six months ahead to protect jobs, households and businesses during the second wave. It comes as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, warned the economic shock from the pandemic threatens to drive up inequality around the world if left unchecked. Writing in the Guardian, she warned a “lost generation of the 2020s” risked being created by severe economic and social upheaval. “Make no mistake: without urgent action, we risk deepening the divide – globally –between the rich and poor. The impact will be profound – and not only in low-income countries,” she said. The Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. On the dashboard this month are several positive signs for the economy before the introduction of new restrictions to contain the pandemic. Retail sales increased for the fourth consecutive month in August to rise well above pre-pandemic levels, as shoppers gradually return to high streets, and continued to spend more money online. The reopening of pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops helped gross domestic product (GDP) to rise by 6.6% in July, clawing back some of the ground lost with the country in the deepest recession since records began, as the lifting of lockdown encouraged catch-up spending by businesses and consumers. However, activity is still well below pre-pandemic levels in the broader economy, while consumer caution amid rising Covid cases and tougher restrictions are expected to further dampen economic activity over the coming months. With the risks of a double-dip recession mounting, economists warned Britain’s economy was heading for a prolonged recession lasting until next spring, dashing hopes that the Covid recession would be among the shortest in history. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “After swift bounce-backs in GDP and retail sales from the total economic stagnation of lockdown, the recovery was slowing – even before the recent return of rising virus cases and social distancing restrictions confirmed difficult months lie ahead.” Despite millions of workers being brought back from furlough as the economy regained a steadier footing in the summer, the number of redundancies in the UK accelerated at the fastest pace since the financial crisis in July. While the proportion of the UK workforce on furlough has gradually fallen from a peak of 30% in May to about 12% by early September, some sectors still depend on support amid continuing restrictions – including in arts and hospitality. A new job support scheme to follow furlough and a fresh extension in government-backed business loans is expected to help protect many jobs as the economic outlook deteriorates this autumn. However, economists warned the measures in the chancellor’s winter economy plan would fall short of preventing a dramatic surge in redundancies. “Sunak’s inter economy plan’ was timely. But, in terms of labour market support, it’s clear that the new version of the widely successful job retention scheme is more light touch than the original,” said Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank. “Bottom line, this new labour market support won’t do very much to stem the rise in unemployment.”"
"The chief executive of Next, one of the UK’s most successful retailers, has said the shift to online shopping triggered by the lockdown means there is no future for thousands of traditional retail jobs. The high street has been one of the worst-hit sectors of the economy with nearly 125,000 jobs lost in the UK in the first eight months of this year as retailers closed stores and in some cases went into administration. Simon Wolfson said what looked to be a permanent shift to online spending was creating work for warehouse staff and couriers but that in the long run fewer people were going to be needed in shops, and their jobs would be “unviable”. “I wouldn’t want to underestimate the difficulty that is going to cause a lot of people who work in retail,” he said. “ I think it’s going to be very uncomfortable.” Marks & Spencer, Debenhams and John Lewis are among the household names to have announced major job cuts as a result of the pandemic. His comments came as the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) warned of mass store closures after the chancellor scrapped the autumn budget when they had hoped he would extend the business rates holiday, which is currently slated to end on 31 March. Andrew Goodacre, the Bira chief executive, said many jobs in retail were not sustainable due to low footfall and low shop sales. “More needs to be done to protect the high street from mass closures and we hope that cancelling the budget does not delay decisions on business rates.” Wolfson said the current rates system was “unfair” and bills for the warehouses used by online retailers needed to rise to reflect the new high street reality. “Over the last six or seven years the price of warehousing has gone up dramatically, and the price of shops have come down dramatically, but both of their rates have remained exactly the same,” Wolfson said. “You could raise rates on warehousing between 30% and 50% and that would make up for some of the loss, and that would be fair.” The pandemic has accelerated changes in shopping behaviour as the lockdown forced Britons online, in many cases for the first time. The transfer of sales from physical stores to websites has put shop floor roles in jeopardy but created thousands of new online roles. The delivery firm Yodel said on Friday that it would recruit nearly 3,000 people, including couriers and parcel sorters, before Christmas. However, only 450 of Yodel’s new hires will be employees. The other 2,500 will be a self-employed and so not guaranteed the legal minimum wage, full sick pay or holiday benefits. The picture is similar to Hermes which in July said it was creating more than 10,000 jobs, the lion’s share of whom would be self-employed. Next has emerged from the crisis as one of the high street’s most resilient brands. Last week it raised its profit guidance for a second time as the company’s sales recovered from the shock of the lockdown when its stores were closed for several months. The chancellor’s winter jobs plan, announced on Thursday, was “very sensible”, Wolfson told the BBC. The Tory peer suggested it was “important that employers begin to pay a little bit more for the schemes and that employees get a little bit less …Otherwise I think there’s a risk that our economy will just become hooked on it.”"
"The owner of Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza has said it will achieve only a slim fraction of last year’s sales because of the impact on its railway and airport outlets from the shift to working and restrictions on travel. SSP Group, which is planning to cut up to 5,000 jobs in the UK after heavy losses during the coronavirus lockdown, said just under a third of its 2,800 outlets worldwide had reopened so far as passenger numbers remained low at train stations and airports. It said it expected to ring up sales in September that were only a quarter of those in the same month last year, despite a rise in commuting. Trading is better in continental Europe, where weekly sales are approximately 66% down year on year as rail travel has recovered in France and Germany. In the UK, North America and elsewhere weekly sales are down by more than 80%. The group, which operates in 35 countries, said the slow return to commuting and business travel, especially in the UK, meant sales for would fall by £1.3bn, or 86%, for the year to the end of September, worse than the 80% fall predicted in March. Expected underlying losses of about £155m will be in line with expectations after the group preserved cash, partly by agreeing rent waivers or turnover-based deals with landlords. Simon Smith, the chief executive of SSP, said: “Covid-19 continues to have an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and on SSP’s businesses in all geographies.” He said there had been some improvement in demand since the height of the crisis, when sales fell by 95%, and that the group would reopen outlets if and when demand was sufficient, as it managed cash flow tightly. About a third of its outlets have now reopened. Smith said: “In the medium term we expect to see the gradual return of passenger travel to more normalised levels. The actions we are taking to rebuild the business will enable us to emerge fitter and stronger, positioning us to capitalise on future opportunities and delivering long-term sustainable growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders.” Analysts at Stifel said the travel sector was likely to see lasting change in the light of the pandemic. More working from home and less commuting is likely to mean fewer passengers at railway stations, while airports are not expected to recover until 2024, with business travel particularly under pressure. However, Stifel predicts that SSP could be a winner in a tough environment as weaker players fall away. “These trends are likely to drive market consolidation, with best-in-class players like SSP well-placed to take share,” said analyst Mark Irvine-Fortescue in a note."
"The Bank of England has said it could have acted faster to identify a security breach that allowed hedge funds early access to its market-moving press conferences. Publishing the findings of an internal report into the incident that hit the Bank during the last months of Mark Carney’s tenure as governor, Threadneedle Street said it had set out a range of measures to tighten its security systems. It also said Andrew Bailey, who replaced Carney in March, had commissioned an external review to investigate whether further steps were required. In a statement on Wednesday, the Bank said the internal review had “indicated that there were occasions where, with the benefit of hindsight, this misuse by a third-party supplier of the Bank’s audio feed could have been identified sooner by the Bank”. The Bank said it had not routinely monitored social media or the broader internet for evidence of companies advertising “inappropriate access to its publications and press conferences”, but was now assessing whether more monitoring could be done in future. In December a technology supplier to the Bank was reported to have sold access to a backup audio feed for press conferences given by Carney alongside its interest rate decisions, potentially giving unidentified investors a lucrative headstart on interpreting his market-moving comments. The breach was missed by the Bank, and was only emerged after a newspaper investigation. The Guardian revealed that the incident followed a restructuring of the Bank’s security department and loss of multiple senior employees in the process. An Essex-based company, Encoded Media, had its status as a supplier to the Bank revoked the same month after media inquiries. The Bank disabled the company’s access to a backup audio feed after the Times newspaper first revealed the breach. Threadneedle Street said at the time that an unnamed third-party supplier would have no part in future press conferences, calling the sale of access “wholly unacceptable” and saying the feed had been “misused”. Separately, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday it was dropping an investigation into the audio feed’s misuse. The City watchdog said in a statement: “We have examined these matters fully. We do not believe the audio feed contained any inside information, nor have we found any activity of concern or misconduct. Our inquiry is now closed and we have informed the Bank and other parties connected to the review.”"
"The head of the International Monetary Fund has given a stark warning that Covid-19 will lead to a lost generation unless urgent steps are taken to prevent the pandemic widening the gap between rich and poor countries. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said financial support for the most vulnerable countries had to be stepped up to prevent long-time scarring that would roll back anti-poverty efforts of recent decades. Writing for the Guardian, Georgieva said failure to act would reverberate around the world, with greater inequality leading to social and economic upheaval. A reduction in exports, reduced capital inflows, fewer tourists and reduced remittances represented a “poisonous cocktail” for the 70 countries most at risk. “Just as people with weak immune systems are more vulnerable to the virus, so low-income countries with weak fundamentals are more prone to its economic effects. More than half of these countries were already at high risk of – or actually in – debt distress before the crisis began.” In her article, the IMF managing director called for a four-pronged approach: “Make no mistake: without urgent action, we risk deepening the divide – globally – between the rich and poor,” Georgieva said. “The impact will be profound – and not only in low-income countries. It risks reverberating throughout the world with increased inequality leading to economic and social upheaval: a lost generation in the 2020s whose after-effects will be felt for decades to come.” More than 100 countries have sought help from the IMF since the Covid-19 crisis began earlier this year and the Washington-based organisation has forecast a near 5% drop in global output in 2020 – the severest slump since the Great Depression. Updated estimates of growth will be published at the IMF’s virtual annual meeting next month but Georgieva said never had so many lives and livelihoods been disrupted at the same time. “The IMF estimates the pandemic’s loss to the global economy at around $12 trillion over 2020-21. The poorest countries – with limited resources and constrained capacity – are hit hardest: growth in low-income nations will be at a standstill this year, compared to 5% last year.” Georgieva said debt relief efforts needed to go further. In response to a call by the IMF and the World Bank, the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries suspended official bilateral debt payments from the poorest countries this year, making about $5bn (£4bn) available to 42 low-income countries. “The initiative could be extended along with increased participation by commercial creditors,” she said."
"The Morrison government will prioritise reducing the unemployment rate ahead of debt reduction in a significant overhaul of its fiscal strategy in response to the coronavirus-caused recession. In a major shift away from the Abbott-era hyperbolic rhetoric of “budget emergencies” and “deficit disasters”, treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Thursday the government would not begin the work of substantial debt and deficit reduction until the unemployment rate was “comfortably” back under 6%. “With historically low interest rates, it is not necessary to run budget surpluses to stabilise and reduce debt as a share of GDP — provided the economy is growing steadily,” Frydenberg said. “Even though debt will be at much higher levels than we are accustomed to, it remains sustainable and will be put back on a steady path of reduction.” Thursday’s speech is a significant pointer to the budget on 6 October. The government is expected to bring forward income tax cuts, provide further support to businesses, unleash significant spending on infrastructure, and help Australians into jobs, as cuts to income support through the jobseeker and jobkeeper payments will be made at the end of September. Frydenberg said if the government implemented austerity policies now in order to deal with substantial deficit and debt accumulated during the crisis, it would be “damaging to the economy and unrealistic to target surpluses over the forward estimates – given what this would require us to do in terms of significant increases in taxes and large cuts to essential services”. “This would risk undermining the economic recovery we need to bring hundreds of thousands more Australians back to work and to underpin a stronger medium-term fiscal position.” Frydenberg said the government’s priority now was to restore confidence after the economic shock associated with the pandemic, and that required a new fiscal strategy. He said the strategy would involve allowing the automatic stabilisers to “work freely to support the economy” and continuing to provide “temporary, proportionate and targeted fiscal support, including through tax measures, to leverage private sector jobs and investment”. The automatic stabilisers refer to cyclical fluctuations in the budget that occur in response to changes in the economy. During economic booms, tax collections increase and expenditure decreases, and during downturns the opposite occurs. But Frydenberg said economic reform would be key to the government’s growth strategy. He flagged “structural reforms that position the economy for the jobs of the future and which improve the ease of doing business”. Some government MPs have been concerned about the size of the fiscal intervention during the pandemic. Frydenberg will be under internal pressure to pursue substantial reforms, such as overhauling labour market regulations, and giving business incentives to boost investment. Liberal MPs on Thursday cautiously welcomed the shift in fiscal strategy, but declared it needed to be accompanied by reform. Sydney Liberal MP Jason Falinski said the treasurer had not abandoned the aim of debt reduction because “the fiscal strategy is to get aggregate demand on a sustainable path and once that’s happened we can go back to debt reduction”. “It’s the paradox of saving – where you’re trying to get your debt reduced but by saving you increase the debt because aggregate demand collapses,” he said. “There is no point collapsing your economy for the sake of having debt reduction if all you’re doing is putting the economy and debt back on an unsustainable path.” Falinski said sustainable growth came from policies that “rebalance risk and reward”, nominating industrial relations, skills and taxation as a focus. Senator Andrew Bragg also nominated taxation and labour law as policies that need to be “recalibrated to drive more private investment”. Bragg said the treasurer is “on the right track because we’ve had enormous shock so what we now need to do is grow to pay down the debt”. But the Coalition “hasn’t abandoned the medium-term focus to run a balanced budget”. The Queensland Liberal Andrew Laming said the shift in fiscal strategy was “very significant”, describing it as “the first time” the Coalition had “definitively” put the goal of fuller employment above reducing debt. The “historic” reordering of priorities “is almost a diluted version of Modern Monetary Theory, a belief that the true crime is to leave the citizenry unutilised or underutilised”, he said. “It’s an ideological shift in the Coalition partly forced on us by Covid ... That if we cut services and insist on lowering debt, we are punishing the current generation for the excesses of those that came before.”"
"Unions have won a landmark federal court case over jobkeeper against airline Qantas, with the federal court ruling companies have to pass the full wages subsidy on to workers. If Qantas does not successfully appeal it will be required to make backpay to hundreds of workers, each of which unions estimate could be due thousands of dollars. Other companies across the economy could also be forced to make similar payments. A group of unions, including the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Services Union, publicly accused Qantas of manipulating shifts to avoid paying workers anything on top of the $1,500 a fortnight jobkeeper payment. But while the unions accused Qantas of wage theft, allegations that Qantas deliberately manipulated rosters for company gain at the expense of workers or taxpayers were not put before the court. During the legal proceedings, Qantas argued that payments made during a fortnight for work done previously should count against jobkeeper payments. But on Thursday judge Geoffrey Flick found that the jobkeeper law “means what it says” and refers “only to the monies an employee is contractually due to receive during any given fortnight for work performed during that same fortnight”. “If the consequence of the interpretation now given … is that idiosyncrasies arise in respect to the quantification of amounts that an employee is to receive – including the prospect that employees may benefit from a “windfall” – so be it,” he said. “It remains a matter for the legislature to “tweak” or adjust the scheme if it sees fit.” He said the ruling potentially affected all employers and workers receiving jobkeeper. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said workers at Qantas “have endured systematic wage theft at the hands of an out of control management”. “This is an important win for Qantas workers who have had their pay raided by senior management in a disgraceful abuse of the jobkeeper scheme,” he said. Assistant national secretary of the Australian Services Union, Linda White, said Qantas’s behaviour was “the clearest example of wage theft we’ve seen in the aviation sector”. “Qantas have a legal and moral responsibility to pay workers their penalties, but it used tricky legal manoeuvres to dodge that responsibility.” A Qantas spokesman said it was “misleading of unions to suggest employees should expect a sudden windfall out of today’s judgement”. “Qantas has based all of its decisions on jobkeeper on the legislation and guidance provided by the ATO and made sure all employees receive a ‘safety net’ payment of $1,500 per fortnight,” he said. “That ‘safety net’ assurance is a central part of the government’s jobkeeper policy. Today’s judgement appears to cut across that principle.” He said Qantas was “carefully considering” whether to appeal. “The judgment will likely have adverse implications for all companies receiving jobkeeper, who are already reeling from the impacts of Covid,” he said."
"The consumer group Which? has called on the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to introduce a single, robust, dispute resolution service after concluding that passenger rights have been “ripped up by airlines consistently flouting the law”. Responding to a CAA consultation on potential changes to its alternative dispute resolution (ADR) policy, the consumer group said the regulator’s current proposals would lead to even less trust being placed in the already beleaguered travel industry. Which? has repeatedly heard from passengers who have been let down by the convoluted ADR process, after flights were cancelled, delayed or failed to arrive at the airport as planned. The ADR process, which is operated by two private companies and overseen by the CAA, is supposed to arbitrate disputes between airlines and customers seeking compensation as per the law. Which? said passengers frequently had to battle for over a year to receive compensation they were due. Others have had to pay claims management companies to challenge the airlines after the ADR scheme failed them, in some cases losing nearly half the compensation they were due in fees. The CAA has proposed changes to the dispute schemes that would include a new process for “complex and novel” cases that Which? fears would give airlines undue influence over how future cases are handled. The consumer group said the proposal appeared to prioritise the airlines’ perspectives over passengers’ rights, and risked the already weak consumer protections being further diluted. Which? cited the case of Ryanair, which was told to pay £2.6m to passengers whose flights were cancelled by strikes in 2018. Rather than pay up, it simply quit the Aviation ADR scheme, potentially saving millions in unpaid compensation. Due to its limited enforcement powers, the CAA was unable to penalise Ryanair. The regulator took legal action, but almost two years on passengers are no nearer getting the compensation they are owed. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “Throughout the coronavirus crisis, passengers have seen their consumer rights ripped up by some airlines that have consistently flouted the law – but they have found there is nowhere to turn for support. This situation has only served to highlight that the current complaints system is broken, and tinkering around the edges will not be enough to reform it and make it work for passengers. “The government must ensure that passengers’ needs are front and centre in its aviation recovery plan, starting with the introduction of a mandatory, single ombudsman scheme for airlines, as a first step to restoring trust in the sector.” He said he was concerned that allowing airlines a choice between resolution schemes could enable them to game the system by choosing the one they thought would deliver more favourable outcomes. Richard Stephenson, the CAA communications director, said: “The Civil Aviation Authority was a leading force in the creation of the alternative dispute resolution scheme in the UK which has enabled thousands of consumers to receive compensation from airlines. “We have received Which?’s response to our consultation and we will review its proposals for how improvements can be made to the existing arrangements for the benefit of consumers.”"
"Halfords has raised profit expectations for the second time in a month after a surge in bike sales. The cycle and car parts retailer said demand for bikes and cycling products had continued despite the end of the peak cycling and summer staycation season, while sales of its car products and services had returned to growth. As a result, the company expects half-year profits to top £55m, compared with the £35m-£40m it was predicting last month and fears of a £10m loss raised in July. The shares jumped 18% after the trading update was published on Thursday morning. Halfords said “unprecedented” levels of demand had pushed up sales of bicycles and cycling-related products by 46% in established stores in the five weeks to 20 September. Overall sales in those stores were up 22%. Consumers have turned to bikes in recent months as a way to avoid public transport during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as for leisure and exercise after the lockdown. Sales were also boosted as holidaymakers bought bikes to use during their summer breaks spent in the UK instead of abroad. Although bike use has fallen back from a peak in April, there were still double the number of cyclists on the roads in September than in 2019, according to Department for Transport figures. The Association of Cycle Traders, which represents thousands of independent shops as well as major chains, said sales had stayed buoyant across the board as local authorities around the country had used government funds to put in temporary cycle lanes and other infrastructure to make cycling and walking easier. Jonathan Harrison of the ACT said sales were above last year but had slowed from the spring, partly because of a shortage of bikes, parts and accessories as major brands struggled to keep up with demand. Harrison said: “If local authorities keep safe infrastructure open that will have a massive impact.” Halfords, which has 447 stores in the UK, has benefited from higher sales of bikes but also demand for servicing them after the government launched a cycle repair voucher scheme in July.  Despite its raised profit guidance, the company said it was cautious about the outlook for the the rest of the year. Halfords said sales of motoring products rose by 7.5% during the period while its vehicle servicing and repair business also grew. Halfords has launched a campaign to recruit hundreds of skilled technicians to work in its stores and autocentres in order to meet demand. However, it said the potential impact of the second wave of coronavirus in the UK seemed to be “more pronounced” than a few weeks earlier. The retailer said it was “cautious in outlook” about the economic impact of the end of the government’s furlough scheme at the end of October, as well as the “uncertain” outcome of Brexit negotiations."
"Shares in Rolls-Royce have tumbled to a 17-year low as the aircraft engine-maker announced a £5bn emergency plan to shore up a balance sheet ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. The dramatic decline in global air travel during the pandemic has hit Rolls-Royce’s revenues from servicing its jet engines and from selling new ones. The engineering group said it would tap shareholders in a £2bn rights issue and raise more debt through a £1bn bond offering. It also announced a new two-year loan of £1bn and a potential £1bn extension of a loan that would be 80% backed by the government’s UK export finance agency (UKEF). The £2bn rights issue was the largest capital raise by a non-financial public company in the UK since 2010, according to Greenhill, one of the investment banks advising Rolls-Royce. Eleven investment banks were among the recipients of £80m in fees connected to the fundraising. It follows days of speculation and share price falls at the manufacturer, which has lost 80% of its value since January and has a market capitalisation of less than £2.5bn. At one point on Thursday, its shares were trading at 112.55p, the lowest since 2003. They ended the day down 10.2%, at 117p. Rolls-Royce said its rights issue was fully underwritten, and was offering a 41% discount, with the company planning to issue 10 new shares for every three existing shares. In addition, the group has agreed a new two-year loan facility worth £1bn, conditional on completing the equity raise. The Derby-based company said the measures were designed to improve its liquidity and reduce the debt on its balance sheet. It added that it did not expect to generate cash again until 2022. Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the impact of coronavirus on its civil aviation business, and in August it reported a record £5.4bn first-half loss. The company said it expected to have burned through £4bn in cash by the end of 2020. Demand for its engines has slumped, and the group is in the middle of the largest restructuring in its history, cutting 9,000 jobs globally and closing several production sites. It is also looking to sell assets to raise at least £2bn, including the Spanish engine-maker ITP Aero.Rolls-Royce’s chief executive, Warren East, said: “We are undertaking decisive and transformative action to fundamentally restructure our operations, materially reduce our cost base and improve our financial position. The capital raise announced today improves our resilience to navigate the current uncertain operating environment.” Before Thursday’s announcement, Rolls-Royce had come in for criticism from some of its shareholders for a perceived delay in announcing the details of its cash-call. East said the company had wanted to put together an “integrated package”, including raising equity, fresh debt and loans. “It was important we got other elements of the package in place before running to the equity market,” he said. “We could sit this out for another six months, but that would give us serious issues around going concern. We know the debt and equity markets are open now and we don’t know if they will be.” Rolls-Royce predicted it would take until 2025 for aircraft engine orders to return to pre-coronavirus levels, and said its path to making money again remained dependent on the timing and shape of the economic recovery from the pandemic. The rescue package received a cautious welcome from some analysts. The credit ratings agency Moody’s, which cut Rolls-Royce’s rating to junk status in July, said the fundraising was overall a positive in terms of the prospects of the company paying back its debt, but highlighted continued uncertainty for aviation. “Rolls-Royce’s proposed debt and equity raising package will substantially improve liquidity headroom to manage through a potentially slow and delayed recovery in engine flying hours,” said Martin Hallmark, a senior vice-president at Moody’s. “But downside risks around future cashflows including its delivery of cost savings and the evolution of market recovery, mean liquidity headroom remains uncertain.”"
"The DIY group behind B&Q and Screwfix plans to return £23m of furlough pay to the government after sales and profits at its UK business climbed during the pandemic. Sales climbed nearly 4% above 2019 levels at Kingfisher’s UK business in the six months to 31 July – despite several weeks during which stores were closed or only partially open – as families snapped up garden furniture, decking, vegetable seeds, paint and other decorating materials to improve their homes during the national lockdown.  Retail profits in the UK rose more than 47% to £411m as the company benefited from £45m in business rates relief and cut spending on non-essential store maintenance, marketing and IT. Thierry Garnier, the Kingfisher chief executive, said Britons had “rediscovered DIY as a hobby” as fewer leisure options and more limited opportunity to travel meant they had spare time and spare cash to spend. He said the group had retained two-thirds of the 3,000 extra staff taken on in the UK over the summer and expected to employ 400 more at Screwfix as it opened 40 more stores in the UK and Ireland. “The crisis has prompted more people to rediscover their homes and find pleasure in making them better. It is creating new home improvement needs, as people seek new ways to use space or adjust to working from home. It’s also clear that customers are becoming more comfortable with ordering online.” Shares jumped 9% after the update on Tuesday morning, making Kingfisher the top riser on the FTSE 100. The group, which also owns the Castorama and Brico Dépôt DIY chains in France and home improvement stores in Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain and Portugal, said it had made £55m in total furlough claims across all its markets in the first half of the year. It intends to pay back the £23m received in the UK unless there are any “material changes in the trading environment” and has also said it will not be claiming the £1,000 per staff member bonus for rehiring workers on the furlough scheme. Kingfisher told shareholders it would not be paying a half-year dividend as it hoards cash to see it through potentially tougher times towards the end of the year. Total sales for the group slid 1.1% to £5.9bn in the half year as growth in the UK, Poland and Romania was offset by continued declines in France, Russia and southern Europe. But pretax profits jumped 62.4% to £398m after cost savings, government bailouts and the cancellation of the dividend. Online sales rose 164% to account for nearly 20% of total sales – up from 7% a year ago – as the group stepped up its plan to pick and deliver orders from stores. Garnier said that Kingfisher “acknowledged uncertainty is extremely high” about trading over the autumn and winter. “Because people are staying at home we have started to think that home improvement will be a bit better [market] than the average market but the average could be a crisis. We are very cautious,” he said. Fears of a slowdown because of economic hardship caused by the pandemic are yet to be felt at the DIY group. Sales rose nearly 17% between the end of July and 19 September. The company said availability in its stores had been affected because suppliers were struggling to keep up with “exceptional demand” for paint, decorating materials, outdoor and building materials ranges."
"Britain’s economy is heading for a prolonged recession lasting until next spring as the number of coronavirus infections climbs and tougher restrictions are introduced to contain the virus. As a Covid-19 second wave spreads and the government launches fresh measures to restrict business and social life, City economists warned that the fightback from the deepest recession in history begun this summer was running out of steam. Dashing hopes that the Covid recession could be among the shortest downturns in history, analysts from Bank of America said growth in gross domestic product (GDP) would probably stall in the fourth quarter and the first three months of 2021. Robert Wood, the chief UK economist at the bank, said: “We struggle to see how the economy can grow in the fourth quarter with escalating lockdown measures, fading stimulus and Brexit risks.” Britain’s economy entered the deepest recession since records began after shrinking by more than in any other major nation in the second quarter. GDP fell by 20.4% after a decline of 2.2% in the first quarter. Economists consider two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP as the technical definition of a recession. Growth rapidly recovered after the lifting of lockdown restrictions over the summer, helped in August by the government’s “eat out to help out” restaurant discount scheme, putting the UK on track for the fastest growth in the G7 in the three months to September. However, analysts said the recovery would probably stop as restrictions are reintroduced and infections climb, ensuring that the country remains in recession until at least next year. Two quarters of positive growth are required to confirm a technical exit from recession. Wood said the UK had “overshot the equilibrium” as the economy grew at a faster pace than was compatible with keeping the virus under control. Suggesting that the eat out to help out scheme could have boosted infections, he added: “The timing may be a coincidence but Covid cases spiked shortly after restaurant bookings soared in late August, suggesting the limits to sustainable economic activity.” Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the new 10pm nationwide curfew on pubs, restaurants and bars, and requiring people to work from home if they can, could mean no increases in GDP in October, November or December. He said a potential “circuit break” lockdown in late October could trigger a 5% plunge in monthly GDP and delay the time taken until Britain’s economy returns to pre-pandemic levels until 2023."
"Business lobby groups have warned that the prime minister’s U-turn on encouraging office workers back to their desks is “extraordinarily reactive and extraordinarily disruptive” and risks “derailing an already fragile recovery”. Unions said Johnson should “get a grip” of his advice on the safety of workplaces after the prime minister on Tuesday told office workers in England that they must work from home “if possible”. The new work-from-home advice comes just three weeks after the government urged companies to bring millions of white-collar workers back to their desks, in part to help revive city centre economies. Within hours of Johnson announcing the new restrictions, Barclays bank announced that about 1,000 of its staff, who returned to the office in recent weeks following the government’s previous drive to “get Britain back to the office” would now revert to home working. Several other large companies are expected to follow. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said of the latest shift in guidance: “Businesses understand that further restrictions are necessary to tackle the rising number of coronavirus cases, but these measures will impact business and consumer confidence at a delicate time for the economy,” Marshall said. “Businesses, their employees and customers need to see a clear road map for the existing restrictions and those that may be introduced in the future. This must include transparent trigger points, and clarity about the support available to protect jobs and livelihoods.” Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI, said the new measures would be a “crushing blow” for many businesses. She said the U-turn on working from home would “keep our town and city centres under great economic pressure, just as people were starting to make their way back”. She added: “Businesses have bent over backwards to make their workplaces Covid-secure and are ready to welcome staff back as soon as allowed.” Roger Barker, the director of policy at employers lobby group the Institute of Directors (IoD), said the new restrictions on office work and a curfew on pubs and restaurants would “inevitably put the brakes on the economic recovery”. “The spread of the virus isn’t wholly predictable, but the back and forth on offices will cause frustration,” Barker said. “With the return of more restrictions, the onus is squarely on the government to set out the next phase of its support.” Johnson said he was “sorry [the new restrictions] will hurt many businesses just getting back on their feet”, but warned that “significantly greater restrictions” could be imposed if people did not comply. He said the restrictions could be in place for six months. “We will only be able to avoid it if our new measures work and our behaviour changes,” he said. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “With infections rising, the government must get a grip on test and trace and safety at work. Workers are still telling us that employers are not enforcing social distancing or providing PPE to keep them safe. It’s clear that this pandemic will not be over by Christmas – so neither should state support for jobs. The PM says he will put his arms around the workforce. Let’s see him prove it.” Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: “We’ve already suffered from six months of disruption linked to this virus, and small businesses and the self-employed will be dismayed at facing another six months of restrictions.” The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, warned that the “very unfortunate” escalation of Covid-19 cases threatened the economic outlook and said the central bank was looking hard at how it could support the economy further. Jasmine Whitbread, the chief executive of London First, which represents businesses in the capital, said: “While public health must be the priority, discouraging people from returning to Covid-secure workplaces risks derailing an already fragile recovery.” 17 July Boris Johnson laid out a plan for a substantial “return to normality”. He said the aim was to reopen society and he was giving employers the discretion to ask workers to return to their offices from 1 August. To help with the return to work the prime minister also ended the government’s advice not to use public transport. 28 August The Daily Telegraph ran a front page story with the headline: “Go back to work or risk losing your job.” The newspaper, for which Johnson wrote a weekly column until he became prime minister, said Downing Street was launching a “media blitz” of adverts to “get Britain back to the office”. 28 August Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “We’re saying to people it is now safe to return to work [...] it is now safe to start returning, that’s what we’re encouraging people to do, because although you can do an awful lot of things via video, Zoom and all the rest of it, there are limitations to that and there will be times when that’s not appropriate.” Following sharp criticism from all sides the “Back to the office” advertising campaign did not materialise. 1 September Johnson told the cabinet: “People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right too.” 22 September The latest change in advice was confirmed before breakfast time by the cabinet secretary, Michael Gove. He told Sky News that people who could work from home would now once again be encouraged to do so. He called the advice a “shift in emphasis”, rather than a U-turn."
"Two of the UK’s biggest hotel and pub companies have announced plans to axe nearly 6,500 jobs as the prime minister announced new restrictions on the battered hospitality sector, including a 10pm curfew on all pubs that could last up to six months. Whitbread, which owns Beefeater and Brewers Fayre alongside budget hotel chain Premier Inn, said it plans to cut up to 6,000 jobs because trading has been pummelled since the lockdown. The job cuts represent one in five of the staff. JD Wetherspoon, which operates almost 900 pubs, announced plans for a further 450 job cuts at its six airport pubs – at Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports – due to a collapse in sales. The planned redundancies represent nearly half the number of its employees in the airport pubs. The pub industry warned that the new curfew would have a “devastating impact on pubs, jobs and local communities”. More than 300 pubs have already closed their doors for the final time so far this year after struggling during the lockdown. The job losses came as Boris Johnson blamed pubs for being a source of transmission of coronavirus and ordered that all pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 10pm from Thursday for up to six months. Johnson also banned people from ordering drinks at the bar at any time, permitting only table service until further notice. Tim Martin, the founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon, said there was no evidence that pubs were a source of transmission and accused the government of being “out of touch and out of control”. Martin, an ardent Brexiteer and Tory party donor, accused Johnson of imposing the strict measures “to be seen to be doing something”. He said that of the 861 Wetherspoon’s pubs, only 51 had had reported cases of coronavirus and of those, 40 pubs had only one infection reported. “Most people think of a pub, a vision from their youth, people dancing, loud music and raucous behaviour,” Martin said. “Most pubs are not like that and no pub when operating social distancing is like that.” The Night Time Industries Association said if pubs and bars had to close at 10pm, there was likely to be “a surge of unregulated events and house parties which are the real hot beds of infection”. Whitbread said the bulk of the cuts – 4,500 – will come at its Premier Inn budget hotel chain, while another 1,500 jobs will go at its Beefeater and Brewers Fayre chains from November. Most are expected to be voluntary redundancies. Whitbread’s like-for-like sales collapsed by 78% in the first half of the year. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said the new restrictions would push hundreds of pubs and bars out of business and lead to thousands of job losses. “Pub-goers and publicans alike want to stop the spread of Covid-19, but this curfew is an arbitrary restriction that unfairly targets the hospitality sector and will have a devastating impact on pubs, jobs and local communities,” Stainer said. “This is punishing the thousands of responsible publicans across England who are providing a Covid-secure environment for their communities, while already operating at greatly reduced levels in their efforts to keep their customers safe.” More than 37,600 English pubs will be affected by the curfew, according to research by commercial property company Altus Group. Many of the pubs complain that the majority of their trade takes place after 10pm, and the early closing will wipe out a great proportion of their takings. Robert Hayton, head of property tax at Altus Group, said: “Government support worth £1.24bn for English pubs went a long way to protecting their future and ensuring that they could reopen safely in July. But with 315 pubs so far this year calling time for good having been demolished or converted into others types of use, curfews and trading restrictions now present new financial challenges which will require discerning targeted additional support.” Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, the UK’s largest pub chain, said: “Pubs are just starting to get back on their feet after lockdown and these new restrictions are a significant setback.” Mackenzie said fewer than 1% of the chain’s 1,700 managed pubs had been contacted by NHS test and trace since reopening in July, which demonstrated that pubs were not disproportionately spreading cases, and that measures were working. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said the curfew was “particularly heart-breaking for those pubs in areas where infection rates remain under control. “During the current circumstances every hour of trading is crucial to the survival of pubs – for many this curfew will render their businesses unviable.”"
"Small businesses in financial distress due to the Covid recession but still considered viable could be left in the hands of their owners rather than placed into administration under a new debt restructuring process to be unveiled by the Morrison government. The Coalition will introduce the new process for incorporated businesses with liabilities of less than $1m as part of an overhaul of the insolvency framework intended to ensure more businesses survive the economic shock of the pandemic. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will unveil the proposal on Thursday ahead of a speech outlining the government’s fiscal strategy before the budget’s release on 6 October. Frydenberg in March adjusted the insolvency framework in an attempt to ensure businesses hit by the lockdowns could enter a period of hibernation without carrying liabilities so substantial they would sink the business. The reforms included temporary relief from any personal liability for trading while insolvent for directors. The government increased the threshold at which creditors can issue a statutory demand on a company and the time companies have to respond. The government is concerned there could be a rush of companies being put into external administration once those measures expire in December and the Coalition has been lobbied by business groups to make the reforms permanent. Briefing materials distributed ahead of Thursday’s announcement say the proposed reforms draw on some features of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy model in the United States. The government says it wants to create a new debt restructuring process for small businesses that are in financial distress – but regarded as still viable. If the business is in that category, the Coalition is proposing to move from a “creditor in possession” model to a “debtor in possession” model, which leaves the owner in control of their business rather than in the hand of administrators. Eligible businesses will have 20 business days to come up with a restructuring plan with a small business restructuring practitioner, and creditors will have a 15-day period to vote on it. If at least 50% of creditors by value endorse the plan, it will be approved and will bind unsecured creditors. During that process, unsecured and some secured creditors will be prohibited from taking actions against the company, including the enforcement of personal guarantees against directors or their families. If the proposal is voted down, then the company can proceed to voluntary administration or use a simplified liquidation process. The obvious risk associated with simplifying the insolvency framework is providing a green light to phoenixing – a practice where under-capitalised companies intentionally go into liquidation to avoid paying creditors and workers’ entitlements. A report in 2018 by accounting firm PwC estimated that phoenixing cost the Australian economy at least $5bn in 2016-17, including $3.2bn in unpaid bills, $300m in unpaid employee entitlements and $1.7bn in unpaid taxes and compliance costs. The government says it will propose safeguards to avoid creating perverse incentives. The proposed safeguards will include a prohibition on related creditors voting on a restructuring plan, and companies and directors will be prevented from using the new procedures more than once within a defined timeframe, envisaged to be seven years. The government says there will be a capacity within the new framework to stop the process if deliberate misconduct is identified. In a statement ahead of Thursday’s announcement, Frydenberg said the overhaul was necessary to try and save jobs. “The reforms are a critical part of our economic recovery plan and will help to boost business confidence and dynamism across the economy by allowing viable businesses to survive as our economy rebuilds,” he said."
"Ocado could make up to 200 workers at its Hatfield call centre redundant as it shifts the roles to Sunderland in an apparent cost-cutting move at a time when the online grocer is recording record profits. One call centre worker involved in a 45-day redundancy consultation process which started this week described the cuts as “quite brutal” for staff who had worked throughout lockdown as Ocado responded to a huge surge in orders. “The people who are [likely] to be made redundant are key workers and worked from the office throughout the pandemic. The staff [potentially] being made redundant will be offered the legal minimum redundancy package and notice. All this at a time when Ocado are making record profits, the share price is through the roof and the chief executive took a £54m bonus,” the worker said. Under statutory redundancy rules, those who have worked for the company for less than two years will not receive any pay-off. Those who are entitled to redundancy pay are concerned they may be disqualified if they do not accept alternative roles offered to them. Statutory redundancy pay rules state that a worker is not entitled to a pay-off if an employer offers suitable alternative work which is refused without “good reason”. The cuts come just days after Ocado’s share price surged to a new high as the online grocery specialist said its retail sales had jumped 52% during the pandemic with a new partnership with Marks & Spencer proving popular. The shares have soared from £12.60 at the turn of this year to £28.65, reaching yet another record on Wednesday. The business is now valued at just a fraction less than Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer. “Nobody is happy to be made redundant but if a company is struggling it makes sense – not when a company is doing well like Ocado. This is clearly to save a few quid,” the worker said, claiming that staff in Sunderland were paid an average £5,000 less a year than those in Hatfield. Ocado said that the Hatfield workers would be offered jobs in Sunderland or in other warehouse or support roles in Hatfield. It declined to comment on any difference in pay between the two sites and said that consultation was on-going. The company said it was making the changes as it had determined that its call centre operations would be more efficient if run from one location. “We are proposing that our Hatfield contact centre close, and the roles transfer to our existing purpose-built contact centre in Sunderland. The proposal will keep the overall headcount the same, but have the entire contact service operation operate under one roof. “Should the proposal go ahead, all Hatfield contact centre colleagues would be offered a relocation package to Sunderland, or have the option to be redeployed into other Ocado logistics roles. In the event that a colleague chooses not to take these options, there may be redundancies although our ultimate aim is to keep as many people in our business as possible.”"
"Pubs and bars have told Boris Johnson that plans to impose a 10pm curfew on drinkers are not supported by evidence and could devastate a sector “already on its knees”. With measures to curb a second wave of coronavirus infections in England due to be announced on Tuesday, more than 175 publicans signed an open letter to the prime minister predicting that a curfew – or stronger measures such as a second national lockdown – would be disastrous. Leading hospitality industry figures also dismissed the view that pubs, bars and restaurants were a significant cause of coronavirus infections. Tim Martin, the outspoken founder-chairman of 861-strong pub chain JD Wetherspoon, said singling out pubs for harsher restrictions was “nuts”, insisting pubs were safer than many people’s homes. “If Boris and his discredited advisers try to impose a lockdown, in my opinion, they’re toast,” he said. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, the trade body that represents restaurants, licensed premises and hotels, called on the government to take heed of its own statistics and avoid targeting the industry. Public Health England figures for the week to 13 September suggested that of 729 reported outbreaks of Covid-19 – incidents resulting in at least one positive test – 45% occurred in care homes, 21% in education settings, 18% in the workplace and 5% in food outlets, including restaurants and pubs. Nicholls said: “Hospitality businesses have patently not been a significant vector of the disease as the government’s own figures show and if lockdowns or further restrictions such as curfews are needed, they need to be highly targeted at the main issue – people moving in groups between each other’s homes and blatant breaches of the rules. “Any restrictions that impact a sector which is already on its knees and that has shown itself to be the home of responsible and safe socialising must be targeted carefully, and come with full government support, to minimise the otherwise seismic and inevitable damage to business.” Pubs, bars, nightclubs and restaurants have repeatedly warned that they face potential financial oblivion if new measures are introduced without the offer of further financial support. In the letter to Johnson, which was coordinated by the Campaign for Pubs, the publicans said: “The reality is that any decision to impose further restrictions on pubs threatens the livelihoods of thousands of people. “It risks the failure of many pub businesses and the permanent closure of thousands of pubs, irrevocably changing the face of this country, its villages, towns and cities. “A key part of our culture, and an institution that is known and loved all round the world, namely the great British pub, is now under grave threat.” Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer & Pubs Association, called on the government to extend further support to the sector. “It is vital that the government recognises the unprecedented challenges that pubs and brewers are facing at this time,” she said. “We are calling on them to immediately put in place a sector-specific furlough scheme beyond October, extend the VAT cut and business rates holiday, and make a substantial cut to the punitively high rate of beer duty in the autumn budget.” McClarkin added: “As an industry we recognise the need to continue to support the government and local communities to manage the risk of rising infection rates. Pubs have been adapting to the ‘new normal’ over the past few months and will continue to do so, but pubs were struggling to break even before today and these latest restrictions may push some to breaking point.”"
"Name: Burnout. Age: First named in 1974. Appearance: Tired, sleepless, short-tempered, unfocused. Sounds a bit like depression. It looks a bit like depression, but it’s entirely work-related. Actually, it just sounds like work. The term was defined by the psychologist Herbert Freudenberger, who described it as a “state of mental and physical exhaustion caused by one’s professional life”. It’s hardly surprising – a lifetime of stress and overwork will do that to a person. Or rather less than a lifetime these days. How so? According to a new survey, the average worker is experiencing career burnout at the age of 32. I barely had a career to burn out at 32. Nevertheless, a full third of respondents overall claimed they have suffered from burnout. What is the cause of all this crashing and burning? Basically, working too hard and working too long. How are they managing that under lockdown? Actually, a third of respondents cited the pandemic as the cause of their burnout.  But so many people are working from home. Exactly.  And working from home means eating pizza and watching TV in your jim-jams. Maybe for you, but a lot of employees obliged to work from home find themselves working harder than ever. Then they are doing it wrong. In fact, more than half of respondents say they have worked more hours since the coronavirus restrictions have been in place. On average, home workers have done an extra seven days of work over the past five months. What has happened to this generation? They feel all the obligations of the office at home, but they are not getting the stress-alleviating social interaction of traditional employment. What can be done about this? Some young burnouts use meditation or yoga to combat stress. Almost a quarter of those surveyed said they wanted employers to offer mindfulness or wellness classes. Huh. I might teach a class in skiving off. You’d be good at that. You know being underworked can be even more stressful than being overworked. I don’t think it can, actually. It’s true. I read about it. You might be thinking of “bore-out”, wherein employees suffer depression from not having enough to do. That’s the one. I’ve had it for months. That only happens when workers are intentionally sidelined by bosses in a bid to get them to quit. Oh my God, is that what they’re doing? It could be time to get dressed. Do say: “I need to take a day off because of illness caused by overwork stemming from coronavirus.” Don’t say: “Actually, I think I just have coronavirus.”"
"Shares in London have had their worst losses in more than three months amid fears that a second wave of coronavirus cases will force the government into harsh lockdown measures that will damage the economy. The FTSE 100 – the leading benchmark of the UK stock market – closed more than 200 points or 3.4% down at 5,804 points on a day of sharp falls in equities in both Europe and North America. More than £50bn was wiped off the value of leading UK-quoted companies as hopes of new treatments for Covid-19 were outweighed by concerns about a double-dip recession. In the US, the Dow Jones closed down more than 500 points, or 1.8%, at 27,148. The S&P 500 fell 1.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 0.1%.  Larry Kudlow, Donald Trump’s economics adviser, expressed the views of many jittery investors when he said there was a worry that the UK and other parts of Europe may shut down again because of the virus. Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, said: “Many economic commentators think that another lockdown would be disastrous for the major economies and undermine the nascent economic recovery which has been in place in the last few months. “A new lockdown would significantly increase both the unemployment rate and bankruptcy rates, especially for small businesses.” Oil prices also tumbled as concerns mount about western economies being in for a tough winter, during which demand for crude would be lower than previously expected. The cost of benchmark Brent crude was down by almost 2% at $42 a barrel on Monday, as financial markets returned to their jittery state of February and March, when the implications of the first wave of the virus became apparent. An early decline in shares on Wall Street added to the gloom in Europe. All three of New York’s main measures on stock market health – the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – were down in early trading. Analysts said the upbeat mood which led share prices to hit new record levels in the US last month had dissipated as investors weighed up the prospect of slower growth and the receding prospect of Republicans and Democrats in Congress reaching a deal on a new stimulus package. With the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, warning that Britain was at a coronavirus “tipping point” and that people tended to contract Covid-19 in social settings, shares in travel and hospitality companies in the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 were among the hardest hit by the sell-off. Shares in British Airways’ owner, IAG, and the pubs groups Mitchells & Butlers and JD Wetherspoon fell sharply. There were only five risers in the FTSE 100 – Tesco, Morrisons, Just Eat, Sainsbury’s, and the discount retailer B&M – as traders backed companies likely to fare better than others in the event of further restrictions. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the government could not wait for deaths to start rising before taking action. London was not alone in big falls in share prices. Markets in the rest of Europe were also affected by the pessimistic mood, with Frankfurt’s DAX index slumping by 4.4%. “Concerns are rising that the summer recovery is probably as good as it gets when it comes to the recent rebound in economic activity,” said Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. “This reality combined with the growing realisation that a vaccine remains many months away, despite Trump’s claims to the contrary, has made investors increasingly nervous, as we head into an autumn that could see lockdowns reimposed.” Reports that UK banks had channelled illicit funds over more than two decades added to the woes of the FTSE 100, which is heavily weighted with bank shares. Germany’s Deutsche Bank, which was allegedly responsible for half the suspicious transactions notified to the US authorities was one of the biggest fallers in Frankfurt, losing 8% of its value. Hancock said preventative measures taken by the government would be different from the blanket lockdown, which led to a 25% slump in economic activity in two months after being introduced at the end of March. The economy began to claw back some of the lost ground from May onwards, but there are growing concerns that the recovery will peter out if new restrictions are imposed. Ministers are determined to keep schools open but hefty falls in the share prices of pubs, brewers, hotel groups and travel companies reflects the belief that consumer spending will be affected by new measures to enforce social distancing."
"Asda has been sold to two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital in a deal that values the supermarket chain at £6.8bn. Asda, which was bought from the US retail giant Walmart, confirmed the sale to Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who made their fortunes building the EG Group petrol station empire, and TDR. In a joint statement, Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they were “very proud to be investing in Asda, an iconic British business that we have admired for many years”. Under the new ownership structure, the Issa brothers and TDR Capital will control Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain. Walmart is not exiting altogether and will retain a minority stake in the business and a seat on the board. The size of the buyers’ stakes and how much they paid for them has not been disclosed. The deal is being financed with £4bn of debt. The £6.8bn price tag is only slightly more than the £6.7bn Walmart paid for Leeds-based Asda in 1999. Even with the US giant’s financial firepower behind it, Asda has struggled to come out on top in a ferociously competitive grocery market in which budget chains Aldi and Lidl have emerged as worthy adversaries. Mohsin said buying Asda was not “just a financial investment for us” with the company’s culture very similar to EG, “not to mention our shared northern values, being from just across the Pennines. The brothers bring a wealth of experience in convenience retail as well as brand partnerships, and KFC, Starbucks and Krispy Kreme are among the companies with which EG Group works. The businessmen leased their first petrol station in 1999 – the same year Walmart bought Asda – and today have more than 6,000 dotted across 10 countries. However, EG’s rapid expansion has been funded by loans, with last year’s accounts showing a debt pile of about £7bn. Asda is not being merged with EG, which the Issa brothers also co-own with TDR , and some analysts think this is to avoid receiving a red flag from the competition authorities. However, Asda has already started trialling a new convenience brand, Asda on the Move, in three of EG’s forecourts in the Midlands, with more expected to follow. Asda said it would continue to be based in Leeds and that Roger Burnley would remain as chief executive. The consortium has promised to invest £1bn in Asda over the next three years and to “maintain competitive pay levels” for staff. Neither side would comment on what the deal meant for the company’s long-running legal battle over equal pay, which has reached the supreme court. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said it was “great to see Asda returning to majority UK ownership for the first time in two decades”. However, the GMB union said the consortium needed to give Asda’s 146,000 staff some reassurance about their job security, given the uncertainty created by the sale process and last year’s pay row. Roger Jenkins, a GMB national officer, said: “They have had enough uncertainty and need to know that their futures are safe and secure.” Rob McWilliam, the Asda finance director, insisted the business had a bright future ahead of it. “This is about growth,” he said. “There is certainly no plan to close stores. We are looking to make Asda price more accessible to more people.”  Walmart will continue to share its buying power with Asda but over time access to the American company’s systems and technology will end. The move comes after Walmart’s first attempt to sell the company by merging Asda with its larger rival Sainsbury’s was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority. This new deal, however, will also require regulatory approval. Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said the deal created the “right ownership structure” for Asda. “I’m delighted that Walmart will retain a significant financial stake, a board seat and will continue as a strategic partner.” Asda made its name by offering customers everyday low prices (EDLP in industry jargon) which stood out at time when rivals used buy one, get one free and multi-buy promotions to convince shoppers they were getting a good deal. However, the battle with the discounters has forced all the big supermarkets to lower their prices, leaving Asda without a point of difference. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Asda’s recent sales performance had been “OK to lagging”, with profits falling sharply in recent years. “In the last decade Asda has underperformed the industry, it is the laggard of the big four superstores and is still behind the German discounters.” Walmart has wanted to quit Britain for some time, as fierce competition made it hard for Asda to make progress, Black said. “For Asda to be a market leader in the UK would require a lot more capital and price investment and I don’t think Walmart were up for the fight,” he added. “Has Asda been a great investment for Walmart? Absolutely not.”"
"Like most small business owners, John Pickering is worried about what a second lockdown will mean for his Norfolk quilting and embroidery shop. His family business – Sew On and So Forth – was lucky enough to recover from a sharp fall in revenue at the start of the outbreak. But further strain – especially during the quiet winter months – will mean making sacrifices. At best, it will mean putting dreams of expansion aside. At worst, it will mean potentially losing his Hunstanton shopfront and letting go up to six staff including his son and nephew. The 67-year-old was hoping to access £40,000 worth of emergency funding under the government’s bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS) to secure his firm’s financial future, but six months into the coronavirus outbreak, Pickering is still empty handed. Banks have so far doled out £38bn to 1.3m firms under BBLS. But Pickering is among the 250,000 small and medium sized businesses believed to be locked out of the government’s bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS) simply because they do not bank with any of the 28 accredited lenders, according to estimates by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair business banking. Without a financial lifeline, many of those firms – which may struggle to afford or qualify for commercial loans – will be forced to radically cut costs or go out of business. Pickering tried to lodge an application with HSBC – one of the few banks that was accepting non-customers until last week – back in May. He later opened an account with online lender Tide, only to find out that the bank had run out of bounce-back loan money a week after the application was approved. “If we do decide to shut down, the government has then got to support six people,” Pickering said. “And we’re on the north Norfolk coast – there’s very little chance of other employment. It’ll cost them a darn sight more to support those people than it is for a loan coming to me. It’s just nonsensical,” he said. The Treasury has started to push the issue in recent weeks, telling banks in high level discussions that that the government expect applications to be opened up to non-customers. However, officials have stopped short of forcing banks to do so, as the matter is still considered a business decision. Even though the bounce-back loan programme – which offers firms cheap funding worth up to £50,000 – is 100% government-backed, lenders still have to make reasonable efforts to chase down debts before the government agrees to use taxpayer cash to foot the bill. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, City minister John Glen said: “Many of those [banks] that are still only open to existing customers are regularly reviewing that position. “The government have always made clear to lenders that they should open to new customers as soon as it is operationally possible for them to do so. Lenders are fully aware of the current urgency, so we would expect them to respond appropriately to their customers’ needs.” The matter has become more pressing for small firms after HSBC closed its doors to new customers last week, saying it needed time to work through a backlog of existing applications. HSBC, one of the UK’s biggest banks, was the only major lender processing applications from businesses outside of its customer base. Critics say banks have been offered cheap funding from the Bank of England – under a term funding scheme for small businesses known as TFSME – for this exact reason: to help bolster lending to businesses in crisis. Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the APPG, said: “It’s unacceptable that up to 250,000 businesses locked out of bounce-back loans through no fault of their own as they’re with the ‘wrong bank’. “Banks who can access cheap funding from the Bank of England have a moral duty to provide loans to these locked out businesses and we are calling on the Treasury to do everything they can to remind them of their obligations to UK SMEs and UK plc,” he added. Industry groups like the Federation for Small Business (FSB) are concerned that businesses like Pickering’s are still struggling to access a loan more than six months since the UK first went into lockdown. “With the end of November deadline for applications already fast-approaching, the Treasury should urgently intervene to ensure that those who find themselves in this position have a guaranteed route through which they can make an application that will be assessed swiftly. “The trend is particularly troubling as a lot of firms will now be thinking about a bounce back for the first time following the PM’s warning of a further six months of disruption.” Banking lobby group UK Finance said lenders were providing “an unprecedented level of support to businesses affected by the Covid-19 crisis”. They said government-backed loans were one of a number of options available for customers, who could also apply for traditional commercial loans, extended overdrafts and asset-based finance."
"The head of the International Monetary Fund has said the recovery in the global economy since the spring is fragile and warned Rishi Sunak and his fellow policymakers against an over-hasty withdrawal of support. In a speech intended as a curtain-raiser for next week’s annual meeting of the Washington-based organisation, Kristalina Georgieva said the unprecedented action taken by central banks and finance ministries had been a key factor in softening the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Georgieva said the IMF’s next World Economic Outlook – published next week – would show a small improvement on the 4.9% drop in global output that had been expected in June. Despite the upward revision, the WEO is likely to predict that this year will be the deepest slump in the global economy since the second world war. The World Trade Organization also said it was less gloomy about 2020 than it had been six months ago but was less upbeat about the prospects for 2021. The Geneva-based WTO said it expected global trade in goods of 9.2% comparedwith a forecast of a 13-32% drop in April. Next year, the WTO has pencilled in trade growth of 7.2% against its April expectation of a 21-24% increase.   Georgieva said that the world faced a “long ascent” and that it was vital that all countries, rich and small, should be attached to the same rope. “The IMF in June projected a severe global GDP contraction in 2020. The picture today is less dire,” Georgieva said. “We now estimate that developments in the second and third quarters were somewhat better than expected, allowing for a small upward revision to our global forecast for 2020. And we continue to project a partial and uneven recovery in 2021. “We have reached this point, largely because of extraordinary policy measures that put a floor under the world economy.” Governments, Georgieva said, had provided about $12tn (£9tn) in fiscal support to households and firms, but some had been able to do more than others. “For advanced economies, it is whatever it takes,” she said. “Poorer nations strive for whatever is possible.” The chancellor is scaling back support for the UK economy at the end of this month, when the furlough scheme is replaced by the less generous job support scheme. He told the Conservative party conference this week that he had a “sacred responsibility” to balance the books. Georgieva said governments should avoid a premature withdrawal of policy support. “Where the pandemic persists, it is critical to maintain lifelines across the economy, to firms and workers – such as tax deferrals, credit guarantees, cash transfers, and wage subsidies,” she said. She identified the other priorities for policymakers as: to defend people’s health; to prepare their countries for the structural change triggered by the pandemic; and to deal with debt, especially in poor countries. “The global economy is coming back from the depths of the crisis. But this calamity is far from over. All countries are now facing what I would call ‘the long ascent’ – a difficult climb that will be long, uneven, and uncertain. And prone to setbacks,” she said. “As we embark on this ascent, we are all joined by a single rope, and we are only as strong as the weakest climbers. They will need help on the way up.” Georgieva said there was a risk of severe economic scarring from higher unemployment, bankruptcies and the disruption of education. The hit to both human and physical capital would reduce the capacity of the global economy and result in output remaining well below the IMF’s pre-crisis projections for years to come. “For almost all countries, this will be a setback to the improvement of living standards,” she said."
"The pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline has told staff to switch off the contact tracing function that allows the NHS test-and-trace app to monitor the spread of Covid-19 while at work in case it is “disruptive” to business, the Guardian has learned. GSK, which is among the companies working on a vaccine for Covid-19, sent the instruction to employees at its research and development labs and some of its manufacturing sites. It told them to switch off contact tracing, which uses Bluetooth to detect if users have been close to someone who has tested positive for the disease. Data collected via contact tracing is seen as integral to the government’s efforts to monitor and control the spread of the virus. But GSK told some of its 16,000 UK staff that its measures to prevent Covid-19 transmission were so secure that they did not need to use it while at work. It said the main reason for the instruction was that it operates a policy of ensuring staff stay 2 metres away from each other at all times. “Consequently, if our site risk assessment is followed, no close contact should be occurring on our R&D [research and development] site,” it said. GSK acknowledged that there may be occasions when staff do come closer to each other but said it had “implemented control measures to ensure safety in these situations”. It said the app would not recognise these additional measures and could trigger the recording of a contact where “in effect”, the risk had been reduced. “Using the above scenario, if one of the individuals were later to test positive the contacts, in this case another site employee/s, could be asked to self-isolate, which may be both disruptive to the business but may also trigger a false positive into the NHS test-and-trace system,” GSK told staff. The message, seen by the Guardian, also suggested that a false contact could be registered if staff left the app on while their phone was in a locker, bag or coat. Government guidelines do allow for contact tracing to be switched off while phones are being stored. But under a heading marked “requirement”, the company said staff should disable the contact tracing function of the app at all times after arriving at work. “You can turn it back on when you leave site,” they were told. A GSK spokesperson said the company believed that its instruction complied with government guidance. “The safety of our employees is our highest priority, and we have put in place strict Covid protective measures at all our sites,” the spokesperson said. “Our pharmaceutical laboratories and manufacturing plants are highly-controlled environments and operate according to the highest Covid-19 security and protection protocols set out by the government. “These environments are distinct from the everyday situations in which most people will use the NHS Covid-19 app, which is why we have issued some specific advice to employees working at these sites regarding the use of certain aspects of the app, while onsite. This is in line with government advice on how to use the app.” Guidance on how to use the NHS test and trace at work sets out exemptions, including in healthcare settings and in environments where staff are protected by an acrylic screen, or the equivalent. GSK did not say which of the exemptions it believes apply to its sites. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We want as many people to download and use the app as possible and it is important to use the NHS Covid-19 app at all times unless in specific scenarios which are set out in our guidance.” The NHS test-and-trace app was beset by delays but launched in September. Using Google and Apple technology, it alerts users if they have been within 2 metres for more than 15 minutes of somebody who has tested positive, and who also has the app. Other functions allow the user to check in at a venue that displays a QR barcode, rather than having to give staff their details. The user can book a test and will be given advice on self-isolation if necessary, including a daily countdown so they know when they can leave home again."
"Cineworld workers on zero-hours contracts in the UK could be left without pay beyond Thursday after the cinema chain confirmed it will temporarily close its 127 sites in Britain this week, putting 5,500 jobs at risk. The UK’s largest cinema operator declined to say how many of its staff are on zero-hour contracts – which do not guarantee any hours of work – but Cineworld workers contacted by the Guardian said that the majority of employees at the average Cineworld site are employed on zero-hour terms. Cineworld employees first found out that their jobs were under threat via media reports on Saturday evening. On Monday afternoon employees had not received communication about their pay for the next month, according to workers who asked to remain anonymous because the terms of redundancy had not been settled. Cineworld’s cinemas are generally run by a small team of salaried managers and a larger group of workers whose contracts give them no guaranteed hours of work. Employers must give employees with less than two years’ service a week of notice – or more according to their contracts. But they do not have to give those on zero-hour contracts any hours during the notice period. That means that workers with less than two years’ service – including many of the students and young people who make up much of the Cineworld workforce – may not be entitled to redundancy pay. Workers told the Guardian they had been treated as “expendable” by the company, and said they had not been consulted about their futures. “My plan is probably to look for other manager jobs,” said one worker at a cinema in the Midlands. “If not I know Amazon are always hiring. It’s probably going to be a minimum wage job.” A Cineworld spokesman said the company has asked the government to extend the furlough scheme, which subsidises wages for temporarily laid off workers, beyond its official closing date of 31 October. “We are currently assessing options for each of our employees. In addition, we have approached the government with a request to re-instate the furlough scheme to support our employees as well as all other employees in this industry, as there is no doubt that the whole sector is in a uniquely complex and vulnerable position.” Speaking on Monday, Boris Johnson urged people to go to their local cinema. Saying that cinemas had devised way of making screenings covid-secure, he added: “I’d encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses.” Mooky Greidinger, the Cineworld chief executive, whose family trust owns a fifth of the company shares, said on Monday that the successor to the furlough scheme – the job support scheme – “cannot work for us” because it did not help companies earning no income. The comments were contained in a memo sent to employees seen by the Guardian. The job support scheme is a central plank in Rishi Sunak’s plan for the UK economy as the furlough scheme comes to an end. Under the scheme the government will support a maximum of only 22% of the salaries of workers on reduced hours – significantly less generous than the 80% offered at the start of its predecessor. The new scheme has been criticised by some economists and opposition MPs for not incentivising job retention. A Treasury spokesperson said: “Unfortunately, we will not be able to save every job during this difficult period – but continue to do all we can to support businesses, protect livelihoods and extend opportunity across the country. Our Job Support Scheme has been advocated by business and is designed to protect jobs in firms facing lower demand over the winter.” Cineworld on Monday confirmed it would close its 127 UK cinemas after distributors for the James Bond spy franchise delayed the release of the latest instalment, depriving the industry of another potential blockbuster. The chain will also shut more than 500 US cinemas, and a total of 45,000 UK and US workers are expected to be made redundant once contractors, such as cleaners and security guards are included. It is understood workers may be encouraged to reapply for jobs once the cinemas reopen, but there is no clear timeline for that to happen. In the staff memo, Greidinger wrote: “The UK government announced a new job support scheme last week and as you know, the aim of this is to support viable jobs. This said, the new government scheme places a greater financial burden on employers, which cannot work for us when we have almost no income.”"
"Shares in Cineworld have plunged after it confirmed it will temporarily close all of its cinemas in the UK and US as it struggles with the pandemic-induced lack of new films to draw in audiences, including the twice-delayed new James Bond instalment. Forty-five thousand employees will be out of work because of the closures, including about 5,500 staff in the UK and 20,000 in the US, as well as contractors such as cleaners and security workers. Staff were informed on Sunday. The world’s second biggest cinema operator said its 127 Cineworld and Picturehouse UK cinemas and its 536 Regal cinemas in the US would shut from Thursday. Cineworld’s share price plunged at the start of trading on Monday by as much as 60% to a record low of 15.6p a share. That was below the levels reached during UK and US lockdowns from March. The sell-off eased slightly after initial trading, with shares down 27% at 29p. The cinema industry has been caught between coronavirus pandemic safety measures in some of the world’s biggest markets, which have limited audience numbers, and the delay of key films that might tempt those audiences back. The latest film in the Bond franchise, No Time to Die, had been rescheduled to November, but this week was delayed until 2 April 2021, a year later than initially planned. The industry was also rattled by DIsney’s decision to release its live-action Mulan remake straight to its streaming service, bypassing cinemas. Cineworld said it would monitor the situation closely as it waited for distributors to plan the launch of the blockbusters that account for a large proportion of multiplex sales. Mooky Greidinger, the Cineworld chief executive and a member of the family that owns more than a fifth of the company’s shares, said: “This is not a decision we made lightly, and we did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings in all of our markets – including meeting, and often exceeding, local health and safety guidelines in our theatres and working constructively with regulators and industry bodies to restore public confidence in our industry. “Cineworld will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time, when key markets have more concrete guidance on their reopening status and, in turn, studios are able to bring their pipeline of major releases back to the big screen.” The dearth of tentpole releases during the pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to Cineworld’s finances, with all sites across the group closed between mid-March and late June. Cineworld lost $1.58bn (£1.2bn) in the first half of 2020 as revenues slumped by two-thirds to $712m. Some 113 Cineworld cinemas are still running in eastern Europe, although 11 cinemas in Israel are also closed. The Labour party has criticised the UK government for not offering specific help to the cinema industry and other sectors that are heavily affected by restrictions, arguing that they will be viable when large gatherings are allowed again. The government will this month reduce the amount of financial support available to support employment, with the coronavirus job retention scheme for furloughed workers making way for a less generous job support scheme."
"It may account for less than 2% of the groceries sold in the UK compared to Tesco’s near 27% share of the nation’s food shopping, but the stock market value of 20-year-old Ocado is now greater than that of the 100-year-old supermarket giant – a change that could reflect the future of the weekly shop. A sharp increase in the speed of the shift to online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up Ocado’s share price by 155% since March. As a result it is now valued at £21bn, compared to Tesco’s £20.9bn, even though Tesco delivers far more food to Britain’s doorsteps.  Before the coronavirus crisis, just 7% of grocery sales were online, but lockdown has changed habits fast to raise that to 12.5%. Ocado delivered a bumper 52% rise in its sales in the three months to the end of August, scotching concerns about its retail arm’s switch from long-term partner Waitrose to Marks & Spencer. The limited options available for those who want to invest in the online grocery business are part of the reason for Ocado’s share price take-off. Most online specialists, including meal kit suppliers such as Mindful Chef and delivery box brands such as Abel & Cole or Riverford, remain in private hands. Ocado’s share price first took off in November 2017 when, after years of delays, it inked its first deal to supply its own hi-tech grocery delivery technology overseas. That technology is the major difference between Ocado and its rivals: while Tesco, Sainsbury and Asda are still collecting most of their customers’ internet orders from inside their stores, Ocado has cutting-edge, robot-operated picking centres. The first deal, with Groupe Casino in France, has been followed by eight others, ranging from Kroger in the US to Aeon in Japan. As a result, investors have reassessed Ocado. It is no longer viewed as a grocery delivery business but as a tech stock – something akin to Amazon with the potential for vast overseas expansion, rather than the relatively limited opportunities of UK food shopping. James Lockyer, an analyst at Peel Hunt, who described Ocado as the “Microsoft of retail” in a 2018 note, flagged that it has not even started to book the earnings from the overseas deals already sealed. “It is all about future potential,” he said. As Ocado investors dream of a technological future, Tesco’s share price has stagnated. Strong sales during the pandemic have not translated into a surge in profits as the need for extra staff, protective equipment and home delivery have all weighed on costs. Tesco’s online sales have increased dramatically – at a much faster pace and total value than for tiny Ocado – but there is scepticism about the profitability of those sales. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco’s share price has also been weighed down by “worries about price wars”. Some analysts believe the sales growth seen in the last six months is a one-off occurrence during the pandemic that will be unwound. Black, however, thinks this year’s change is more permanent. “We think that working from home, the collapse of [eating out] represents a step change, not just this year but ongoing,” he said. Meanwhile, some point out that Ocado is quite different from other tech stocks because its international expansion will take years to realise. It is not just about selling digital clicks, because warehouses and sorting equipment take time to build and adapt for different retailers around the world. The first warehouses – designed for Casino and Canada’s Sobey’s – have only opened this year, two and three years after the deals were signed, but investors and analysts have already pencilled in the likely earnings from those deals and others. Ocado’s technology, however, is not nimble and reactive. In the UK this summer, Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury’s were able to dramatically and rapidly expand their online businesses at low cost, hiring thousands of new staff within weeks and using their stores as sites to pick and pack groceries for home delivery. Morrisons, whose online business is driven by Ocado, did rapid additional deals with Amazon, because Ocado was not able to provide instant extra capacity. Black reckons Ocado’s valuation has gone too far: “The sort of earnings that Ocado needs to do to justify its current valuation are light years away if ever. That’s what’s perplexing.”"
"The organic vegetable box company Riverford has been certified as an ethical B Corporation business, reflecting its focus on its workers’ wellbeing through its John Lewis-style employee ownership model. The Devon-based company scored 124.6 out of 200 in its first B Corp assessment, becoming the second highest-scoring food business overall in the UK behind the chocolate brand Divine Chocolate. B Corp certification uses a broad assessment, substantiated by evidence, to score companies’ social and environmental performance. To certify as a B Corp, a company has to formally give people and environmental considerations the same weight as shareholders or profits. They must score at least 80 out of 200 to be certified and the assessment is repeated every three years. A global model, there are now an estimated 307 certified B Corp businesses in the UK including Guardian Media Group, the owner of the Guardian. Big brands include Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream and the plant-based cleaning range Seventh Generation, while newer startups include the brewer Toast Ale. Riverford notched up its highest score in the workers’ section of the assessment where factors scrutinised included employee ownership, a governance system including a co-owner council, and a high level of health, safety and wellness for its 800 staff. They each received the equivalent of a £1,300 annual dividend in June. Guy Singh-Watson, the founder of Riverford, said: “Riverford has always sought to balance the needs of planet, staff, suppliers and customers, with commercial success being a means to an end, not an end in itself. We have done right by our own definitions, and developed our own measures. I, for one, am intrinsically resistant to assessments of virtue. “But these are niceties we can no longer afford; we need an objective, global approach to avoid the ultimate market failure of thoughtless overconsumption leading to self-destruction.” In the immediate outbreak of the pandemic the company had to cope with demand on the scale of its Christmas peak – but without having six months to prepare – driven by its 75,000 existing customers ordering more frequently or adding more items. Before lockdown it was making 50,000 to 55,000 deliveries every week, soaring to 85,000 at the peak – 70% up on the previous year. It has settled down to about 70,000 a week, up 40% on last year.  "
"Medicinal cannabis companies have been cleared by the UK’s financial regulator to float on the London Stock Exchange but firms that sell marijuana to recreational users will still be banned. The Financial Conduct Authority said businesses that grow and sell recreational cannabis, even in countries such as Canada where it is legal, cannot list in London because of the Proceeds of Crime Act. Income from the sale of cannabis and cannabis oil outside the UK could constitute “criminal property” under the act, because it covers conduct abroad that would constitute a crime if it happened in the UK. But the regulator said UK medical cannabis firms could float in London, as could overseas firms, although they would have to satisfy the regulator that they should be allowed to do so because of the more nuanced legal position. The rules for overseas firms are complicated by the UK’s restrictive regulatory environment for medicinal cannabis, legalised in 2018. Cannabis growers require a licence from the Home Office, while any imports of the drug require patients to get a prescription first. The FCA said regulations, which limit the extent to which medicinal cannabis is being used in the UK, meant overseas firms could not automatically be granted the right to list in London, even if they only sold a medical product. While firms might have a licence to sell in other countries, that did not mean they would be able to secure the same permissions from the Home Office, the regulator said. “For medicinal cannabis and cannabis oil companies with overseas activities, the company will need to satisfy us that their activities would be legal if carried out in the UK,” the FCA said.  “We will also need to understand the legal basis of the company’s overseas activities, for example the nature of the local licensing and the licences the company holds.” Despite the complex position for overseas producers, the fast-growing cannabis industry is expected to celebrate the clarity from the markets regulator, which will help firms tap funding from new investors. Roby Zomer, co-founder and managing director of the pharmaceuticals firm MGC, said: “MGC started the process of looking to list on the London markets over a year ago. During that time we have struggled with the pace of the process but have continued to push forward, with a view to being one of the first UK-listed medical cannabis companies. “Given the news today, we will again push ahead with our listing ambitions for the business, which will support its future growth and offer investors the opportunity to access a significant and growing opportunity.” Nick Davis, chief executive of the law firm Memery Crystal, which counts MGC and other cannabis companies among its clients, said: “This is great and overdue news for the medicinal cannabis sector in the UK, both for medicinal cannabis companies themselves, but also for patients, who have yet to receive easy access to the products they need. “Our firm, and a number of our clients, have worked hard over the past few years to have medical cannabis companies admitted to the London markets. With greater clarity from the FCA we hope investors will also support companies coming to market to drive the sector forward.”"
"New “circuit-breaker” restrictions designed to prevent a second wave of Covid-19 in England would have “astronomical” consequences for struggling businesses unless they receive further financial support, the government has been warned. Boris Johnson is weighing up short-term plans to close pubs and restaurants, while parts of the north of England and the Midlands are already facing 10pm curfews on nightlife and tighter restrictions on socialising from Tuesday. As shares in airlines, hotel groups and pub chains fell, multiple trade bodies called on the government to clarify its plans and ensure firms are not cut adrift financially. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: “Uncertainty and speculation around future national restrictions will sap business and consumer confidence at a delicate moment for the economy. “While protection of public health must be the priority, government should do everything in its power to avoid further national lockdowns that will cripple businesses. She said any requirement for firms to close or reduce capacity through no fault of their own should be accompanied by a “comprehensive support package”. Expectations of new restrictions came after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, refused to rule out a two-week nationwide lockdown as the “last line of defence”, hitting shares in some of the UK’s biggest companies. British Airways owner IAG was the biggest loser on the FTSE 100, down nearly 15%, while easyJet fell by 9% and the aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce lost 5%. Pub companies such as JD Wetherspoons and Mitchells & Butlers, along with hotels groups Intercontinental and Whitbread also lost ground, as traders were spooked by the threat of closures. Shares in NatWest, formerly known as RBS, slipped below £1 for the first time since the pandemic took hold, while Lloyds Banking Group was down by 3%. Both are seen as proxies for the health of the UK economy. The hospitality sector has been particularly hard hit by coronavirus prevention measures. A quarter of licensed premises still yet to reopen after the first lockdown and firms have issued dire predictions about the effect of any new curbs. UK Hospitality boss, Kate Nicholls, said the sector was “on a knife edge”. Unverified rumours about lockdowns and curfews was hitting consumer confidence, she added. “If lockdowns or restrictions are needed, they need to be formulated carefully, and come with government support, to minimise the damage to business,” she said. “Even relatively minor tweaks like a business having to close at 10pm rather than 11pm has a huge impact.” Her counterpart at the British Beer and Pubs Association, Emma Emma McClarkin, said: “As an industry we recognise the need to continue to support the government and local communities to manage the risk of rising infection rates. Pubs have been adapting to the ‘new normal’ over the past few months and will continue to do so, but pubs were struggling to break even before today and these latest restrictions may push some to breaking point.”  “The government needs to act fast in putting together a comprehensive support package to ensure that thousands of pubs don’t close their doors for good. We need a sector-specific furlough scheme to save the hundreds of thousands of jobs that pubs support, extended VAT cuts and business rates holiday and a substantial cut to the rate of beer duty.” She added: “Shutting down completely even for a short period, would be a monumental task, severely impact livelihoods and would come at an astronomical cost to the trade.” The BBPA is calling for an extension of the furlough scheme for hospitality firms, as well as an extension of the VAT cut, a business rates holiday and lower beer duty. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), urged ministers to be cautious about targeting hospitality firms, including struggling pubs, clubs and bars, with Covid-19 curbs. “Curfews are devastating for our sector,” he said. “We are concerned about the narrative around hospitality being at partial blame for what’s going on. There have been schools and universities going back, illegal parties, households, that have all contributed in different ways. “If we end at 10pm in the evening, we’ll end up with people looking for those additional hours, whether it’s an illegal event or continuing the party at a household.” Analysts at the stockbroker IG said the possibility of London being included in lockdown restrictions had sharpened fears among investors. “While localised restrictions have become somewhat normalised of late, the economic importance of London means we are likely to see a more significant market reaction if the growth in cases leads to significant economic consequences,” said the senior market analyst Joshua Mahony. “With the growing likeliness of quarantine restrictions being imposed on UK visitors, it comes as no surprise to see the likes of IAG, easyJet, Carnival, Rolls-Royce, and InterContinental Hotels Group heading up the FTSE 350 losers,” he added."
"Company directors will have their identities verified before their names are listed on the UK’s official register of company information, as the government attempts to make life harder for financial criminals. The reforms to procedures at Companies House will look to provide businesses with greater assurance about who they are dealing with, while also improving the ability of law enforcement agencies to trace their activity for suspected fraud or money laundering, the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. Lord Callanan, the minister for corporate responsibility, said: “Mandatory identity verification will mean criminals have no place to hide – allowing us to clamp down on fraud and money laundering and ensure people cannot manipulate the UK market for their own financial gain, whilst ensuring for the majority that the processes for setting up and running a company remain quick and easy.” However, the move is seen as a small and long overdue step in many parts of the financial world, where there have long been complaints that false data has been given credibility by it being posted on Companies House. Jonathan Tickner, head of commercial litigation and civil fraud at the law firm Peters & Peters, said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a harsh light on the inaccurate data flows into Companies House – which has simply made it easier for organised crime and fraudsters generally to perpetrate the vast scale of misappropriation sadly seen on the Treasury’s bounce back loan schemes. “Root and branch reform is essential … The key question will be how quickly government actually takes action, and it is troubling that the announcement makes no mention of when these changes are set to take place, leaving us to question whether the government is ready to take action or this is simply an attempt to show willing.” BEIS said that the changes “will require primary legislation which will happen in due course”. It did not explain if or how the changes will be enforced retrospectively to tackle what false entries which already exist on the register. Despite the lack of checks being performed on Companies House data, the information is widely used. The government said that the register’s data has been accessed 9.4bn times in the last year, with research suggesting it is worth up to £3bn per year to users."
"MPs are to debate the controversial $40bn (£31bn) sale of the UK’s biggest tech company, Arm Holdings, after assurances from its US buyer failed to quell lingering concern that the deal will harm British interests. Jensen Huang, the founder and chief executive of California-based tech firm Nvidia, moved to allay fears about the transaction on Friday, publicly declaring himself willing to offer legally binding guarantees on jobs and investment. Huang is also understood to have made personal representations to UK government officials at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The department is headed by the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, who has the power to “call in” the takeover for a review of whether it would harm the national interest. Dowden has yet to act, despite concerns expressed by trade unions, Labour and Arm’s co-founder Hermann Hauser. With pressure mounting on the government to intervene, Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, whose Cambridge constituency includes Arm’s headquarters, said he had secured a debate scheduled for this Monday, at which MPs will discuss the deal. “The government have been painfully quiet about the acquisition of a strategic national asset by a foreign company so I am pleased to have secured this debate so a minister must to come to the dispatch box to explain themselves,” said Zeichner. “This is a serious matter and decisions taken will have a big impact on the role of the UK in the production of global technology. “I want to know what action the government is taking to safeguard Arm’s neutrality from an American company that is eyeing up the tech. “If Arm becomes a US subsidiary of a US company, then Donald Trump will gain extraordinary powers over which foreign businesses can use Arm-designed chips.” “I find it bizarre that the government would want to give away such powers at any time, but particularly ahead of a trade negotiation. We also need guarantees on keeping high-skilled jobs in Cambridge.” Zeichner and Hauser have raised fears that US ownership would expose Arm to US legislation that allows the White House to intervene in transactions with overseas companies. Nvidia is understood to have told the UK government that these fears are unjustified because nothing about the transaction would expose the company to the whims of Trump or a successor. In an interview with the Times, Huang promised to sign a pledge to keep UK jobs and invest in Arm. “There’s no possibility that Arm’s headcount will fall,” he said. “It will increase, but we just don’t know exactly by how much and how quickly. We’ll work on the plans over the coming months and will make them legally binding.”"
"Pearson has suffered a significant shareholder revolt against controversial changes to its remuneration policy, which will grant its new chief executive a multimillion-dollar pay package. Almost a third of investors in the FTSE 100 educational publishing group voted against the plans, which will award a $9.3m (£7.2m) one-off payment to the incoming boss, Andy Bird. The British executive, who is the former chairman of Walt Disney’s international operations, is based in Los Angeles and will remain there when he takes up the top job at Pearson on 19 October. Pearson thanked the majority of its shareholders for supporting the proposal, but noted that a “significant minority” of investors had rejected its plans. Under the new directors’ remuneration policy, Andy Bird will receive a salary of at least $1.25m fixed until 2023, with the opportunity to double it if he meets certain performance targets.  Bird will also be allowed to make a one-off purchase of $3.75m of Pearson shares, equal to 300% of his salary, by 31 December 2020. He is in line to receive more shares worth $9.3m, which will be paid out in three instalments over three years. Pearson said what it called its “co-investment plan” had an “unusual nature … in the UK market”. The company will contribute to Bird’s costs of renting an apartment in New York, which it noted is “to be used for business purposes”. At the time of his appointment in August, Pearson’s chairman, Sidney Taurel, said the company was “delighted” to have secured someone of Bird’s calibre. He had received multimillion-dollar annual remuneration packages while at Disney, and Pearson had to increase its offer to secure Bird, whom he described as an “outstanding candidate to lead Pearson in its next chapter”. “We believe strongly that Andy is the right person to lead Pearson into an era of growth, building on the foundations already laid, to benefit all stakeholders,” said Taurel. However, some of Pearson’s leading investors had expressed concerns ahead of the vote about the size of the pay award. Bird, who has no experience in the education sector, has been a non-executive director on Pearson’s board since May. He replaces John Fallon, who is retiring and has run the company since 2013. Bird faces the challenge of reinventing Pearson for the digital age, as the group has struggled to switch its dependency on selling printed books to students into a Netflix-style digital rental model."
"A City trader who is locked in a legal battle after resigning from a job has filed court papers in Dubai alleging he was subjected to 83 instances of “bullying, harassment and racial discrimination” over three years. Opeyemi Olayanju, 26, quit the City broker TP ICAP in December last year, alleging constructive dismissal because of “harassment, bullying and discrimination” at the firm in London. He claims he has since been offered employment at a rival brokerage firm in Dubai but has been prevented from taking the role after an injunction was granted to TP ICAP in the United Arab Emirates courts in March. TP ICAP denies racism and said: “It is unfortunately not unusual for brokers to seek to avoid their [contractual] obligations by making unfounded allegations of constructive dismissal.” In court proceedings in Dubai to determine whether or not Olayanju can take up the new role, the trader’s evidence includes an appendix detailing 83 examples of alleged harassment, including instances he claims were racist, according to exchanges made during an open court hearing in August. The filing reveals for the first time details of the frequency of the alleged harassment. Olayanju’s court papers add that the alleged abuse caused Olayanju’s health “to suffer as a consequence”. The appendix detailing the instances is not currently public, but the trader has previously spoken about how he and another ​b​lack colleague were referred to as “the Africans,” and how Olayanju was nicknamed “n-Ope” or “n-Opy” in what he interpreted as a racist slur. Olayanju’s papers also contain the conclusion of a formal grievance he filed last November, in which TP ICAP said: “It is apparent from the investigation that the working environment on the desk was volatile and that foul language was often used … it is likely you were subjected on occasion to derogatory comments, primarily by [two managers] … such treatment is wholly inappropriate and is not in keeping with the company’s values and code of conduct.” However, the investigation concluded: “On occasion you may have been subjected to derogatory comments on the desk although I do not find any evidence this was related to your race.” Prior to Olayanju outlining the 83 instances of alleged harassment, TP ICAP filed court papers saying his claims of bullying and racism were “grossly unparticularised” and made “without any proper particulars”. The papers added: “TP ICAP cannot respond to so vague and general a case, save by general denial.” The firm declined to respond to the Guardian’s questions about Olayanju’s specific allegations, saying it would be inappropriate. It said: “TP ICAP denies all allegations of racial discrimination and constructive dismissal in the strongest terms. TP ICAP is committed to promoting equality and diversity as part of our continuous efforts to build a positive, inclusive and meritocratic culture. Our code of conduct clearly sets out the principles and standards of behaviour we expect from all our employees. “With regard to the alleged working environment on the emerging markets desk at TP ICAP, any issues that arose last year have been fully addressed and steps have been taken to ensure a positive working environment.” A hearing on whether Olayanju can take up his new role is set for December in Dubai."
"Lawyers for Adani have sought to identify people who obtained leaked information about its Carmichael coal project, raising concerns that journalists could be dragged into “conspiracy” legal proceedings launched by the miner against an environmental activist. The activist, Ben Pennings, from the group Galilee Blockade, is being sued by Adani for conspiracy, intimidation and breach of confidence. Adani alleges Pennings “orchestrated a sustained campaign” against the Carmichael coal project, in which he solicited confidential information about the construction process and used it to harass contractors. Pennings told Guardian Australia that Adani had offered to cease the legal action against him if he provided an affidavit “identifying how the information they say is confidential information has been allegedly used”. “I deny what Adani alleges in their civil action against me, but it’s no secret that as Galilee Blockade’s spokesperson I spoke to journalists regularly,” Pennings said. “As a citizen passionate about press freedom, I’m concerned Adani will continue their attacks on journalists by unnecessarily dragging them into my supreme court proceedings.” Adani has previously sought to access ABC journalists’ records via freedom of information requests. The company has recently taken to social media to criticise journalists from the ABC and Nine newspapers in relation to stories about its business dealings. The Carmichael project in north Queensland has become Australia’s most significant flashpoint in the broader debate about coal and climate change. In recent years, multiple news reports have detailed information about the project that was obtained via leaks, or that Adani had otherwise not sought to reveal. Adani did not address questions sent by Guardian Australia last week, seeking to clarify whether the company intended to take court action, or seek similar damages, from journalists who had obtained and published the company’s confidential information. The journalists’ union has also raised worries that Adani’s moves to identify those who obtained its information could ultimately target journalists. “It is concerning when litigation is designed to impede journalists carrying out their duties in reporting on matters that are in the public interest,” the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance acting media director, Adam Portelli, said. “There can be no doubt that the activities of Adani are of great interest to Australians. Any attempt to intimidate, threaten or harass journalists or to prevent them from reporting such matters is clearly an attack on press freedom. “There is a long history of corporations engaging in strategic litigation against public participation to avoid scrutiny of their operations, muzzle freedom of expression and deny the public’s right to know. These actions tend to be self-defeating simply because they provoke even greater curiosity about what the company may be trying to hide.” Guardian Australia asked Adani whether it was seeking the names of journalists who had obtained confidential information; whether the company considered journalist were part of the alleged “conspiracy” involving Pennings; and whether it intended to take legal action against journalists. Adani Australia said in a statement: “Out of respect to the courts and in accordance with prudent legal advice, Adani is not able to comment without prejudicing negotiations with Mr Pennings via the media. “We expect Mr Pennings to honour his commitment to comply with the supreme court order made on 11 September 2020. Further, we look forward to receiving his response to Adani’s claim in due course.” Pennings said he would fight the case against Adani. “Adani has a lot to gain if concerned citizens are too scared to tell the truth or engage in peaceful protest,” he said. “The more my family and I suffer, the stronger the threat to the wider community. “Civil society must fight Adani’s attacks on journalists and activists in the court of public opinion.”"
"Marks & Spencer will this week bring back its popular UK “shwopping” scheme which is aimed at keeping clothing out of landfill, six months after it was mothballed because of coronavirus. Customers can from Thursday donate their unwanted clothes, shoes, bras and accessories of any brand or condition in 287 stores with clothing sections. The scheme, launched in 2012, is part of the retailer’s Plan A programme and an expansion of a partnership with Oxfam, which began in January 2008 and has led to more than 35m items being donated, worth a total of £23m. It started on a modest scale when the retailer encouraged shoppers to donate their unwanted M&S clothing to Oxfam to receive a £5 voucher. It later morphed into “shwopping” , with the aim of encouraging shoppers to donate clothing routinely when they buy something in store. All clothing items that customers donate in stores – via large cardboard bins – are sent to Oxfam to be resold in one of its shops or online, to be reused via its social enterprise in Senegal or to be recycled into new materials, which include being used to make the filling in M&S mattresses. “At M&S, our goal is to source all our products with care and ensure nothing we make goes to waste”, said Carmel McQuaid, head of M&S sustainable business. She said shwopping was “a programme that many of our customers rely on as they shop with us for new staples – and now more than ever it’s perfect for those who have been decluttering”. In line with government guidelines, M&S will quarantine all items for 48 hours before sending them on to Oxfam. The retailer is also starting to include details of the sustainable raw materials it uses for its clothing products online, with information available for more than 4,000 items so far. Despite high charity-shop donation rates before the pandemic, 300,000 tonnes of clothing ends up in household bins every year – 20% of which goes to landfill and 80% is incinerated – according to a recent report from the environmental audit committee. The rise in the popularity of “fast fashion” led to clothing worth an estimated £140m being sent to landfill every year in the UK. Charity shops were forced to close at the start of lockdown and while most have been reopening since the end of June, many have been restricting donations, and have had their work curtailed by a shortage of volunteers. The government was this month urged by the all-party parliamentary group for ethics and sustainability in fashion to take urgent steps to fix fast fashion by boosting clothing recycling facilities and supporting the development of fabrics with a lower environmental impact. Other recycling schemes include TK Maxx Give Up Clothes for Good campaign, which has been running for 16 years. "
"The owner of Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK will go ahead with plans to shut 29 sites, putting 450 jobs at risk, after creditors voted through an agreement to try to save the pandemic-hit business. Pizza Hut Restaurants, the brand’s biggest franchise arm in the UK, has agreed a reduction in rent and bills with its landlords and other creditors through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The CVA will not affect Pizza Hut’s delivery operations, which are operated separately. The UK restaurants are run under a franchise arrangement with Yum! Brands, the S&P 500 company that is also the owner of the KFC and the Mexican-themed Taco Bell chains. The closures will be spread across much of the UK, with branches in London, Glasgow and Cardiff among those affected. However, the deal will save the jobs of more than 5,000 workers, a spokeswoman said. Pizza Hut Restaurants ran 244 branches across the UK before the coronavirus pandemic hit, employing 5,700 people. However, it was forced to shut all its restaurants during the UK’s lockdown and the sector has been forced to contend with further restrictions across the UK’s nations. Many of Pizza Hut’s competitors in the casual dining sector have also pursued similar closures, including Pizza Express, Azzurri Group, the owner of Ask Italian and Zizzi, Carluccio’s and the Casual Dining Group, which owns Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas. Pizza Hut Restaurants first hired advisers during the summer as it looked at options to restructure its debts despite saying that it had entered the lockdown in a “place of strength”. A Pizza Hut Restaurants spokeswoman said: “We are delighted to have reached such a constructive position in partnership with our landlords and creditors. “We appreciate the support of everyone involved and this outcome provides us with a strong platform to secure the long-term future of the business including over 5,000 jobs and over 200 restaurants. “Our focus is now business as usual supporting all of our team members and continuing to provide a Covid-safe restaurant experience for our guests.”"
"More than a third of UK employers plan to make staff redundant over the next three months, according to research warning of a cascade of job losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. With a month to go until the end of the government furlough scheme on 31 October, 37% of more than 2,000 managers polled by YouGov said they were likely to make staff redundant by the end of the year. About 60% of the managers surveyed from larger businesses with more than 250 employees said their companies planned to make redundancies this year. The Labour party and the TUC said the findings showed that the government needed to do more to protect UK workers’ jobs. Economists and politicians from across the political spectrum are increasingly concerned over the prospects for British workers as the government prepares to replace its coronavirus job retention scheme with a less generous “job support scheme” and the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic hits during the winter. The poll commissioned by Acas, the public body that resolves employment disputes, follows a slew of job cut announcements from some of the UK’s best-known companies. The oil company Royal Dutch Shell and TSB bank on Thursday announced almost 10,000 job losses between them. They joined a host of other large companies that have announced thousands of UK cuts, including airlines such as British Airways and EasyJet, retailers including Marks & Spencer and John Lewis, manufacturers such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, and contractors to Jaguar Land Rover. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week announced that the government would pay up to 22% of the wages of workers on reduced hours under a new job support scheme, with the employer supplying 55% of the staff member’s pay if they work a third of their normal hours. However, the scheme has faced criticism. The Resolution Foundation thinktank noted “avoidable design flaws” that mean that under the scheme it is more expensive to retain two workers on a part-time basis, rather than retaining one of the workers full time and making the other redundant. Sunak said it was not sustainable to continue to support jobs as much as in the early months of the furlough scheme, when the government paid as much as 80% of the salaries of workers who had been temporarily laid off. The UK unemployment rate stands at 4.1% but the Bank of England has forecast that it could reach 7.5% by the year end, while last week several economists warned that Sunak’s new scheme would do little to prevent more than 1 million workers losing their jobs. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said Sunak was “forcing small businesses to choose which staff to keep and which to fire”. She has also criticised his focus on supporting “only viable jobs” at a time when many companies are restricted in the number of workers they can bring back. “These are viable businesses that just need support to cope with the restrictions the government has imposed on them,” Dodds said. “They pinned their hopes on the chancellor to deliver, but he’s pulling up the drawbridge at the worst possible time. “This wasn’t by accident – it was by design. This sink or swim mentality is a throwback to the worst days of Thatcher, and just like in the 1980s, people on the lowest incomes will pay the highest price.” Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, the umbrella body for UK trade unions, stood beside Sunak at Downing Street last week as he announced the new scheme. However, in response to the survey findings, she said that the scheme “cannot be a standalone intervention” and called for industry-specific support, alongside investment in new jobs in green infrastructure. “Ministers must urgently work with unions and business on a wider support package for the hardest hit parts of the economy,” she said. “Industries like aviation, retail, the arts and hospitality need targeted help now.” A Treasury spokesman highlighted the support still available to companies, including emergency loans, VAT payment deferments, business rates holidays and rebates for sick pay. The spokesman said: “Our support for business has reached, and continues to reach, millions of firms. The job support scheme is designed to protect jobs in businesses facing lower demand over the winter due to Covid, and is just one form of support on offer to employers during this difficult period. “We’re also continuing to innovate in supporting incomes and employment through our plan for jobs announced in July, helping employees get back to work through a £1,000 retention bonus and creating new roles for young people with our kickstart scheme.”"
"TSB is cutting almost 1,000 high street banking jobs and closing 164 branches around the UK, as it blamed the declining number of customers visiting their local bank. The announcement comes as the growing use of digital banking services hits footfall to traditional branches, with the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating the trend by hitting high street visits. TSB is making 969 people redundant and the branch closures, on top of another 21 already announced, will leave the bank with 290 branches at the end of 2021, down from 475. The number of UK bank branches has dropped from at least 9,803 in January 2015 to below 6,500 in July, before the latest announcements, according to the consumer group Which? The Co-operative Bank announced similar plans to close 18 branches in August, while Lloyds Banking Group, the former owner of TSB, announced 865 job losses this month related to restructuring – although the latter announcement did not include branch closures. TSB, owned by Spain’s Banco Sabadell since 2015, had already announced it was axing the role of dedicated branch cashier, given the steep decline in in-branch transactions. The bank told 929 staff they had to retrain, change roles or take voluntary redundancy under the cashier announcement. While investors put pressure on banks to cut back branch networks, the wave of closures has raised concerns among MPs and campaigners that people unable to use digital banking could be left without access to basic banking services. The 2018 access-to-cash review found that a sixth of people in Britain would struggle to cope without the ability to withdraw cash. In August the Co-operative Bank announced plans to close 18 branches. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has drawn up guidance that could force banks to consider opening shared locations in underserved communities or mobile branches. Major high street banks are expected to take part in a six-month trial of three shared banking hubs run by the Post Office that will begin in October. Banks will be able to send bank managers to shared locations on different days of the week, potentially allowing cost sharing. The Unite trade union, which represents TSB workers, said the bank’s customers would be hit by the closures and highlighted that seven years ago TSB had more than 600 branches. Dominic Hook, a Unite national officer, said: “The financial services industry has a social responsibility not to walk away from its local customers who continue to need access to banking in bank branches.” TSB said 94% of its customers would still be located within 20 minutes of a branch and that the remaining network would be the seventh largest in the UK. Debbie Crosbie, TSB’s chief executive, said: “Closing any of our branches is never an easy decision but our customers are banking differently – with a marked shift to digital banking. We remain committed to our branch network and will retain one of the largest in the UK.” The cuts will leave TSB with just under 6,000 full-time equivalent workers, including 120 new jobs in operational roles also announced on Wednesday."
"The cabin of a harvester in the middle of a vast wheat field might be a strange place to find an airline pilot at work, but for Andrew King it all makes sense. King worked as a passenger jet pilot for Hainan Airlines but has been on leave without pay since the pandemic hit in February. Now several factors have combined to create a surprising opportunity in – literally – a new field. Coronavirus restrictions have reduced the number of backpackers available to help bring in what is promising to be a bumper harvest, and pilots have turned out to have the right set of skills to fill the gap. Matt Stewart of Whittaker Stewart Harvest and Haulage has hired King to work up and down the east coast through the summer. He says pilots were far from his thoughts until recently. “Wouldn’t have thought about it in a million years, but we saw that they were a really good fit. If they can fly a plane, I’m sure they can drive a header,” Stewart says. King found about farming jobs targeting pilots on a Facebook group called Pilots4Harvest2020, where farmers and aviation staff are encouraged to link up. It was set up by farmer Amanda Thomas, who saw an opportunity in the bleak outlook for the aviation industry. “It’s the fact that we don’t have the backpackers, and that air travel has shut down, and we’ve got this big crop, so it’s these three things that have come together for a bit of a perfect storm,” Thomas says. “So I was having a think about what are the areas and industries that we could tap into, and it just seemed like a logical choice.” King says he is eager for the challenge. “They’ve recognised the transferability of the skillset of an airline pilot, someone who could operate heavy equipment and learn large amounts of information quickly, and remain proficient. “I’m looking forward to it. I’m looking forward to the change in scenery. I’m looking forward to the camaraderie with other people doing it.” The group has more than 800 members as the industry heads into the harvesting season, and Thomas thinks it will keep growing as farmers and pilots bring their friends into the conversation. “It’s quite New South Wales based, but it’s starting to spread to Victoria and Western Australia, who’ll be in dire need of help soon.” The wettest winter since 2016 has dragged much of NSW out of drought and led to a 300% year-on-year increase in the winter harvest, which usually includes wheat, barely and canola. The shortage in skilled labour has affected the entire industry, with a lack of fruit pickers in Western Australia leading the state government to launch a much-mocked advertising campaign aimed at getting young people to help farmers. Other suggestions to bolster the workforce have included raising the level of the jobseeker payment for those who go to help with the harvest, or offering refugees a path to permanent residency. The government is due to announce incentives in the budget for those on jobseeker or youth allowance to work on farms. Thomas says years of drought have drained the industry of its workers, even before Covid border restrictions were imposed. “Because we’ve had the four years of drought, we’ve lost a lot of people to the mining industry, so we’re not getting those high-skilled workers back. I know a lot of our friends all over Victoria and NSW are really screaming out for skilled farm workers.” Stewart says his company will be working across 15 farms this harvest, working around 60,000 hectares. They start in Queensland and follow the season down the coast, across NSW and into Victoria. The workload hasn’t put off King, who says he’s looking forward to some regularity. “I haven’t worked on the same day and the same time in any day for the last 20 years. Irregular shift work is how I would describe what I’ve done before.” He says flying a plane requires skills and temperament that are well suited to the work. “Thinking outside the square, decision making, problem solving, getting on with the job with a smile on your face, being able to learn a new skill, which in this case is operating some farm machinery quite quickly, and hopefully doing so without error is all important here.” Fellow pilot and future colleague Matt Shepherd agrees. “Pilots spend a lot of time operating machinery for 10-12 hours a day, that’s kind of their core job. And whether it’s an airplane or a large piece of machinery or an agricultural machine, it’s all the same. “Our training is around some core systems, hydraulics, pneumatics, pressurisation, electrics and operating computer software. All these things are pretty transferable to a combine harvester, especially the more modern ones.” Shepherd was working for Tigerair Australia before a restructure in March resulted in all its pilots being made redundant. The airline was “discontinued” by its parent company, Virgin Australia, in August. After 34 years in the industry, Shepherd found himself looking for a new opportunity. “I am kind of sick of it, to be honest. It’s the complete uncertainty from one moment to the next. And as soon as this virus popped up – bang – the entire aviation sector is absolutely wiped out, across the planet.” He says many pilots have ventured into new industries.  “We’ve got some guys who’ve started up their own businesses: tow truck driving, caravan rentals, all these wacky things that they probably never thought they’d be doing. “For a lot of people, it will be a permanent change. I won’t be one bit surprised.” Thomas says she has been particularly impressed with the pilots’ networking skills. “I really like the fact that once one farmer hires a pilot, they bring their friends. And so there’s these little satellite communities growing.” Shepherd in turn is effusive in his praise for Thomas and the Facebook group. “The lady who set that up is an absolute genius. I wish the government had as much faith in Australian people as she does, because that is such a simple solution to their problem. “I hope people are taking up the offers and getting out there and having a go.”"
"The US casino operator Caesars Entertainment has agreed a £2.9bn takeover of the British bookmaker William Hill. The companies announced on Wednesday that Caesars would pay £2.72 per William Hill share in cash, a premium of more than a quarter compared with the price before the US company’s interest was first reported last week. The deal, which must be agreed by 75% of William Hill shareholders, was unanimously recommended by the UK company’s directors. It came after two rival bids by the US private equity group Apollo were turned down. The takeover will give Caesars, the operator of the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas, access to the burgeoning US sports betting market. Caesars also owns various casinos in the UK. Sports betting was illegal across the vast majority of US states until a 2018 supreme court decision overturned a federal ban, firing the starting gun on a race between bookmakers to target one of the world’s biggest potential markets. The size of the online opportunity has given US betting companies a lifeline during the coronavirus pandemic, with the value of shares in Caesars surging from lows of almost $6 in the March panic to $54 on Tuesday evening. Caesars previously said the takeover could allow it to make between $600m and $700m in revenues next year in online and sports betting. Roger Devlin, William Hill’s chairman, said the offer was at “an attractive price for shareholders” but added that it reflected the “risk and significant investment required to maximise the US opportunity, given intense competition in the US and the potential for regulatory disruption in the UK and Europe”. He said it would be “very much business as usual” for William Hill workers for now. Caesars plans to sell William Hill’s UK and European branch networks, which have struggled before and during the pandemic under increased regulatory pressure to tackle problem gambling. William Hill announced the closure of 119 UK branches in August. Tom Reeg, the chief executive of Caesars, said: “William Hill’s sports betting expertise will complement Caesars’ current offering, enabling the combined group to better serve our customers in the fast-growing US sports betting and online market.”"
"Two decades of welfare crackdowns by successive governments have resulted in a sharp rise in older women and people with disabilities languishing on unemployment benefits for longer. A Parliamentary Budget Office paper issued on Wednesday reveals that, as of 2019, 62% of men receiving jobseeker payment are staying on the benefit longer than 12 months – up from 51% in 2007. But the change is even more drastic among women, rising from 47.6% to 71.2%. The analysis – which tracks the impact of big shifts in welfare policy dating back as far as the Howard years – confirms warnings from advocates and analysis by Guardian Australia that the unemployed are spending longer on benefits than ever before. In 2007, 9.5% of women and 13.7% of men receiving jobseeker had been on unemployment benefits longer than five years. By 2019, it was 20.2% of men on the jobseeker payment and 24.4% of women. Yet the most notable shift has been among older women. Women over 50 made up 4.9% of all jobseeker recipients in 2001. Last year, they were one-in-five of all dole recipients. Since 1991, the proportion of women over 45 on jobseeker benefits has increased sevenfold, the PBO paper shows. The researchers said during the 1990s and early 2000s jobseeker recipients had typically been young men in their 20s and 30s, while older men and women were likely to be receiving other benefits such as parenting payment, the age pension, or disability support pension. “However, by 2019, this picture of recipients by gender and age group had changed considerably,” they said. Although the bulk of the paper examines the pre-Covid era, researchers warn the trends identified are unlikely to be altered by “short-term fluctuations in unemployment”. They argue unemployment benefits now appeared to “function as a kind of pre-age-pension payment for some older Australians”. The result is that over three decades, those on unemployment benefits have been likely to spend longer on a payment that has hardly changed in value. Jobseeker benefits are subject to tougher indexing arrangements than pensions, though it was temporarily boosted for the pandemic. In 1991, the fortnightly rate of the jobseeker payment was $276.50. The payment was $565 a fortnight before the pandemic, or $815 with the current coronavirus supplement. But the PBO put the inflation-adjusted value of the pre-Covid benefit at only $288. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the report was “deeply concerning” given the country was experiencing “one of the worst recessions of our history”. “We must ensure that those people who could not get paid work even before this crisis hit, including older women, are not left behind in entrenched unemployment,” she said. The other large shift noted by the PBO is that those on jobseeker payment are far more likely to have barriers to full-time work such as caring responsibilities or a disability. Conny Lenneberg, the executive director at the Brotherhood of St Laurence, told Guardian Australia women who lost their jobs at a mature age often faced discrimination from employers. “There is this sort of presumption that because you’re older, you won’t be able to manage in the modern workforce,” she said. Another issue was that women working in customer-facing industries such as retail or tourism were usually passed over for younger candidates. “There’s a bar on appearance that really does impact on older women,” Lenneberg said. The Howard government introduced the notion of ‘partial capacity to work’ in 2007 to reduce spending on disability payments. Those who are assessed as being unable to work more than 30 hours a week face more relaxed job search requirements. The consequence is that last year 42% of people on jobseeker benefits had disabilities that prevented them from working full-time, compared to only 7% in 2007. “As the overall prevalence of disability in the community actually decreased somewhat over a similar period, it is likely that the increase in job seekers with an ongoing partial capacity to work was driven by the tightening eligibility requirements for the DSP,” the PBO said. In 2011, the Gillard government significantly tightened access to the disability pension, while further changes were made under Tony Abbott. Other key factors identified by the PBO include the end of partner payments paid to women during the 2000s and, more recently, the decision to force single parents onto jobseeker payment once their child turns eight. The controversial move started under John Howard and was broadened under the former Labor government. The paper also tracks a period of massive change within the labour force, including the increasing number of part-time and casual jobs, and the privatisation and then continual overhaul of the much-maligned employment services system. During the pandemic, the number of people on jobseeker payment rose to 1.46 million in May, up from 793,000 in March, with the increase driven disproportionately by young people unable to access the jobkeeper wage subsidy. The PBO warns of likely “upward pressure” on jobseeker expenditure in the medium term driven by the fact many on benefits before the crisis were unlikely to move off the payment. However, the “increased expenditure is at least partially offset by savings from other income support payments due to eligibility changes” to payments such as the age and disability pension."
"The bakery chain Greggs said on Tuesday that job cuts in its stores are inevitable, as a string of household names laid bare the damage done to their finances by coronavirus. Greggs said workers in half its 2,039 shops would be affected as it tries to slash its wage bill before the government’s furlough scheme is withdrawn next month. Roger Whiteside, the Greggs chief executive, said the baker was negotiating reduced working hours with staff but, with sales “well down” in struggling city centres, it would be impossible to avoid redundancies. The high street has been one of the worst-hit sectors of the economy, with nearly 125,000 jobs lost in 2020 as retailers shut stores and in some cases went into administration. Greggs’ upmarket rival Pret a Manger has already axed 2,900 jobs while SSP Group, which owns Upper Crust, is cutting up to 5,000. Whiteside said Greggs was more resilient, as the vast majority of its customers were not office workers. More than half of its stores are in towns and suburban locations while only about one in seven are in hard-hit city centres and travel hubs. Nonetheless, with trade down 25% on a year ago, it is still having to cut costs. “About half of our shops have got higher contracted hours than we’re going to need by the time furlough ends,” explained Whiteside. “We need to negotiate lower hours. If we can be successful in that, it will minimise the extent to which we have to remove roles.” Greggs employs 25,000 people, the majority of whom work in its shops. Rishi Sunak’s new job support measures would be of only limited use to the company, said Whiteside. He added that Greggs was “very grateful” for the furlough scheme, but it now had to adapt to straitened times. “It’s not viable to keep going [with furlough] if you don’t envisage demand coming back to pre-Covid levels anytime soon,” he said. “You’ve got to resize your business to match the level of demand you anticipate will prevail until this crisis comes to an end.” The Greggs update came as no-frills greeting cards chain Card Factory announced a loss of £22m after sales halved to £100m in the six months to 31 July. The picture is much better now, with sales running down just 7%, but Paul Moody, its executive chairman, said it could not predict the level of profitability in the second half. Any high street recovery remained “sensitive to spikes in Covid-19 cases and potential local or national restrictions”, which affected customer footfall and shopping habits, Moody said. The widespread disruption also took its toll of upmarket chocolatier Hotel Chocolat, which fell to an annual loss of £6.5m on the back of a £10m writedown, the majority of which related to 30 store leases that are no longer worth what they once were.  The turmoil in the travel industry also knocked £2.7m off the book value of the luxury hotel and cocoa farm in St Lucia which the chocolatier describes as its “spiritual home”. Angus Thirlwell, the chief executive, said that all but five of its 130 shops were now open, but sales were down on last year. Shoppers were instead visiting its website to get their chocolate fix, with online demand up 150% over the last three months. The shift to home-working had hit impulse purchases of its upmarket chocolate treats, particularly in London, and Hotel Chocolat is trying to agree rent reductions with its landlords. Its store opening programme is on hold but Thirlwell said the company “loved physical retail” and had no current plans to close any locations. Despite the plan to cut jobs, Greggs is restarting its expansion, with plans to open another 20 stores this year, mainly in locations such as petrol forecourts, retail parks and supermarkets rather than the high street.  Before the pandemic, it had planned to open 100 new shops this year. The new stores may provide roles for workers affected by the job cuts programme. "
"Discount retailer B&M has stepped up its expansion plans after its stores, selling everything from tinned and frozen food to wallpaper and bedding plants, became a lockdown sensation. B&M said its UK sales increased by nearly 20% over the last three months despite the absence of a website. The retailer is benefiting from big shifts in spending as out-of-town retail parks win custom during the pandemic. To capitalise on the success it now plans to open up to 45 stores between now and March. It had previously expected to open about 30. B&M, which was promoted to the FTSE 100 this month, said the strong sales picture meant it now expects to bank underlying half-year profits of £285m. That compares with its previous forecast of between £250m and £270m and is the second time it has raised profit guidance this year. Simon Arora, the B&M chief executive, said its business model was “proving well-attuned to the evolving needs of customers”. Discounters such as B&M, along with its privately owned rivals Home Bargains, Wilko and Poundstretcher, have fared much better than many high street chains after they were allowed to remain open during the UK’s 12-week lockdown. The no-frills chain has come a long away from its roots in Blackpool where it was founded by Malcolm Billington in 1976. The initials originally stood for Billington & Mayman, and later Bargain Madness. When it was acquired by the entrepreneurial Arora brothers in 2005 it only had about 20 stores and was making a loss. Today B&M has more than 600 stores in the UK and turns over more than £3bn. The businessmen transformed B&M, which followed a formula similar to the now defunct Woolworths chain, by introducing homewares, toys, toiletries and even pet supplies and clothing. They sold a stake to private-equity investors before listing on the stock exchange in 2014. The budget retailer is still officially headquartered in Luxembourg. B&M shares, which were changing hands for as little as 256p back in March, have doubled in value over the last six months. On Tuesday shares closed up 4% at a new high of 510p, giving the discount chain a market value of more than £5bn – more than twice that of Marks & Spencer. Amy Higginbotham, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said that the UK lockdown had provided conditions for B&M to thrive. Its low prices appealed to shoppers during the current economic uncertainty while its large out-of-town stores “allow shoppers and staff to adhere to social-distancing guidelines,” she said."
"HSBC has received a much-needed vote of confidence from its largest investor after China’s Ping An Asset Management increased its stake in the embattled bank. The move comes after the lender was caught in the middle of rising diplomatic tensions between Washington and Beijing and as it attracts fresh criticism for its money-laundering compliance procedures. Shares in HSBC, which is based in London but makes a large proportion of its profits in Hong Kong and China, jumped by almost 9% to 308.5p on Monday after the news that Ping An had increased its stake to 8% from 7.95%. The rising share price was a much-needed fillip for investors who had watched as the bank’s shares slumped to a 25-year low last week, after allegations of money-laundering following the FinCen files leak. HSBC has said the information in the documents was “historical”. Despite Monday’s rise, HSBC’s share price has still almost halved this year as the bank has become embroiled in the spat between the US and China, which some observers fear could severely damage its business. China’s state-run media has reported that HSBC is being considered for inclusion on the Chinese government’s “unreliable entities” list of firms, which have supposedly harmed China’s interests. Meanwhile, in early June, HSBC appeared to back Beijing’s contentious new rules relating to Hong Kong, immediately sparking controversy that the bank was supporting the anti-democratic laws that critics said would undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy under the one country, two systems framework. During the same month, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also accused HSBC of a “corporate kowtow” to Beijing, as he cited reports of Hong Kong-based executives at Next Media being unable to access their bank accounts. While many of HSBC’s problems relate to it attempting to balance doing significant amounts of business in the east and the west, it has also been hit by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic like many of its rivals. Investors are said to be concerned by the prospect of lost revenues as global interest rates are slashed to record lows and after HSBC cancelled its dividend for the first time in 74 years because of the Covid-19 crisis. It is not clear if Ping An’s increased investment is a political move, with the Chinese asset manager classifying the share purchase as “a long-term financial investment”. Some bank watchers speculated that the stake building was more likely to have been driven by the belief that HSBC would start paying investors a dividend again soon. Peter Garnry, the head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said Ping An had “said that it has confidence in the long-term prospects of the bank. The cancelled and subsequent discontinued dividend is viewed by Ping An as short-term and that dividends will resume as the outlook improves.”"
"The recovery in UK’s bricks and mortar retail sector has gone into reverse, according to new data that shows footfall has declined during September amid new pandemic restrictions and concerns about a second wave of coronavirus infections. Footfall on UK high streets and at other retail destinations was 33% lower last week compared to the same period in 2019, according to data from the British Retail Consortium and ShopperTrak. That represented a marked deterioration since the first week of September, when footfall was only down by 24% year-on-year. At the start of the UK-wide lockdown in March, footfall was down by more than 80% even as online sales boomed, but over the summer the number of people visiting shops had increased steadily as lockdown restrictions were eased and the number of Covid-19 cases declined. Separate footfall figures from data company Springboard showed a similar decline in UK-wide footfall last week, as high streets suffered a big drop in custom. The 10pm curfew on pubs in England appeared to have a particularly strong effect, with the number of people on the streets dropping by more than a third between 10pm and midnight on Friday. The decline in footfall could cause further difficulties for landlords as quarterly rent day falls on Tuesday, when many property owners will collect payments covering the previous three months. Commercial tenants across the country have withheld rent payments in recent months as they struggled with cash flows, and the government this month extended an April ban on evictions of business tenants until the end of the year, in order to protect businesses hit by the pandemic. Data from technology company Re-leased, which facilitates rent payment, suggested that commercial property landlords had collected 68% of the rent due for the April to June period, in a snapshot taken 60 days after rent day in June. That was in line with the 67% in the January to March quarter but significantly lower than the 84% rate recorded in December, before the coronavirus was detected outside China. Caleb Dunn, a commercial analyst at Re-leased, said there was unlikely to be a large jump in payments this quarter given continued uncertainty around the retail environment. There was also evidence from previous quarters that landlords were increasingly giving rental discounts to tenants, another possible sign that tenants were struggling, he said. Ian Wilkinson, a partner at law firm Osborne Clarke who regularly advises landlord clients, said landlords were braced for hospitality tenants in particular to struggle in the coming months after the introduction of the “rule of six” in England, earlier closing times and various local lockdowns. Some landlords are expecting to collect between only 20% and 50% of their rents for the quarter from hospitality businesses, he said, but retail landlords were slightly more hopeful, expecting to collect between 30% and 70% of rents owed. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, a consultancy, said that retail landlords face “significant challenges” ahead because of their dependence on clothing and footwear retailers. Clothing and footwear accounts for about 40% of space in shopping centres, but the subsector has been hit hard by lower demand for new outfits from people stuck at home, Lim said. The uneven retail recovery has meant that retail parks – more spacious for distancing and less reliant on public transport – have proven more resilient, while companies with strong online operations have also benefited, Lim said."
"Since the onset of the pandemic, the government has spent tens of millions of pounds on management consultants to help it manage elements of the Covid-19 response, from the much-criticised NHS test-and-trace programme to buying PPE. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that at least £56m of taxpayers’ money had gone to companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and McKinsey for their help with initiatives that often have not run smoothly. Even more has been spent since then, in what has become a fee-earning bonanza for some of the world’s largest professional services firms. Here are some of the most lucrative contracts picked up by management consultants."
"When companies postpone their annual results, it isn’t usually because they need a bit more time to cram in all the good news. Pub chain Wetherspoon’s should have had its numbers out by now but instead pushed the financial statement back to the coming Friday. Given the storm clouds hanging over the pubs trade – what with curfews, regional “circuit breakers” and social distancing – it’s bound to be a more sombre affair than usual. Typically, Wetherspoon’s confidently swats aside any obstacle that stands in its way. The company is targeted frequently on social media with calls for a boycott, over anything from employment conditions to the pro-Brexit views of its loquacious founder-chairman, Tim Martin. The consequence is always the same – yet another year of barnstorming sales, based on the simple equation that most of its customers aren’t too bothered about what Martin says, as long as he’s prepared to sell them cheap food and beer. The people who boycott Wetherspoon’s are not, by and large, the people who ever went there very often. This time, as the company has already indicated, will be different. The irresistible force of Spoons has collided with an immovable object in the form of a pandemic, heralding the impossible event – a stomach-churning loss. Expect the same at fellow pub chain Marston’s, which also has numbers out this month and is even larger – if less high profile – than Wetherspoon’s, with an estate of 1,400 venues. Indeed, expect the same at any hospitality group. Those that survive this crisis will emerge significantly weaker. We’ve already seen Greene King shut 79 pubs with 800 job losses, while Revolution bars announced a company voluntary agreement (CVA) likely to mean similar pain. Given its recent success, a retrenchment along those lines seems almost inconceivable at Wetherspoon’s, but these days nothing is off the table and the delay in the results raises worrying questions. Perhaps Martin just wanted a bit more time to craft one of his now-famous political diatribes. They have become a staple of results day at Spoons, often taking up more space than the results themselves. Traditionally, at least in recent years, the diatribes have been about Brexit, but it seems likely that this year’s figures will be accompanied by long screeds about the government restrictions affecting hospitality, complete with annexes and links to scientific studies. For once, Martin isn’t out on a limb alone. He’s sharing a windswept bough with most of his struggling industry, whose trade bodies have begged the government to rethink its sternest curbs or, if not, dip into its pocket for a bazooka-sized sector-specific bailout. The 10pm curfew has eroded sales already diminished by social distancing and now conditions are set to get even worse. Holyrood has imposed tight temporary restrictions – banning booze sales and post-6pm restaurant outings. About 60 of Spoons’s 861 UK pubs are in Scotland, and more pain is to come, with similar restrictions imminent across the north of England. According to number-crunchers at the property firm Altus Group, that could force the temporary closure of more than 7,000 pubs across the north, or one in five of all UK drinking establishments. Some will never reopen, although the government attempted to mitigate the economic blow on Friday with a package of measures for lockdown-affected businesses and their employees, including the reintroduction of the furlough scheme in all but name. The impact of the new lockdowns won’t show up in Wetherspoon’s figures, which cover the period to the end of July, but they are bound to feature prominently in its outlook and any comments about trading since the financial year end. The company has been such a reliable engine of growth that if it too is prophesying doom, then prospects will be much, much worse for less robust competitor chains and grimmer still for independent venues. Barring some dramatic deus ex machina – a huge government bailout or a vaccine breakthrough – pubs are facing the worst pandemic outcome of any UK industry. Even Wetherspoon’s won’t be immune."
"The head of parliament’s business committee has asked the business secretary what his department is doing to protect British tech firm Arm, adding to pressure on the government to review the controversial $40bn (£31bn) takeover of the business by the US chipmaker Nvidia. In a letter to the business secretary, Alok Sharma, Darren Jones, the chair of the business select committee, asked what assurances Nvidia had provided on retaining jobs in the UK if the deal went through. The deal has prompted significant concern for the future of Arm’s business model and for the UK’s standing in the global tech sector, including from the Labour party, unions and one of Arm’s founders. Arm, which is based in Cambridge in the UK, designs computer chips used in billions of devices, including the vast majority of the world’s mobile phones, and licenses its work to chip manufacturers, including direct rivals to Nvidia. Arm was taken over by SoftBank in 2016, but the Japanese investment house gave the government assurances that jobs would not move out of the UK. Critics of the Nvidia deal, which was announced last month, have suggested the takeover could diminish Arm’s ability to work with the US company’s rivals, as well as suggesting that Nvidia may seek to move key Arm functions out of the UK. Arm employs 6,500 people worldwide, including 3,000 in the UK. In the letter Jones asked for details of any guarantees Nvidia had given that it would retain Arm’s current business model and that jobs in the UK would be protected. Jones said Sharma should be considering the Arm sale in the context of the UK’s “ambitions to forge a comprehensive industrial strategy, which ensures the UK remains at the leading edge of science, research, and innovation. “A series of concerns have been raised regarding the future of Arm in this country, of thousands of jobs in the UK, and its role in the UK technology industry. I hope that the secretary of state will be able to provide some clarity on these issues and offer some reassurance that every effort is being made to safeguard the success of Arm in the UK.” A spokesman for Nvidia said: “Nvidia guarantees to keep Arm’s headquarters in Cambridge. We are going to sustain and grow [research and development] spending and headcount in the UK. And we guarantee Arm’s IP will stay registered in the UK. “We are discussing our plans with the UK government, and we are very happy to put legally binding agreements behind all our commitments.” The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority has the power to reject or require changes to takeovers on competition grounds but ministers can also call for a review on public interest grounds. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, is thought to be leading the decision on whether to call in the Arm deal for review. However, the prime minister’s office and the Treasury have also been considering the deal, which has increased political significance as the UK prepares to leave the EU’s single market in January. A government spokesperson said:  “Arm is an important part of the UK’s tech sector and makes a significant contribution to the UK economy. “While acquisitions are primarily a commercial matter for the parties concerned, the government monitors these closely. When a takeover may have a significant impact on the UK, we will not hesitate to investigate further and take appropriate action.”  Arm was also approached for comment."
"The Restaurant Group, which owns the Wagamama, Frankie & Benny’s and Garfunkel’s chains, has suffered a sizeable shareholder revolt over a lucrative new pay deal for its chief executive, Andy Hornby,in a year when the company has closed hundreds of restaurants and made thousands of staff redundant. The company said its new remuneration policy had been approved by shareholders, but nearly 37% voted against. Hornby, the boss of HBOS bank in 2008 when it had to be rescued by Lloyds Banking Group during the financial crisis, and TRG’s finance director, Kirk Davis, waived their annual bonuses and took pay cuts of 40% and 20% respectively this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the company’s new pay policy has drawn heavy criticism, as it comes after it shut 200 branches permanently with the loss of nearly 4,500 jobs. Along with the rest of the hospitality sector, TRG has been hit hard by the pandemic, which led to the temporary closure of restaurants and pubs and pushed the company into a £235m pre-tax loss for the first half. Hornby is in line for a share award of £787,500 this year, taking his total maximum pay packet to £1.3m, even after his pandemic-related temporary pay cut. Next year, he will once again qualify for a £945,000 cash bonus plus a share award equal to his £630,000 basic salary, taking his maximum package to £2.2m. Davis will be paid £788,000 this year and is in line for £1.3m next year. Debbie Hewitt, TRG’s chairman, said the firm had engaged “extensively” with a number of its shareholders before proposing the new policy and was pleased that the majority had backed it. “We recognise that some shareholders did not support the proposal,” she said. “We will continue engaging with our shareholders in the coming months.” She said TRG had already made concessions, lowering next year’s share award to 100% of salary. It was previously 200% of salary. The share awards will not pay out for three years. Hewitt added: “In the short term the senior team continue to take pay cuts while the company is still making use of the government’s job retention furlough scheme.” TRG’s pubs and restaurants, especially Wagamama, have managed to attract more customers in recent weeks and sales have improved markedly, partly boosted by the government’s ‘“eat out to help out” scheme in August. However, TRG said the recently imposed 10pm curfew has hurt business."
"John Baring, seventh Lord Ashburton, who has died aged 91, played many roles at the heart of the establishment. He was perhaps best remembered for his long stint as chairman of his family’s bank, Barings, guiding it successfully through cultural change when the big bang opened up the City to international competition, and he was a calming chairman of BP from 1992 until 1995, after sacking his predecessor, the controversial Bob Horton. In later years he presided over the founding of the successful Grange Park Opera. He was the direct descendant of Francis Baring, first Lord Ashburton, who founded Barings Bank and became president of the Board of Trade. His father was Alexander, whom he succeeded to the title in 1991, and his mother was Doris, the daughter of Viscount Harcourt. Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford, Baring joined the bank in 1950, became a managing director at 27 and served as chairman for 15 years from 1974 until 1989, a period of huge change for the City. He played active external roles in insurance and property and in attempts to support British manufacturing industry in the difficult years of the 1980s. He was chairman of the National Economic Development Council’s committee on finance for industry, served on the board of Dunlop as it vainly struggled to escape its tag as the biggest industrial casualty in Britain’s private sector, and was a director of the electronics company Pye, and later of Jaguar. He was a director of the Bank of England from 1983 until 1991. His long stint at Barings was characterised by his successor as chairman, Peter Baring, as “steady progress guided by his firm and discriminating judgment” but this underplayed the transformation he oversaw. When he joined in 1950, the bank had 200 staff and a balance sheet of £30m, compared with 2,400 and £3bn when he retired. He reshaped it, splitting banking from investment management, demolished its old headquarters, introduced profit sharing and opened up successful activities in Asia, which ironically were to prove its downfall. In his valedictory annual report in 1989, he identified an “enormous increase in competition” stemming from the internationalisation of business with the attrition of exchange rates and regulation and the power of computer and communication systems. Sheer competitiveness, he argued, was bringing “lapses of behaviour”: “We must do everything in our power to ensure that our personal behaviour as businessmen is no less upright than we would expect of ourselves as private individuals.” Six years later, on the bitterest day of his life, the activity of a single rogue trader in Asia, Nick Leeson, would bring the bank crashing down. Baring’s time as a director of British Petroleum (now BP) began in 1982 when the government still held more than 30% of the shares and it was seen almost as a branch of the civil service. But rapid change was put in hand, with chemicals, shipping and US interests all rationalised, and sale of the government’s holding. In 1990, a new chairman, Horton, was appointed, and he attempted to drive change even faster. A natural autocrat, who insisted he wanted to drive individual empowerment and presided over innumerable management workshops, Horton was undone by the 1991 depression, which drove down prices, margins and profits. As he stubbornly banked on rising prices, and BP headed for a loss, Ashburton led the criticism and, as the longest-serving director, had the task of sacking Horton as chairman and chief executive. Baring was himself appointed chairman, with David Simon (now Lord Simon of Highbury) as chief executive running the day-to-day business. Although pleased to be asked, Baring maintained it had never been part of his gameplan. The partnership was successful. Three years later, when he stepped down, the targets – debt reduced by $1bn, profits raised to $2bn and capital spending cut to $5bn – had all been achieved. Observers credited him with bringing equilibrium and teamwork to a boardroom “which had gone through a war”, describing him as a healer and a good people person – “no kind of a snob”. It was, said one, “a rare moment of boardroom harmony for BP”. By contrast, his treatment of historic listed buildings was far from emollient – bringing him the nickname “Basher Baring”. In 1955, he bought the early-19th-century mansion Stratton Park in Hampshire, which had been the bank’s wartime headquarters, demolishing it for a modern house and preserving only an empty portico. He also oversaw the demolition of the bank’s Norman Shaw-designed headquarters in the City. In 1964, he purchased the Grange Park estate in Hampshire, another former Baring possession containing a house designed to resemble a pair of Greek temples. Baring wanted “to bring back to my family a very beautiful piece of land”. He planned a new house near the lake and controversially applied to demolish the Grange. The Architects’ Journal commented that he had “plumbed depths of barbarity previously unknown even in the hard world of merchant banking”. After four years, he received permission and took out fireplaces and staircases. But the public mood had changed and the Council of Europe telegraphed Edward Heath, the prime minister, asking him to save “one of Europe’s great neoclassical monuments”. Eventually the rotting house was taken under the care of English Heritage, with Baring contributing an undisclosed amount for upkeep. In 1998 Wasfi Kani, then chief executive of Garsington Opera, approached Baring about founding a new summer opera festival on his land. Grange Park Opera began with a 20-year lease and an appeal brought in £4m to construct an indoor theatre within the ruins. Its performances and magical setting proved a highly successful addition to the summer opera season. But by 2015 the Barings and Kani were unable to agree about future use of the theatre and Kani moved Grange Park Opera to a new theatre constructed at West Horsley Place in Surrey. Operas and other musical events have continued at Grange Park as the Grange festival. Baring is survived by his second wife, Sarah (nee Spencer-Churchill), whom he married in 1987; and by two sons and two daughters from his first marriage, to Susan Mary Renwick, which ended in divorce."
"Nearly three-quarters of City firms are reviewing how much office space they really need following a boom in home working during the pandemic, new research shows. The latest CBI/PwC financial services survey found 74% of companies – particularly banks and insurance firms – have been taking stock of their office requirements in the hope of either using the space differently, or reducing it. Around 88% of the 133 financial services firms polled for the survey said the Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in a greater shift towards remote working. Nearly half of those surveyed said that more than 90% of their workers could feasibly do their job without being in the office. At high street lenders such as Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Metro Bank, branch staff – who are considered essential workers – have continued going into work throughout the crisis, but the vast majority of bank employees have been logging on remotely during the outbreak. Firms like Schroders, the FTSE 100 listed fund manager, have told staff that they will not be required to return to the office full time even after the heath emergency has passed. But some major banks like JP Morgan have raised concerns about the impact of home working, including the lack of mentorship for young staff, and a small drop in productivity on Mondays and Fridays. However, the Wall Street lender is still expecting up to 30% of its nearly 257,000 employees to work remotely in future, at least part of the time. The CBI/PwC report, which polled firms in the first three weeks of September, said that around 71% of firms were now investing in their IT systems to support remote working. However, the survey also showed that City firms are planning to axe more jobs and cut back on non-IT investment amid uncertainty over Covid-19 and Brexit. Companies are now experimenting with new and less costly ways of housing employees. Lloyds, which has had around 50,000 of its 65,000 staff work from home during the outbreak, will test whether empty space in branches could be kitted out for office workers. However, that will only start once Covid restrictions are relaxed. Lloyds also announced this month that it was cutting 865 jobs across the UK as part of a push to simplify parts of its business. Metro Bank will also be installing office desks in free branch space after confirming that the success of homeworking meant that staff are unlikely to return to a permanent desk and would only be in the office two to three days a week. That shift meant Metro was able to shut its Old Bailey back-office site more than a year earlier than expected and scrap plans to rent new space for the 900 staff it would have displaced."
"The Hywind offshore windfarm stands 15 miles off the coast of Peterhead, and firmly on the cusp of Britain’s most dramatic energy revolution since the discovery of North Sea oil. The world’s first floating windfarm was one of the first low-carbon energy projects developed by Norway’s state oil giant Equinor, and today is one of the best performing windfarms ever built. “On a super-clear day you might just be able to make them out from land,” says Equinor’s Stephen Bull, of the turbines floating above the ageing crude oil pipelines which criss-cross the North Sea. The government hopes that within the next 10 years there will be enough offshore turbines to power every home in Britain, including more world-leading floating windfarms. Boris Johnson last week set out plans to use offshore wind power as the backbone of Britain’s carbon-neutral energy future, calling for 10 times the existing offshore wind capacity by 2030, or 40GW, including 1GW of floating turbines. The plan to become the “Saudi Arabia of wind power” is one of the most ambitious British industrial endeavours since oil rigs began populating the North Sea in the 1960s. It will require the equivalent of one turbine to be installed every weekday for the whole of the next decade, and £50bn of private-sector investment. But within the industry there is little doubt that it can be done. Investor appetite has been whetted by years of falling costs, guaranteed returns and growing political support. The sector has already exceeded expectations in recent years to emerge as one of Britain’s great modern industrial success stories – and it is ready to do so again. The catch? It needs government ministers to translate the rhetoric to reality. “We are very keen on doing more floating offshore projects in the UK,” says Bull. “We absolutely welcome the 1GW target from the government, but we could easily get up to 2GW if we have the right government support.” As part of the government’s plan, it has promised £160m to upgrade Britain’s ports to manage the giant turbine blades as they pass through on their way to sea. Better ports bring benefits to local communities and help to establish supply chains which can act as an economic multiplier for the benefits of offshore wind. But the industry’s concerns centre on the government’s auction of project contracts, which guarantee a set revenue stream for their clean electricity via energy bills. The reverse auction has delivered record low prices which are unlikely to raise household costs. And the next one will be held in the spring. But there will need to be many more over the next decade to meet the government’s targets, and they will need to be far bigger too. In return for having the gates opened to more offshore projects, the industry has promised to play a major role in the government’s bid to “build back better” from the coronavirus crisis as part of a green economic recovery. The upcoming auction alone, which will include onshore wind and solar power for the first time in four years, could secure more than £20bn of investment and create 12,000 jobs. Jasmine Allen, 20, is an apprentice at SSE, which is building the world’s largest offshore windfarm alongside Equinor at Dogger Bank off the coast of Yorkshire. She is one of many young people entering the renewable energy industry for whom the government’s new offshore wind targets could guarantee a long-term career. “I think it’s fantastic,” she says. “I think it will open up new jobs, better the areas where the projects are, and create new opportunities for people to build careers.” Increasing the pace and scale of project auctions also bolsters Britain’s burgeoning supply chain of manufacturers and engineers. They will have the confidence to make long-term investments, take on more work, and reap the benefit of a growing industry. Eishar Bassan, 23, is a graduate trainee at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, a company responsible for building some of the largest wind turbines in the world. She is working on the Neart na Gaoithe windfarm, about nine miles off the east coast of Scotland, where turbines with 80-metre-long blades will spin to generate enough electricity to power the whole of Edinburgh. The prime minister’s offshore wind pledge was welcomed by colleagues, she says. “It’s ambitious, and really exciting. But there were also people being kind of cynical, like, ‘I hope the government actually pulls through and delivers’,” she adds. Bassan is one of many young engineering graduates who have chosen to work in Britain’s renewables industry in part because it will help tackle the climate crisis and create a carbon-neutral economy by the UK’s target date of 2050. “I just hope that [the government] recognises that the climate emergency is real and it’s happening right now. We need to fight – in this generation, and the next generation and the next generation – for net zero,” she says. “In 10 years’ time I definitely still want to be here, and be able to use what I’ve learned to help lead the development of these windfarms. It’s how I can help stop climate change. “I’m just hoping that the government has some substance behind this plan, to actually execute the things they promise.”"
"Britain’s biggest cinema chain is considering shutting all its UK and US venues temporarily, after the release of the latest James Bond film was put back to next year. Cineworld, which owns the Regal cinema and Picturehouse chains, said in a statement on Sunday: “We can confirm we are considering the temporary closure of our UK and US cinemas, but a final decision has not yet been reached. Once a decision has been made we will update all staff and customers as soon as we can.” The company has 127 cinemas in the UK, including 26 Picturehouse venues, and 536 Regal cinemas in the US. It employed 37,000 people globally before the pandemic, with 5,500 in the UK. Its cinema in Dublin, its only venue in Ireland, had to close due to tightened Covid-19 restrictions two weeks ago. Cineworld also has 123 cinemas across eastern Europe and Israel, where it hopes to keep venues open as those countries are benefitting from lighter coronavirus restrictions and local movies. The premiere of the new 007 movie, No Time To Die, has been twice postponed, from April when cinemas were shuttered to 12 November, and now to April 2021, in a big blow to the cinema industry. The company, the world’s second-biggest cinema operator, wrote to Boris Johnson and the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, this weekend to warn them that the industry has become “unviable”. Film studios are postponing blockbuster releases because audience numbers have been slow to recover since the Covid-19 outbreak. Other releases that have been pushed into 2021 include Disney’s Black Widow and Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story. Disney has pushed back all Star Wars and Avatar film releases scheduled between 2021 and 2027 by one year, which means there will be no Avatar 2 next year and no new Star Wars movie in 2022. Cineworld’s theatres reopened in July following the coronavirus lockdown, but it flagged up doubts over its ability to survive a second lockdown in September when it reported a £1.3bn loss for the first half of the year. It said then that admissions had been growing since it reopened 561 out of 778 sites worldwide, thanks in part to local films and the release of Christopher Nolan’s spy movie Tenet. But it warned that its financial future could be in doubt and that it would need to raise more money if authorities introduced further restrictions to combat the next wave of the virus. Tenet has taken $280m at the box office internationally but only $41m in the US, where cinemas in the three main markets – New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco – remain closed. The Cineworld Action Group, which represents employees around the world, said staff had not been consulted about the company’s plans. It is understood that news of the potential closures, which was first reported by the Sunday Times, leaked out before staff could be informed. The Labour party warned that closures would have a damaging impact across the UK, and criticised the government for not providing more support to the cinema sector. “This is devastating news for Cineworld workers and cinema-goers, and will have a knock-on impact on towns and city centres,” said Jo Stevens MP, the shadow culture secretary. “The cinema industry was viable before the crisis and will be afterwards, when the film industry recovers. The failure of ministers to recognise the value of shut-down businesses, which now includes many cinemas, means they are consigning thousands of workers to the scrap heap.”"
"More than half of furloughed jobs in the UK are at the highest risk of automation as the Covid crisis accelerates workplace technology change, driving up redundancies and inequality across the country, according to a report. The two-year commission on workers and technology, chaired by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, found that workers in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic – such as hospitality, leisure and retail – face a “double whammy” as their jobs are at the most risk of being replaced by machines. The findings from the commission, organised by the Fabian Society and the Community trade union, show that as many as 61% of jobs furloughed in the first half of this year were in sectors where automation is most likely to lead to job losses. Rapid adoption of technology during the coronavirus pandemic has helped protect jobs as millions of employees work from home. But while employers have used new technologies to survive, the commission formed of academics and trade unionists said many furloughed jobs would not return as a result. Physical-distancing requirements, remote working and online shopping have driven consumers and firms to make permanent changes to the way they use technology this year, with the pandemic likely to have a lasting impact on business and society. While spending in some physical shops has collapsed, resulting in thousands of job cuts by well-known high street employers, online spending has boomed – benefiting firms with fewer staff and highly automated operations. According to the commission, 5.9 million of the 9.6 million furloughed workers were in the third of sectors with jobs at highest risk of automation, according to analysis of Office for National Statistics figures. Urging the government to increase spending on job support and skills to help workers retrain for new employment opportunities, the report said failure to take action would risk exacerbating social disruption and fuel an increase in inequality. It said low-paid and disadvantaged workers were more likely to work in jobs at high risk of automation, with women, younger and older workers, people from minority ethnic backgrounds and disabled staff most likely to lose out. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has promised more funding for jobcentres and training since the pandemic struck, including a £2bn “kickstart” fund to help young people find work. However, the commission said additional steps were urgently required to address the scale of the jobs crisis. It said free training needed to be offered to all furloughed workers this winter, before the wage subsidy scheme is due to expire at the end of March. Among a wide-ranging set of recommendations, it also said the Treasury should also expand kickstart to support people over the age of 25 and to guarantee people either a job, training or the opportunity to return to full-time education. “The government is really not looking at this double risk, on how you help the economy through the Covid crisis and the people most affected by these much more rapid changes in technology, to make sure they aren’t left behind and lose out as a result,” Cooper said. “There’s a real danger of widening inequality, long-term structural unemployment and low pay, as a result of people not being able to benefit from the economic recovery and improvements in technology that we all want to be able to benefit from.”"
"A British artificial intelligence startup that helped Sky News and YouTube stars translate their video content into foreign languages has secured £8m in funding to expand its speech-dubbing venture. Papercup, which was founded three years ago, attracted early investors including William Tunstell-Pedoe, whose business was acquired by Amazon to help develop Alexa, and Uber’s former artificial intelligence chief Zoubin Ghahramani. Now it is targeting the millions of hours of content companies such as Netflix need to translate. “Most of the world’s videos – billions of hours of content – are shackled to a single language,” said Jesse Shemen, the co-founder and chief executive of Papercup. “And that is for a simple reason: quality dubbing is prohibitively expensive and time consuming, so current solutions only work for a select group of deep-pocketed content owners. “The technology we created will level the playing field, allowing all forms of video and audio to be consumed in any language, therefore vastly multiplying the potential reach for all content creators.” The company, which has worked with YouTubers including Yoga with Adriene as well as the US pay-TV company Discovery, says its automated translation technology results in synthetic voice dubbing that is “indistinguishable from human speech”. Sky News used the technology to translate its English broadcast to Spanish to create a new news service. The latest round of funding comes from backers that include venture capital funds LocalGlobe, Sands Capital Ventures and Entrepreneur First. Other investors include Sky, GMG Ventures, which is part of Guardian Media Group – the publisher of the Guardian, and The Future Fund, a UK government initiative focused on investing in innovative businesses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Papercup has identified a huge potential market within the global media industry, giving a wide variety of creators access to the sort of capabilities that have previously been the preserve of only the biggest conglomerates,” said Mish Mashkautsan, a partner at LocalGlobe. The funding round takes the total Papercup fundraising to more than £10m."
"Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group has reported an 18% rise in pre-tax profits as it continues talks about the potential acquisition of Debenhams. Frasers, which owns Sports Direct, the designer fashion chain Flannels and House of Fraser department stores, made no comment on the progress of discussions with Debenhams’ owners. However a decision on a deal, which could rescue at least some of its 124 outlets and thousands of jobs, is expected imminently. Debenhams has begun winding down and will close all its outlets by March if a buyer cannot be found by the time it has sold remaining stock. Ashley has long sought to gain control of Debenhams, which he wants to merge with House of Fraser to get the benefit of reducing combined costs, securing key stores and gaining Debenhams’ stronger own-brands such as Maine and Mantaray. He is also expected to cast an eye over Arcadia, the owner of Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, as well as Jaeger and Austin Reed, which collapsed into administration last month. Chris Wootton, the finance director of Frasers, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the company remained interested in Arcadia, but added: “The process has only just started so there’s a long way to go as to ascertain what - if anything – we look at with that”. Frasers said it was not paying a dividend as it wanted to “maximise flexibility in the near term with regards to a number of inorganic growth opportunities under review”. However, the company has not paid a dividend since 2009. Pre-tax profits for the group rose to £106.1m in the six months to 25 October, despite a 7.4% fall in sales as its stores suffered from Covid-related high street lockdowns. The rise was underpinned by increased efficiency and the coronavirus-linked business rates holiday at House of Fraser’s large stores, which helped return Frasers’ premium lifestyle division to profit despite a 0.7% fall in sales before acquisitions.  The division made £28.4m profit in the half year against a £7.6m loss in the same period last year, as it revealed it had permanently closed another three troubled House of Frasers since April taking the chain to 45. Shortly after buying the business in 2018, Ashley said he hoped to keep at least 47 of House of Fraser’s then 59 stores operating, but he later admitted the turnaround project had proved tougher than expected, even before Covid hit. Ashley has warned that more House of Fraser stores are likely to close next year, with some landlords already seeking planning permission for alternative uses for the sites. Underlying sales at the core sports chain slumped by nearly 13% but underlying profits rose by 6.7%, which Frasers credited to strong online sales and increased efficiency. Ashley has also been making efficiencies, cutting his personal spending on use of the company jet and helicopter to £400,000 in the half year, from £1.2m in the same period a year before. David Daly, the chairman of Frasers, said the group expected underlying profits to rise by at least 20% for the year to April, up from a 10% rise predicted in August. He said: “In an industry sector blighted by the decline of the High Street we are really proud of our performance.” The company said it had been given confidence by strong online sales as well as the successful reopening of its stores in England on 2 December after the month-long high street lockdown. Daly took a swipe at the UK government for a “lack of clarity of guidance when it finally arrives” relating to the controls on “non-essential” retailers. He added: “The coming months will continue to be tough but we are well prepared and positioned for the future.”"
"Ocado is stockpiling long-life products such as Italian beer in readiness for a no-deal Brexit but said it did not have enough warehouse space to build big reserves and could do little to mitigate the feared disruption to fresh food imports. The online grocer was as ready as it could be, said the chief executive, Tim Steiner, with the obvious problem being that “you can’t store fresh food because it is fresh. It needs free-flowing ports to move from its country of origin to the UK.” Steiner said that if Ocado wanted to store a month’s worth of inventory, it would need four times the amount of warehouse space it has.  Tesco has warned that shoppers could face temporary shortages of some fresh foods and higher prices if the UK fails to agree a deal. John Allan, the Tesco chairman, said a no-deal exit could trigger more than a month of disruption, and new import taxes on EU products could push up the cost of foods by 3%-5%. Steiner said Ocado did not anticipate material changes in pricing but would have to “wait and see” what happened in the event of no deal. Ocado updated investors on fourth-quarter trading at its Ocado Retail division, which is co-owned by its food partner Marks & Spencer. Sales increased by 35% to £580m in the 13 weeks to November as the business benefited from the boom in grocery home deliveries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The company said underlying profits at its Ocado Retail division, which began delivering M&S food in September, were now expected to top £70m. It is the third time the company has increased its profits forecast in recent months. With coronavirus restrictions curtailing the size of this year’s Christmas celebrations, Ocado said turkey was off the menu in some households, with beef joints and salmon being chosen as alternatives. For those sticking to the traditional Christmas dinner, smaller birds were the first to sell out compared with normal years, it said."
"Lloyds Banking Group has revealed that its black staff are being paid nearly 20% less than their colleagues, as it became the first major UK bank to disclose its black pay gap. Britain’s biggest high street lender said the earnings gap was due to a lack of black staff in senior positions that come with larger salaries and bigger bonuses. Figures released as part of its wider race action plan showed the median pay gap between black staff and their colleagues was 19.7%, while the bonus gap stood at 37.6%. Black employees make up 1.5% of Lloyds staff, but only hold 0.6% of the top jobs at Lloyds. The bank pledged in July to increase the number of black staff in senior roles to 3% by 2024 – bringing it in line with the black population in England and Wales – in response to Black Lives Matter protests this summer. It is difficult to determine how Lloyds’ black pay gap compares with rivals, given that the bank is the first to publish the data. Unlike gender pay gap reporting, the disclosure of ethnicity pay gaps is still voluntary. NatWest and Barclays are the only major lenders to have previously published combined pay gap data for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff, though Santander UK expects to follow suit later this month and Virgin Money plans to do so in 2021. Lloyds reported its own BAME pay gap for the first time on Friday, showing a 14.8% median difference, while the bonus pay gap stood at 32.5%. BAME staff account for 10.3% of all staff at Lloyds, and 7.3% of senior management. However, Lloyds said that, on average, BAME colleagues in the same role as white colleagues were not paid any less than their peers. At Barclays, BAME staff in the UK earned 7.6% more than their peers on a median basis in 2019, though they were paid 11% less in bonuses. Across NatWest’s UK and Ireland operations, BAME staff earned 15.7% less in wages on a median basis, and 12.3% less in bonuses. The Lloyds staff union, Accord, urged other major banks to publish ethnicity pay data. “We also need the government to step up, too. Introducing mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting is an obvious first step,” said Accord’s general secretary, Ged Nichols. Lloyds also announced on Friday that it was launching a black business advisory committee led by the former Cabinet Office adviser Claudine Reid, to understand barriers faced by black-owned businesses. It will share its research and recommendations in the spring. The banking group confirmed that the shortlist for its new chief executive had included a BAME candidate, but ultimately it chose HSBC executive Charlie Nunn for the job. Lloyds’ outgoing boss, António Horta-Osório, said: “We want to be clear that we are an anti-racist organisation – one where all employees speak up, challenge, and act to take an active stance against racism. In doing so, our colleagues will help break down the barriers preventing people from meeting their full potential.”"
"Buy-to-let landlords are joining the rush to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, with the proportion of property sales agreed with investors hitting its highest level in four years. In November, landlords made 15% of agreed property purchases in England, Wales, and Scotland, more than at any time since December 2016, according to research from the estate agent Hamptons. The Midlands and the north of England attracted the most attention from investors looking to add to their property portfolios. More than one in five (22%) agreed sales in the West Midlands were to private landlords rather than buyers intending to move into the property, while investors were involved in 18% of sales in the north of England. Blackpool was the most popular location for landlords, who were involved in seven out of 10 agreed sales in the Lancashire seaside town. The housing market has been booming since the summer, thanks to a combination of pent-up demand after the end of the first lockdown and Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s decision to temporarily halt stamp duty on all properties up to £500,000. Investors are required to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge on second homes worth more than £40,000, which has remained in place during the stamp duty holiday, but landlords have still been able to reduce their overall bill. Homebuyers wanting to take advantage of the holiday have been warned that high demand for mortgages and coronavirus restrictions have created delays in the purchase process, with mortgage approvals hitting a 13-year high this autumn. Hamptons estimates that landlords will pay £365m in stamp duty on house sales agreed between September and November, provided the deals are completed before the end of the tax holiday on 31 March 2021. However, this figure could rise by 20%, or £74m, if those purchases miss the deadline, and if the stamp duty holiday is not extended by the chancellor. The average price paid for a property by an investor in November was £180,000, which is around £80,000 less than the average amount paid by an owner-occupier. This means that the average cost of missing out on the tax break would be £1,100, according to Hamptons researchers. A typical investor who is liable to pay the surcharge would see their stamp duty bill rise from £5,400 to £6,500 if they fail to complete their purchase before the deadline. A record number of purchases by landlords were in cash, accounting for just over half (51%) of properties bought, a sign that experienced investors are looking to benefit from reduced stamp duty bills, said Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons. “With over half of investor purchases made in cash during November, those taking advantage of the holiday are disproportionately larger investors expanding portfolios rather than new investors starting out. And with landlords also making up a rising proportion of sellers, in many cases, larger landlords are buying homes from smaller landlords,” Beveridge said. During 2020, investors will have bought 134,000 homes, a slight increase from 133,000 in 2019. This is despite the coronavirus pandemic, which brought the housing market to a standstill for several weeks in the spring. Blackpool was the most popular local authority area for investors, followed by St Helens in Merseyside (where investors made 50% of property purchases), Liverpool (39%), Calderdale in West Yorkshire (36%), and Nottingham (35%). London did not feature in the top 10, although Lewisham, in the south-east of the city, took top spot in the capital, where 20% of property sales were agreed with investors."
"Struggling retailers increased the amount of rent paid to their landlords in September compared with three months earlier but still left property owners waiting to receive more than half of due rental payments. Landsec, the property group behind the Trinity Leeds shopping centre and Bluewater in Kent, said that it had collected only a third of rents from its retail tenants, five working days after they were due, compared with 82% of rental payments from office tenants. The Covid-19 crisis has had a clear impact on commercial property firms, and the company said that a year earlier it had collected 89% of retail rents and almost all (98%) office rents during the same timeframe. Overall, it received just under two-thirds (62%) of rent due in September from all of its commercial tenants, down from 95% a year earlier. It was a similar picture at the rival property group British Land, owner of the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield and Drake Circus in Plymouth, which collected 50% of rent from its retail tenants and 91% from office tenants, amounting to 69% of total rents. The commercial landlord has still only received three-quarters of rent that it was due in June. Almost half of British Land’s retail assets are out-of-town retail parks, which are usually accessed by car and are generally home to larger and more spacious food and homeware stores, making it easier for customers to avoid contact with other shoppers. British Land said footfall at retail parks was “outperforming” the wider sector, with visitor numbers reaching 89% of the previous year’s levels in September. The property firm said shoppers were visiting its parks such as Giltbrook in Nottingham and Mayflower in Basildon to buy specific items, what it calls “mission-based shopping”, or to collect online orders or return unwanted goods. British Land said that it had completed the sale of £245m of retail property since the start of April. In a boost for investors, the firm has reinstated its dividend from November, which will now be paid twice-annually instead of quarterly. The company confirmed it had not received any business rates relief from the government during the coronavirus pandemic. British Land shares rose 5% on Friday, a fact that is “testament to the state the commercial property industry is in”, said Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, adding “it’s quite something when being underpaid by 25% is considered a success”. However, Hyett warned that tenants moving into British Land’s empty shops will be paying significantly lower rent than the rates before the pandemic and questioned rent rates for office tenants.“Just 18% of desks in the group’s London offices are occupied and we seriously question whether current rental rates can be maintained if customers’ staff aren’t using the buildings,” Hyett said."
"Passenger journeys on Britain’s railways fell during lockdown to the lowest level since the mid-19th century, according to official figures. The rail industry regulator said 35m journeys took place from April to June, which was just 8% of the total for the same period in 2019. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said revenue had fallen even further than usage, with less than 7% of 2019’s fare income collected over the three months – a shortfall of £2.5bn, which was covered by the taxpayer under emergency contracts. Passenger numbers climbed steadily to 43% of normal traffic after lockdown ended, and until the government reversed its messaging about returning to the workplace in late September. The latest provisional figures show the levels have dipped again to between 30-40% of usual traffic. Train operating companies have been urging the government to give a clear message that rail travel is safe. The ORR’s director of railway planning and performance, Graham Richards, said: “Rail is one of the safest ways to travel and our inspectors continue to monitor the reality on the ground to ensure people have the confidence that they can travel safely.” The industry is also calling for speedy changes to the fares system, with season ticket sales drying up. The Rail Delivery Group said companies were keen to work with government to introduce flexible season tickets to encourage passengers back. Meanwhile, ministers have hailed a shift in public attitudes towards more walking and cycling – despite data that suggests the Covid-19 cycling boom may have tailed off. The Department for Transport highlighted figures in the national travel attitudes survey, which was published on Thursday, that showed 39% of people claimed to walk more than before the pandemic, and 38% saying they cycled more – with 94% of this group saying they were likely to continue to walk and cycle more as a result. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Coronavirus has undoubtedly changed the way we travel and more people walking and cycling will bring environmental and health benefits. “It’s great that those people who have switched to greener forms of transport want to stick with it and I want to capitalise on this with our unprecedented £2bn active travel fund.” The £2bn fund was launched in May, with £250m for immediate spending on popup cycle lanes and wider pavements. Cycling was favoured for safety in terms of contracting coronavirus, according to respondents in the travel attitudes survey, with 82% saying they had no concerns on a bike – the same as in a private car. Only about 10% said they would travel on trains, tubes or trams without worrying about Covid-19. Alarmingly for public transport operators, only between 14% and 20% said they would have no concerns about using tube or trains again when travel restrictions and physical distancing rules were lifted. Yet the survey, which was conducted between May and July, also underlined how far cycling lags behind car use. Only 3% of those who travelled to work the previous day had gone by bike, compared with 72% by car. Further evidence that people’s expressed intentions may not match the daily reality appear in the latest DfT data for actual transport use. Cycling activity had climbed to more than double pre-pandemic levels on several weekdays in May and June, and was almost four times higher at weekends. However, levels of cycling in England have now fallen significantly below 2019 figures on four of the last 10 recorded weekdays."
"Cineworld staff on zero-hours contracts say they have been wrong-footed by the cinema chain’s decision to keep them on, even though the closure of its cinemas means they have no shifts. “People want the option to take redundancy but that doesn’t seem to be what the company wants to do,” one contractor told the Guardian. “It feels like they’re holding us hostage.” The majority of Cineworld’s 5,500 staff working at its 127 UK sites are on zero-hours contracts which do not guarantee any regular work. However, those with more than two years service would be entitled to redundancy pay if they were being let go. In an email to thousands of zero-hours contractors, Cineworld chief executive, Mooky Greidinger, said he hoped its theatres, which closed temporarily on Thursday for an indefinite period, would be shut for the short term only and the company would be “able to offer you new shifts again”. Staff are being paid for hours worked this week, plus a week of furlough pay based on their shifts for the corresponding period last year.  “Cineworld plans to keep them on, which means they don’t have to give them any holiday or redundancy pay,” explained one cinema manager. Cineworld’s lack of respect for its staff was, he said, summed up by the company’s decision to give them free sweets on their last shift on Thursday – but it only comprised of confectionery with a best-before-date up until November, which the company knew wouldn’t get sold to customers. The company’s senior managers are being given the choice of taking unpaid leave until the business reopens or voluntary redundancy, but they only have until noon on Monday to make their decision. In a statement, Cineworld said the temporary closure of its cinemas and the current criteria of the government’s job support scheme meant it was “no longer able to support a number of our valued workforce”."
"Up to 21,500 jobs are at risk at Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group – the owner of Jaeger, Peacocks and Austin Reed – as the retailer teeters on the brink of administration. The group, owned by the entrepreneur Philip Day, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal document that provides protection from creditors for 10 days. The group, which has 1,100 stores and concessions, about half of which are Peacocks outlets, had been seeking a buyer for some weeks and will spend the next few weeks considering its options. Day, a former executive at the traditional British brand Aquascutum, who lives in Switzerland and owns a castle in Cumbria, built up his retail empire by acquiring a string of businesses out of administration. He got his first big break in 2001, as part of the £49m private equity-backed buyout of the purveyor of knitwear to the middle-aged Edinburgh Woollen Mill. After buying out his co-investors, Day picked up the homewares group Ponden Mill, the young fashion brand Jane Norman and then, in 2012, the cut-price fashion chain Peacocks. He snapped up Austin Reed in 2016 and Jaeger in 2017 when he tried launching his own department store, Days, in Carmarthen. Last year, Day also bought the fashion chain Bonmarché, via a separate investment vehicle from the EWM Group, and put that into administration. Bonmarché, which employs about 2,500 people, is not affected by the potential administration process announced on Friday. Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM) said it was “responding to the harsh trading conditions caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a recent reduction in its credit insurance”.  Credit insurance – which suppliers take out to cover orders yet to be paid for – was withdrawn two weeks ago amid a dispute over £27m that Bangladeshi factories say they are owed. EWM said it had received a number of expressions of interest for parts of the group in recent weeks and that these were being assessed along with “all other options”. However, the chief executive of EWM, Steve Simpson, said there would “inevitably be significant cuts and closures” and the group would appoint FRP Advisory as administrators to carry “necessary restructuring” of the business. Sources said that Austin Reed and Jane Norman, both of which now operate only online, were most likely to be shut down for good. Simpson said: “Like every retailer, we have found the past seven months extremely difficult. This situation has grown worse in recent weeks as we have had to deal with a series of false rumours about our payments and trading, which have impacted our credit insurance. “Traditionally, EWM has always traded with strong cash reserves and a conservative balance sheet but these stories and the reduction in credit insurance, against the backdrop of the initial lockdown, current local lockdowns, and the second wave of Covid-19 reducing footfall, have made normal trading impossible. “As directors we have a duty to the business, our staff, our customers and our creditors to find the very best solution in this brutal environment.” Analysts at the market research firm GlobalData said EWM had suffered because its older customer base was more reluctant to visit stores during the coronavirus pandemic, while it had not developed its online proposition as much as some rivals. Patrick O’Brien at GlobalData said Day had bought up a collection of weak brands that didn’t have a lot of appeal to potential buyers of the business and so the most likely outcome was a pre-pack administration restructure in which Day would buy back more successful elements of EWM Group. He said the continuing coronavirus crisis had forced Day to act. “Retailers were hoping Covid was only going to be affecting a short period of lockdown and then they would be able to recover. That is no longer the case and if we look into 2021, it is unlikely footfall is going to recover to pre-pandemic levels for some time. Where retailers are disproportionately exposed to older age groups, [those people] are going to be isolating and if they have not already been converted to shopping online, you are going to struggle,” O’Brien said."
"The nationwide closure of Cineworld’s theatres was the disaster movie nobody working in the UK’s battered leisure industry wanted to see. The mothballing of the country’s largest cinema operator not only spells hardship for its 5,500 staff but has set off a chain reaction that threatens the livelihoods of many more working in the neighbouring restaurants that rely on the multiplex trade. On Friday, the billboards outside the 14-screen Cineworld in Feltham, west London, were still advertising Tenet and Bill & Ted Face the Music, but the next screening will be months, rather than hours, away. At the start of 2020 the future was bright for the Leisure West park. The owner was ready to refurbish and install a “superscreen” to give an extra wow factor to the Bollywood films that draw huge crowds to the venue, making it one of Cineworld’s top five performers. With a Tenpin bowling alley and family friendly restaurants such as Pizza Hut, Burger King and Frankie & Benny’s, the leisure complex, like 124 others around the country, is in normal times a destination for birthday parties, date nights and family outings. But with cinemas closed will people still come? Two out of every five Cineworld cinemas are sited on leisure parks. Mark Jason William, a Cineworld regular, described the temporary loss of his local cinema as “gutting”. “We come here, then go to Burger King to make a night of it.” But the closure does more than curtail social lives. It is a blow to a London borough already hard hit by the travails of Heathrow airport, a major local employer. The crisis in the aviation sector has already put more than 40,000 jobs at risk in the borough of Hounslow, with a recent report forecasting the economy will contract by 11% this year. The restaurants and entertainment brands that populate the Feltham leisure complex are typical of other parts of the country and have already been battered by the Covid-19 crisis. What used to be Tex-Mex dining chain Chiquito has closed down, but in a hurry, with menus and novelty sombreros still visible on the tables. The Pizza Hut and Frankie & Benny’s are still trading, having survived shutdown programmes which have closed many of the brands’ other outlets. The Buzz Bingo hall has also made the cut in a company overhaul that involved 26 other closures. The sign outside Tenpin advises would-be bowlers: “In a world where you can be anything, be kind.” It is a gentle reminder to have patience as staff deal with coronavirus red tape that has halved the capacity of bowling alleys. According to the Local Data Company (LDC), leisure parks have a slightly higher vacancy rate than retail parks which are actually winning business as pandemic shoppers now prefer large out-of-town stores to glitzy indoor malls and high streets.  Ronald Nyakairu, an analyst at LDC, said social distancing in restaurants and limitations on party sizes mean leisure businesses have had to “miss out on events such as children’s birthday parties, which provide a key revenue stream”. “Cinemas have been hampered by the lack of box office films and gyms were one of the last categories allowed to reopen under government guidelines,” he says. With a fifth of the country’s cinemas now closed or operating weekend-only hours “footfall to these locations is likely to drop further, making life even harder for the surrounding businesses”. Retail and leisure parks used to be a safe prospect for investors, thanks to reliable rent-payers and Britons eager to spend their free time shopping or combining a meal out with the latest blockbuster movie. But rents are falling fast or not being paid at all, hitting the owners, many of whom are managing pension-fund cash. The biggest leisure park investors are Legal & General and Land Securities, but Leisure West is owned by the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) which bought it for £33m in 2011 and is grappling with a deficit put at up to £18bn. It is “not a great time” to be the landlord of a leisure scheme conceded Ross Kirton, head of UK leisure at Colliers International. “Box office admissions in January were 16.5m people, whereas the figure for August was 2.5m,” said Kirton. “It’s about the sheer volume of people and the ‘dwell time’ cinemas create. The impact on a restaurant of a cinema closing is only going to be negative.” Turning over space to logistics firms who need warehouse space to serve the UK’s booming online shopping industry, would be one way to breathe into new leisure parks, suggested Nyakairu. “Historic data shows that units that fail to find a new tenant after two years are likely to never be re-let. Leisure parks will need to reinvent themselves if they are to survive.”"
"High-income earners will gain two-fifths of the Coalition’s tax cuts in 2020-21, rising to more than four-fifths in 2021-22, according to the Australia Institute. The progressive thinktank’s analysis, released on Wednesday, confirms that middle-income earners get a one-off benefit from the extension of the $1,080 tax offset but are not better off from 2021-22, when the offset is replaced dollar-for-dollar with tax bracket changes. The government disputes the analysis, arguing that because the low- and middle-income tax offset was set to expire, that middle-income earners are permanently $1,080 better off every year with a double benefit in 2020-21. Despite the argument over the fairness of distribution and pressure from the Greens to reject them, Labor will help the Coalition pass the tax cuts, which have been rolled together with big business support it says requires more scrutiny. On Wednesday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said he had written to the tax commissioner confirming the opposition’s support and there was “no reason” not to implement the cuts immediately. The Australian Taxation Office confirmed it will “publish updated tax withholding schedules as soon as possible after bipartisan support has been confirmed” for the bill containing tax cuts. From 2020-21, the upper limit of the 19% personal income tax bracket will rise to $45,000 and the 32.5% marginal tax rate upper threshold will lift from $90,000 to $120,000. People earning more than $120,000 will see the biggest benefit, with a permanent cut of $2,430 in 2020-21 and beyond. People earning $48,000 to $90,000 – who were set to lose the low- and middle-income tax offset – will be compensated with an equivalent reduction of $1,080 in their fortnightly tax and an additional $1,080 in 2020-21 from a one-off extension of the offset. Tax cuts from bracket changes will be delivered as soon as the tax office gives the green light to employers; while cuts from the extension of the offset and the backdating of tax cuts to July will be paid at the end of the financial year. At the National Press Club on Wednesday, treasurer Josh Frydenberg said tax cuts would start arriving from November or December onwards – “before Christmas”. Frydenberg said taxpayers will receive some of the benefit “as soon as the [pay-as-you-go] withholding schedules are updated by Treasury” with the rest delivered “at the end of the year”. The Australia Institute’s analysis found that in 2020-21, 41% of the government’s tax plan will go to the top 20% of income earners, who earn about $102,000. The bottom 20% of taxpayers receive only 4%. In 2021-22, 88% of the government’s tax plan will go to the top 20% of income earners. The bottom 20% get nothing, the thinktank found. Matt Grudnoff, the Australia Institute’s senior economist, said: “This budget gives a temporary boost to lower and middle-income earners and a permanent boost to the wealthiest people in the country. “Our research shows that low- and middle-income earners will actually be paying more tax next financial year than they are this year. “Regular Australians and those who are struggling will get a handout this financial year while wealthy Australian get a tax cut that is legislated forever. “Gearing this tax plan towards wealthy Australians will permanently widen inequality in Australia and increase the chances of it being saved rather than spent, undermining its already limited stimulatory effect.” Chalmers said Labor was concerned that the average-sized tax cut is $50 a fortnight, which is less than the $300 reduction in jobkeeper wage subsidies imposed on 2 million workers. That means many are “worse off” despite public debt reaching $1tn, he told reporters in Canberra."
"Under lengthy questioning James Packer has admitted he has “long been on clear notice of the links” between organisers of gambling junkets at Crown Resorts’ casinos and organised crime, but that he personally did nothing to set risk guidelines for the high-roller operation while executive chairman of the company. Giving evidence to an inquiry into Crown on Thursday, Packer also said he would not go back on to the board of the gambling empire and expected his shareholding in the company to be capped. The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority inquiry, which is looking into whether Crown and its associates, including Packer, should be allowed to operate a casino in Sydney, also heard details of his close involvement with the junket business, which continued after he stepped down from the board of the company in late 2015. It was called last year by the New South Wales government after the Nine media group published allegations of wrongdoing, including money laundering at Crown’s casinos and links between junket operators, who bring in high-roller gamblers, and organised crime groups. Packer was appearing for a third and final day before the inquiry after giving evidence that has included admitting to making “shameful” threats against a businessman in 2015. Under questioning from counsel assisting the inquiry, Naomi Sharp SC, Packer initially refused to accept that he had “long been on clear notice of the links between junket operators and organised crime”. “Not the junket operators that Crown Australia was dealing with,” Packer told the inquiry. But Packer conceded the point after Sharp reminded him of an episode of ABC TV’s flagship current affairs show, Four Corners, broadcast in 2014 that alleged links between six junket operators that brought gamblers to Crown and organised crime. “Yes, that’s fair,” he said. He said that while executive chairman of Crown he was aware of the due diligence work the company did on junket operators “only at the highest level”. “I was assured that they were junkets of good repute,” he said. He agreed with Sharp’s suggestion that it was the board’s responsibility to set guidelines for the risk Crown was willing to take in the junket operator business, but he never turned his mind to the topic. “I saw that as Mr [Rowen] Craigie’s job,” he said, referring to Crown’s chief executive at the time. Emails tendered to the inquiry show the Crown executive Ishan Ratnam kept Packer up to date on what was going on in the international VIP business, including developments with junket operators. This included updates given in May and July 2017, more than a year after Packer had stepped down from the Crown board. The emails show Ratnam told Packer of his concerns that a crackdown by mainland Chinese authorities on capital leaving the country was making the high-roller business more difficult. Ratnam sent Packer an email on 31 August 2015 “telling you ‘transferring money out of China difficult’”, Sharp said. The inquiry heard that in emails sent in August 2017, Ratnam told Packer rebuilding the VIP business at Crown’s London casino, Aspinalls, would be very challenging because of “credit and wealth checks” needed under anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance rules. “I can recall that the Aspinalls business was getting tougher and tougher,” Packer told the inquiry. Asked what Ratnam meant by a reference in one email to “too many third-party bank payments not having proof of wealth”, Packer said: “I believe it had to do with AML.” Packer also met with junket operators, although he said he did this “rarely”. “I do not and never had intimate relations with junket operators or junkets, and I had nothing to do with management of those junkets,” Packer said. In 2015 in Macau Packer met with Alvin Chau, the head of the biggest junket operator in the Chinese territory. Suncity, which operated a high-roller room at Crown’s Melbourne casino, was one of the junket operators that the 2014 Four Corners episode alleged had links to organised crime. In August last year, Nine newspapers reported Chau had been banned from Australia amid an investigation into Suncity. At the time, Chau said he was “not subject to any Australian investigation”. Packer said that at around the same time as he met with Chau, he also met with another junket operator, Song Zezhai. “The purpose of the meeting was for me to thank Mr Song for his business,” Packer said. However, he denied that he set the company’s VIP strategy between 2012 and 2015. He was chairman of the company until August 2015 and resigned from the board in December that year. Sharp asked: “Did you contribute to that strategy?” “Marginally,” Packer said. He agreed with the inquiry commissioner, former NSW supreme court judge Patricia Bergin, that “some very serious changes have to be made”. “I won’t be going on the board again,” he said. “I think the board will be more independent than it was in the past. “I think that caps on shareholders may be something that you’ll think about.” He said the Crown board “has a lot to think about in terms of who does what job”. “I think that this has been a terribly painful and terribly shocking experience for the board, as it has been for me.” The inquiry continues."
"A “disinfection” cabinet that zaps coronavirus could be this Christmas’s must-have gadget as manufacturers tap into demand for professional levels of hygiene in the home. The UV cleaning cabinet, which resembles a microwave and costs £199, is one of a range of anti-coronavirus appliances being put on the market by the electrical brand Beko. The appliance-maker thinks the metal box, which uses UV light, could become a fixture in British hallways. The device can be used to kill bacteria and viruses on the surfaces of personal effects such as keys, mobile phones, bags and toys. The Hygiene Shield range, which also includes a fridge with a disinfection drawer and tumble dryer with a UV setting, was rushed into production after a poll of Beko customers in 31 countries found widespread concerns about domestic hygiene. The range is designed, it said, to provide consumers with “peace of mind that their homes are safe and clean”. Hakan Bulgurlu, the chief executive of Arçelik, the Turkish conglomerate that owns Beko, said the company was fulfilling a “real consumer need” with the products that enabled them to achieve “professional levels of hygiene at home”. “I think good hygiene practice is going to be one of the lasting impacts of coronavirus,” he said, echoing other major businesses such as Unilever which have pointed to a permanent increase in demand for soap and cleaning products supplies. The online electrical goods retailer AO.com said there had been a huge increase in searches for terms such as “anti-bac” and “steam clean” on its website. Sales of steam cleaning appliances have soared this year by 140%, compared with 2019, while demand for washing machines with 90C wash cycles and steam settings is up 87%, AO said. “Consumers are extremely uncomfortable with coming back into their homes after they’ve been outside, whether it’s shopping, something being delivered, their clothing, their shoes, their keys, their phones,” said Bulgurlu. They were particularly worried that food packaging could be carrying the virus, he added. “Everybody has a little table where they put keys, hats or spare change by the door. It’s probably not the most attractive thing to put there but as soon as you arrive home you can put your keys, wallet or mobile inside to be disinfected,” Bulgurlu said, referring to the UV cleaning cabinet. At the start of the pandemic there was a lot of debate about the length of time coronavirus could survive on different surfaces. However, scientists have said this area of concern may have been overplayed, with a recent paper in the Lancet suggesting the chance of transmission via contaminated surfaces is “very small”. Some shoppers have been taking extra precautions, wiping down bottles and packets when they get home from the supermarket – and in some cases quarantining purchases for several days. With a separate disinfection drawer above the crisper, Beko says its new fridge will do some of that work disinfecting items in about 40 minutes. The company said it was not cashing in on the pandemic with the range, as the new models were not much more expensive than the standard ones. “Our intention here is not to be opportunistic but to provide a service to our customers,” said Bulgurlu. “This is a real need they have communicated to us. By including a feature which raises the cost of ownership by 5-10% it’s not like we’re making a lot of money here.”"
"Optimism that a mass rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will lead to an economic recovery lifted stocks in London again on Tuesday, to their highest closing level in over four months. London’s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares rallied by nearly 1.8% to finish at 6,296 points, the highest close since 23 June. This added £28bn to the index’s value, taking its gains so far this week to nearly £100bn after it surged 4.6% on Monday on news of a vaccine breakthrough. Investors continued to snap up stocks, such as airlines, transport companies and hospitality firms on Tuesday, hoping for a return to normality in 2021. Monday’s promising clinical data from Pfizer and BioNTech, showing their Covid-19 vaccine was 90% effective in medical trials, produced a second day of gains for certain businesses and helped shares in jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce gain 7% to their highest level since June. The parent company of British Airways, IAG, rose almost 6% to a two-month high. Ocado, whose online grocery business has seen huge demand in the pandemic, fell 5%. The oil price rallied again too, with international benchmark Brent crude up 2% to $43.24 per barrel. This drove BP’s share 5% higher, with Royal Dutch Shell 4% higher. Among smaller companies, cinema chain Cineworld – whose UK and US screens are currently closed – jumped 18%. Food and drink operator SSP, which operates Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza outlets at UK railway stations and airports, gained 13%, adding to Monday’s 51% leap. Tuesday’s rally came as the UK government outlined that dedicated GP clinics will be set up to each deliver nearly 1,000 Covid-19 vaccines a week in England, if they are approved for use. “The post-pandemic world that at times this year has looked a distant dream is suddenly a little in sight, following the Pfizer/BioNTech announcement yesterday and investors are seeing some value in those companies whose business plans have been decimated this year,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency trader OANDA Europe. Erlam cautioned that there are still major hurdles to overcome, including final regulatory approval and the challenge of distributing many millions of doses. Other European markets showed smaller gains, with France’s CAC jumping 1.5% and the German DAX finishing 0.5% higher. The FTSE 100 has been one of the worst-performing major stock indices since the pandemic began, and is still 16% lower than at the start of January. But growing hopes of a vaccine mass rollout soon are pushing investors into “value” stocks again. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained ended up 1.06% at 29,467.94. The tech-focused Nasdaq dropped by 1.12%, to 11,582.35. Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said Pfizer’s vaccine trial results “gave a big jolt to equity markets”, boosting the energy, financials, and industrials sectors at the expense of technology stocks. “European equities are benefiting the most from the vaccine as the European economies are hit hard from Covid-19 and generally European equities are more cyclical than the overall US equity markets,” Garnry explained. But in the long term, big tech is still the fastest growing segment of the market, Garnry added. “US technology stocks have had explosive earnings growth since 2009 while also being more immune to crises such as the euro area crisis in 2011-2012, emerging markets in 2015, and lately Covid-19.”"
"Ministers are seeking sweeping powers to block takeovers by Chinese and other foreign companies on national security grounds as part of the biggest shake-up in the UK’s industrial intervention policy for nearly two decades. A national security and investment bill is due to be published on Wednesday, which would also allow ministers to retrospectively halt acquisitions any time in the five years after the deal was concluded. But China hawks on the Conservative backbenches said they wanted to study the bill carefully and were considering amendments to make it easier to prevent takeovers by foreign companies accused of being involved in human rights abuses. Business secretary Alok Sharma said that while ministers were keen to ensure the UK remained attractive to inward investment “hostile actors should be in no doubt – there is no backdoor to the UK”. Ministers and officials have been careful to draw up the legislation in a country-neutral manner, but although there are concerns about Russian companies, it is takeovers involving Chinese firms that will come under the greatest scrutiny. The proposals emerge at a time of heightened political concern about Chinese ownership in key parts of the economy, while the coronavirus pandemic has also further revealed dependencies on foreign suppliers for critical goods. A growing number of Conservative backbenchers also want to make it harder for Chinese companies to buy strategic British firms – after they successfully forced the government to drop Huawei from 5G mobile networks after 2027. One of the party’s MPs, Bob Seely, said he welcomed the intent of the bill but wanted ministers to be clear about how far takeovers by foreign companies could be blocked amid concerns over human rights. “You can’t be neutral about a company involved in slave labour, or in significant intellectual property theft or abuse of human rights or in helping set up the surveillance state,” Seely added. Last month, Iain Duncan Smith called for a full review of Chinese ownership in the UK, highlighting the country’s leading supplier of blood plasma as an example. Rebel MPs are also focused on the UK’s programme of new nuclear reactors, in which China General Nuclear wants to build a reactor in Bradwell, Essex. The existing rules were drawn up in the early days of the last Labour government in 2002, when Tony’s Blair’s administration was keen to introduce a laissez-faire regime, and only allowed ministers to review a takeover on relatively narrow grounds. At one point in 2006, it appeared, with British approval, that Russian energy giant Gazprom was going to make a bid for British Gas, although this did not ultimately materialise. In total, there have only been 12 public interest interventions on national security grounds since 2002. The bill will ask that takeovers, mergers and other significant transactions in critical sectors of the UK economy will have to be notified to a new Investment Security Unit based in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis). The exact sectors are subject to consultation but will include companies operating in areas such as civil nuclear, communications, defence, transport, artificial intelligence, computer hardware as well as critical suppliers to government, NHS and police. But business deals of all sizes across the entire economy will be subject to the regime, and ministers will be able to intervene retrospectively up to five years after a deal has been concluded. That power will apply from today, meaning that any deal conducted in the coming days could be reviewed and voided in 2025. Ministers will have 30 days in the first instance to decide whether they want to “call in” a takeover or any other significant transaction, subjecting it to a national security review. That could result in takeovers being blocked or a range of conditions being placed on deals. Cornelia Andersson, head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and capital raising at Refinitiv, said the impact could be far-reaching on defence, energy and hi-tech areas of the UK economy. “This could spell costly delays for M&A activity in the UK and may add more pressure to a challenging post-Brexit outlook next year,” she said."
"Ryanair expects air passenger numbers to bounce back to near normal levels by next summer, defying industry predictions that it could take years for growth to return after the pandemic. The airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said passenger volumes should reach 75-80% of pre-Covid levels in 2021, especially if a vaccine was developed by the spring. While he admitted winter was a “write-off”, he claimed Ryanair was poised “at the dawn of an extraordinary era of growth” with a fleet of new planes arriving, and was emerging from the pandemic with a strong balance sheet, in a position to offer low fares to stimulate travel. Speaking at the World Travel Market conference, O’Leary said he was optimistic that Covid vaccines would be rolled out before the peak summer season in 2021. “There’s going to be an enormous snapback on travel demand … Mrs O’Leary is very keen to go back to the Algarve and I suspect she’d be there in 2.5 nanoseconds after the coronavirus restrictions are lifted. I think she’s reflective of the overwhelming majority of Europe’s population, and they will go back,” O’Leary said. “We’re going to see a surge of that intra-European tourism next year, and we need to be there to provide the capacity at low prices.” Ryanair has cut capacity for winter, but not yet as drastically as its rival easyJet. O’Leary added: “I’ve heard a lot of rubbish coming from legacy airlines that it’ll be 2035 till the volumes come back. Rubbish. Volumes will go back in 2021 or 2022 pretty quickly – they will go back because Ryanair will discount prices, hotels will discount.” The travel industry organisation Abta said some firms had reported bookings for next summer since the announcement of a vaccine by Pfizer on Monday, while more were receiving inquiries from would-be holidaymakers.  TravelSupermarket said 54% more people had searched for holidays in the 24 hours since the vaccine news, compared with the previous Monday. On the Beach, which organises about 1.5m package holidays a year, said online traffic had jumped 25% but there had not yet been a notable impact on bookings. An Abta spokeswoman said the vaccine news would “go some way to restoring consumer confidence” but the industry needed government support now “as many travel companies will not be able to wait for the full rollout of a vaccine”. O’Leary criticised government “incompetence”, particularly in the UK but across Europe, in addressing the pandemic. He said: “What was disturbing is the way the government mishandled that first lockdown … it should have given time to put in place mass testing.” He said Boris Johnson’s promise of a world-class test-and-trace system had been “utter vacuous rubbish”, and questioned the approach now being taken by the UK government’s global taskforce in developing a new testing regime for arrivals. “Airport testing is a complete waste of time … it’s too late, it takes too long, what do you do in a terminal when you have positive tests?” Ryanair supported pre-departure testing, O’Leary said, to restart flying. “Testing should not be at airports, people should be coming to airports with a negative test … Certainly within Europe, short-haul should be restarting quickly.” O’Leary said he had been busy negotiating new airport slots around Europe for after the pandemic. “Airports are realising that a lot of Lufthansa’s capacity is not coming back … they want to deal with an airline that is rapid and flexible. What we’ve done is been keeping all our planes, pilots and crew current, so we can pounce on growth.” Ryanair’s fleet should be augmented by the first deliveries of Boeing 737 Max planes, O’Leary said, anticipating European regulatory approval of the model in January. He dismissed concerns over the safety of the plane, which was grounded after two fatal crashes. “It will be the most audited, the most interrogated, safest aircraft ever to fly.”"
"Wealthy people in England are booking private jets to escape the lockdown set to be introduced on Thursday, according to jet brokers. Air Partner, one of the biggest aircraft charter firms, said there had been a “sharp rise” in private jet bookings out of the country before Thursday. The company, which supplies planes to Premier League footballers, celebrities, the royal family and six of the eight governments in the G8, said it had been overwhelmed with inquiries. “Many of these flight inquiries are for individuals wishing to go to their second homes in Europe, with the Canary Islands, which are still warm at this time of year, being the most sought-after destination,” the company said.  “We do expect to continue to see some demand for private jet flights during the rest of the month for business travel, particularly as many commercial flights become grounded and unavailable.” The new lockdown in England, expected to come into force on Thursday, will ban residents in England from travelling abroad except for essential work until at least 2 December. Air Partner said it would cost about £24,000, one way, for five people to depart from Biggin Hill to Tenerife before lockdown. Commercial airlines have dramatically reduced their flight schedules in anticipation of an even greater fall in demand for international travel, which has been moribund since the pandemic began. However, private jet operators have reported a much smaller decline in bookings. The operators say this is because the super-rich have continued to travel as much as before.  In addition, more moderately wealthy people are seeking out private jets as they view it as a safer way to travel during the pandemic because it avoids potentially crowded commercial planes and airport terminals. Private jet operators also reported a rise in bookings before the first UK-wide lockdown in March. They also marketed “evacuation flights” out of countries badly hit by the virus. The number of private flights dipped by just 10% between 1 September and 15 October compared with last year, according to the aviation consultancy WINGX. That compares with a more than 50% drop in scheduled commercial flights. Richard Koe, the managing director of WINGX said: “Business aviation demand has been considerably more resilient than commercial airline activity throughout the pandemic, with a really strong rebound in last summer as travel restrictions got lifted.  “That recovery has relapsed this autumn as leisure demand has tails off and business travellers stay home, but the latter could pick up as economies recover. The advantages of flying private, notably hygiene control and convenience, should continue to draw some customers from the airlines.” Oliver Stone, the managing director of the private jet brokerage firm Colibri Aircraft, said: “Covid-19 has also resulted in an increase in enquiries from potential first-time buyers of business aircraft as the crisis has helped raise the profile and benefits of flying privately amongst those who can afford to do this. “For many business owners and executives, travel is a necessary component to keep their business running. The use of private aviation is now often the only way to continue to travel and keep their companies operational.” Private jets emit about 20 times more carbon dioxide per passenger mile than commercial flights, according to industry data."
"Record demand for country houses in the UK has driven prices to a four-year high, with wealthy buyers flocking to Worcester in the West Midlands and Cobham in Surrey in a “race for space”. Prices for country houses, including cottages, farm houses and manor houses, rose 2% in the three months to September from the previous quarter, according to the estate agent Knight Frank, as the number of offers accepted outside London hit an all-time record. Compared with the third quarter of last year, prices rose by 2.3%, the highest annual growth rate since March 2016, when the impending 3% surcharge on second home purchases led to buyers rushing to complete ahead of its introduction. With working from home becoming a long-term reality for many office workers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, those who can afford to do so have been moving out of London and other big cities into more rural areas in search of larger houses. The stamp duty cut announced in July has also fuelled demand. In the West Midlands, prices for country houses rose by 3.7% on the quarter, led by Worcester, while north Surrey recorded a 3.1% price rise, with Cobham, Ascot, Esher and Weybridge among the most popular locations. In the south-east and the east of England prices rose by 2.1%, with the area around Basingstoke proving popular. Chris Druce, a senior research analyst at Knight Frank, said: “Worcester is an example of somewhere that offers both greenery and space that hasn’t traditionally been considered an easy location to commute full-time from. Following lockdown and the adoption of WFH [working from home] widely, this perception and indeed people’s requirements have changed.” People had realised they did not need to be right next to a train station as they were commuting less, he said, and that “an extra 20 or 30 minutes on the train will get you a much bigger house”. Prices for country houses valued at less than £1m rose by 1.8% on the previous quarter, while those valued at more than £1m recorded growth of 2.3%, Knight Frank said. Houses valued at £3m to £4m were most in demand, where prices rose 2.9% on the quarter. Other data from estate agents and mortgage lenders has shown that property prices are on the rise in leafy commuter towns, while rents for flats in some areas of central London and cities such as Edinburgh are sharply down. However, Knight Frank said there were some signs of a slowdown, amid the resurgence of the Covid-19 virus, fresh lockdowns and the weakening job market. While the number of property viewings remained at 35% above the five-year average, they had been slowing. Despite this, offers for houses accepted outside London were still at an all-time high in the second week of October, suggesting exchanges would continue to rise in the run-up to Christmas."
"Up to 3,500 jobs are expected to go at Sainsbury’s as the supermarket closes the bulk of its standalone Argos stores as well as all its meat, fish and deli counters. The retailer, which employs 172,000 people, said about 420 of its Argos stores would close over the next three years, leaving just 101 standalone stores compared with 845 when Sainsbury’s paid £1.4bn for Argos in 2016. Alongside the closures, Sainsbury’s said 150 Argos stores would be moved into its supermarkets as part of an effort to save more than £600m in costs over the next three years. The changes come as Sainsbury’s, the UK’s second largest supermarket, said 40% of its sales were now online – compared with 19% a year ago – after the dramatic change in shopping habits during the pandemic. Bev Clarkson, national officer for the food industry at the union Unite, which represents workers on Sainsbury’s fresh food counters, said: “This is very grim news for our members and their families in the run-up to Christmas, and we will be giving them maximum support during this worrying and uncertain time.” The company is aiming to find new roles for thousands of staff affected by the changes, but expects 3,500 could leave despite plans to increase the overall number of people it employs by 6,000 by March. Most of the new roles are linked to expanding the group’s online services. Sainsbury’s plans to increase its grocery home delivery capacity from just over 700,000 slots a week to 760,000 by the end of the year. The move follows a doubling of online sales in the half year to 19 September as more customers chose to avoid physical stores during the pandemic. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “Covid-19 has accelerated a number of shifts in our industry. Investments over recent years in digital and technology have laid the foundations for us to flex and adapt quickly as customers needed to shop differently.” He added that customers were unlikely to go back to the way they shopped before the pandemic. As supermarkets shape up for a tricky Christmas because of the financial difficulties facing many families, Sainsbury’s has lowered prices on 1,500 grocery products and pledged more price cuts on essential items in the coming months. Roberts said the retailer was not moving downmarket by closing its fresh food counters and cutting prices, but was making “a direct response to what customers want”.  With more people choosing to pick up their groceries closer to home, Sainsbury’s said it would open up to 20 more convenience shops this year, including larger “neighbourhood hubs” with clothing and Argos pickup points. However, up to 20 large supermarkets and 60 convenience stores, which are now considered to be in the wrong location, such as city centres, could close over the next three years. The cost-cutting plan comes after Sainsbury’s reported a pre-tax loss of £137m in the six months to 19 September, down from a £9m profit in the same period last year, as total sales decreased by 1.4%. Trading was hit by a fall in petrol and clothing sales, which offset an 8.2% increase in sales of groceries and 7.4% rise in general merchandise led by Argos. However, the company said pretax profits for the full year would be up by at least 5% after a stronger-than-expected performance at Argos during lockdown. Sainsbury’s said it would pay out £232m in dividends – almost the same amount as it claimed in business rates relief from the government. The dividend decision – which the supermarket delayed by several months – comes despite similar payouts by Tesco and Morrisons drawing heavy criticism. Roberts said that £160m of the paout related to the previous financial year, before the business rates payments were claimed, and the payment relating to the first half of this year was important as “many small shareholders rely on the dividend”. He added that Sainsbury’s had incurred heavy costs in continuing to “feed the nation” and had not called on furlough payments or other government support measures during the year. Sainsbury’s said it had spent £290m on Covid-related protective measures for staff and customers in the half-year period on top of oneoff costs of £438m related to the closure of Argos stores and other restructuring. Roberts said Sainsbury’s expected to spend more than £460m on extra staff costs and protective wear related to the pandemic for the full year. Shares fell more than 5% to 198p."
"A US property developer that owns studios where films including Gone with the Wind and TV shows such as The Sopranos were filmed is investing £300m to build a Hollywood-style production complex in Dagenham, east London. Hackman Capital Partners, the owner of sites including Culver Studios in Los Angeles and Silvercup Studios in New York, has agreed to invest £300m over the next three years to develop the site with the first productions due to start filming by mid-2022. “Dagenham used to be famous for factories and Fords but in the future we will be equally famous for making films,” said Darren Rodwell, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council. “It’s about bringing in thousands of jobs, providing education and training opportunities for local young people, and giving people hope in these gloomy Covid times.” The council estimates the studio will create 1,200 jobs and contribute £35m a year to the east London economy. The Studios site will include 12 sound stages over 4.5 hectares (11 acres), about two-thirds the size of Pinewood, the home of the Star Warsand James Bond franchises. “This is a very special moment for Dagenham, our capital and all those who have been working hard to realise this bold vision of bringing a new world-class film studio to east London,” said the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. The plan to build a studio in east London has been a challenging venture for the council, which was forced to seek a new investor after its original backer, Pacifica Ventures, pulled out last year citing Brexit uncertainty. While the coronavirus pandemic brought the film and TV production industry to a halt the UK remains a world leading location for Hollywood blockbusters and big budget TV dramas. More than 200 films and 120 high-end TV shows – those costing more than £1m an episode, such as The Crown – were made in the UK last year with a total production spend of £3.1bn. In the last two years, Disney and Netflix have struck long-term deals with Pinewood and sister studio Shepperton Studios to secure production space to ensure an uninterrupted flow of content. Sky and The Fast and the Furious maker Universal Studios, both owned by Comcast, are building a Hollywood-style film studio at Elstree in north London. “Today’s announcement is proof that the private investment climate is resilient,” said Adrian Wootton, the chief executive of Film London and the British Film Commission."
"John Lewis is cutting 1,500 head office jobs as part of efforts to make £300m in annual cost savings and return to profitability. Its finance director, Patrick Lewis, the great grandson of John Lewis’s founder and the only family member still working for the business, is to exit the department store and Waitrose group after 26 years as part of the changes. Lewis will be replaced by Bérangère Michel, the director of customer service. Her duties will switch to Pippa Wicks, the head of the John Lewis department stores, and James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, as the group trims down its executive team. The John Lewis Partnership, which employs 78,000 people, paved the way for further job cuts last month when it said it wanted to save an additional £200m in annual costs. The business, which is owned by its staff who are known as partners, had already announced £100m of savings, to be achieved by making its head office and other operations more efficient over the next two years. The company said the latest cuts would save £50m a year and would involve the loss of jobs in its strategy, commercial development and operations teams. The group said it wanted to create a simpler and more “agile and flexible head office” that was “even closer to customers and frontline partners”. It aims to complete the job reductions by April next year. Sharon White, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said: “Our partnership plan sets a course to create a thriving and sustainable business for the future. To achieve this we must be agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing needs of our customers. “Losing partners is incredibly hard as an employee-owned business. Wherever possible, we will seek to find new roles in the partnership and we’ll provide the best support and retraining opportunities for partners who leave us.” White described Lewis, who she said was leaving to “seek new opportunities”, as “the best of the partnership”. She said: “His determined drive to build the financial strength of the business has granted us the opportunity to emerge stronger from the Covid crisis.” The latest job losses come on top of 1,300 jobs cut when John Lewis closed eight of its 50 department stores this year while it cut one in three senior head office management posts – 75 out of 225 – as part of a reorganisation announced last year. The company said it hoped to find alternative jobs within the business for some and would offer those being made redundant after at least two years’ service a leaving package including up to £3,000 towards retraining."
" The Treasury is aiming to reduce the number of senior City roles held by people from privileged backgrounds, amid fears that those from less affluent families are being left behind. The Treasury and business department are launching an independent taskforce – led by the City of London Corporation – to address a lack of socioeconomic diversity across financial and professional services, including banks, investment funds, accountancy and law firms. Nearly nine in 10 senior roles are held by people from privileged families, according to new research from the City of London Corporation. That is in stark contrast with the wider UK workforce, where employees from higher socioeconomic backgrounds – based on their parents’ occupations – make up a third of the population. The group will start by launching an industry-wide consultation on how companies can be coaxed into boosting socioeconomic diversity, potentially through incentives. They will also create a new membership body that will help companies benchmark their progress and share strategies for tackling their own lack of diversity. Conservative MP and City minister John Glen said its efforts would “help to level up the UK”. The City of London’s research found that just under half of senior City roles were held by white men who attended an independent or selective state school. Meanwhile, staff from lower socioeconomic backgrounds faced greater barriers when they tried to move up the corporate ladder, taking 25% longer to progress despite no evidence of poor performance. Those same workers were also putting their productivity and wellbeing at risk by trying to fit in with the culture of their more privileged peers, the survey found. The City of London Corporation’s policy chair, Catherine McGuinness, who is heading the Treasury taskforce, said the report was a “wake-up call” for the industry, which is still trying to shake its reputation for being an “old boys’ club”. The industry is also coming to terms with a lack of racial diversity, highlighted by the Black Lives Matter movement. “Talented individuals should be able to succeed in financial and professional services on their own merit regardless of socioeconomic background. Unfortunately, for many people that does not yet seem to be a reality,” she said. Sarah Atkinson, chief executive of the Social Mobility Foundation charity, also welcomed the launch. “The plan proposed is broad and ambitious, which it needs to be to reverse the City’s deep-rooted preference for polish over potential – the measure of success will be whether the commitment from government and firms is there to deliver long-term change.” She believes similar efforts should be extended to other sectors – including those that have benefited from the pandemic, such as tech, gaming, and pharmaceuticals. Labour MP and shadow City minister Pat McFadden said: “Anything that can improve social mobility and break down class, gender or racial barriers is to be welcomed. There is still too much of British life where people don’t get a fair chance because of their background. “When that kind of thing happens, it is not only deeply unfair, but also an enormous waste of talent. I hope this taskforce has teeth and follows through so that the senior appointments in companies don’t always go to the same charmed circle of people.”"
"AstraZeneca shares fell after the drugmaker announced efficacy results for its Covid-19 vaccine that were below those reported by rivals Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The shares ended the day 3.8% lower at £80. Results from the phase 3 trial showed the vaccine developed with the University of Oxford can protect 70.4% of people from becoming ill and, in a surprise result, up to 90% if a lower first dose is used. This is lower than the 95% efficacy reported for vaccines developed by the US drugmaker Pfizer and the German biotech BioNTech, and the US biotech Moderna. Analysts said the AstraZeneca/Oxford results left some unanswered questions. Maxim Jacobs, of the investment research firm Edison Group, said: “It’s not normal for there to be lower efficacy for a higher dose, it can happen but it’s rare. There are some potential explanations, such as the vector immune response, but it’s hard to know without more data.” James Bevan, the chief investment officer at the fund manager CCLA, told Sky News the efficacy data had been “rather less than had been anticipated by the market”. AstraZeneca, which is Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical firm, also reiterated that it would not profit from the vaccine during the current pandemic – until at least July – by pricing “at cost”, about $3 (£2.25) to $5 a dose. This is far below Pfizer’s $19.50 and Moderna’s $25 to $37 a dose. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets.com, said: “AstraZeneca shares have had a very good run this year so there is always a bit of ‘sell the news’ to this kind of thing unless it is better than expected.” The shares slipped further after an analyst at the US investment bank SVB Leerink, Geoffrey Porges, cast doubt over whether the vaccine would be licensed in the US. Porges argued that the design of the studies did not meet the norms of the Food and Drug Administration for the representation of minorities, severe cases, previously infected individuals and the elderly.  In response, Ruud Dobber, the head of AstraZeneca’s biopharmaceuticals division, told Bloomberg TV: “In the US, we are running a trial with more than 30,000 participants, so let’s be patient to see how the FDA will react before making such harsh statements.”  Emily Field, the head of European pharmaceutical research at Barclays bank, said with the trial results out of the way, investors could concentrate on AstraZeneca’s strengths such as cancer treatment, via its oncology unit. “This will allow investor focus to return to Astra’s innovative oncology and other programmes and the company continues to offer one of the best earnings growth rates across EU pharma,” she said."
"UK factories could be making up to £4.8bn more goods for British retailers in the next 12 months as the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit prompt businesses to bring home production. The additional orders, largely of food and fashion but potentially including DIY products and homewares, would be equivalent to the country’s entire current clothing manufacturing output, according to a report by advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal and research group Retail Economics. Signs of the trend have already emerged with online fashion site Asos making its new lower-priced AsYou range at approved factories in Leicester, and Ted Baker announcing its Made in Britain range this month. Retail businesses are making changes after the pandemic highlighted structural weaknesses in global supply chains – which can be slow to adapt to sudden increases or drops in demand caused by shock events or rapidly changing consumer tastes. The possibility of a no-deal Brexit – under which tariffs as high as 80% could be introduced on some meat and dairy products, 12% on clothing and 16% on footwear – has also prompted retailers to consider alternative options, according to the report. Consumer and investor demand for more sustainability is also playing a big role in the change as the environmental cost of shipping goods from the far east, with many ending up unwanted, is now being factored in. “Seven in 10 of the retailers surveyed for the report said they had already started changing the way they sourced goods to meet green or ethical targets,” the report said. In Wales, 70 former Laura Ashley sewers have returned to the clothing industry at a new factory in Powys, where ethical supplier Fashion Enter is making clothes for Asos and has just landed a contract with online clothing specialist N Brown, the owner of Simply Be. Jenny Holloway, the chief executive of Fashion Enter which also has a factory in north London, said business was up by more than a third this year. She said retailers were looking for more responsive supply close to home, after the uncertainties of the pandemic highlighted the inflexibility of shipping clothing from Asia. “It’s commercial suicide to back long lead-time stock at the moment. Retailers are getting closer and closer to the season,” she said. “There is no way I would have opened the factory in Wales unless I was certain there’s a long-term trend in coming back to the UK. It’s exciting.” Meanwhile, over-50s fashion brand David Nieper is hiring 30 new dressmakers and investing £4.5m in a textile factory employing a further eight workers in its home town of Alfreton in Derbyshire, where it will print and dye its own fabrics. Christopher Nieper, the chief executive of David Nieper, said: “Manufacturing in Britain makes business accountable and allows control over each step of the production process. “Offshoring manufacturing is essentially offshoring responsibility and indeed pollution. Currently two-thirds of emissions from UK clothing occur overseas. It’s not acceptable to shift the problem to where it’s out of sight and out of mind.” In Kent, fruit and vegetable crisp maker Nim’s Fruit Crisps, has seen business surge 20% this year despite taking a severe knock from the Covid crisis. Nimisha Raja, the chief executive of Nim’s, said the company had been forced to switch to selling dried fruit and vegetables as ingredients for fellow snack makers and dried fruit for pubs, bars and gin fans to use in drinks, after the lunchtime takeaway market was hit by the shift to working from home. The shift by retailers is only part of wider changes in supply chains prompted by Covid and Brexit. Tony Hague, the chief executive of PP Control & Automation, is part of the UK manufacturing Unite group which offers a “dating service” for manufacturers looking to work together to bring production home. Started in response to the Covid ventilator challenge, the group now has 300 members. “It’s not a short term thing,” he said. “It takes a lot of time and effort to move a supply chain back to the UK. You don’t just do it for a few months.”"
"Employees who continue working from home after the pandemic should be taxed for the privilege, with the proceeds used to help lower-paid workers, according to a new report. Economists at Deutsche Bank have proposed making staff pay a 5% tax for each day they choose to work remotely. They argue it would leave the average employee no worse off because of savings made by not commuting and not buying lunch on-the-go and fewer purchases of work clothing. Alternatively, the report suggests the tax could be paid by employers who do not provide their workforce with a permanent desk.  The report from the German lender’s economic research unit has calculated that such a tax could raise $49bn (£37bn) a year in the United States, €20bn (£17.8bn) in Germany and £7bn in the UK. The money could be used to fund subsidies for lower-paid workers who are not able to carry out their jobs from home. “Working from home will be part of the ‘new normal’ well after the pandemic has passed,” said Jim Reid, global head of fundamental credit strategy and thematic research at Deutsche Bank. “Our calculations suggest the amounts raised could fund material income subsidies for low-income earners who are unable to work remotely and thus assume more ‘old economy’ and health risks,” Reid said. Coronavirus has “turbocharged” the popularity of remote working, which was growing rapidly before the pandemic, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Luke Templeman. “For years we have needed a tax on remote workers – Covid has just made it obvious,” Templeman said. “A big chunk of people have disconnected themselves from the face-to-face world yet are still leading a full economic life. That means remote workers are contributing less to the infrastructure of the economy whilst still receiving its benefits. That is a big problem for the economy.” A daily 5% working from home tax would cost an employee earning £35,000 just under £7 a day, according to Templeman’s calculations. He suggests the £6.9bn raised in the UK by taxing remote workers could provide a grant of £2,000 to the 12% of people aged over 25 who earn the minimum wage. Under Deutsche Bank’s proposals, the new tax could also support people who have lost their jobs or been forced to take on lower-paid roles while they retrain."
"My father, Roger Straker, who has died aged 86, was a personnel officer whose negotiating skills bridged many a gap between unions and management in industry and public transport in the 1970s. He was also a lifelong Liberal Democrat. He was born and brought up in Beckenham, Kent, the son of Roland Straker, owner of a printing business, and Constance (nee Hubbard), a music teacher. He attended Dulwich prep school, which was evacuated to Betws-y-Coed, Snowdonia, for three years during the war, and then Kingswood school, Bath. Roger did his national service in Malaysia during the communist insurrection and became an officer, before studying economics at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating in 1958. His interest in politics began at Cambridge, where, as chair of the Liberal Students club, he staged a debate in 1957 at which a motion to decriminalise homosexuality was passed. It took another 10 years before this passed into law. He subsequently stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals in the 1964 general election in Glasgow Pollok, where his 11.5% share of the vote was considered a triumph.  Roger spent his working life in personnel departments where he was often at the forefront of the fraught industrial relations of the era. After graduating from university he spent six years at Hoover in Glasgow, then spent much of the 70s at British Leyland in Cowley. In 1977 he joined the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (responsible for the rail/bus services in the county) as personnel director, before joining London Underground in the same role in 1984. He was at London Underground for eight years, a period that included the King’s Cross fire and subsequent inquiry, as well as periods of industrial action. He was known for his consensual negotiating style, which was helped by the warm personal relations and trust he had established with many of the most powerful union leaders of the time. He abhorred the confrontational industrial relations of the Thatcher era and believed that a constructive relationship was the way forward. After he retired in 1992, Roger’s negotiating skills proved useful when he successfully led the merger of two Methodist circuits in Brighton and Hove. He was active in the church, delivering meals on wheels and supervising construction works. He also served on the Employment Appeal tribunal and was a governor of Seaford college, West Sussex. He greatly enjoyed music, with regular visits to Glyndebourne, travelled extensively, and loved to attend football and cricket matches, while also playing golf regularly. In 1960 he married Ann Lovell. She survives him along with their three children, Carly, Elizabeth and me, nine grandchildren and a great-grandchild."
"Advertisers counting on Christmas TV campaigns to save a year blighted by the pandemic have fuelled a faster-than-expected recovery at ITV, which said ad revenues in the final three months of the year were on track to beat last year’s performance. ITV, whose TV advertising slumped by almost half earlier in the pandemic – the biggest fall in the broadcaster’s history – has bounced back strongly, with TV ad revenues expected to rise 6% year on year in November and to be “slightly up” in the final, so-called golden quarter that businesses bank on for much of their annual sales. Growth in fourth-quarter advertising revenue at ITV would beat expectations in the City, where analysts were previously expecting a fall of about 5%. The final three months of the year usually account for around 30% of ITV’s annual advertising take. As the annual Christmas advertising battle kicks off in earnest this week with the unveiling of the latest John Lewis campaign, brands appear to be betting on the boom in TV viewing in the first wave of the pandemic to continue through the second wave and the festive season. ITV is expecting strong viewing for flagship shows such as I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, which has relocated from its traditional home in Australia to a castle in Wales and premieres on Sunday. “With so many eyes due to be glued to the box over the long winter nights, it bodes well for advertising,” said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Last month a report by the Advertising Association/Warc said advertisers were expected to cut more than £700m from their marketing budgets in the run-up to Christmas this year. However, TV was predicted to be the “least worst” medium, amid a decline across all media including ad spend on Google and Facebook. Spending on broadcasters’ streaming services such as ITV Hub and All4 is expected to rise. ITV’s third-quarter trading update was a mixed bag as ITV Studios, the production arm that makes shows ranging from Coronation Street to Come Dine With Me, continued to struggle to get back on track after the production shutdown during the first lockdown. Carolyn McCall, ITV’s chief executive, said 85% of the 230 productions that were halted were now either back in production or had been delivered. “However, Covid restrictions and further national lockdowns have added production costs and are making it challenging to bring ITV Studios productions back to full capacity,” she said. Revenue a ITV Studios fell by 19% in the quarter. ITV’s total viewing hours haven risen by 2% in the first nine months of the year, thanks to the pandemic, but its share of total TV viewing is down 4%, partly due to a significant increase in the volume of news output by the BBC, which has captured large audiences. On ITV Hub, the broadcaster’s streaming and on-demand service, online viewing hours have fallen by 6% year on year owing to the cancellation of a summer edition of Love Island and the rationing of episodes of soaps such as Coronation Street and Emmerdale. ITV said BritBox, its Netflix-style joint venture with the BBC, was on track to hit internal subscriber targets after the successful launch of Spitting Image, the streaming service’s first original commission. “The pandemic has put ITV between a rock and hard place,” said Streeter. “Demand for new content is soaring and more viewers are switching back on their TVs to watch programmes live, bucking the trend of a drift toward on-demand. But its production arm, ITV Studios, can’t make shows fast enough to satisfy their need, with lockdown 2 delaying filming even further, adding to costs.”"
"Burberry has warned that the government’s plan to scrap tax-free shopping will rob the British luxury brand of its “home market advantage” on the eve of Brexit, as wealthy international tourists opt to holiday in mainland Europe instead. Julie Brown, the chief operating officer of Burberry, said foreign tourists, who traditionally accounted more than half of its UK sales, could “turn to buying in Europe … This represents a challenge as we could lose our home market advantage competing against brands in Paris and Milan,” she said. The Treasury’s decision to end tax-free shopping on 31 December has caused a storm in retail and tourism circles. It wants to use the end of the Brexit transition period to bring personal duty and tax systems in line with international norms. Millions of wealthy tourists from China and the Middle East come to Britain each year, spending nearly £18bn on shopping trips, hotels and days out. The current retail scheme hands these non-EU visitors a significant perk as they can reclaim the 20% VAT paid on purchases such as clothes, handbags and jewellery. The removal of VAT reduces the purchase price by a sixth, a discount that is particularly significant to luxury brands and department stores such as Selfridges and Harrods, which sell designer clothing and accessories. Burberry’s popular Lola bag, for example, starts at £790, with eligible travellers able to recoup nearly £132. A recent report by the Centre for Economics Research suggested that withdrawing the scheme would result in a 7% drop in the number of non-EU visitors, the equivalent of 1.2 million people, and up to 41,000 job losses. Heathrow airport is seeking to overturn the decision through a judicial review.  Brown’s comments came as Burberry updated investors on a difficult six months when the pandemic wiped 31% off sales and profits fell 62% to £73m. The coronavirus crisis, coupled with the tax-free shopping issue and Brexit, meant the business faced “three layers of challenge on top of each other”, she said. Over the past three years Burberry has been revamped by its Italian chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, who wants it to become a super-luxe brand, in the same league as Gucci and Dior, which both have higher prices and profit margins. In 2018, the label, previously best known for its trenchcoats and signature check, replaced its longstanding creative chief, Christopher Bailey, with Riccardo Tisci. The collections created by the former Givenchy designer, which include bomber jackets and bumbags emblazoned with a new logo comprised of interlocking Ts and Bs (the initials of the company’s founder Thomas Burberry), have been well-received and credited with attracting younger shoppers. Brown said there was a growing buzz around the brand in many countries. It has recently partnered with footballer Marcus Rashford, who is featuring in ad campaigns in return for Burberry supporting his high profile campaign to help underprivileged children. Sales were down just 6% in the second quarter compared with a 45% slump in the first and were back to growth in October before the second wave of lockdowns which has forced the temporary closure of one in 10 of its stores. Burberry shares closed down 2% on Thursday at £15.91. In January this year they were changing hands at a near record £23.30."
"Commercial passenger flights have resumed on Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft for the first time in 20 months, after Brazilian airline Gol resumed operations using the plane. The aircraft was grounded globally in March 2019 after two fatal plane crashes in the space of six months, which killed a total of 346 people. The American company’s previously bestselling aeroplane was given approval to return to the skies by US regulators in November. Gol, Brazil’s largest domestic airline, had previously announced it would reintroduce the 737 Max on routes to and from the company’s hub in São Paulo. The aircraft completed a 864km flight (537 miles) from São Paulo to Porto Alegre on Wednesday, with a journey time of one hour and 16 minutes, according to website Flightradar24.com, which tracks global flight data. Gol declined to comment on how many passengers were on board the first 737 Max commercial passenger flight in nearly two years. All 189 passengers and crew on board Lion Air Flight 610 died in October 2018 when the plane crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. Less than five months later, in March 2019, all 157 people on board Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 died when it crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa, triggering a global grounding of the 737 Max fleet. Faulty sensors and a design flaw that repeatedly pushed down the nose of the aircraft were blamed for the two incidents. Following months of safety assessments, a design upgrade, and test flights, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted restrictions on the 737 Max last month, followed by other regulators, including in Europe and Brazil. Gol’s flight is a critical milestone for Boeing, which has been burning through cash and cut 30,000 jobs in recent months as it faced the twin challenges of the shutdown of global aviation during the coronavirus pandemic, and the grounding of the 737 Max which amounted to more than $20bn (£15bn) in direct costs. Gol has seven 737 Max aircraft in its fleet, and a further 95 on order with Boeing. The airline’s chief executive, Paulo Kakinoff, welcomed the return of the aircraft earlier in December. “The Max is one of the most efficient aircraft in aviation history and the only one to undergo a complete recertification process, ensuring the highest levels of safety and reliability,” Kakinoff said. However, the airline will allow customers who do not wish to fly on a 737 Max to exchange their ticket. American Airlines is expected to be the next operator to restart flights with the aircraft on 29 December. Ryanair, Europe’s biggest short-haul airline, has ordered a total of 210 of the aircraft that its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has described as a “gamechanger” for the carrier’s business model due to its fuel efficiency."
"The billionaire boss of Glencore is to step down from the commodity trading firm next year, in a shift away from the management team that crystallised colossal fortunes during the company’s 2011 flotation. Ivan Glasenberg, 63, who has been chief executive for 18 years, is to be replaced next year by Gary Nagle, the 45-year-old head of the firm’s coal assets, marking a shift to a younger generation of executives at the business. The departing boss burst on to the City’s radar nine years ago as his company’s flotation revealed his paper fortune of nearly £6bn – a figure so large that his 3,600 neighbours in the Swiss village of Rüschlikon got a tax cut. Glasenberg’s close lieutenants, Daniel Maté, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard, all owned stakes worth about £2bn at that time – but, aside from Glasenberg, only Peterson remains on Glencore’s executive management team and investors have long been expecting a succession plan. Glencore was founded in 1974 by the controversial metals trader Marc Rich but, in 1983, he was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as “the biggest tax evasion case in United States history”. Rich was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on “trading with the enemy”. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBI’s most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001. By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993 that included Glasenberg. Glencore’s chairman, Tony Hayward, said: “The board has worked with Ivan over the past two years to oversee a seamless transition to the next generation of leadership across Glencore’s business.” Nagle, a 45-year-old South African, takes over a company facing pressure from investors to cut carbon emissions. “We have decided that over the next six months I will be working closely with Gary Nagle who will be taking over from me,” Glasenberg said. “Gary started with me in the coal division 21 years ago.” Glasenberg is likely to be remembered in the City for presiding over a company whose share price stubbornly refused to rise above its float price, which massively affected his paper fortune. Glencore has also attracted the attention of the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, which launched an investigation into suspicions of bribery at the mining and commodity trading group a year ago. Glencore said at the time it would cooperate with the investigation."
"Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group is in talks to buy Debenhams out of administration, raising hopes of a last-ditch rescue for the 240-year-old UK department store chain. Without a buyer, Debenhams would be wound down after Christmas, with the loss of up to 12,000 jobs and closure of 124 stores by the end of March. Liquidators moved in last week to start clearing stock after a potential rescue deal with JD Sports collapsed. Administrators have been trying to find a buyer for Debenhams since the summer. In a brief statement, Frasers, formerly known as Sports Direct, confirmed that “it is in negotiations with the administrators of Debenhams’ UK business regarding a potential rescue transaction for Debenhams’ UK operations”. It added: “While Frasers Group hopes that a rescue package can be put in place and jobs saved, time is short and the position is further complicated by the recent administration of the Arcadia Group, Debenhams’ biggest concession holder. There is no certainty that any transaction will take place, particularly if discussions cannot be concluded swiftly.” Frasers also said, according to an emailed statement seen by Bloomberg: “We hope to be able to save as many jobs as possible.” Debenhams rents all its 124 stores, and if a deal is completed, Frasers could operate them on a 12-month licence while working out how many outlets could be saved, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed source. The liquidation of Debenhams was announced a day after Philip Green’s Arcadia group, the owner of brands including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Wallis, called in administrators, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Ashley, a retail tycoon who made his fortune with Sports Direct, has long had his eyes on Debenhams. He previously built up a near-30% stake in the business, which was wiped out last year when lenders took control of it. Frasers also owns House of Fraser, another department store chain, which it bought out of administration. Adding to the high street’s woes, the fashion chain Ted Baker reported widening first-half losses and said it had laid off 953 people after Covid-19 lockdowns and other restrictions. Its pretax loss ballooned to £86.4m in the 28 weeks to 8 August, from £23m a year earlier. Revenues almost halved to £169.5m. As the UK and EU remain stuck in Brexit negotiations, David Wolffe, Ted Baker’s chief financial officer, warned of the impact of a no-deal Brexit. “There is material risk to our future profit if the UK is not successful in signing new trade agreements with the EU and other markets in which we operate,” he said. In the worst-case scenario, profits would be £16.1m lower if no trade deals are struck, he added."
"It is in the nature of stories about the hospitality industry that they come with a selection of ready-made metaphors. And so it is that the newly introduced tier regulations for the hospitality sector can variously be described as a collapsed soufflé, a split sauce or, perhaps most appropriately, a complete dog’s dinner. Last weekend, partly to mollify its own rebellious MPs, the government released the evidence used to justify those restrictions: the closure of all pubs and restaurants in tier three areas, and the rule that venues in tier two could only serve alcohol alongside a “substantial meal”, forcing all those pubs with no food offering to close. It was a thin document, referencing the obvious fact that without social distancing, pubs and restaurants are crowded places where virus transmission is likely. It pointed to super-spreader events in South Korean and Japanese bars and clubs. However, it contained nothing on transmission rates in venues using rigorous infection control measures of the sort introduced in the UK since July. It certainly didn’t mention the one study, by an economist at Warwick University, which did suggest a link between rising infection rates and the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme throughout August. Then again, it’s a peculiar piece of work. It claims only a correlation – not a causal link – between rainy days when fewer people might have been expected to eat out and lower infection rates. It’s also contradicted by a survey from UKHospitality, the industry’s trade body, which reported tiny numbers of infections among restaurant staff and customers. Flawed though the government evidence may have been, it did give the industry something tangible with which to argue. Social media thrummed with chefs and restaurateurs insisting their businesses were Covid-safe. But those forensic arguments were quickly pushed to the margins when, urged on by journalists looking for a little light relief, the exchanges degenerated into a jolly story about what actually constituted a substantial meal. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove proposed a scotch egg. Doubtless he thought it was a brilliant choice, establishing his “man of the people” credentials. Or perhaps not. Invention of the scotch egg is claimed by upmarket store Fortnum & Mason as a Georgian grab-and-go food item for aristocrats travelling from London along the Great West Road to their country seats. The perfect choice, then, for a government headed by an old Etonian. “It was annoying,” says chef Tom Kerridge, who owns a number of pubs and has recently fronted a BBC documentary series about the challenges faced by the sector during the pandemic. “You had Michael Gove laughing and joking about it, which showed a complete lack of respect for an industry that employs three million people. It’s not a laughing matter.” Kerridge describes the government’s late offer of £1,000 for each of those pubs that cannot open at all as “embarrassing and condescending”. The new rules have also shone a light on just how class-riven our approach to the business of eating and drinking outside the home continues to be. In effect, they said that if you were sufficiently bourgeois enough to want to eat something, you could get as bladdered as you fancied. But if you were some oik who merely wanted to go to the pub for a pint, you could forget about it. As Kerridge puts it: “The people who make these rules live in nice houses with big gardens. Wet-led pubs [with no food offering] are the only space many people have to get out of cramped accommodation.” Intriguingly, early last week the phrase “substantial meal” was quietly dropped from the guidance, after it transpired it was defined by legal precedent. According to Law Gazette, judges in a 1965 case found that accompanying sandwiches were substantial enough to permit two men to carry on boozing in a hotel under a “supper time extension”. The phrase has thus been replaced with “a table meal”, meaning a “meal eaten by a person at a table”. But not, apparently if that table is in a pub and you only have a pint. But in a theatre, where the nice people that you can trust go, it’s absolutely fine. The hospitality industry did welcome the introduction of an extra hour to the curfew in which to eat up after last service at 10pm, but otherwise the mood was one of bitterness. “The rules feel arbitrary and unfair,” one leading restaurateur said to me, “particularly when so many businesses are struggling to survive.” The restrictions also demand that people only eat with members of their own household. “If you are fighting for survival and think the rules are unfair are you going to abide by them or are you going to squint at them and conclude it’s not your job to police it?” It’s a fair question. Policing of Covid-19 regulations has to be by consent. And yet these rules covering the hospitality sector have been so poorly written that such consent has been tested. We have been treated to the bizarre spectacle of police officers wandering around pubs inspecting what’s being served, and reaching a judgment as to whether a piece of pizza, a pastie or, yes, a scotch egg, counts as dinner or not, like they’re your mum. It’s confusing to diners, it’s a waste of police time and most of all it’s grossly unfair to a hospitality sector which has rolled with every punch this pandemic has thrown at it."
"Dirty loos and scathing reviews by guests have led Britannia hotels to be named as Britain’s worst hotel chain for the eighth year running. Described by one guest as a “filthy hovel” and another as “by far the dirtiest hotel room I have ever stayed in”, Britannia props up the table in Which?’s rankings of the best and worst large UK hotel chains. The consumer group said Britannia, which has 62 hotels across the country, had received a customer score of 37%, with the lack of cleaning a particular concern. One of the most scathing reviews was so bad it was “unprintable”, it said. When Which? visited the Britannia’s Grand Burstin hotel in Folkestone, researchers found stray hairs, stained towels, and surfaces that had not been thoroughly cleaned between stays. At the chain’s Brighton hotel, the Royal Albion, Which? conducted swab tests that revealed traces of enterococci bacteria on the toilet seat and bathroom door handle. In response Britannia said: “We are totally committed to providing a safe environment for visitors. We have so far spent around £2m on Covid-19 precautions, but we accept there is more to do.” Which? asked more than 4,000 people to rate their experiences at UK hotels on a range of criteria, including bedrooms, bathrooms, cleanliness, customer service and value for money. Premier Inn was named as the best budget chain. It was second in the table with a score of 82%, and only bettered by the luxury brand Sofitel, which offers rooms at an average of £148 a night, compared with Premier Inn’s more wallet-friendly £60. Holiday Inn Express and Hampton by Hilton were also named as “recommended providers”. Warner Leisure and Hotel Du Vin were named as to the top two small and medium hotel chains. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: “It appears that not even a global pandemic could force Britannia to clean up its act. At best, it’s drab and dated, and at worst it’s downright filthy – and after eight years at the bottom of our survey, our message is loud and clear: avoid these hotels. “While Premier Inn remains a firm favourite, it’s clear that this year, UK hotels have become more than just a place to lay your head, but a destination in themselves. With fewer of us travelling abroad this year, our survey shows that when it comes to holidaying at home, we’re quite happy to pay more for a little luxury.”"
"The collapse of three major chains last week has put 30,000 retail jobs at risk and triggered fears for the future of town centres. But the picture isn’t all bleak, according to experts including the former government retail tsar, Mary Portas, who says there is too much nostalgia and too little optimism about the future of the British high street. “The days of stacking stuff high and selling it fast are completely and utterly over,” says Portas, who has worked in retail for more than 40 years. “The brands that dominated did that for years and they failed to offer anything beyond mediocrity. Does anyone really miss BHS? Does anyone care about Dorothy Perkins?” On a damp Thursday afternoon in Oxford Circus, shoppers are notably thin on the ground. By Topshop’s entrance, the store DJ desperately mans the decks to meet the brief of creating “a party atmosphere” for customers. A few doors down at Debenhams, shoppers take advantage of sales across all seven floors of the flagship store. Both went into administration last week. “We’re looking at a whole new generation who aren’t going to prop up the likes of Philip Green any more,” says Portas. “They’re not supporting businesses who don’t prioritise people or the planet. We’re moving away from that: there is a new value system at play.” Were it not for the potential job losses, she would be singing good riddance to the dinosaurs of retail. Portas is focused on what she has dubbed “the kindness economy”, wherein she forecasts growth for high streets with an overarching philosophy that involves some kind of contribution to making life better. But what will this translate to? Far fewer shops selling actual goods apparently, and a far stronger focus on the experiential side of things – a catch-all that takes in everything from escape rooms and nail salons, to restaurants and street performers. In town, bricks-and-mortar stores are expected to survive if they’re able to provide something beyond the purely transactional – excellent service that can’t be replicated online, expert knowledge, or a space where people like to get together. Community hubs are frequently mentioned, while brands such as Patagonia, Glossier and Nike are cited as role models for bigger retailers. Research routinely shows that sustainability, innovation and standing for something aren’t just buzzwords for marketers, but the keys to building brand loyalty among younger customers who demand that the companies they buy from show social responsibility. This trickles down to what sticks on high streets, where the most successful will offer a mix of retail, entertainment, culture and wellbeing. From Stoke Newington to Stoke-on-Trent, pop-ups and local boutique businesses are also expected to thrive in high streets with strong local communities. That American Express and Google have both launched campaigns urging customers to shop local and support small businesses underlines where experts predict the future is headed. “Covid-19 has crystallised a social and economic movement that has been bubbling under this past decade,” says Portas. “We’ve seen mass introspection and a re-examination of how we live and want to live. Globally, 77% of people now say they value decency in business as much as price and convenience. Deeper, meaningful connections with where you live will become far more important than a day trip to an out-of-town shopping centre or retail park.” In Reading town centre, retail expert Mark Pilkington surveys Broad Street, a pedestrianised thoroughfare anchored by John Lewis. “This isn’t bad as modern high streets go: there aren’t too many boarded windows and there’s a strong mix of services – nail bars, phone repair shops and so on. It’s a common mid-market offering.” For retail to survive here, however, he predicts shops will become windows to inventory held online. “It’s pointless to use a store as a glorified warehouses full of stuff when stock can be seen and sold online. The shop floor will shrink and it will be about engaging customers in a way that they can’t experience from their screens,” says Pilkington. While much of this focus seems bent on serving the habits of millennials, generation Z and younger, Pilkington and Portas argue that the overall restructure of the high street will benefit everyone. “Injecting more theatre and excitement into traditional high streets increases their appeal to customers across the board. If you don’t want town centres where skinheads are mugging grannies, you have to make them an attractive place to hang out.” This year, the government created a £95m fund to revive “historic high streets” across England. The scheme, which is being run by Historic England, identified 68 high streets that would be revitalised by the cash injection, but it focuses only on those in conservation areas. The modern-day, identikit every-town high streets blighted by boarded windows, betting shops and rundown discount outlets are also in need of attention. If Pilkington were running a more down-at-heel high street, he would “beautify it with some sculptures and flowers. Have stores that add services or an experience – an alterations service, or repairing electronics. They will be of real value to that community, and you can’t replicate that online.” High streets are also expected to become more residential: under new rules that came into effect in September, it is now possible to convert commercial properties – including vacant shops – into homes without planning permission. The hope is that a high street revival could be ignited by allowing commercial properties to be quickly repurposed. The relationship between businesses and landlords is also expected to change, with rental systems becoming more flexible. In the short term, a number of retailers including All Saints and New Look, are renegotiating their lease terms to push for “turnover-based rents” to reflect the takings of individual stores. In the long-term, Pilkington says, landlords “must come to the party” if they’re serious about saving the high street. “Leases are too long, too unyielding. Landlords need to be far more innovative and nimble and offer a space that a new business can take on and transform the look of through technology,” says Pilkington. Instead of six months of fitting a store, this way a business would “plug and play”, so that a space could be a pop-up for a well-known brand one day and a yoga studio the next. In his book Retail Therapy: Why the Retail Industry is Broken and What Can Be Done To Fix It, Pilkington argued that the excessive level of business rates was a principal cause of the high street’s long decline. For its post-Covid future, he considers an online tax essential to reform retail. “If local authorities really wanted to save high streets, they would make parking free and readily available. And if government cared about saving retailers, they would impose an internet tax. Amazon pays virtually no business rates.” Portas, who was appointed by David Cameron to lead a review into the future of British high streets in 2011, believes the Conservatives have systematically failed to understand how business has changed. “They need to wake up. It’s shameful that they have still not readjusted their thinking on how Amazon and the delivery giants should be paying equivalent rates of tax online. It’s shameful they’re not doing anything about it. Their slowness in understanding, their tardiness, is ridiculous. “You have these delivery giants clogging up the roads, massively increasing CO2 emissions, increasing packaging, and they contribute so little. Nobody’s actually looked at the implications of what we buy, when we buy, and the effect that it has on the way we live.”"
"The insurance industry is considering launching a second test case to try to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars to businesses forced to shut because of the coronavirus pandemic. Insurers lost a test case on Wednesday in which the industry tried to knock out every claim for business interruption insurance lodged due to Covid-19. Lawyers for businesses said insurers had advised customers that losses from the virus could not be claimed as the disease was a quarantinable one, under the Quarantine Act of 1908. However, the act was repealed in 2015 and the court said the carve-out did not apply to a similar clause in the law that replaced it, the Biosecurity Act. The Insurance Council of Australia, which funded the original action, said it was considering funding a second case that would focus on different issues. Such a case would test how many cases would be needed, and how close to a business, to count as an outbreak of an infectious disease and result in a payout. It would also test whether government closure orders amount to “prevention of access” to business premises, which also triggers a payout. The UK insurance industry recently lost a case brought by the Financial Conduct Authority dealing with similar issues, although there are differences between British and Australian law. Separately, the ICA is also considering asking the high court to allow an appeal against the result of the first test case. “The industry seeks to progress a court resolution of these matters quickly, and regardless of any decision around an appeal on the first test case,” it said. There are hundreds of thousands of business interruption insurance policies in force in Australia. The total size of potential claims is difficult to estimate but industry sources say a figure in the many hundreds of millions of dollars is conservative. Big insurer IAG said on Wednesday that it might need to raise additional money from the stock market to meet the cost of claims. QBE, which also offers business interruption insurance, said its policies required a number of triggers to be met for customers to claim. QBE said these claims in Australia were likely to be limited to $5m a claim. Suncorp said the court decision did not mean Covid-19 claims would be automatically covered for policies mentioning the Quarantine Act. Customers’ individual circumstances needed to be considered, it said. Shine Lawyers commercial disputes practice leader Michael Lalji was not involved in the case but gave a different view. “I expect this decision will open the floodgates to a lot of claims and cost insurers a lot of money,” he said."
" Chow Khai Shien died three days before the Melbourne lockdown lifted, holding someone else’s food. He had been in Australia for five years, having arrived from Malaysia at the age of 31. First he was a student, then a chef, working part-time in a restaurant inside a casino. When the pandemic descended, like many other people around the world, he turned to food delivery – ferrying burgers and chips, burritos, and pizzas, across the city on a small motorised scooter. The car hit him on the corner of King and La Trobe streets at 7pm on a Saturday night. Chow was on a delivery when he died, which meant someone was expecting him. But for two and a half days, his death did not register in Australia. The police did not know who he was. The news release that went out on the Monday called him a “yet to be identified” man. DoorDash, the company he was delivering for, did not say anything until Tuesday, and only after a reporter working for Chinese-language media identified him on the morning of 27 October. His sister in Singapore initially thought he had just lost his phone and would reply soon. But over 26 hours, she realised, with a slow sinking of her heart, that he would not. Two weeks earlier in Sydney, Dede Fredy, a 36-year-old Uber Eats rider from Indonesia, and Xiaojun Chen, a 43-year-old from China, died in separate road collisions. Fredy was hit on Sydenham Road, and witnesses saw food strewn across the intersection. Chen was hit by a bus in Zetland. Chen worked for Hungry Panda, a UK-based company that targets the Chinese community in various countries (Australia, the UK, the US, New Zealand, but not China). Fredy left behind a wife and young son, Chen had a wife and two children, aged eight and 15. Chow, who was 36, had no children, but left behind two siblings and his mother. Chen and his widow, Lihong Wei, are from a rural area of Shaanxi province in China. The pair lived in a small village, and had been married since 2002. Before he came to Australia in 2018, he worked in construction, and she worked in a clothing factory. In China, Chen was making the equivalent of A$16,000 a year, Wei says. By delivering food in Australia, he made much more, and he sent it all back. On an afternoon in early November, Wei is in Sydney for the first time in her life, for her husband’s funeral. From a small serviced apartment in Chatswood, in the city’s north, she can see streets lined with restaurants. But for the past three weeks, she says, she has been eating instant noodles, because the food in Australia is too expensive.  The only decoration in her room is a picture of Chen, framed in black. She speaks flatly, says “thank you” a lot, and pauses to cry frequently. The local primary school is across the road, and on a sunny Friday, the noise floats up of the children on their way to swimming. “I find Sydney is very beautiful,” she says in Mandarin. “It’s so nice. But at the same time, I can’t stop thinking about my husband dying here. I feel very, very sad. “When he first decided to come to Australia, my mother and I were against it. But he said he is approaching 40, and he doesn’t want his children to have the same tough life as we did. And he also was thinking about his own parents, he wanted to have a chance to give them a better life.” Wei went to the room where he lived, a small space in a suburb she doesn’t know the name of. “I felt it was very, very painful,” she says. “Because when he left China, we went shopping together. Now, all the things are still in his room. Just he was no longer there.” She was flown to Australia by Hungry Panda, who also paid for the accommodation, and for that she is grateful. She is here to pick up his ashes, and take them back to China. In October, an Australian, Ashlee Green, who lived near where Chen died, started a GoFundMe for the family, raising $40,000. Wei met Green, and was full of praise for her and for Australians generally. “I find the Australian people are very nice,” she says. “They all are willing to help me.” The money will help Wei look after her elderly parents, and Chen’s father. Wei says Chen was closer to her mother (his mother-in-law), than he was to his own. At the time, the family had not told his father that his son was dead. Both Chen and Wei are descended from a long line of labourers, who lost the use of their bodies through work. All their parents have acquired disabilities. They broke their legs in the fields and on the farm. When their parents worked in the fields, Wei says, they would have to carry heavy buckets of water, back and forth. Sometimes they fell. Her husband left to make a better life. They knew the risks of food delivery, but Wei says Chen was more confident about delivering in Australia. He told her construction work at home was riskier. He described Australia as a country with a good legal system, a “rule of law country”. “He was so hopeful,” Wei says. “He believed Australia was an advanced country. It was a rule of law country, as long as he worked hard here he can have a better life.” On 16 November, the day after Wei flew out of Sydney, Hungry Panda was due to appear before a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry into the gig economy and the future of work. It would have been Hungry Panda’s first public statement since Chen died. Fifteen minutes after they were scheduled to arrive, the chair of the inquiry, Daniel Mookhey, had to announce that the company had not shown up. “Hungry Panda has failed to attend and not given any explanation,” he said. More than an hour later, its delivery manager, Luna Wei, sent an email of apology. “I’m really sorry that I didn’t attend this important meeting on time today,” she wrote. “Recently, I have been busy with the safety education of riders. Today, some riders came to the company without an appointment to discuss some delivery problems with me, which caused me to fail to arrive at the meeting site on time.” Chow Khai Shien’s uncle died in a motorbike accident. Chow’s sister, Chow Khai Sing, says their mother told him not to work in food delivery. She would have not let him, if he had been in Malaysia, Chow Khai Sing said. But he was always an independent child – a classic older brother. He stopped taking pocket money at 16. He started working part-time. He still sent money home, but he loved Melbourne, his sister says, because of the freedom he got from living alone, in a different country. And, he said, Australia’s roads were safer than Malaysia’s. “Sometimes I would tell him, ‘Hey don’t make mum worry, just come home. You have a place to stay’,” Chow Khai Sing says from Singapore, where she now lives. When the pandemic hit, Chow’s mother begged him to come home. Chow Khai Sing told him there was a food cart near her house that was up for lease. “I told him maybe ‘You can become a chef here, I can became the owner of the restaurant’,” she says. “He told us ‘Yeah, yeah, we can plan it when I go back.” Chow told his family he would come back in January, when flights became cheaper. Until then, he would stay in Melbourne to make a bit more money. It is not lost on Chow Khai Sing that her brother was on a delivery when he died, yet she did not find out from the food company. “They probably just received a complaint from a customer,” she says. “‘Hey, my food rider hasn’t arrived’. And you can imagine a food rider is very conscious for their stars, they all want that five stars, they want to get extra rewards, when they can deliver faster or pick up more. That is also a sad part. When they are rushing now, to pick up the food, accidents happen.” A DoorDash spokeswoman declined to say when the company found out that Chow had died, or whether anyone investigated why he failed to deliver on the night he died. A survey conducted by the Transport Workers Union in September found food deliverers earned an average of just $10.42 per hour after costs – 73% said they were worried about being “seriously hurt or killed” at work. Some workersin Australia are entitled to compensation for their families if they die in the workplace, or as a result of a work-related injury. In NSW, their dependants are entitled to a lump sum payment of $834,200 and weekly payments of $149.30 for each dependent child until they turn 16. In Victoria, those who qualify are entitled to $636,470, and a dependent partner may receive a weekly pension for three years.  Employees are, by and large, covered by these schemes. But under Australian labour law, all three men were classed as independent contractors. Their eligibility for these schemes varies, and it can change from person to person, contract to contract. The amount their families are guaranteed to receive depends on the individual insurance – if any – that the delivery companies provide for them. For example, UberEats’ insurance policy gives dependants a maximum of a $400,000 lump sum, and potentially $5,000 for each spouse or dependant. Both Wei and Chow Khai Sing are still unclear how much money they will receive from Hungry Panda and DoorDash respectively. Chow says they have been offered “much less” than $100,000. DoorDash has declined to say how much compensation would be paid to Chow’s family. Food delivery is a global business model, thought up in Silicon Valley and now successfully exported around the world.  In California in November, voters narrowly voted in favour of Proposition 22. The state had been one of the few in the world to expressly legislate to give gig workers the same rights as employees. But the ballot measure, written by Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart, and backed by millions of dollars in campaigning, overturned the law. Michael Kaine, the national secretary of the TWU, says California’s example should be avoided in Australia. Instead, he proposes a more “flexible” independent tribunal system that can listen to evidence from riders and make orders granting extra benefits. “Our warning is that regulation must be flexible enough to give workers the rights they need without lighting up a pathway for cashed-up tech giants to again restructure their businesses to get around these rights,” he says. “California’s example should be a warning to Australia to not go down the path of giving rights based on whether a rider qualifies as an employee or not.” The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, says the individual companies should be encouraged to offer better insurance, safety training and compensation for their workers. “There are potential commercial advantages for companies that go the extra step to look after their workforce, whether they are employees or contractors,” he says. “As with any other employer, those with the best reputation and policies that benefit workers will be more sought after as the workplace of choice.” But four riders told the NSW parliament their pay had actually been cut during the pandemic. Diego Franco said the widespread job losses during the pandemic meant there were more riders. “It is what they [the companies] want,” Franco said. “They have high demand for the orders because customers are just at home, and they have many people willing to work on these jobs because they have no other options. “What do they do? They make more money, and they pay less for us, because there are too many people willing to work.” With additional reporting by Ai Ling Zhou"
"EasyJet has slumped to a £1.3bn full-year loss, the first in its 25-year history, but said bookings had been boosted by positive news on Covid-19 vaccines. Johan Lundgren, the airline’s chief executive, said sales had surged by 50% last week, compared with the prior week, after the US drugmaker Pfizer and the German biotech firm BioNTech announced their coronavirus vaccine. The airline has cut back to around 20% of its planned winter schedule after further travel restrictions were imposed by the UK government and other countries this month. However, Lundgren said: “We know when the recovery comes it will be strong. The longer travel restrictions are in place, it actually increases pent-up demand.” Airline stocks rose sharply last week on news of the Pfizer vaccine, which was followed by a second from Moderna, raising hopes that more than 1 billion people could be immunised against coronavirus in 2021. Lundgren has written to Boris Johnson to offer the airline’s support – using its fleet and up to 4,000 crew – for the rollout of vaccines. “Momentum has continued this week, as people have more confidence making travel plans going forward,” Lundgren said. “Clearly the news about the vaccine is good news but the industry is still very much in difficulty.” However, he said that easyJet was well positioned for next summer. Holiday bookings for summer 2021 are significantly ahead of those at the same point in previous years, easyJet said – if largely boosted by the many customers who had rebooked using vouchers from cancelled flights in 2020.  “We know that people will gravitate towards brands that they trust and towards value – all those are in the middle of easyJet’s strengths,” he said. The short-haul and leisure routes that make up the airline’s network are widely expected to recover more quickly than long-haul and business trips, Lundgren said, with pent-up demand evidenced in the response to the UK lifting quarantine for the Canary Islands in late October, when sales jumped 900% over the following five days and easyJet added 180,000 seats. EasyJet will be opening seasonal bases in Málaga and Faro next summer, although Lundgren said he did not share rival Ryanair’s view that travel would bounce back to pre-pandemic levels before 2023. Airlines are pinning hopes on a swifter restart, before a vaccine, on possible airport testing, which could also cut the current UK quarantine period. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said that a “test-and-release system” should be in place by 1 December, potentially cutting the current 14-day quarantine period down to less than a week. Lundgren said it remained “a big obstacle”, adding: “If you can get that down to five days that would make a big, big difference.” EasyJet tumbled deep into the red with a pretax loss of £1.27bn in the year to 30 September against a profit of £430m the year before. This includes a £311m charge related to fuel and other items as a result of the sharp drop in flying and a £123m bill for redundancy costs. The airline flew 48.1 million passengers in the year, about half the previous year’s number, which meant revenues more than halved to £3bn. EasyJet has raised £3.1bn in cash since April through measures such as the sale and leaseback of 53 aircraft, and delaying the delivery of 24 new planes. It is also cutting staff numbers by up to 30%, resulting in 4,500 redundancies. EasyJet has closed its bases in Southend, Stansted and Newcastle, although it still uses Stansted and Newcastle for inbound flights. It has been criticised for pushing flight vouchers over cash refunds for cancelled flights, but Lundgren said the airline had paid out £863m in refunds up until 30 September, and customers were now repaid on average within 25 days. The airline’s founder and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, hit out again at the board over its contract to buy more Airbus planes, despite much of the order having been deferred. Ioannou said they were delivering an “absurdly upbeat message” with “shareholders’ money flushed down the toilet”, adding: “Why does anyone want to buy more aircraft when 80% of the fleet is grounded as we speak?” However, Lundgren said: “We have probably the most flexibility of any European airline regarding our fleet – we have the ability to scale down but also to scale up if the demand is there.” The airline said it is contractually tied to a fleet of between 302 and 322 planes by September 2021, down from 342 now."
"Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia fashion group is in talks with potential lenders over a loan worth tens of millions of pounds as it seeks to recover from the blow of England’s second coronavirus lockdown. Arcadia, the parent company of brands including Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, could look to borrow as much as £30m to help it plug the gap from lost sales. The company has sought talks with multiple potential lenders, Sky News first reported. The latest English lockdown came at a perilous moment for many retailers, who were preparing for the Christmas rush and hoping to salvage the year following months of enforced closure. Instead, shops selling “non-essential” goods have been closed since 5 November and will not be able to reopen their doors until at least 2 December, with the threat of further extensions if infection numbers do not diminish. Arcadia’s brands operate about 500 sites across the UK, employing 15,000 staff. However, all of its staff in stores in England have been put on the government’s extended coronavirus job retention scheme, which covers 80% of furloughed workers’ wages up to £2,500 a month. Arcadia had struggled even before the second lockdown was announced. In July, it announced 500 job losses at its head office as it tried to cut costs. Early in the crisis it asked landlords for rent cuts and temporarily paused payments into its pension scheme. The financial difficulties have prompted management to look at a number of options for the business. These included work by advisers at Deloitte on potentially placing the company into administration to protect the company’s assets while directors attempted to sell its brands, the Sunday Times reported. An effort to sell assets would represent Arcadia’s second restructuring in two years, after the company narrowly staved off administration in June 2019 through an agreement with creditors that involved 1,000 job losses and 50 store closures. It could also mean the end of a retail empire built by Green, who was once hailed by prime ministers as one of the UK’s most successful businessmen. However, Green’s reputation was dealt a blow after intense criticism of his £1 sale of the doomed BHS to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience. Chappell was this month sentenced to six years in prison for evading tax on income he received from the company. Any restructuring arrangements would also be closely scrutinised by the Pensions Regulator. Independent pensions expert John Ralfe previously calculated that the Arcadia pension scheme’s deficit would be significantly higher if it entered administration. An Arcadia spokesman declined to comment on the loan talks. In a statement the company said it was not true that it was nearing administration. The statement said: “Clearly, the second UK lockdown presents a further challenge for all retailers and we are taking all appropriate steps to protect our employees and other stakeholders from its consequences. “All our stores in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have now reopened, and we are continuing to trade online through our own channels as well as through those of our partners.”"
"The food delivery company Hungry Panda has failed to appear before a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry that is looking into the death of one of its workers. In an appearance that had been planned for weeks, the company had agreed to give testimony to a NSW inquiry into the gig economy but on Monday no representatives from the company appeared. The chair of the committee, the Labor MP Daniel Mookhey, said the company had given no notice. Monday would have been the first public appearance for the company in Australia, which has its headquarters in the UK and targets Chinese communities around the world. Other gig economy companies including Ola have previously appeared before the NSW inquiry, as has the widow of the worker who was killed. Hungry Panda’s delivery manager, Luna Wei, was scheduled to speak at 11.45am on Monday. But at 12pm Mookhey had to tell those watching that the company had simply not shown up. “Our next set of witnesses were meant to be from Hungry Panda,” he said after a 15-minute delay. “Hungry Panda has failed to attend and not given any explanation.” A Hungry Panda rider, Xiaojun Chen, was killed in Sydney in a collision on 29 September, two days after an Uber Eats rider, Dede Fredy, died. Last week Chen’s widow, Lihong Wei, testified before the committee. She told Guardian Australia earlier that her husband’s death had left her family in financial ruin, and it was unclear whether Hungry Panda would pay her compensation for his death while working. Mookhey told Guardian Australia that the company’s failure to appear did “not inspire much confidence in their ability to support their workers”. “I’m disappointed that Hungry Panda failed to front the Future of Work inquiry,” he said. “It is the height of disrespect – especially after hearing evidence last week from the widow of a Hungry Panda worker who died on the job. “The committee expects better cooperation from Hungry Panda. We will look to call them at our next public hearing early next year.” Mookhey said Hungry Panda had sent a letter of apology at 1pm, more than an hour after its representative was due to appear. “I’m really sorry that I didn’t attend this important meeting on time today,” Luna Wei wrote in an email shown to Guardian Australia. “Recently, I have been busy with the safety education of riders. Today, some riders came to the company without an appointment to discuss some delivery problems with me, which caused me to fail to arrive at the meeting site on time. “I apologise for my absence today. I’m terribly sorry.” Later on Monday the committee heard from a director of SafeWork NSW, Peter Dunphy, who said the agency was investigating Chen and Fredy’s deaths. Dunphy said SafeWork NSW had been notified of Chen’s death on 1 October, two days after he died, by the Transport Workers’ Union. The question of why Hungry Panda had not notified SafeWork was the subject of an investigation, he said. Dunphy also revealed that SafeWork NSW had reported a significant increase in gig economy notifications this year. Nineteen incidents had been reported in the six months to July this year. In the two years before that, it received just five notifications. “We are aware in the increase of the number of notifications,” he said. “Our overall number of notifications we receive over a year is about 8,000.” Hungry Panda operates in six countries – the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, France and New Zealand. Like companies including Uber Eats and Deliveroo, the food delivery workers for Hungry Panda are classified as independent contractors, not employees, meaning they are not entitled to minimum wages, sick leave and workers compensation for death or injury. Also on Monday, the committee heard from the national secretary of the TWU, Michael Kaine, who said 80% of people who work in food delivery are in Australia on temporary visas. “These companies act as if no law applied to them,” he told the inquiry. “They are marching through our society. It’s a wrecking ball. It has ripped away public revenue and it’s ripping away people’s lives.” Kaine said that the gig economy should be regulated by an independent standing body that could identify different classes of gig workers and recommend extra rights and conditions. A “logical” solution would be “a body that can inquire into particular types of work”, he said. “These kinds of digital platforms will continue to evolve, we need to have a system that is flexible enough. For example, food delivery riders riding a bicycle … They can be characterised as a level of work of with a level of dependency that can trigger workers compensation laws.” He said this would avoid “prescriptive” definitions of worker and contractor, similar to those legislated in California which were overturned by proposition 22, a ballot measure authored by gig economy companies. Mark Goodsell, the head of the NSW Australian Industry Group, said the gig economy was “delivering huge benefits to the Australian community”. On Sunday a TWU survey revealed that Uber and other rideshare drivers are paid an average hourly rate of $12.35 after expenses."
"Retailers are warning a logjam at the country’s biggest container port could result in product shortages this Christmas, as it emerged 11,000 containers of government-procured PPE is clogging up Felixstowe. Congestion at Felixstowe is a problem for the whole country as the Suffolk port handles approximately 40% of all the containers coming into and out of the UK. The port is facing two problems that are together hitting deliveries and causing delays, just as the key Christmas trading period – when retailers rely on daily deliveries of stock to keep their shelves full – is getting underway. Firstly, a huge surge in freight volumes is currently underway as retailers load up their warehouses ahead of Christmas and the Brexit deadline. The volumes are greater than usual because the flow of goods into the UK was seriously disrupted during the spring lockdown when, faced with the unfolding health crisis, businesses postponed or cancelled billions of pounds of orders placed with overseas suppliers. There are therefore more containers coming into the port than normal. At the same time Felixstowe is struggling to provide storage for 11,000 containers of PPE belonging to the government. The backlog is filling 3o% of the inbound container space at the port. The PPE was a “significant factor” in the current congestion at port, according to one source who suggested the government did not have anywhere to store it. “There is a big build up of it,” they said. Felixstowe said it was “proud to support the government and to play a small part in helping ensure the NHS does not run out of vital PPE during this pandemic”. But a spokesman for the port said some of the PPE containers “have been at the port since August, which does create additional pressure on top of a more general spike in volumes being experienced worldwide. We are working with the contractors to the Department of Health to remove these containers to off-port depots as quickly as possible.” Felixstowe was handling more than 100,000 containers a week, the spokesman added, but “remains under pressure due to the Covid pandemic, high levels of import traffic, the large number of empty containers, and a large amount of unusually long-stay containers held at the port.” The 11,000 containers of PPE being stored at the port was first reported by the East Anglia Daily Times, which said containers were also being stored at other sites. The British International Freight Association (BIFA) said the huge stack of containers were making operations difficult at Felixstowe, and adding to problems elsewhere, at other ports such as London Gateway at Thurrock in Essex and at Southampton. John Roberts, the chief executive of online electrical goods retailer AO.com, described the situation at Felixstowe as a mess.  “Felixstowe is a mess at the minute, so there is a lot of product being unloaded elsewhere and redirected by road, and also being redirected through Liverpool,” Roberts said. “Over a third of the product we receive is arriving at the wrong time. That might sound like a very simple thing but when you’re planning labour and bays on warehouses, it adds a phenomenal amount of complexity and quite a bit of cost as well.” With retailers gearing up for their biggest sales weeks of the year, Roberts warned of looming product shortages by the end of this month. “We don’t know exactly what they’re going to be,” he said. “We’ll have a much better picture at the end of November. ” Another major high-street retailer said the ports were being overwhelmed because stores were “playing catch up” as a result of the spring lockdown as well as the need to prepare for Brexit. “There was there was a period of about six weeks where incoming stock to the UK dropped off significantly,” he explained. “Now we have turned the tap back on the capacity in China and the capacity in the UK ports is overloaded. Of course the little thing that’s also adding to the complexity is called Brexit.”"
"Tesco has apologised after its grocery website was overwhelmed with shoppers trying to book delivery slots for Christmas. Customers complained they had been forced to join an online queue for hours on Friday morning after Tesco opened bookings for Christmas week for shoppers who had signed up to the supermarket’s delivery subscription service. The retailer said it had also paused sign-ups to the “delivery saver” service “to help support our existing and vulnerable customers because of the high demand for online slots”. Messages on Tesco’s official Twitter account told shoppers the website had suffered from a “technical issue” that it was trying to fix. “We’re sorry if things take a bit longer than usual,” Tesco said. “We’re experiencing a huge volume of customers who are trying to book a slot at the moment.”  It said it was “using a virtual waiting room to help us manage the flow”. It said the problems had been fixed by Friday afternoon. One shopper tweeted: “Over 2 hours of waiting now, been allowed in 3 times but each time it throws me out. I’m on the priority list for myself and also for my elderly neighbour. Help me out Tesco!!!!” Another wrote: “After almost a 90min queue all the slots I wanted were gone, I settled for something and then it crashes at checkout with a “oops something went wrong”. The problems on the website for the UK’s biggest supermarket are the first sign of the huge pressures for online delivery services expected in the run-up to Christmas as the November lockdown in England and fears of the virus keep shoppers away from actual stores. Supermarkets have dramatically ramped up their capacity to offer home deliveries, adding hundreds of thousands of new slots. Tesco alone has almost doubled its available delivery slots, to 1.2m a week, since the outbreak of the pandemic. Online grocery sales have jumped from 7% of overall sales to 13%.  But availability is still expected to be tight in December. The online grocery specialist Ocado has said its Christmas slots are already booked but more might be made available in early December. Asda and Morrisons both started releasing delivery slots last week and both said they still had availability. However, Morrisons’ service on Amazon Prime, which includes unlimited fast deliveries, is limiting deliveries to one every four days because of high demand. Waitrose opened bookings more than a month ago and said some were still available. Sainsbury’s will gradually release its delivery slots from 29 November but those signed up to its delivery pass service can book theirs from 22 November."
"The combination of Black Friday discounts and coronavirus restrictions will make November a record-breaking month for online spending in the UK, according to a new report that showed early web sales rising by 60%. With non-essential shops closed in England and shutting in parts of Scotland at the end of this week, household names such as Currys PC World and Debenhams, have started cutting prices to encourage customers to buy early and avert a high street meltdown in December. Online sales were up 61% in the first week of November compared with the same period last year, according to the internet industry body IMRG, which said the impressive growth indicated November is “well on track to be a record-breaking month for online retail”. Andy Mulcahy, the strategy and insight director at IMRG, said the week of Black Friday – beginning 23 November – was always big in sales terms but the backdrop of the pandemic meant retailers needed to encourage customers to do their shopping earlier so as to avoid “heavy backlogs and delays in proximity to Christmas”. Of the 320 retailers IMRG monitors, by the middle of last week more than one in 10 had launched their Black Friday campaigns compared with about 4% in 2019, with AO.com, The Entertainer and Amazon among names already offering discounts. The focus for the Black Friday discount extravaganza is the final weekend of November, when shoppers are expected to spend £7.5bn, according to a Centre for Retail Research report for Vouchercodes.co.uk. That would be some 12% less than in 2019 and the first time CRR’s experts have predicted a drop in total sales since the US-inspired event arrived in 2013. The fall in spend is blamed entirely on lockdown store closures. The diverging fortunes of real and virtual stores is writ large in the CRR’s forecasts, which predict online sales will be nearly £2bn higher at £5.8bn while stores will miss out on £3bn of business, to take just £1.7bn. Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at consultancy GlobalData, said he expected a strong Black Friday sales period with multichannel retailers “desperate to make up for lost store sales” via their websites. “They are staring down the barrel of a catastrophic Christmas and are not certain they are going to be able to open on 2 December. There is a battle to get their share of spend.” When Black Friday first arrived in the UK the scramble to get discounted TVs and appliances descended into brawls in some shops but it is now primarily played out online, with consumers at home combing websites to find the best deals, particularly on coveted home appliances such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners, as well as personal gadgetry like smartphones, tablets and speakers. Big names such as Marks & Spencer and Next are not taking part this year while, unlike last year, John Lewis is not launching its own promotions but will price-match rivals. There are also expected to be fewer promotions in the supermarket aisles, with store chiefs wary of drawing more people to already busy stores. Delivery companies are already experiencing a spike in demand. Last week parcel volumes were 43% higher than in 2019, according to technology firm Metapack, which works with major brands like John Lewis. Its software finds delivery slots for parcels within a network of 400 carriers, helping move a billion packages a year. During the three-month spring lockdown the number of parcels processed by Metapack was actually 25% bigger than during last year’s festive rush. Given the lockdown restrictions some retailers think the Christmas peak could be up to 60% higher again, according to Metapack executive Bruce Fair. Carriers keep their ultimate capacity “close to their chest” he added, but the top four – Royal Mail, DPD, Hermes and Yodel – have stopped taking on new business. The Entertainer toy chain launched its Black Friday deals early to help spread out sales and, like some other chains, is offering a refund of the difference if prices drop again. Gary Grant, its founder and executive chairman, said it could not “cram seven weeks of customers into its shops in three weeks” when stores reopened. “We’ve got to maximise every single day of every week, all the way to Christmas now, we don’t want a lull now and to be over capacity in three weeks time.” In previous years The Entertainer took 10 days to process Black Friday orders and if the lockdown results in a 50% or 100% increase, Grant has warned “we and the couriers could not cope”. “There’s no point the whole world thinking that on 27 November we can go online and buy everything we want, and it will miraculously turn up at our front door,” he added."
"The FTSE 100 has recorded its strongest week since April amid rising hopes that a coronavirus vaccine can trigger a faster economic revival from the pandemic than first anticipated. The index of leading UK company shares ended the week more than 300 points higher at 6,316, a rise of about 7%, despite a modest dip on Friday as City investors bet it would still take time to deploy the vaccine and for Britain’s economy to stage a full recovery. Financial markets around the world have soared since Pfizer/BioNTech announced earlier this week that its Covid vaccine was 90% effective in protecting people from transmission of the virus in global trials. Russia also said on Wednesday that its own candidate, Sputnik V, had shown in trials it could cut the likelihood of catching the disease by 92%. However, the continued rapid spread of the virus and the start of tougher lockdown restrictions has limited gains in stock markets as the second wave of Covid inflicts a heavy toll on the global economy. Shares in the blue-chip London index erased some of the earlier gains this week, falling by 0.4% on Friday, as optimism over the vaccine was tempered by a record number of new cases in many countries and the prospect of a difficult winter ahead before it becomes widely available. Official figures show the UK economy grew at a record quarterly rate of more than 15% in the third quarter as lockdown restrictions were eased but that the recovery was losing momentum even before new curbs came in. The Bank of England forecasts GDP to fall again in the final three months of 2020. Unemployment is also rising despite the government extending the furlough scheme until the end of March, with official figures this week showing the fastest increase in redundancies on record. Eurozone GDP rose by 12.6% in the three months to September, slightly below an initial estimate of 12.7%, according to official figures on Friday. The FTSE 100 has gained by more than 700 points since the start of the month as hopes over a vaccine and Joe Biden defeating Donald Trump in the US election lifted financial markets around the world. However, the index is still down by more than 1,000 on the start of the year, before the onset of the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the leading index of US company shares, has also gained, by about 3% this week, extending a winning streak after its biggest gains since April a week earlier as Biden’s victory over Trump became clearer. Shares on Wall Street rallied further on Friday after Biden won in Arizona, flipping control from the Republicans to the Democrats in the state for the first time since 1996. The Dow Jones was up by 1.37% to 29,479 on Friday afternoon. Spot gold gained 0.8% to $1,890.81 on Friday on rising infections and increased worries about their economic impact and the speed with which vaccines might be available. However, bullion was still in line for its worst weekly loss since the end of September – down more than 3% – as a result of the initial excitement over the vaccine news. Russ Mould, investment director at the Manchester-based stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Investors’ perspective on the outlook has definitely been shifted in a positive direction by the vaccine breakthroughs and there is the promise of more news in this area in the weeks to come. “Clearly the Covid crisis is not at an end despite the positive news announced by Pfizer and counterparts in Russia – perhaps it would be more accurate to paraphrase Churchill and say we are at ‘the end of the beginning’ of the pandemic.”"
"Many companies that have suffered a sharp sell-off since the beginning of the pandemic registered big gains after the vaccine news boosted hopes that a return to normal pre-Covid life could be coming. At the same time, some of the shine came off firms that have profited from coronavirus thanks to a strong focus online. International Consolidated Airlines Group This week: +40% Year to date: -65% Share price Friday: 145p Share price 1 Jan 2020: 414p The owner of British Airways was one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 this week as investors bet that vaccine hopes could mean better times ahead for an industry hit hard by travel restrictions and plummeting passenger numbers. Rolls-Royce This week: +35% Year to date: -60% Share price Friday: 94.5p Share price 1 Jan 2020: 234p The sharp fall in air travel during the pandemic has had a serious impact on the order books of plane-makers and their suppliers.

"British holidaymakers, chalet owners and resort staff are in limbo as countries across Europe decide whether or not this winter’s ski season will go ahead. This week, Britain’s biggest ski operator Crystal Ski Holidays was forced to cancel all its French ski trips in December after President Macron ordered the nation’s resorts to stay shut until the new year. But a call by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for an EU-wide agreement to keep all European ski resorts closed until early January looks set to go unheeded by Switzerland, and possibly Austria. Many staff who were due to travel out to resorts in the coming days to take up seasonal jobs have been told to stay at home. Meanwhile, those with holiday bookings for January and the busy February half-term are waiting to see whether their trips will go ahead. “Everything’s up in the air with everyone waiting to see what each country decides to do in terms of reopening ski resorts,” said Lynsey Devon, whose PR firm represents many of the big resorts across Europe. “We have already seen many of the big firms cancelling chalet-based ski holidays to prevent different groups mixing in the same accommodation, meaning that the number of chalet staff needed is way down.” Charlotte Kyle is one of those caught up in the uncertainty. In August, the 19-year-old from Surrey was offered a chalet hosting job with the firm Ski Famille, and was due to travel to the Alps next week. “It’s all gone very quiet and I’m not expecting to hear anything any time soon. I get the feeling that the ski firms are waiting like everyone else to hear whether the season will be going ahead. It’s frustrating but what can you do?” she said. Recent UK business casualties of the pandemic include the travel firm VIP Ski, which went into administration on 17 November, saying: “It has proved impossible to navigate a way through this.” Experts have warned there will be further business failures if resorts do not open after January. Ski resorts in France employ roughly 120,000 seasonal workers, while in Italy, winter tourism provides jobs for 400,000 people, from ski instructors and hoteliers to restaurant owners. This week, Crystal Ski Holidays, part of the Tui group, said that because of the impact of Covid-19 and the restrictions now in place, it would not be able to operate holidays to several European destinations, including Austria and Switzerland, or the US until mid-December. Trips to France were off before the end of the year. The company said holidays due to depart after these dates were scheduled to operate as planned, although it was continuing to monitor the situation. Brighton-based Ski Beat specialises in chalet holidays in the French Alps, where it has 59 chalets. Laura Hazell, its sales and marketing director, said that while it had reduced its catered chalet provision for this season, it had expanded its self-catered programme “due to strong demand from European and French domestic markets”. The company said that as things currently stood, it had about 30 chalet hosts, reps and other seasonal resort staff going to France towards the end of December, with the aim of starting work in January. The firm has also opened bookings for the 2021-22 ski season six months earlier than usual. Diane Palumbo, the sales and marketing director at Skiworld, which describes itself as the UK’s largest independent ski tour operator, said that with a Covid-19 vaccine seemingly on its way, the company was anticipating a busy February half-term, plus a potential mini boom in Easter bookings. She added: “A lot of customers are now booking for 2021. I was just on the phone to the resort operators in Méribel [in the French Alps]. They are saying all the right things – the infection rate appears to be falling. It’s like the UK – there will be areas where travel is restricted and the same will emerge in France.” Even before the latest coronavirus developments, Brexit had dealt a major blow to British employees seeking seasonal work as chalet hosts, bar staff and instructors in European ski resorts. Barring an 11th-hour reprieve, from 1 January they are likely to find it more difficult to obtain work because the rules for Britons applying for seasonal jobs in EU countries such as France will become much more onerous. Under the existing arrangements, UK staff who are working in the resorts before 31 December can remain in their jobs for the entirety of the 2020-21 ski season – but if the ski slopes in countries such as France are off-limits until January (or later), this puts companies in a very difficult position. Meanwhile, high-end estate agents are insisting there is still a strong appetite among well-heeled Britons for buying properties in the Alps – with Covid-19 putting the spotlight on the health and wellness benefits of living in the mountains. Knight Frank runs a ski property price index, and last month said that overall this had increased by 1.2% in 2020, “suggesting that Covid-19 has had little impact on prices to date”. Scotland’s ski resorts will be open for Christmas and new year, unlike the shuttered resorts of the Alps. But before ardent skiers flock to the Cairngorms, there’s a small problem. At the mountain range’s biggest ski centre, Glenshee, the head of ski patrolling, Karen Hunter, said: “I’m looking out of my window here and right now there’s not one flake of snow to be seen.” Glenshee formally opens on 19 December, while Glencoe in the west of Scotland opens its first chairlift on 5 December. “Live together, ride together” is the motto on the mountains, with skiers told they can only share a chairlift if the other person is within their household. Ski clothing can no longer be hired, while boots and skis must be booked in advance. Access to the mountains will also be limited: Glencoe has a usual maximum of 1,500 skiers a day but is cutting that to only 500-600 each day this year. Scotland’s ski season tends to begin late, with the slopes receiving their first proper cover in mid- to late January. But the season also lasts later into the year – so the first lockdown in March was a major blow. “We had to shut on 22 March, even though we could have run the lifts until 15 May,” said Andy Meldrum, the managing director of Glencoe. He is confident of an early start this year, saying the resort’s snow machines will ensure that “we open on 19 December irrespective of the weather”. But the Scottish resort operators candidly acknowledge that it is no replacement for a week’s holiday in the Alps. “Scottish skiing is completely different – it’s more about sport than holidaying,” Meldrum said. “The Covid issue for the Alps is that they will see thousands of people descend on a small village for a week at a time. In Scotland it’s more last-minute. You’ll see the snow is good, grab a day off work and dash up from Glasgow.” Or, as Hunter puts it: “When it’s good, it’s like nowhere else in the world. But when it’s bad it’s unspeakably awful.” The tiering system presents problems. Glenshee is tier 2 on its Aberdeen side and tier 3 on its Perthshire side, while Glencoe in the Highlands is tier 1. Despite the challenges, operators say forward bookings – such as lift season passes – are holding up well. Skiing in Scotland is remarkably good value compared with the Alps. A day pass in Glenshee is only £32, half the price of a typical day pass in the Alps, while skis and boot hire add another £24."
"Britain has fired up some of its last remaining coal power plants to help keep the lights on as the country’s wind turbines slow over a few days and the demand for electricity rises. Three of the UK’s last coal power plants, operating at Drax, West Burton, and Ratcliffe, were called on to supply 6% of electricity on Thursday morning. Coal’s share of the electricity mix was roughly double the share of wind and solar power in the electricity mix, and six times the average contribution made by coal plants in the final months of last year. The coal plants are likely to keep running over the next few days, alongside a fleet of gas-fired power plants, before breezy weather returns to help meet the rising demand for electricity from renewable energy sources. The electricity system operator said that the UK still had enough electricity to meet demand, but the cushion of extra power supplies was lower than usual “owing to a number of factors” including “varying renewable generation levels and colder temperatures”. It is the third time in recent weeks that National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has warned that energy supplies are under pressure. Tom Edwards, an energy analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the supply squeeze had caused market prices for electricity generated in the early evening, when electricity demand typically spikes, to climb to over £313 per megawatt hours (MWh). He said that renewable electricity was in relatively short supply in western Europe too, meaning the UK would need to keep running its coal plants while exporting power to France and to the Netherlands via cable interconnectors. The UK is poised for a multi-billion pound boom in renewable energy in the next 10 years, alongside big investments in energy storage technology and nuclear power to help cut fossil fuels from the energy system. SSE and the Norwegian energy firm Equinor on Thursday gave the green light to the first two phases of the world’s largest offshore windfarm, at Dogger Bank, after completing the financing for the £3bn project. The Dogger Bank windfarm is also one of the most cost competitive offshore windfarms in the world after driving its costs down to record lows of between £39.65/MWh and £41.61/MWh in the government’s support contract auction last year. Orsted, the offshore wind power company, and Shell, have agreed to buy the electricity generated by Dogger Bank when it starts operations in the middle of the decade. Orsted will take a 40% share of the electricity generated, and Shell a 20% share."
"The manufacturers of the UK’s three biggest coffee pod brands have joined forces to set up the sector’s first national recycling scheme, in the face of a backlash against single-serve capsules, many of which end up in landfill. Nestlé, the owner of Nespresso and Nescafé Dolce Gusto, and Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) UK – which makes Tassimo – are next year launching the first system to make it easier and more convenient for consumers to recycle pods in a number of different ways. Local councils are being invited to provide kerbside collection for pods alongside other household recycling. Consumers will also be able to leave them at 6,500 Yodel dropoff points, and, eventually, hand them over on the doorstep when their supermarket online shopping has been delivered. The overarching national scheme – run by a new not-for-profit organisation called Podback – aims to replace a complex patchwork of different recycling services. Nespresso expects to phase out its UK recycling scheme – under which little more than a third of its pods are recycled. A TerraCycle system for Tassimo and L’OR pods will also become redundant. The founding brands of the scheme are urging rivals to back the initiative. More than 95m cups of coffee are drunk in the UK every day, but single serve pods have become an environmental scourge, often ending up in landfills where they can take 500 years to break down. An estimated 20bn capsules are used every year across the world, of which about 14bn are sold by Nespresso online and from 810 boutiques in 84 countries. The complex mix of plastic, foil and aluminium – combined with coffee dregs – can make pods difficult to recycle and process in standard municipal recycling plants. Coffee pod usage soared even before lockdown, but Britons are now drinking more – and premium – coffee while at home. The market research company Mintel has forecast that the UK retail value sales of coffee pods will reach £260m this year, up from £210m in 2018. The brands’ research highlights confusion among consumers, with more than a third (35%) of people who use coffee pods unaware they can be recycled, and nine in 10 saying they would like to be able to recycle their pods through their household recycling. Exeter city council, Cheltenham borough council and South Derbyshire district council are expected to be the first confirmed local authority partners, while advanced talks are continuing with others. Toby Bevans, the marketing director of JDE UK and Ireland and director of Podback, said: “We are proud to be a co-founder of Podback, working to ensure that every pod enjoyed is easily recycled. With Nestlé, we are calling on the entire industry to put commercial rivalries aside and collaborate, working together with other brands and retailers to make it as easy as possible for consumers to recycle their pods.” Trewin Restorick, the chief executive of the environmental charity Hubbub, welcomed the plans while urging more transparency. “It is hugely encouraging to see major companies collaborating to boost coffee pod recycling. Hopefully this service will eventually be available through all local authority household recycling collection schemes and the companies will be transparent about how many pods are recycled,” he said."
"Naked Wines is having to routinely test grapes for smoke damage in California as worsening wildfires linked to the climate crisis cause problems for growers. Nick Devlin, the chief executive of the online wine retailer, said it was taking the extra step owing to the increased “frequency and intensity” of wildfires, which have affected growers in the US and Australia this year. The company could not take the risk of buying “compromised fruit”, Devlin said. “It is not good for us and it’s not good for our winemakers in the long term.” Smoke damage, or smoke taint as it is referred to in the industry, resulted in wines that tasted “incredibly unpleasant”. The smokiness was at the “cigarette-ashtray end of the spectrum, rather than an enjoyable campfire”, Devlin said. Devlin’s comments came as the company increased its sales forecasts for the year as shoppers flocked online to buy wine in response to the pandemic. The clamour for its Christmas deals even crashed its website. The retailer said last week it had sold 40,000 of its luxury Christmas boxes in 24 hours. They include foodie treats such as olive oil and craft gin as well as wine. The increase in traffic overwhelmed the site, which was down for about an hour. Sales at Naked Wines increased 80% in the six months to the end of September as more customers signed up for its wine deliveries – and existing ones, called “angels”, bought more. That surge had continued into the winter months, prompting it to upgrade its sales forecast. The company now expects annual sales growth of between 55% and 65%. Sales were up 80% to £157m at the retailer, which last year sold off its high street arm Majestic Wine. Despite the big increase, pre-tax losses widened from £5.4m to £8.1m. The bigger loss was blamed on a £4m hit relating to the sale of Majestic Wine stores in Calais. The value of the business collapsed after the government dented the lucrative booze cruise trade with less generous duty free allowances after Brexit. Dan Lane, a senior analyst at the fintech firm Freetrade, said the share price of the “wannabe Ocado-for-wine” had almost doubled this year as it delivered the nation’s “lockdown libations”. “The real test is hanging on to customers who flocked to the service during lockdown,” he said. “There are signs that we’re quite happy for this shopping habit to stick around … with monthly order rates rising and their flock of angels growing.”"
"One in seven businesses in Britain was teetering on the brink of collapse even before the new lockdown in England came into force at the start of November, the latest official snapshot of trading conditions has revealed. The regular update from the Office for National Statistics showed that one in seven firms polled during the last two weeks of October said they had low confidence or no confidence that they would survive the next few months. The hospitality industry was the least confident, with one in three firms fearful of collapse. Economists are predicting that the economy will take a significant hit from the tougher restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus, but the ONS figures suggest that many companies were already struggling. The news came as the employers’ organisation, the CBI, said the resurgence of the virus was having a marked impact on factory order books and the International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy was losing momentum after a stronger than expected third quarter. Ahead of a virtual meeting of the leaders from the G20 group of developed and developing countries, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the road to recovery would not be easy despite the recent vaccine breakthroughs. With UK consumer confidence weakening as a result of the surge in infections, the ONS report provided a gloomy backdrop to next week’s announcement by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, of the government’s spending plans for 2021-22. Pessimism was most apparent among hotels and restaurants where a third (34%) of businesses said they would struggle to make it through to the new year. The ONS reported that by the end of October – the date when the government’s furlough scheme was originally due to end – 9% of workers, about 3 million people, still had their wages subsidised by the state. In the arts, entertainment and recreation sector – much of which remained closed even as restrictions were lifted elsewhere during the summer – 34% of the workforce remained furloughed. Sunak announced earlier this month that the furlough would be extended until at least March, with workers paid 80% of their wages, but the ONS evidence on a possible wave of business failures suggests unemployment will continue to rise through the winter. Data from the ONS covering the period up until the middle of October showed the impact of the new English lockdown on the economy. The ONS said footfall among shoppers was 44% of the level seen in November 2019, while traffic on the roads was 22% down on its pre-crisis levels in February. Meanwhile, the number of adults shopping for items other than food and medicine dropped to 10% – the lowest level since June when non-essential stores were reopened after the first lockdown. The CBI said 61% of the manufacturing firms responding to its monthly industrial trends survey said order books were below normal against 21% reporting they were above normal. The gap of -40 percentage points in November compared with -34 points last month. Anna Leach, the CBI’s deputy chief economist, said output volumes had been declining at their slowest pace in over a year during the economy’s recovery phase. “But order books have softened again as global demand has been hit by intensified lockdowns, and manufacturers have trimmed their expectations.” Georgieva said a medical solution to the crisis was now in sight but the economic road ahead remained difficult and prone to setbacks. “On the upside, faster-than-expected containment of the virus or the development of better treatments would allow for a quicker return to normal activity, limit economic scarring, and boost growth. On the downside, if new outbreaks require more stringent mobility restrictions, or if the development, production, and widespread distribution of vaccines and treatments is delayed, social distancing will persist for longer.”"
"For nearly a month festive shop windows and twinkling fairy lights have been wasted on empty high streets but that changes on Wednesday when the end of shopping restrictions in England hands retailers 23 days to save Christmas. Retailers have drawn up the battle plans they hope will enable them to safely concertina two months’ worth of Christmas shoppers into a Covid-secure one, from round-the-clock shopping in Primark to virtual queues outside John Lewis. The four-week shutdown has cost the non-essential retail chains, which sell Christmas gifts such as clothes, toys and gadgets, an estimated £8bn in lost sales. A successful December will be critical to preventing further store closures and job losses on the UK’s battered high streets. For struggling retailers such as Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia fashion group and the department store chain Debenhams, the November shutdown was the final straw. Debenhams’ 124 stores are reopening only to run closing-down sales as administrators wind up the 242-year-old chain after failing to find a buyer. Analysts say the failure of two household names, which together employ 25,000 people and run 574 shops, threatens to destabilise the high street during a critical trading window. The Moody’s analyst David Beadle said heavy discounting could now be added to the list of challenges facing clothing retailers as they reopen to face a “condensed Christmas season at the end of an extremely difficult year”. There are few retailers where the stakes are higher at this time of year than in the toy business. Approximately a quarter of the £3.6bn spent on toys in the UK happens in December. November equates to about 15% or £500m of Lego and LOL Surprise! dolls. Gary Grant, the founder and chairman of The Entertainer, is anticipating a rush. “If it is anything like our experience in Wales [where stores reopened on 9 November] we will open to a 50% increase in sales over last year,” he said. Like other chains The Entertainer’s shops will open for a least 12 hours a day. Marks & Spencer is promising its “longest-ever” Christmas opening hours, including keeping 400 stores open until midnight in the final week. Primark’s chief executive, Paul Marchant, has gone further still with 11 stores reopening for an initial 24-hour stint so shoppers can buy its “famous Christmas jumpers, festive pyjamas and much, much more”. The government has not relaxed Sunday trading laws and while non-essential retail is reopening in England on Wednesday it will remain closed in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland until 11 December. Grant’s strong Christian beliefs mean The Entertainer always closes on Sundays, giving it just 20 days to maximise Christmas trade. “They are gonna be a blast,” he says of the days to come. “We are going to be absolutely run off our feet.” Longer trading hours is one way of coping with social distancing requirements but other creative routes to crowd control are also being deployed. John Lewis is offering “bookable shopping slots” and a virtual queuing system that allocates shoppers a time to return if there is a line outside. The Lush co-founder, Mark Constantine, said the key to keeping staff and customers safe would be to serve customers as quickly and as efficiently as possible. “People do not want to be put in a difficult situation within a shop,” he said. As part of that efficiency drive, the Poole-based retailer, best-known for its fragrant soaps and bath bombs, has discontinued 200 products and sharpened its prices. “I got rid of a load of things I call nubbins,” the businessman said. Before the new lockdowns were imposed high streets and shopping centres were struggling to coax shoppers back in the same volumes seen before the pandemic. Retail data expert Springboard reckons the reopening of stores should result in week-on-week shopper numbers jumping by 40%, but that figure would still be almost two-fifths down on 2019. One of the biggest casualties has been London’s West End shopping district, which is heavily reliant on office workers and overseas tourists. The high end stores on key shopping thoroughfares such as Oxford Street usually rake in more than £2.5bn in November and December but this year the figure is expected to be about £900m. While the end of the spring lockdown led to a gradual recovery in shopper numbers, Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of the New West End Company that represents 600 retailers in the area, expects more of a bang this time round. The closeness to Christmas led to a 30% surge in shopper numbers in three days before the November lockdown began in England. “We think there’s going to be a lot of pent up demand,” Tyrell said. “The summer was slower. This is a completely different feeling. There’s more confidence with customers, you know the vaccine is on its way. Operationally it is about opening hours.” Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, is encouraging Britons to support their local shops. Every purchase, she said, was a “retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported”."
"You can’t cuddle or stroke them, and God forbid you should take them for a walk. Yet the humble goldfish is making a comeback as more Britons embrace pet ownership. The switch to working from home has led to a well-documented rise in households adopting puppies and kittens, but the retailer Pets at Home says fish-keeping is also enjoying a renaissance. After a period of what looked like “terminal decline”, said Peter Pritchard, the company’s chief executive, fish-keeping was increasing for the first time since he joined a decade ago. “People are at home more,” he said. “It is an easy way to get into pet ownership. They don’t need to be walked and you can leave fish alone.” He said the cost of setting up a tank started at about £50, with the fish “a couple of pounds” on top of that. But as with any hobby, the sky is the limit, with the retailer selling extras such as £60 ornaments shaped like the Acropolis. “Fish-keeping is a hobby that requires a degree of involvement from easy through to very sophisticated,” Pritchard said. “It is very rewarding. A fish tank is an incredibly peaceful thing to have in your home.” Owning a pet fish may also be one of the few options open to those living in rented accommodation, suggested Dick Mills, of the Federation of British Aquatic Societies. Some landlords “really don’t want cats and dogs but don’t mind fish tanks,” he said. “I mean, the worst that can happen is that it leaks.” Fish-keeping is a practical choice but also provides a mental workout as owners must grapple with maths, physics and biology to keep their fish alive – and that’s before you get into what type of fish you are going to own.  “Is it going to be cold water, warm water or tropical marine fish?” said Mills. “You have got so much to choose from. It’s the best living picture you can hang on your wall.” The shift to working from home has benefited Pets at Home, which has 451 stores and was classed as an essential retailer by the government, as working-from-home Britons lavished attention on existing pets or embraced ownership for the first time. Membership of its Puppy and Kitten Club – where cat and dog owners receive expert advice and exclusive offers – is up 25% on this time last year. This week the company said sales at established stores were up nearly 8% in the three months to 8 October."
"More than 100,000 additional house sales are expected during the first three months of 2021, as the rebound in the property market continues and buyers rush to complete their purchases before the end of the stamp duty holiday. The number of new sales being agreed remains 38% higher than it was a year ago, according to property website Zoopla. It predicts the housing market will be the busiest before Christmas than it has been for over a decade. The UK housing market has rebounded since the summer because of pent-up demand following the first UK-wide lockdown, and after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, decided in July to introduce a stamp duty holiday on properties up to £500,000 until March 2021. The boom in property sales since the summer has been felt most strongly in London and southern England, where 7% more sales were recorded than in the previous year. The flurry of interest from potential buyers has pushed up house prices by 3.5%, the highest level of growth for almost three years, and is set to increase further by the end of 2020. The housing market has had a “remarkable turnaround” since the spring, said Richard Donnell, director of research and insight at Zoopla. “It has been a rollercoaster year for the housing market which is ending on a strong note with demand and sales agreed still more than 30% higher than this time last year,” Donnell said. Continued interest from homebuyers caused residential property transactions to surge by almost 10% in October, compared with a month earlier. More than 105,000 residential transactions took place last month, an increase of nearly 10% compared with September, and 8.1% higher than October 2019, according to figures from HMRC. “There haven’t been more transactions than this in a single month since March 2016, and even that was a very unusual spike created by tax changes for landlords,” said Andrew Southern, chairman of property developer Southern Grove. “The pandemic and a raft of measures to support the economy have delivered record house prices and, finally, a head-turning recovery in sales volumes.” A last-minute surge of prospective buyers is expected in January, as purchasers try to beat the deadline for the stamp duty holiday. However Zoopla said that only half of deals agreed that month will likely complete before the March deadline for the end of the stamp duty holiday. Homebuyers have been warned that high demand for mortgages and coronavirus restrictions are creating delays in the process. The number of mortgage approvals hit their highest level since before the financial crisis in September. Figures from the Bank of England showed almost 85,000 loans to fund a house purchase were approved in August alone."
"Boeing’s 737 Max plane has been certified safe by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), meaning it could soon return to service. Two 737 Max crashes – a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019 – killed a total of 346 people. In September a report from the US House of Representatives came to scathing conclusions about the conduct of Boeing and the FAA, the agency regulating the plane. However, the FAA’s announcement marks the beginning of the end of a crisis for Boeing.  Both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights crashed shortly after takeoff, and investigators quickly found similarities when they examined the planes’ black box flight data. The pilots in both crashes struggled with the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system (MCAS), which had been installed on the 737 Max to prevent the plane from stalling if it climbed too quickly. The system was designed to push down the nose of the plane when it rose too high. That system depended on a sensor on the outside of the plane that measured the aircraft’s so-called angle of attack. However, a faulty sensor caused the planes to dip their noses repeatedly, eventually forcing the planes into a dive. Boeing has changed the software running the planes so that they take account of two sensors instead of one, according to the FAA. The anti-stall system will no longer kick in repeatedly, meaning a pilot should be able to take control again. The manufacturer has also updated its training materials so that pilots are aware of the potential issue, and it will install as standard on all of its models a warning that will go off if a sensor fails. The regulators and Boeing certainly think so. Steve Dickson, the head of the FAA, said he would be “100% comfortable” putting his family on a 737 Max when they re-enter service. Boeing said it would be “one of the safest airplanes ever to fly”. Given the prominence of the crisis, it is likely to be one of the most heavily scrutinised. The 737 Max has now completed about 1,400 test and check flights and more than 3,000 flight hours. It is unclear exactly when the first 737 Max will take off on a commercial flight, but American Airlines has scheduled its first one for 29 December. In the US, the FAA has mandated various steps that Boeing has to carry out, including training pilots in its software, making the required technical changes and carrying out routine maintenance for planes that have been grounded since last year. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has a similar process. It will soon make a formal proposal to unground the 737 Max, followed by a 28-day consultation period. After that the regulator will examine responses, meaning the first flight in Europe is not likely to be until the end of the year or early January. There is an added complication for the UK: Brexit. The UK Civil Aviation Authority usually follows the lead of EASA in certifying planes as safe to fly, but whether it will continue to do so depends on trade negotiations between the UK and the EU. If there is no deal and the plane has not yet been certified by 1 January, the end of the post-Brexit transition period, it could lead to complications in the recertification process. Many airlines let their customers know what model of aircraft they will be flying when they make a booking, but there is no obligation to do so. Two 737 Max customers in the British Isles are preparing to fly the plane when the ban is lifted: Tui and Ryanair. Tui said it would let customers know beforehand what model is scheduled, and let customers change flights free of charge if they feel uncomfortable. Ryanair, on the other hand, said it was not practical to inform its passengers of what model they would get, because it allocated its aircraft the day before the flight. Ryanair will not waive flight change fees for customers who do not want to fly on the 737 Max, according to Which?, the consumer group. Rory Boland, the Which? travel editor, said: “This is the first step to the Boeing 737 Max returning to service worldwide, but many passengers may still be uncomfortable taking flights on these planes given their past record. “Airlines that plan on flying these aircraft should give passengers with existing bookings the option of transferring to another flight for free, while operators should also make clear which planes will be used for future bookings, so people can make an informed choice before travelling.”"
"Low-cost airline Norwegian Air has filed for bankruptcy protection in Ireland, becoming the biggest casualty of the coronavirus pandemic in the aviation sector to date.  The troubled carrier has asked an Irish court to carry out a process of examinership. This should protect the group’s assets while it tries to slash debt levels and find new funding as part of a restructuring. It is expected to take as long as five months. Norwegian will continue to operate its flight schedule, which is reduced owing to Covid-19, during the process and its shares will still be traded on the Oslo stock exchange. The carrier built its reputation on rock-bottom fares, as low as £69, to cross the Atlantic and in 2018 overtook BA to become the biggest non-US airline linking Europe and New York. Norwegian said it had chosen Ireland because its fleet is held there, and that it had taken the decision “in the interests of its stakeholders”. The request to the Irish court comes just a week after Norway’s government refused to grant further financial assistance to the airline, a move Norwegian said left it facing a “very uncertain future”. The carrier received a bailout through state aid from Norway in the spring, with stringent conditions attached, after the first wave of coronavirus grounded many planes around the world. However, Norwegian had appealed for more financial support as the pandemic continued and fresh lockdowns in many markets slowed an expected recovery in aviation. Jacob Schram, the airline’s chief executive, said the the decision to request bankruptcy protection had been taken to “secure the future of Norwegian for the benefit of our employees, customers and investors. “Our intent is clear. We will emerge from this process as a more financially secure and competitive airline, with a new financial structure, a right-sized fleet and improved customer offering.” Schram said the company wanted to work with its stakeholders to find solutions to its financial problems, and intended to save as many jobs as possible. The carrier said it believed it had enough liquidity to get through the examinership process. It is only flying six of its aircraft and will only operate domestic Norwegian routes during the winter. Before the pandemic, Norwegian was operating more than 100 planes from several European bases, including London’s Gatwick airport. The airline pioneered low-cost, long-haul flights, including cheap no-frills fares across the Atlantic. However, the carrier’s rapid expansion, fuelled by borrowing, meant it entered the pandemic in a weaker financial state than some of its rivals. “Some of Norwegian’s problems were of its own making, with its ambition and expansion into low-cost long-haul flights,” said John Strickland, an analyst with JLS Consulting. “They have turned over every stone over a long period of time to stem losses, cut debt and raise equity, and then have had to deal with the pandemic on top of that.” Strickland added that Norwegian was facing increased competition in its domestic market, with low-cost rival Wizz Air planning to open two bases in Norway, while a new home-grown airline was also being planned. Norwegian is most likely to come out of the pandemic a very different business: a European regional carrier. However, Dan Thomas, an analyst at the research firm Third Bridge, said this would also present challenges. “They did have a profitable short-haul business, and one would assume that they would look to regrow the business. Short-haul European routes are going to be competitive. You’ve got some well-established players like Ryanair and Wizz Air who by all accounts have weathered coronavirus fairly well, and who are going to have lots of capacity in short-haul for some time,” Thomas said."
"UK inflation rose by more than expected in October, fuelled by the rising price of clothing and secondhand cars, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to 0.7% in October from 0.5% a month earlier as clothing prices increased, returning to a more normal seasonal pattern after the disruption this year. City economists had forecast an inflation rate of 0.6% for October. After steep discounting during the first lockdown, as the rapid spread of Covid-19 forced consumers away from the shops, the ONS said prices rose in October at a similar rate to last year. It comes despite retailers across the country coming under increasing pressure after the second wave of the pandemic forced local lockdowns in England and tougher measures in Scotland, Northern Ireland to contain the virus. The cost of food also increased slightly last month, in a development analysts said would probably continue into November as restaurants closed due to the renewed restrictions, pushing up demand for goods sold in supermarkets. The ONS said computer game prices also increased reflecting the release of several new titles ahead of Christmas. Inflation in the price of a secondhand car also soared by more than 10% on a year ago, amid a rush among consumers to buy their own vehicles to reduce their reliance on public transport during the pandemic. This was partly offset by falls in the cost of energy and holidays as travel companies attempted to lure weary British consumers to take an autumn break. The ONS said the government’s temporary VAT cut for the hospitality sector also continued to keep down the cost of hotel stays and eating out in restaurants. The latest inflation snapshot comes as the second national lockdown in England triggers a sharp drop in footfall on the high street, with the number of visits to retail outlets plunging by 75% in the first week of November as restrictions were imposed. While online spending has boomed during the pandemic, with more people staying at home, spending in physical shops remains the biggest driver of retail sales. Despite rising on the month, the rate of inflation remains significantly below the 2% target set by the government for the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street is forecasting subdued levels of inflation over the coming months as the UK economy remains under pressure during the second Covid wave. However, the Bank forecasts price growth will accelerate again towards the end of next year as demand recovers. Jai Malhi, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said British consumers appeared keen to continue spending despite new Covid restrictions. With companies still struggling to operate at full capacity, this would lead to a higher inflation rate than might be expected. “Further good news of a potential working vaccine may now be around the corner, and so the path from here may get smoother yet,” he said. However, analysts said price rises would probably remain subdued in the near future, as the second wave of coronavirus infections pushes the economy into a double-dip recession. Tom Stevenson, an investment director at the fund manager Fidelity International, said: “While prices are on an upwards path, rises are likely to be subdued for a while longer. Covid infections are still increasing, large swathes of the UK are under strict lockdown rules, restricting opportunities to spend, and unemployment is climbing.” After recording rapid growth in the three months to September as the economy reopened from the first lockdown, gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to plunge in the final three months of the year. Economists said a no-deal Brexit could trigger a surge in inflation early next year, warning that failure to strike an agreement before the transition period expires at the end of December could spark a sell-off in the pound. This would drive up the cost of importing goods to Britain. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “While it [inflation] will rise more significantly from next April, we doubt that it will spend much time above the 2% target. That is unless a no-deal Brexit pushes it up to a peak of 3%-4%.”"
"Household wealth among older Australian couples boomed above $1m before the pandemic, but median incomes remained below GFC levels and poverty among single-parent families continued its steady rise, a study has found. The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, or Hilda, tracks 17,500 people about various aspects of their lives, from employment and income, to wellbeing and lifestyle. The latest report, released on Friday, tracked participants from 2001 to 2018, and provided a picture of the country before the pandemic hit, said Prof Roger Wilkins, the Melbourne Institute deputy director and report co-author. “It tells us a bit about where we were heading before we went into this pandemic, and who was most vulnerable,” Wilkins said. “And, what will be the challenges once we come out the other side.” It found young people and women were overrepresented in industries such as hospitality, arts and recreation that would have left them most exposed to the Covid-19 recession. But Wilkins said the report’s findings around single-parent families were also worrying. Between 2016 and 2018, poverty among single-parent families increased from 15% to 25%, the report said, while a fifth said they’d gone without three or more essential items. Older couples and older single males also saw a small uptick in poverty, and the overall rate rose from 9.4% to 10.8%. “To my eye, the results for single parents are a cause for concern,” Wilkins said. Overall, 11.3% of people did not have $500 in the bank for an emergency, 8% could not afford home contents insurance and 5.3% couldn’t afford dental treatment they needed. Disadvantage was also entrenched, with 43% of those who in 2014 said they could not afford two or more items of a list of 25 essentials saying the same in 2018. The survey also allowed researchers to gain a sense of which groups were most affected by the Covid-induced recession. Wilkins noted the survey showed young people had already been facing an “increasingly less receptive labour market up until 2018”, with “declining full-time employment rates, even for graduates, and declining wages”. Using the Hilda data to 2018, young people were most likely to be working in jobs exposed to the effects of pandemic, representing 34.9% of all workers in these industries. Women were also overrepresented, making up 49.5% of people employed in the worst-affected industries, but only 47.4% of people employed in other industries. Wilkins said the government’s jobmaker hiring credit would offer “marginal” help to young people, but he said they were already “fighting a more hostile economic environment”. The survey put the women’s participation rate at 72.5% in 2018, the highest rate in its history. But there was also risk the recession would unwind improvements to the gender pay and employment gap, which Wilkins said had been closing since 2012. Declining home ownership rates finally came to a halt between 2014 and 2018, with a slight uptick in the proportion of adults who were home owners from 51.6% to 51.9%. Overall wealth also increased between 2014 and 2018, but the growth was driven by older couples who have seen a dramatic increase in their household wealth. The measure improved for all groups, except single parents who had gone backwards since 2005. Older couples reached $1m in median household wealth in 2018, up from $791,736 in 2014, and $454,557 in 2002. By location, household wealth was also highest in Melbourne, followed by Sydney and Perth. Hilda put the median annual household disposable income at $81,310 in 2018, lower than the 2009 figure of $82,236, and a slight improvement from 2017 ($80,100). Once again, single-parent families saw a large drop in their median incomes, from approximately $38,000 to approximately $34,000 between 2016 and 2018. The Hilda report included an estimate of the proportion of workers who were earning less than the national minimum wage. Wilkins said the researchers decided to probe the issue amid increasing public attention on cases of wage underpayment. Hilda found 9.9% of all adult employees appeared to be receiving less than the minimum wage, a proportion that had remained stable since 2007. Notably, 40.5% of employees in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industry appeared to be receiving less than the minimum, while the same was true for 35.1% of people working in accommodation and food services. Wilkins said the “piece rate” agreements would have been a factor in the agriculture findings, but the hospitality figure was “consistent with the cases that have come to light” in the industry. Caveats to the figures included that some workers may have misreported their income or hours and that the minimum wage might not apply in certain cases. But he added that while very few people should be receiving less than the minimum, most should legally receive more because award minimums tended to be higher. The survey noted life satisfaction among Australians had been relatively stable, though people were less satisfied with their lives in 2018 than they were in 2001. Wilkins said even this likely reflected “social desirability bias” in the early years of the survey. He noted this disappeared over time in a longitudinal study when participants became more comfortable taking part. The report found people over the age of 65 were most satisfied, followed by people 15-24 years old. For the first time, the survey collected data about pet ownership. It found 62% of Australians own at least one pet. Dogs were more common (44%) than cats (23%), followed by fish (18%), birds (16%) and horses (3.6%). Victorians were more likely to own a cat and no dog, while the opposite was true of people living in New South Wales and Queensland."
"Whitehaven Coal has pleaded guilty to 19 charges brought against it by the state’s resources regulator for breaches of mining laws that caused environmental damage that could last for decades. The regulator commenced prosecution in the NSW Land and Environment court in August against the mining company’s subsidiaries Narrabri Coal and Narrabri Coal Operations for breaches of exploration licences at an underground mine site in the Pilliga region of north-west New South Wales. Earlier this week, the regulator rejected Whitehaven’s proposal to pay $50,000 to the NSW Minerals Council as part of a settlement, saying it would be out of line with community expectations. The regulator said the unauthorised destruction of vegetation, including 13 hollow-bearing trees, to clear access tracks was particularly concerning and had caused “significant environmental harm” that could take decades to recover from. Other offences related to the unauthorised construction of tracks and drilling of bores as well as a failure to rehabilitate drill sites. In a directions hearing on Friday, the mining company pleaded guilty to all charges – 10 against Narrabri Coal and nine directed at Narrabri Coal Operations. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of $1.1m. A date for a sentencing hearing will be set by the court next week. Whitehaven had proposed to settle the case with an enforceable undertaking that included a $150,000 payment to Gunnedah Shire council towards the operational costs of a new koala park once the park was established. The company also proposed paying the state minerals council $50,000 to put towards producing industry guidance on “leading practice in exploration”. But the regulator rejected the proposal due to “the seriousness of the conduct alleged and the collective merits of the initiatives proposed”. In a list of reasons for his decision, the regulator’s executive director, Anthony Keon, said the offending behaviour was “significant and at the higher end of the scale” and that it was “demonstrative of a comprehensive failure to meet fundamental regulatory obligations in relation to the approvals (and restrictions) obtained.” Keon also had concerns about the proposed $50,000 payment to the minerals council to develop exploration guidance for the mining industry. He wrote that while the concept was worthwhile, the “only enforceable deliverable in the undertaking is the payment of the monies with the final deliverable resting with the minerals council”. “I am further of the view that the community would be rightly concerned with a project that involves payment to an industry advocacy group,” the decision states. With regards to the koala park, Keon wrote that the proposed $150,000 payment lacked sufficient detail to ensure benefits were delivered to the community in the event the planned park didn’t eventuate. Other measures Whitehaven put forward included $50,000 for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy to support an endangered mammal reintroduction program in the Pilliga Forest and $203,500 to pay the regulator’s unrecoverable costs associated with investigating the alleged breaches. The regulator noted Whitehaven had taken steps to “remedy the alleged offending behaviour”, had complied with the suspension of its exploration licence, and undertaken rehabilitation work. But Keon wrote that such governance arrangements “should have been in place prior to the alleged contraventions taking place given the size and scale of the operations”. A Whitehaven spokesperson said the company would not comment on the matters before the court. But the company previously acknowledged the alleged breaches were “an unacceptable incident”. “In response, the company took immediate rehabilitation action and implemented a range of longer term management measures to ensure compliance with its environmental obligations in the Narrabri exploration lease area,” the spokesperson said. “This included commissioning independent and comprehensive reviews of systems and processes, implementing the full suite of remedial measures arising from these reviews, and having the full implementation of these measures independently verified.” The anti-mining group Lock the Gate welcomed the regulator’s decision to proceed with the legal action. “It’s a sad joke that Whitehaven’s idea of an enforceable undertaking is to pay money to its own industry body, who have led the charge in NSW to weaken controls on mining. It reveals Whitehaven’s contempt for the law,” Sally Hunter, a Boggabri farmer, said before the company pleaded guilty on Friday. “It is such a relief to hear that the resources regulator is willing to stand up to this company in a court of law.” Hunter said she hoped the case would lead to the concerns of farmers in the region being taken seriously. “We hope the court recognises the significance of the offences and that Whitehaven receives fines that reflect the community’s absolute outrage over this company’s illegal behaviour.”"
"Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has chosen to build a “British” 4x4 inspired by the Land Rover Defender in France, rather than Bridgend in Wales. Ratcliffe, who has built up an estimated £12.15bn fortune from petrochemicals company Ineos, announced on Tuesday that the Ineos Grenadier vehicle will be built at the Smart factory in Hambach, close to the French-German border. The deal will “safeguard” 1,300 jobs at the factory, but dash hopes for an automotive revival in south Wales. Ratcliffe, a vocal Brexit supporter who recently left the UK for tax-free Monaco, said Hambach had presented the company with “a unique opportunity that we simply could not ignore”. He said that in Hambach, Ineos was buying “a modern automotive manufacturing facility with a world-class workforce”. “Ineos Automotive set out a vision to build the world’s best utilitarian 4x4, and at our new home in Hambach, we will do just that,” he added. Ratcliffe last year announced plans to build a factory in Bridgend and employ 500 British people building the new vehicle. “We have looked long and hard at possible manufacturing locations for Grenadier across the world with lots of good options to choose from,” he said in September 2019. “The decision to build in the UK is a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing, which has always been at the heart of what Ineos stands for.” When Ratcliffe announced plans for the Grenadier – which is named after the pub near Buckingham Palace where he first conceived of the idea – the billionaire said: “Our preference is to build it in the UK. “We’d like to retain the Britishness and have a bit of passion about UK manufacturing,” he told Sun readers at the time. “We believe that Britain can produce something as reliable as Germany or Japan if we do it well.” However on Tuesday, Ratcliffe announced that Ineos had bought the Hambach factory from Mercedes-Benz and would start building the 4x4 there in late 2021. “The acquisition secures the future of the site and safeguards many jobs that might otherwise have been lost,” Ineos said. Dirk Heilmann, chief executive of Ineos Automotive, said: “This acquisition marks our biggest milestone yet in the development of the Grenadier. Alongside the exhaustive testing programme that our prototype vehicles are now undergoing, we can now begin preparations at Hambach to build our 4x4 from late next year for delivery to our customers around the globe.” Ratcliffe said he came up with the idea of pumping £500m into creating a successor to the Defender over beers in the Grenadier pub in Belgravia, London. He had already selected German, rather than British, engineers to create the designs for the vehicle. The Ineos chairman and majority shareholder said he wanted to create a “rugged, uncompromising, no frills” spiritual successor to the original Defender because of his love for the vehicle, which is also a favourite of the Queen. “When I’m on safari in Africa I always prefer to be in a Land Rover,” he said. “But I always carry a picnic basket.” Jaguar Land Rover ceased producing the original design of the Land Rover Defender in 2016 after 68 years but launched its own all-new version earlier this year. According to the latest Sunday Times rich list, Ratcliffe is worth just over £12bn, making him the fifth richest person in the UK."
"Security firm G4S has agreed to a sweetened takeover offer from its US rival Allied Universal Security Services, which values the British company at £3.8bn. Under the terms of the cash offer, G4S shareholders would receive 245p a share. This is an improvement on the 210p a share previously offered by Allied Universal, which G4S said significantly undervalued the company. G4S, which operates services including running four British prisons and managing 21 UK Covid-19 test centres, has been heavily criticised following a series of scandals about its work on UK government contracts. Allied Universal said its offer included a significant premium on G4S’s share price at the beginning of the offer period in September. However, the UK firm’s stock has jumped in the last three months since a bidding war intensified between two of its overseas rivals, and its shares closed at 255p on Tuesday. G4S has been fighting off hostile takeover bids from its smaller Canadian suitor GardaWorld for several months. GardaWorld made a final bid of 235p a share earlier this month, valuing G4S at £3.68bn. The directors of Allied Universal and G4S said that the combined company would create a “world-leading integrated security business with revenues of approximately $18bn (£13.5bn), a strong international platform and an extensive portfolio of blue-chip clients across the public and private sectors”. G4S’s chairman, John Connolly, recommended that shareholders vote to accept the offer, which he said “represents an excellent opportunity to create a leading global security company, for shareholders to realise value for their investment at an attractive premium, while also ensuring the future success of G4S for employees, customers and other stakeholders”. Allied Universal said that US regulators had already given the go-ahead for the merger to proceed. G4S employs 533,000 people across 85 countries, with its biggest business in North America. The firm has repeatedly hit the headlines after being stripped of several government contracts, including its contract to run HMP Birmingham, but the majority of its work emanates from corporate contracts. G4S runs cash-handling services and provides security operations, including at the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station."
"Honda is to pause production at its UK plant on Wednesday because of a shortage of car parts caused by delays in getting parts into Britain in the run-up to the end of the Brexit transition period, according to reports. The car company, which relies on “just in time” and “just in sequence” supplies, told the BBC on Wednesday the decision was “due to transport-related parts delay” as ports are hit by Brexit demand and coronavirus restrictions. “The situation is currently being monitored with a view to restart production as soon as possible,” Honda said. Honda’s Swindon factory in south-west England built just under 110,000 cars last year but is due to close permanently next year. The company is looking at alternative arrangements, such as flying parts in, but production could grind to a halt as early as Wednesday. The carmaker joins a growing number of businesses complaining of disruption that can be traced back to the ports. Builders are reporting shortages of power tools, timber and roof tiles while retailers are struggling to get stock into stores in time for Christmas. Roads in Kent were hit by lorry queues on Tuesday for the fourth day in two weeks, with the congestion caused by a combination of Brexit stockpiling and a reduction in the number of ferries because of Covid. Ten days ago five-mile tailbacks developed on the M20 after France started to test its new immigration system. Operation Brock contingency plans for Brexit on Kent motorways will be introduced on Friday ahead of the end of the transition period. The situation at the ports has been described as a perfect storm with operators overwhelmed by a surge in freight volumes at a time when their ability to handle it is hampered by coronavirus restrictions. Since September, the country’s biggest container port, Felixstowe, has been struggling to cope as firms rushed to replenish stock after lockdown ended while simultaneously building stockpiles before the final Brexit deadline. Last month, the Guardian revealed that 11,000 containers of government-procured PPE were part of the problem at Felixstowe. That backlog has since been reduced to about 4,000 and should be cleared by Christmas. Congestion at Felixstowe is a problem for the whole country as it handles about 40% of all the containers coming into and out of the UK. However, the congestion has spread to other ports including Southampton and London Gateway. The Builders Merchants Federation told the Guardian that port delays were becoming a “major issue” with shipments taking up to four weeks to get through. The situation was of major concern because it was preventing companies from building up Brexit stockpiles. In recent weeks the picture of congestion has prompted vessels to “cut and run” – either partially unloading or skipping UK calls altogether and dumping cargo at Rotterdam, Antwerp and Zeebrugge instead. Some carriers are discussing not calling at Felixstowe until February because of fears it will remain clogged. The disruption faced by Honda is a potentially worrying signal as the Brexit talks go the wire. Carmakers have been moving cars and parts both ways across the Channel to make sure they can cope if the UK and EU fail to agree a trade deal."
"Shoppers face temporary shortages of some fresh foods and higher prices if the UK fails to strike a Brexit deal with the EU, the chairman of Tesco has warned. John Allan said a no-deal Brexit would trigger tariffs, “which can be quite substantial on some food items”. “Those almost inevitably are going to lead to higher prices and I think if we go out on no-deal basis that is unavoidable,” Allan told Bloomberg TV. The chairman of Britain’s biggest supermarket warned that the end of the transition period could trigger temporary disruption of food imports and lead to gaps on supermarket shelves, although he urged shoppers not to panic-buy. “We may see some shortages of fresh foods, particularly short-life fresh foods. I think that will only be for a limited period, perhaps a month or two, before we get back to normal,” Allan said. “I don’t think there is any reason at all for any consumer to panic or panic buy at the moment. There is still going to be plenty of food in the UK – there may just be slightly restricted choice for a period of time.” Tesco, along with its competitors, has been preparing for a possible no-deal scenario by stockpiling longlife products in its warehouses and with its suppliers. Allan said Tesco had been working to “minimise the risk of food being caught in what is probably going to be the most difficult place, which is the port of Dover and alongside” and had been diverting some of its shipments to other UK ports. However, this comes at a time when British ports have become congested and are struggling to cope with the simultaneous pressures of arrivals of Christmas goods, Brexit stockpiling, and coronavirus restrictions. Price increases faced by British shoppers in the event of a no-deal Brexit would be determined by how much imported food they put in their baskets, Allan said, estimating an average cost increase of 3%-5%. “Some of the tariffs on imported dairy products, French cheeses for instance, can be as high as 40%-plus. If you eat a lot of UK-produced food, it will have less impact,” he said. Whether deal or no deal, a concession from the EU would allow Tesco and other supermarkets with a presence in Northern Ireland to continue supplying shops in the province without special Brexit checks. Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer, Asda and other trusted traders in the food sector would be given a grace period before the checks were required, meaning sausages, burgers and cheeses would not need to examined individually at ports. Sainsbury’s recently raised concerns that it would have to curb meat, dairy and fish supplies to Northern Ireland because of the Brexit checks."
"A steep fall in tax receipts and the extra cost of government subsidies for businesses and the self-employed pushed UK government borrowing last month to its highest level for October since records began in 1993. In the latest reading of the government’s finances ahead of the chancellor’s spending review next week, the Office for National Statistics said monthly borrowing had hit £22.3bn in October, up more than £10bn on the same month last year. October’s borrowing pushed Britain’s debt mountain to about £2,076.8bn, the ONS said, or 100.8% as a proportion of GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio is now at levels last seen in the 1960-61 financial year, when Harold Macmillan was prime minister and Britain was paying down debt incurred in the second world war. The deficit in October was not as bad as the £35bn many expected after a strong bounce back in the economy during the summer months that prevented steeper falls in tax receipts. In a boost to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who has faced pressure from many Tory backbenchers to restrain government spending, the total deficit since April was £77bn lower than estimated in July by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent forecaster. However, the annual deficit was still on course to reach £400bn by the end of the financial year in April following the government’s decision to impose a second lockdown and maintain the furlough scheme into 2021. Responding to the ONS figures, Sunak said: “We’ve provided over £200bn of support to protect the economy, lives and livelihoods from the significant and far-reaching impacts of coronavirus. “This is the responsible thing to do, but it’s also clear that over time it’s right we ensure the public finances are put on a sustainable path.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that while the deficit was lower than the OBR forecast, the first seven months of the year had already outstripped the annual deficit following the 2008 banking crash. “In just seven months borrowing is already a greater share of this year’s national income than over the whole of 2009-10, when borrowing peaked during the financial crisis,” it said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said there was worse to come following the second lockdown, which would probably cause a renewed rise in the pace of borrowing in the coming months. “We expect the deficit to reach about £420bn – or 21.7% of GDP – in 2020-21,” he said. The ONS said tax receipts were estimated at £39.7bn in October, £2.7bn lower than in October 2019, with falls in VAT, business rates and income tax causing the most damage. Meanwhile, government bodies spent £71.3bn on day-to-day activities, up £6.4bn on the same month last year. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said it was difficult to estimate the annual deficit while the extent and duration of the government’s restrictions remained unclear, although he expected the deficit to hit £400bn. He said: “Public finances are set to come under increased upward pressure from the cost of recent extra measures to support the economy and jobs, most notably the extension of the furlough scheme. “The likely renewed economic contraction in the fourth quarter, caused by the national lockdown in England, will reduce receipts and further put up the deficit,” he added. Central government paid £4.3bn in subsidies to businesses and households in October, according to the ONS. Despite higher borrowing and an increased debt pile, interest payments on the government’s outstanding debt were £2bn in October – £4.4bn less than in the same month last year."
"Norwegian Air said it is facing a “very uncertain future” after the government of Norway refused to grant further financial assistance to the airline. The carrier was bailed out through state aid with stringent conditions attached in the spring, after the first wave of the coronavirus and the grounding of airline fleets. However, with a further winter lockdown in many markets and a slower recovery than hoped, Norwegian had appealed for further aid. On Monday, Norwegian said the Oslo government had announced the airline would not receive the further financial support that the carrier “had clearly communicated was necessary to maintain operations throughout the Covid-19 crisis”. Although, until this year, the airline had operated entirely independently of the Norwegian state – and in the past had attracted the ire of unions in Oslo for its use of cheaper, foreign crews – its chief executive, Jacob Schram, said: “We are called Norwegian, we are Norwegian. We are a part of Norway and Norway is a part of us. This is the way it has been for almost 20 years. “The fact that our government has decided to refrain from providing Norwegian with further financial support is very disappointing and feels like a slap in the face for everybody at Norwegian who is fighting for the company when our competitors are receiving billions in funding from their respective governments.” The airline said it would now be forced to furlough another 1,600 staff, leaving only 600 employed out of more than 10,000 people at the start of the pandemic. It said it would park all but six aircraft and operate only domestic routes through the winter. Norwegian was operating a fleet of well over 100 planes from a number of European bases before the pandemic. It pioneered low-cost, long-haul flights, offering cheap no-frills fares across the Atlantic in particular. Before the coronavirus crisis it was also a significant player in the UK’s leisure and short-haul market, and one of the biggest airlines at London Gatwick. However, it had long been tipped for failure by rivals, who saw its rapid expansion and borrowing as unsustainable. Norwegian argued it had anticipated record profits in 2020 before the pandemic struck, after restructuring the company. Schram said: “We could clearly see the results of our hard work to go from growth to profitability, which was initiated in 2018. With further support to get Norwegian through this unprecedented crisis for the aviation industry, we would come out as a more sustainable and competitive airline.” The rescue deal agreed in May resulted in Oslo ploughing 3bn kroner (£255m) into Norwegian, after aircraft lessors and other major creditors agreed to write off much of the airline’s debt. By August, Norwegian indicated that the funding would not be sufficient to guarantee its survival, after reporting losses of 5.3bn kroner for the first half of 2020."
"Countrywide, the estate agency group that owns Hamptons International and Gascoigne-Pees, has received a £82m takeover approach from its rival Connells. Countrywide, the UK’s largest listed estate agent group with 731 branches, said it had received an indicative approach from Connells at 250p a share in cash, which would take it back into private ownership. Countrywide shares surged 48% to 214.8p on the news. Connells, an estate agency group with nearly 600 branches that is a subsidiary of Skipton Building Society, said it had approached Countrywide’s board on 26 October and was scrutinising its books before deciding whether to make a firm offer. It said: “The board of Countrywide has indicated that Countrywide is in urgent need of recapitalisation to reduce its net debt and lessen its exposure to its lenders. The board of Countrywide believes that, in the absence of a recapitalisation, Countrywide is unlikely to be able to execute its business strategy over the short and medium term and there is a risk that it could end up in administration, with Countrywide shareholders losing all or a substantial portion of their investment.” Connells added that Countrywide needed a new management team and a strategy to turn around the business along with significant investment in its technology, network and people after years of mounting losses. Countrywide has debts of £91.9m and has been closing branches. Countrywide sells and rents properties through 60 high street brands including Bairstow Eves and King & Chasemore. When the company floated on the stock market in March 2013, it was worth £750m. Connells’ 25 brands include Allen & Harris, Bagshaws Residential, Fox & Sons, and Barnard Marcus in London. Countrywide said it was postponing a special meeting of shareholders, due to be held on 18 November, at which it would have sought approval for a rival move made by the private equity firm Alchemy last month. Alchemy, a Countrywide shareholder with a 2% holding, proposed a £90m investment in return for a management shake-up, including the removal of the chairman, Peter Long, and the appointment of a new chief executive to replace Paul Creffield. Long would be replaced by Carl Leaver, a former senior executive at Marks & Spencer who previously ran the gambling group Gala Coral and the financial firm DeVere. Connells said its offer would avoid the “significant costs and risks” associated with the Alchemy proposal. The approach from Connells comes eight months after LSL Property Services, which owns Your Move, abandoned a planned all-share merger with Countrywide that would have brought together two of Britain’s biggest estate agency groups."
"Sales of scented candles and retailers’ premium food ranges have soared as cold weather and coronavirus restrictions encourage Britons to hunker down for winter. While the tightening of government rules has not led to a repeat of the stockpiling in the spring, they are still having a big impact on shoppers’ mindsets. Sales of scented candles, potpourri and essential oils for diffusers jumped 29% in October, according to the research group Kantar, while shoppers spent £56m more on premium own-label food and drink brands during the month. Fraser McKevitt, the Kantar head of retail and consumer insight, said shoppers in Wales had spent an extra £10 a week on groceries during its recent firebreak lockdown but the increased spending “did not provide any evidence of stockpiling”. Initial figures for England also suggest “no sign of panic buying”. The prospect of spending less time out and about during winter means people are “hunkering down with seasonal comforts and making the best of life at home”, McKevitt said. Spending on premium supermarket own-label products such as wine, chocolate and fresh meat was 18% higher than in October 2019. The pandemic had an impact on Halloween celebrations with £9m spent on pumpkins, which was the same as in 2019, but sales of sweets for trick-or-treaters were down 2.3% as children were forced to stay home. The operating restrictions faced by restaurant and pub chains have also a positive impact on sales at Bisto maker Premier Foods. Alex Whitehouse, the chief executive, said: “Britain has got cooking again” as more shoppers bought ingredients such as stock cubes and sauces. Sales at its grocery brands division, which includes store cupboard staples such as Bisto gravy granules and McDougalls flour, were up 13% in the three months to 26 September. The Kantar data showed UK grocery sales increased by 9.3% during the 12 weeks to 1 November with “no significant spike in demand” in the most recent four weeks, despite a variety of restrictions coming into force across the country. However, the figures also revealed a huge increase in demand for frozen food with sales up 14% over the period. This surge was good news for Iceland, which was the UK’s fastest-growing supermarket chain with sales up 17.9% and the average shopper spending nearly 50% more per visit than in 2019. “Frozen food has been a hot ticket since the beginning of the pandemic,” said McKevitt, who pointed to a spike in sales of fridge-freezers over the summer that showed “the desire for long-lasting provisions in the current climate”."
"Britain’s economy is set for a pre-Christmas slump with further job losses and shop closures, despite government measures to protect businesses during the latest Covid-19 restrictions. Surveys of business activity reveal a sharp decline as tough new restrictions were launched across the UK amid the second coronavirus wave, setting the stage for a difficult winter ahead as the economy plunges into reverse. While the damage to many industries will be less severe than during the first lockdown, the accountancy firm BDO said measures of business confidence and output fell in October for the first time since April. A separate study by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the recruitment firm Adecco showed almost a third of UK companies plan to make redundancies over the final months of the year. Gerwyn Davies, the senior labour market adviser for the CIPD, said: “The best that can be said is that the situation is getting worse more slowly. Employment looks set to keep falling and the relatively weak demand for labour means that it is going to be a long and hard winter, affecting young jobseekers in particular.” Although job losses are expected to rise, the survey of more than 1,000 human resources managers suggested the economy outlook was more resilient than during the first wave of Covid-19. With more companies expected to remain open and after firms have already cut significant numbers of jobs, the CIPD and Adecco said 30% of firms expected to make redundancies in the final months of 2020, down from 33% in the summer. This is still higher than 22% of companies that planned job cuts before coronavirus spread to the UK. BDO said its index of business output – which is compiled from surveys of more than 4,000 firms – dropped to 77.09 in October from 77.95 in September, on a scale where anything above 95 indicates economic growth. The figure is, however, higher than a record low of 44.9 recorded during the first lockdown in April. Official figures for Britain’s economy due this week are expected to show the fastest quarterly GDP growth on record in the three months to September, with economists pencilling in a 15.8% growth rate for the summer months. However, the Bank of England has warned that a return to lockdown amid the second Covid wave would spark a double-dip recession, with GDP expected to fall 2% in the final quarter. Although the Bank still expects an 11% decline in GDP for the year as a whole, the second dip of the 2020 recession is significantly below a 20% plunge in the three months to June. The renewed signs of an economic slump come as businesses across the UK temporarily close their doors or suffer from severely reduced demand as the second English lockdown and tough measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to contain Covid-19 hit the economy. However, more businesses are expected to stay open under the new controls, which allow pubs and restaurants to offer takeaways and for shops to use click and collect. The construction, manufacturing and property industries also remain open, despite a sharp drop in activity as the wider economy sinks into reverse. The damage from the second set of restrictions is however expected to exacerbate the hit to companies suffered during the first wave of Covid-19. As many as 5,552 retail outlets enter the new controls after temporarily closing in March without managing to reopen over the summer, according to research from accountancy firm PwC. It said the amount of floor space nationwide of shops that remain temporarily frozen is equivalent to 888 acres (360 hectares) of land – equivalent to 36 times the size of London Waterloo station – spread across high streets, retail parks and shopping centres nationwide. Kaley Crossthwaite, a partner at BDO, said: “The green shoots of recovery which started to emerge in May have been dealt a blow by the announcement of a second lockdown. “While the extension of the furlough scheme until March is welcome news for employees in the immediate term, uncertainty looms over sustainable job security and fears of mass redundancies have merely been pushed back rather than solved.”"
"The FTSE 100 posted its biggest one-day gain since March on Monday after the drug companies Pfizer and BioNTech said their prospective coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. The news jolted global stock market indices to record levels but it also highlighted the stark divergences in fortunes across sectors during the pandemic. Those companies who gained from people spending their work and leisure time at home were among the biggest losers on Monday, while the vaccine news offered some welcome relief to previously hard-hit sectors such as travel and events. Rolls-Royce – up 44% Aviation has been stricken by the pandemic. Rolls-Royce lost out because it earns money on maintenance contracts based on the hours flown by its jet engines. However, the prospect of a faster return for aviation could increase its revenues rapidly. International Airlines Group – up 25% The owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, has said it could survive months with no revenues but the prospect of a vaccine could quickly raise confidence in the stricken airline sector. In the US, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines all rallied more than 14%. British Land – up 22% Even if a vaccine takes months to be widely available, the promise of a return to city centre offices and retail has been a boon to the UK’s largest property developer, British Land. The conference company Informa, also up 22%, would benefit from the same dynamic. ExxonMobil – up 13% The prospect of increased economic activity across the world boosted oil prices. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the US’s biggest oil producers, gained 13% each, although they both remain down by more than a third this year as analysts wonder if the oil industry has had its peak. Carnival – up 38% Carnival’s cruise ships suffered multiple outbreaks onboard, early in the pandemic. A vaccine would give light on the horizon. Cineworld – up 40% The world’s second-largest cinema chain, Cineworld, closed all of its UK and US branches last month after the repeated cancellation of potential blockbuster films such as the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise. A vaccine could draw Hollywood releases back out. Fresnillo – down 15% Investors generally see gold as a safe haven by investors in times of trouble but the hopeful vaccine news caused prices of the yellow metal to drop rapidly, hitting miners such as Fresnillo and Polymetal International. Ocado – down 12% The grocery delivery retailer and technology company Ocado has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rapid rise in online shopping during the pandemic. Although it fell back on Monday, many analysts think the pandemic has permanently expanded its market. Just Eat – down 9% One of the few luxuries available throughout various lockdowns has been takeaway food delivery, through apps such as Just Eat. If vaccines allow lockdown to ease, that spending could move back to restaurants. Zoom Video Communications – down 14% If there is one company that will be indelibly linked to the pandemic, it is Zoom, the video conferencing application. Its growth might slow if work and social meetings are allowed again but its value has still septupled during 2020. Peloton Interactive – down 16% Peloton, which sells exercise bikes equipped with a screen for livestreaming classes, survived a rocky flotation in 2019 but stay-at-home fitness boomed during the pandemic. All those extra customers mean its value is still more than three times higher than at the start of 2020."
"Rishi Sunak has extended the government’s furlough scheme until March, but Tuesday’s employment figures underlined the impact that coronavirus is having on the jobs market. The unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.8% between the second and third quarters of 2020, while a record 314,000 people lost their jobs in the three months to September. Here are some stories from the frontline of the Covid employment crisis. Peter McGinn, 26, assistant retail manager, Manchester Peter McGinn was made redundant from his role as an assistant manager in September after working six years for Boots in Manchester. “I started part-time while I was at university and when I finished I progressed through the ranks,” said McGinn. “It was the only proper job I’ve had apart from bar work.” He worked throughout the first national lockdown and since losing his job has applied for about 40 roles, most of which he hasn’t heard back from. “There have been a few rejections but no interviews at the moment. I applied for a role at the Co-op and after I had submitted my application I saw that the job had been taken down. “I like to be out busy doing things all the time so it can be quite hard being at home. I feel OK about the future but I think it will be hard for me to get a job as stable as the one before. Universal credit is my only source of income so finding one is a necessity to live.” Alison Luckham, 58, dental nurse, Bognor Regis Alison Luckham, a dental nurse who lives in Bognor Regis, was made redundant on 19 March. She has applied for jobs since but is living on universal credit. “It took five weeks to get the first payment,” said Luckham. “I ended up taking a universal credit loan, so I have to pay back £68 a month out of my benefits. “I’ve budgeted £25 a week for food which means no money for petrol so I walk to do the shopping. It’s desperate. I have to fly by the seat of my pants every day. I can’t even think about what might happen in a month’s time.” She has considered debt management but wants to avoid it if possible. “I can’t bear thinking about it as it can affect your credit rating but I’m hoping I can dig myself out of this hole I’ve been chucked into.  “I do have an upcoming job opportunity though in a dental practice that involves beauty therapy, which is something I did in my 30s, so I’m hoping it will work out.” Savannah Southorn, 21, graduate, West Midlands For graduate Savannah Southorn, her experience has been “demotivating” after applying for more than 100 jobs since the summer. “Most of the time you don’t even hear back,” said Southorn. After graduating with a degree in history she moved back home and is living with her parents. “It’s quite hard for someone straight out of university as you’re competing for jobs with people who have been made redundant and are more skilled than you. It makes you wonder what’s the point? “I have some savings and am on universal credit but I’m not really optimistic as we’re in a second lockdown now and it feels like deja vu. It’s hard to see when things will get better but everyone is in the same position.” She is anxious for what will happen in the future: “There’s often uncertainty graduating from university, and I was just beginning to find my place in society, but the pandemic has made things even worse.” Eleanor Doyle, 23, barista, Liverpool “I feel quite pessimistic but I’ve got to just keep applying,” said Eleanor Doyle, who was made redundant last week from her job as a barista in a small independent restaurant. Doyle, who lives in Liverpool, started the role just before the first lockdown but was not eligible for furlough. She volunteered for some shifts, some of which were paid, to help with takeaways. “I’m heartbroken for the business owners as they worked really hard to stay open. They were donating meals to homeless people and schools to help support them.” She contracted coronavirus in October at the same time five close family members were made redundant. “We’re all going through a similar thing so empathy is a big part of us getting through this. I have savings in my master’s fund as I plan on going back to university next year but I may have to dip into it if I can’t find a job.”"
"Restaurants, cafes and pubs claimed more than £849m through the government’s month-long “eat out to help out” scheme, as diners bought more than 160m discounted meals in August. More than 49,000 businesses had made a claim for the government subsidy by the end of September, according to official HMRC figures. The scheme, designed to draw diners back into hospitality venues over the summer to support the sector, proved extremely popular with consumers. The initiative offered a half-price discount up to a maximum of £10 per head on food and non-alcoholic drinks from Mondays to Wednesdays in August. Diners received an average discount of £5.24 per meal, according to the figures. The scheme was such a hit that many restaurants called on the chancellor to extend it. As a result of its popularity, the scheme has cost the Treasury over two-thirds more than the £500m Rishi Sunak set aside for it in the July mini-budget. Use of the scheme increased steadily throughout August, as the number of discounted meals and total value of claims grew each week. A study from the University of Warwick suggested that eat out to help out could have directly caused a sixth of new coronavirus case clusters over the summer, a claim rejected by the Treasury. Official figures showed more than half (55%) of claims were made by restaurants, while just under a third (28%) were made by pubs. More than nine in 10 claims were made by businesses with just one participating outlet, although between them these venues only claimed half (52%) of the total discount, meaning chains received larger amounts of money from the government. Major nationwide chains including McDonald’s, Burger King, Nando’s, Pizza Hut and JD Wetherspoon signed up to the scheme, as well as the coffee retailer Costa. HMRC said 172 large businesses, with a total of more than 18,000 outlets between them, took part in the initiative, representing almost a quarter of participating locations. The figures showed less than 1% of claims were filed by businesses with more than 25 outlets, although these companies accounted for a third of the meals claimed for, and a quarter of total discount claimed."
"The three major music labels are operating “like a cartel” in the streaming era and the current system is threatening the future of music in the UK, according to evidence given on the first day of an inquiry into the impact of streaming on the music industry. During the digital, culture, media and sport select committee inquiry into the economics of music streaming, MPs heard from musicians including Ed O’Brien of Radiohead, Elbow’s Guy Garvey, and Tom Gray of Gomez, who painted a bleak picture of artists struggling to survive. Garvey said the “system as it is is threatening the future of music”, while equitable remuneration, increased transparency and user-centric streaming models were put forward as ways in which the industry could be reformed and made fairer for artists. Gray, who is the founder of #BrokenRecord Campaign, said some artists were still tied to contracts that included antiquated clauses, such as a 10% damage clause, which saw labels work on the assumption that 10% of CDs would be broken in transport. An artist’s share is then worked out from the remaining 90%, despite the fact in the streaming age barely any CDs are sold. Tom Frederikse, a solicitor and former producer, who also gave evidence, said in some cases the damage clause was as high as 25%. “What’s very clear is over 70% of consumers think artists are underpaid. As soon as anyone sees this data and learns the terms of the payment deal, everyone comes to the same conclusion: it’s not right,” said Gray. After hearing the evidence, Julie Elliott MP said it sounded as if the three major labels – Warner Brothers, Sony and Universal – were operating “like a cartel” because of what Gray called “suspiciously similar” artist contracts. Gray referred to a recent YouGov poll which found that 77% of customers believed artists were not getting a fair deal, and reports that Universal recorded revenues of $1.14bn in the last quarter despite the global pandemic and economic downturn. MPs heard that the huge profits seen by major labels were not trickling down to artists who, in the case of Nadine Shah who also gave evidence, were struggling to make ends meet in the streaming era. Streaming was worth around £1bn last year, however, artists had been reportedly paid only 13% of the income generated. The musicians said artists were having to adapt to a streaming model that had rapidly replaced the system that existed when they were first signed. O’Brien said when Radiohead were signed in 1991 there were huge imbalances but that the streaming era had exacerbated them. “It’s interesting to see your reaction to the testimony this morning because you’re becoming aware of the unfairness and the opaqueness within the business, and then you’re bolting on this digital model. And it’s not working,” he said. Garvey said Elbow had recently shortened the intro of a track so that it would be more likely to appear on playlists. Gray told the committee that genres such as jazz and classical were struggling because their longer length tracks don’t suit the playlist system, which he said benefits easy listening and muzak. Gray also told the committee he had heard of cases in which people who ran influential playlists on streaming platforms were being paid to include tracks, calling it a modern form of “payola”. The inquiry continues and will hear the “perspectives of industry experts, artists and record labels as well as streaming platforms themselves”. The chair, Julian Knight MP, said the goal was to ask whether the business models used by major streaming platforms were “fair to the writers and performers who provide the material”."
"The chief executive of online retailer AO.com has suggested supermarket executives “ask their mum” about whether they should repay nearly £2bn in business rates relief. Like supermarkets, AO has benefited from lockdown living trends, with UK sales up 54% as Britons kitted out home offices and upgraded their TVs and fridge freezers. John Roberts said Bolton-based AO had not accepted any government help and had returned £300,000 of business rates and furlough support.He said the health crisis was a societal challenge and “businesses should do their bit. We live by the mantra of ‘if I have to go and explain our actions to my mum over dinner we should be proud of the decisions that we’ve taken’.” The government introduced a year-long business rates holiday in March to help struggling retailers cope with the lockdown. However, the supermarkets, where sales have boomed albeit alongside higher running costs, have been among the scheme’s big beneficiaries. This has led to fierce criticism of dividend payments made to shareholders by the three listed chains of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. In total, the big six supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrison, Aldi and Lidl – will save £1.9bn in bills during the tax year to 31 March 2021, according to figures from Altus Group, a property adviser. Roberts declined to comment on whether the money should be returned, but suggested “maybe they should go and ask their mum?” His comments came as AO said overall sales had increased 53% to £717m in the six months to 30 September. The pre-tax profit of £18.3m compared with last year’s near £6m loss. With coronavirus restrictions forcing non-essential shops to close more than once AO has benefited from consumers being forced to shop online. That had changed how big domestic appliances, such as fridge freezers and washing machines, would be bought “forever”, says Roberts. -Seventy percent of the market is now online. The strong trading picture continued in the autumn with shoppers taking advantage of Black Friday deals to buy TVs, wireless headphones and coffee makers. The unusually high levels of demand for appliances coupled with delays at the ports was leading to shortages of products such as printers, washing machines and tumble dryers. The altered shopping landscape had revived investor interest in AO which floated six years ago. The share price has quadrupled this year with Richard Hunter, head of markets at investment platform Interactive Investor, describing it as “comfortably the best performer in the FTSE350”. Whether the company’s “meteoric” growth could continue, Hunter said, was the big question but the share price had “rewarded shareholders handsomely”."
"The UK automotive sector risks losing £55bn in manufacturing value within five years in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to new industry analysis. British car production could drop below 1m cars a year if there is no deal, compared with more than 1.3m in 2019, because tariffs would make large parts of the UK business unviable, said forecasts commissioned by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry lobby group. The car industry has endured a difficult year, as the coronavirus pandemic has forced the temporary closure of every factory in Europe and reduced demand for new cars. At the same time, European car companies spent £54bn last year on new electric car technologies to meet tightening carbon dioxide emissions rules. Trade negotiations between the UK and EU have still not reached a conclusion, with little more than a month to go until the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. EU ambassadors have been told a deal is close to being finalised, but there is still a risk of talks falling through. The car industry has been outspoken in its opposition to a no-deal Brexit, which would result in 10% tariffs being applied to their products overnight, adding £1,900 to the average cost of a car imported from the EU. Industry executives have warned that a no-deal Brexit would jeopardise the future of UK plants. PSA Group has said it will only build its new Vauxhall Astra in the UK if there is a trade deal, while Nissan has said the business model of its Sunderland plant – the largest car factory in the UK – would be destroyed. Nissan’s chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, last week reiterated that “obviously our UK business will not be sustainable” if there were no deal, in an interview with Reuters. However, the Japanese carmaker on Monday denied a report in German media that a decision to close the plant had already been made. All of the UK’s large car manufacturers have foreign owners. The presence of Japanese and other European carmakers in the UK was based in large part on easy access to Europe’s single market, meaning that the industry sees any barriers to trade as damaging. The SMMT study, carried out by consultancy Auto Analysis, found that even a “bare bones” trade deal would cost the industry £14.1bn. George Gillespie, the SMMT’s president and the executive chairman of Japanese-owned car testing company Horiba Mira, said: “We need a future trading relationship that works for automotive. We’ve already spent nigh on £1bn preparing for the unknown of Brexit and lost 28 times that to Covid. Let us not also be left counting the cost of tariffs, especially not by accident.”"
"The fashion chains Peacocks, Jaeger, Austin Reed and Jacques Vert have collapsed into administration, putting nearly 4,800 jobs at risk. The retailers are all part of entrepreneur Philip Day’s Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group (EWM), which warned last month it was on the brink of collapse. The Cardiff-based budget fashion chain Peacocks, which Albert Peacock founded as a penny bazaar in Warrington, Cheshire, in 1884, employs 4,369 staff across its 423 stores. Upmarket brand Jaeger, which was founded the same year by Lewis Tomalin, employs 347 people across 76 outlets. The Jaeger business also includes the formalwear chains Jacques Vert and Austin Reed. They were put into administration before a legal deadline on Friday after talks on a rescue package failed.  No redundancies or permanent store closures have so far been announced, and administrators said the businesses would continue to trade while they consider options for their future. Tony Wright, a joint administrator and partner at the advisory firm FRP, said: “Jaeger and Peacocks are attractive brands that have suffered the well-known challenges that many retailers face at present. We are in advanced discussions with a number of parties and working hard to secure a future for both businesses.” Day is thought to want to rescue Peacocks and potentially Jaeger, which is run by his daughter, but has been looking for a buyer for other brands, including Austin Reed and Jacques Vert. Potential buyers are thought to include Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group and TM Lewin’s owner, Torque Brands, which is controlled by the London-based finance group SCP Private Equity. Any deal is likely to need the backing of Day, who holds a charge over certain assets of the group – making him first in line above other creditors to recover debts. EWM said: “In recent weeks we have had constructive discussions with a number of potential buyers for Peacocks and Jaeger but the continuing deterioration of the retail sector due to the impact of the pandemic and second lockdown have made this process longer and more complex than we would have hoped.” The group said it could not extend further a standstill agreement agreed with the high court six weeks ago. EWM added: “Therefore, as directors, we have taken the desperately difficult decision to place Peacocks and Jaeger into administration while those talks continue. We will continue to do all we can to support FRP advisory in trying to secure the best outcome possible for these businesses.” Two other chains owned by Day – Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which specialises in knitwear and fashions for the over-50s, and Ponden Mill homewares – called in administrators earlier this month. Just under 900 people immediately lost their jobs and a further 2,000 roles remain at risk at those two chains. A number of other small brands that are part of Day’s main group – including the women’s fashion label Jane Norman and the knitwear label James Pringle – are not in administration. Bonmarché, the ailing 50-plus women’s fashion chain, which Day controls via a separate investment vehicle, is also not part of the latest administration process. The businesses have suffered from years of underinvestment and were ill-prepared for the massive switch to online shopping brought about by the pandemic. All fashion retailers were already under pressure from a slowdown in spending on clothing, but the shift to working from home, high street lockdowns, the fall in tourist numbers and the closure of pubs, clubs and bars have all increased the financial woes. A string of department store closures in recent years, including more than 40 Debenhams sites, at least 11 House of Fraser outlets and eight John Lewis stores have also hit smaller brands such as Jaeger, Jacques Vert and Austin Reed. The future of Debenhams continues to hang in the balance, as it owners consider potential rescue bids, while House of Fraser has warned it is likely to close more stores next year."
"Coronavirus may be doing its best to cancel Christmas but, for the time being anyway, shoppers are carrying on regardless, with this week’s Black Friday online sales expected to reach new heights. In previous years, store chiefs have agonised about the impact on their high street chains of the US-inspired discount event, which arrived on British shores with a bang in 2013. But come this (Black) Friday, selling online will – for anything other than essentials – be the only game in town for retailers, whose shops may by then be closed in three of the four home nations. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says lockdown 2 means a “seismic shift” towards online shopping this Christmas. Around 23 million Britons are expected to do most of their gift buying on the internet, in a development that will starve struggling high streets of much-needed business. “I think people are well aware that this Christmas is going to be completely different,” he says. “They are not going to be able to go to their local town centre or shopping mall and have the same pleasant experience as they had last year.” The virtual high street has already gone into overdrive: online sales are up 58% in the second week of November compared with the same period last year, according to internet industry body IMRG. It predicts that sales during Black Friday week will end up being between 35% and 45% higher than in 2019. In a tactic borrowed from the government’s response to the health crisis, retailers have been trying to “flatten the curve” to prevent their delivery systems collapsing under the strain. They therefore started cutting prices earlier than usual, mindful that a huge, late surge of ordering could overwhelm socially distanced warehouses and courier networks. Of the 320 retailers monitored by IMRG, almost 30% were running offers in the middle of last week, compared with about 11% in 2019. Despite the drip feed of promotions throughout November, spending usually reaches a crescendo in the final weekend, when shoppers are expected to spend a total of £7.5bn on clothing, toys and gadgets.  That is a big number, but will be 12% down on 2019 spending, according to a Centre for Retail Research report for Vouchercodes.co.uk. The dip will be due to a big change in the ways we shop, with online sales expected to be up nearly £2bn at £5.8bn while, on the back of widespread closures, takings in stores will be down £3bn to £1.7bn . Kelly Askew of consultancy Accenture says many retailers did not anticipate a second lockdown. The industry is “bracing for larger-than-normal e-commerce volumes, but just how much larger we don’t know yet”, he adds. What is certain is the topsy-turvy conditions created by the pandemic will test the virtual high street to its limits this week. In a sign of problems that could face many of us, last week’s virtual scrum for the new Sony PlayStation 5 saw the websites of several major retailers, including John Lewis and Curry’s PC World, either crash or be forced to introduce queuing systems. Tesco’s website similarly crumpled when shoppers logged on en masse to try to book a Christmas food delivery slot. The PlayStation 5 debacle is a “reality check” for retailers, which do not have a “limitless capacity for online sales”, according to Lim. “It took years and years of investment to be able to cope with the level of demand we had pre-pandemic…The industry can’t suddenly move from making 20% of sales online to 50% or 60%.” This latest lockdown promises to “leave deep scars” on the high street, Lim adds, particularly for the small businesses that are already “hanging on by a thread” after having to close for months in the spring."
"The car dealer Lookers has finally revealed it lost £46m in 2019, eight months after it first delayed its accounts following its discovery of a £300,000 fraud. Lookers said an unnamed individual in one of its trading divisions was the subject of criminal investigations after it discovered “internal fraud” via “misappropriation of expenses”, through submitting “a number of fraudulent expenses claims”. The fraud, which was revealed in March, was worth £327,000 accumulated over several years – a minor financial loss for a company whose earnings before tax had not dropped below £30m since 2009. The company’s shares have been suspended since July because of the reporting delay. However, the fraud investigation uncovered accounting problems with misrespresented debtor balances in respect of bonus receivables, which required it to book more than £20m in charges to correct previous inaccuracies. The fraud and accounting scandal came at the worst possible time for Lookers, just as the car industry was rocked by the twin challenges of Brexit uncertainty followed by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the closure of all dealers for months during the UK’s lockdowns – although demand has bounced back since restrictions eased. At the same time, car dealers have struggled to adjust to the shift to online sales. Lookers, which sells vehicles for large manufacturers including Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen, as well as luxury brands including Aston Martin, Bentley and Ferrari, in June closed 12 dealerships with the loss of 1,500 jobs. It runs 164 dealerships in total, employing 8,100 people. The turmoil at the company started in July 2019, when it announced a profit downgrade. In November 2019 its chief executive and chief operating officer both left, alongside another 15 closures. Mark Raban was appointed chief executive in February, having only joined Lookers the previous July. Lookers acknowledged “significant weakness” in its finance department, following the fraud investigation by auditors Grant Thornton. The investigation found “weaknesses in the design and implementation of policies and procedures, an insufficiently resourced and skilled finance function and instances of failure to follow policies and procedures where they existed”, Lookers said. Phil White, Lookers’ executive chairman, said: “The investigation into our financial systems and accounting controls, the delay in the publication of our 2019 results and the subsequent temporary suspension of our shares have been a great disappointment. “As chairman of Lookers plc, I would like to apologise unreservedly to all our stakeholders and team members for the uncertainty this has caused.”"
"An £18 own-brand champagne from Morrisons has claimed top place in an annual champagne taste test, beating competition from premium champagne houses, including Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Lanson. The supermarket’s Adrien Chopin Brut champagne was awarded the highest score of 82% in blind tasting of supermarket own-label and popular champagne brands, priced up to £36, by a panel of wine experts for the consumer group Which?. The experts were won over by the Morrisons’ bubbly, describing it as “golden champagne with stewed apple aromas, rich flavours and a hint of sweetness”. The runner-up was another supermarket champagne, Waitrose’s Brut. Costing £19.99. It was described by the experts as an ideal party fizz, with notes of “ripe red apples and apple blossom”. Both the Morrisons and the Waitrose fizzes scooped a Which? “best buy” award in time for the festive season. Their offerings knocked Moët & Chandon’s Imperial Brut champagne into joint third place, despite it costing £36 – double the price of the winner. Imperial Brut, the only bottle from a well known champagne house to make it into the top four, was described by the experts as a pleasure to drink, although one found it a “little bland”. The Moët & Chandon champagne received the same score as Landric Champagne Brut from Sainsbury’s, priced at £25, which just missed out on “best buy” status. Own-brand or exclusive champagnes from supermarkets dominated in this year’s taste test. Champagnes from Lidl, Aldi and Marks & Spencer ranked more highly than those from some of France’s best-known producers, such as Veuve Clicquot and Lanson. Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine, said consumers would be able to pop a cork this festive season for less than £20. “Your Christmas might be a bit more low key this year, but there is no reason to scrimp on the bubbly,” he said. At the bottom of the table was a champagne from the discounter Aldi, with its Philizot & Fils organic champagne, which costs £27, described by one panellist as “wishy washy”."
"The proportion of homes in England and Wales that have been bought, renovated and sold again within a short period has hit a 12-year high, with Burnley in Lancashire topping the list of properties most commonly “flipped”. So far this year, one in every 40 homes sold were bought and sold within 12 months, according to research from estate agent Hamptons International using Land Registry data, the most since 2008. In Burnley, it was about one in 12. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, which brought the housing market to a standstill for several weeks, Hamptons predicts that about 23,000 homes will be flipped this year, up from 20,857 last year, and investors are on track to make greater profits. The housing market has been booming in recent weeks, as pent up demand following the first lockdown was released and after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, introduced a stamp duty holiday on properties up to £500,000 in July. The average difference between the purchase price and sale price of flipped properties has risen to the highest level since records began in 2007, now standing at £40,995 at the national level. This is more than £10,000 higher than the average profit recorded in 2019. According to Hamptons International researchers, average profits have been boosted as investors have increasingly switched to houses from flats. Just 5% of the homes bought and sold since the housing market reopened in May have been flats, a large drop from 20% in 2019. “Flippers play an important role in the housing market, by improving housing stock and taking on projects other buyers often won’t touch,” said Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons International. “Since the market weakened following the financial crash of 2007, the number of flipped houses dwindled. However in recent times their numbers have started to recover.” Flipping is most common in the north-east and north-west of England, with traders looking to make a quick profit targeting areas where property is more affordable. So far this year, one in every 12 homes sold in Burnley had been purchased in the previous 12 months, equating to 51 properties. The average difference between the purchase and sale price was £20,643. Some 80% of the flipped properties in Burnley, the vast majority of which were terraced houses, were purchased for less than £40,000, the level at which investors are usually required to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge, and below the general threshold for the tax. After Burnley, the second most popular place for flipping was County Durham, followed by Rutland in the east Midlands, Middlesbrough in fourth place and Stockton-on-Tees in fifth. Merthyr Tydfil, in eighth place, is the only local authority in Wales to feature in the top 10. It has been two years since anywhere in southern England appeared in the top 10 flipping locations, but that may be about to change, according to Beveridge. “While the current stamp duty holiday will see flippers across the country save money, its full impact won’t be felt until early next year when these homes are likely to return to the market for sale. Given investors in more expensive areas will see larger stamp duty savings, there is potential for Burnley to be knocked off the top spot before too long,” she said. 1. Burnley: 8.2% of properties are flipped within 12 months of purchase, with an average increase in sale price of £20,643 2. County Durham: 5.8% and £6,780 3. Rutland: 5.8% and £45,269 4.

"Bank of England policymakers are expected to inject up to £100bn into the economy when they meet this week amid mounting fears that the four-week lockdown for England will lead to a double-dip recession. Threadneedle Street’s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) will spend the next few days weighing up the impact of the renewed closure of large chunks of the economy before announcing its latest decisions on Thursday. The MPC was already poised to announce gloomier economic forecasts even before the prime minister announced the drastic tightening of restrictions, and fresh action to support economic activity is now seen by the financial markets as inevitable. The economy shrank by 20% in April – the most severe month of the first lockdown – and one leading analyst predicted that it could contract by up to a further 10% as a result of the curbs coming into force later this week. Gerard Lyons, economic adviser to Boris Johnson when he was London mayor, said: “The economy will contract and while not by as much as it did in the initial lockdown, it will still be significant, possibly as much as 7.5-10%. “I expect unemployment to rise from 1.52 million to 3 million and large swathes of firms to be left nursing debt that will inhibit their ability to recover.” Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said he had been expecting UK GDP to move sideways in November but was now expecting a monthly fall of 5%. “The economy is likely to show zero growth or even have a small decline in the fourth quarter of the year,” Dales said. “This has all the signs of a double-dip recession.” The City is braced for a marked sell-off in the share of retail and hospitality companies – the two sectors hardest hit by the curbs on activity – when trading resumes on Monday. Reports of the government’s U-turn on a lockdown came after the financial markets closed on Friday following a week in which the FTSE 100 Index dropped by almost 5%. It is thought unlikely that the Bank’s MPC will reduce interest rates – already at just 0.1% – but instead rely on the money creation programme known as quantitative easing (QE) to boost lending and combat the imminent contraction of the economy. With high street sales falling and consumer confidence sliding backwards in recent weeks, City analysts already believed the MPC was likely to increase QE from its current level of £745bn when it meets on Thursday. Quantitative easing is a form of electronic money, created by the Bank of England and used to purchase UK government bonds, mainly from financial institutions. The Bank owns almost half of the UK government’s debts. The effect is to depress long-term borrowing costs and encourage banks to lend to commercial businesses. The Bank policymakers, who have increased the central bank’s QE programme by £300bn since March, are also likely to be concerned about ongoing Brexit talks, which have hit investment and could cause severe disruption to EU/UK trade if negotiators fail to agree a deal. The Bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has stressed in recent speeches that the UK economy rebounded quickly from the first lockdown although several of his colleagues, noticeably the academic Silvana Tenreyro and former hedge fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe, have highlighted the UK’s weak growth rate. Martin Beck, senior UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said an additional injection of QE could “boost sentiment” in financial markets and among businesses and consumers. “It would also help guard against any unwarranted rise in government borrowing costs were market turmoil to return.”  US Federal Reserve policymakers will also meet next week, though they are not expected to discuss a shift in policy during the final few hours of the presidential election campaign."
"The treasury’s “eat out to help out” scheme could have directly caused a sixth of new coronavirus case clusters over the summer, new research suggests. The paper, from Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick, found that the scheme – in which the government funded discounts on food and non-alcoholic drinks at participating businesses Monday to Wednesday throughout August – was closely linked to an increase in cases over the summer. Coronavirus spread more rapidly in areas with a lot of participating restaurants, Fetzer found, and infections in those areas slowed after the scheme ended. Fetzer used rainfall to try to estimate whether the increase was caused by the programme. He found that in areas that had a lot of rain during lunch and dinner hours on Mondays to Wednesday that month, fewer people ate out and fewer people were infected. The same pattern was not visible if it rained on other days of the week, suggesting that the scheme itself was directly responsible for the increase in infections. “The empirical estimates suggest that the scheme may be responsible for around 8-17% of all new detected Covid-19 clusters (at least two new infections in the same area) emerging during August and into early September in the UK,” Fetzer concludes. “Given the dramatic rise of Covid-19 infections across the UK in recent weeks, the likely changes in consumer behaviour due to higher infection risks and the ensuing economic damage this generates suggests that the EOHO [eat out to help out] scheme may have indirect economic and public health costs that vastly outstrip its short-term economic benefits.” But a Treasury spokesperson rejected the economist’s findings. “We do not recognise these figures – which, as the study itself admits, are ‘back-of-the-envelope’ calculations.” “Many other European counterparts have experienced an uptick in cases,” the spokesperson added, “irrespective of whether similar measures for the hospitality industry have been introduced. We’re continuing to work closely with businesses to help them be Covid-secure.” Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College London, said the Warwick paper was “methodologically sound”. “Thiemo is a very well-respected econometrician and he’s done the obvious checks. The estimated impacts are plausible. Is it proof? No. There are lots of potential confounders, in particular different mechanisms by which rain could influence infection independently of EOHO. So it’s not definitive, but I think the burden of proof is now on EOHO defenders.” Portes also criticised the Treasury for failing to take the claim seriously, calling its response “childish and unprofessional”. “I would have expected better from a department that claims to take economics seriously,” he said. Fetzer is not the first to suggest that the government’s scheme, which paid half the price of a restaurant meal, up to £10 per person, could have had dangerous consequences. In September, Toby Phillips, a public policy researcher at the University of Oxford, noted that, while “transmission rates were already creeping up in early August”, there was a “rapid acceleration in the proportion of detected positive cases at the start of September consistent with cases where infection occurred in mid-August.” “It’s certainly worth considering the effect of a £10 discount at the pub,” Phillips added, “and the effect of concentrating people’s outings on just three days of the week.”"
"NatWest Group has swung back to profit after a sharp fall in bad debt provisions but its chief executive cautioned that renewed Covid-19 restrictions meant there were “challenging times” ahead. NatWest – formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – put aside another £254m to cover a potential surge in defaults linked to the coronavirus crisis in the third quarter, 60% lower than the £628m that analysts expected. The bank said it reflected a “limited level of defaults” in the three months to September. It brings the bank’s total impairment charge for 2020 to £3.1bn, after reporting provisions of £802m and £2.1bn in the first and second quarters respectively. The bank now expects loan loss provisions for the whole of 2020 to be at the lower end of £3.5bn-£4.5bn. The lower charge helped NatWest swing back into the black with an operating profit of £355m. It was a marked improvement on the £8m loss logged last year when NatWest was forced to put aside £900m to cover payment protection insurance mis-selling claims. Analysts had expected RBS to report a second consecutive quarterly loss of £75m, having also been stung by Covid loan loss charges earlier this year. NatWest said its retail customer activity “improved significantly” compared with the second quarter, with debit and credit card spending up 30% and 43% respectively, while mortgage applications shot up 91%. It helped make up for a slowdown in market activity, which impacted the performance of its investment bank. However, NatWest’s chief executive, Alison Rose, warned that there were more difficult times ahead, as the UK battles a second wave of Covid-19 cases. “Although impairments were relatively low in the quarter and we have seen some positive trends across our customer base, the full impact of Covid-19 remains very unclear,” Rose said. “Challenging times lie ahead, especially as the current government support schemes come to an end and as new Covid-19 related restrictions are introduced.”"
"BP’s market value has fallen below 200p a share for the first time since 1994 with investor faith in the future of the oil industry shaken by the coronavirus pandemic. The 26-year share-price low means the oil company is worth little more than £40.5bn, well below the market value of the Danish offshore wind developer Orsted, which in less than two years has doubled its value on the Copenhagen stock exchange to more than £51bn. BP is also now a substantially less valuable business than Diageo, which is worth slightly less than £60bn. The 111-year old oil company is also worth less than a third of the market value of Unilever, which is worth £124bn. The company’s share price has buckled under the growing pressures affecting the global oil industry amid the coronavirus pandemic. The historic share-price lows have also emerged as the company prepares to overhaul its business by cutting investment in fossil fuels in favour of clean energy alternatives. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has also lost ground in the equity markets, and at $141bn is now worth less than the US renewable energy firm NextEra Energy, valued at $145bn. ExxonMobil was eclipsed by NextEra Energy, a Florida-based clean energy company, early in October, just months after it was also surpassed by Netflix, at the height of the coronavirus outbreak. The Covid-19 pandemic has battered global oil demand this year, and threatens to hasten the terminal decline of fossil fuel use as governments turn to green energy industries to reboot economies. Bernard Looney, CEO of BP, addressed the concerns raised by one retail shareholder in a social media post on LinkedIn this month, saying the share price slide was “down to a number of factors”, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on oil demand. Looney said: “Our entire sector has experienced similar drops this year, and if anything we feel that in itself is a robust case for change. As for our strategy, it is a long-term approach, and we believe that we will create more value through this shift than we would if we kept doing what we were doing. “At the end of the day shareholders … want to see us deliver on what we laid out. Words are cheap, actions count. And we are very confident we will deliver.”"
"Landsec, one of Britain’s biggest property companies, has said it plans to sell off almost a third of its £12.8bn property portfolio over the next few years as it looks to focus on growth opportunities in cities. The property group behind the Trinity Leeds shopping centre and Bluewater in Kent said it intended to sell assets worth around £4bn over four to five years and reinvest the money in new developments. The firm will sell off some of its hotel and leisure properties and retail parks, areas where it believes it has “little or no competitive advantage”, and will instead focus on a new strategy to develop projects that include a mix of offices, retail stores and homes. Mark Allan, who joined Landsec as chief executive during the national lockdown in April, said the firm was “setting out a strategy that makes the most of Landsec’s strengths and positions the business for growth”. Allan highlighted one of its north London shopping centres , the O2 Centre on Finchley Road, as having “significant redevelopment potential, repurposing potential”, such as building new residential buildings on the site. Landsec reaffirmed its commitment to the capital, despite persistently low footfall in central London because of the absence of office workers and tourists. Central London assets account for almost two-thirds (64%) of Landsec’s portfolio by value. It said it believed that some of its retail outlets located on the ground floor of London office buildings would recover following the pandemic as they do not face competition from internet retailers. However, Allan confirmed that Landsec expects rents to fall at its regional shopping centres, in cities and towns from Glasgow and Leeds to Cardiff and Portsmouth. It expects rents to drop by between 20% and 25% from their March levels in order for them to become “sustainable” for tenants. Allan said the pandemic had “accelerated structural changes which were already under way” in the retail sector. The firm revealed earlier in October that it had managed to collect only a third of rent from its retail tenants five working days after it was due, highlighting the impact of Covid-19 on commercial property firms. In contrast, it had collected 82% of rental payment from its office tenants, and Landsec said it was not forecasting a fall in office rental values. The property group highlighted the growth of its retail outlets, including Braintree Village in Essex and Clarks Village in Somerset, which offer shoppers discounted products and are situated in out-of-town locations that are usually reached by car. Landsec described its retail outlet portfolio as “thriving” and said this part of its portfolio was “growing most strongly and recovering most strongly as we emerge from the pandemic”. Analysts from the US investment bank JP Morgan Cazenove said they were “disappointed over the lack of detail” provided by Landsec over its new strategy. “Nothing presented today materially changes the group’s near-term fortunes,” they said."
"A ‘test-and-release system’ to cut the quarantine period for international arrivals to the UK should be in place by 1 December, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps said he was “extremely hopeful” that the system, which would require a single coronavirus test to be taken about a week after arrival and paid for privately, would be ready in six weeks’ time, depending on sufficient tests being available through the private sector. Speaking to the aviation industry Airlines 2050 summit, Shapps said the government travel taskforce he chairs had been “working extensively with health experts and the private testing sector on the practicalities” of such a regime, as well as discussing possible pre-departure test and isolation schemes with partner countries. He said the taskforce was in contact with more than a dozen firms about different rapid tests. The taskforce is due to report to the prime minister at the start of November on a reformed entry regime. Asked if the test-and-release system could be running by 1 December, Shapps said: “As long as the [testing] capacity is there through the private sector to do it, I’m extremely hopeful.” However, the new boss of British Airways signalled that even a seven-day quarantine period would not do much to restart travel. Sean Doyle, who replaced Álex Cruz as BA chief executive last week, said: “It’s our view that even if that quarantine period is reduced to seven days, people won’t travel here and the UK will get left behind.” He said BA wanted to see pre-departure testing, particularly to restore major transatlantic routes. BA is now flying two planes a day between London and New York, instead of the normal 12, carrying just 200 passengers, Doyle said. Doyle quoted recent research by the global airline body Iata that showed there had been only 44 confirmed cases of aircraft passengers contracting Covid-19 onboard, including in the period before wearing face masks was mandatory. He said: “I find that pretty reassuring. That’s one in 27 million, and mostly before people wore face masks.” Speaking to the summit, Doyle said: “We do not believe quarantine is the solution. The best way to reassure people is to introduce a reliable and affordable test before flying. “If we look abroad to our near neighbours, we see that business travel and indeed tourism is being prioritised by some countries. We need to get the economy moving again and this just isn’t possible when you’re asking people to quarantine for 14 days.” The trade body Airlines UK also questioned the value of the proposed regime. Its chief executive, Tim Alderslade, said: “Eight days, plus one or two days to get the results, isn’t going to have the impact we want. If you look at the average number of days people stay in the UK, from the US it’s about four days. Eight days isn’t going to cut the mustard.” Shapps said the taskforce was still pursuing an alternative pre-departure testing scheme, but he could give no guarantees of a timescale as it would require international cooperation through the International Civil Aviation Organization. “We’re talking to the US homeland security and others. We’d like to get trials set up. That could involve a series of tests that could involve quarantine before and after flights – or ultimately no quarantine at all if the technology is there for a rapid tests. But that requires international cooperation.” Shapps said that the Department for Transport was still working on a long-awaited aviation recovery plan for the sector, which he promised would arrive later in the autumn, setting out more measures to boost air travel."
"The Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain could be closed and Peacocks saved under Philip Day’s plans to rescue his high street empire from complete collapse. Up to 21,500 jobs are at risk at Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group – which also owns Jaeger, Austin Reed, and Jane Norman – as the retailer teeters on the brink of administration. The group, which has about 1,100 stores, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal document that provides protection from creditors for 10 days. Day has until Thursday to secure a rescue package under which he is aiming to secure funding from US hedge fund Davidson Kempner to buy Peacocks, the largest chain in the group, out of administration. The deal would exit Peacocks’ worst-performing stores and could also see Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which has about 260 stores, closed down as the latter chain’s reliance on tourists and elderly shoppers faces a bleak short-term future during the pandemic. About 50 Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Peacocks stores were closed last week, leading to 600 job losses, and up to 100 more could be closed imminently with hundreds more redundancies. Austin Reed and Jaeger are thought likely to be sold off but the future for the group’s homewares business Ponden Mill and fashion brand Jane Norman is unclear. If a viable deal is on the table this week, the deadline for one or all of the brands could be extended by a further 10 days in order to complete it. Day, a former executive at the traditional British brand Aquascutum, who lives in Switzerland and owns a castle in Cumbria, built up his retail empire by acquiring a string of businesses out of administration. He got his first big break in 2001, as part of the £49m private equity-backed buyout of the purveyor of knitwear Edinburgh Woollen Mill. He went on to buy out his fellow shareholders and to expand his empire across a string of troubled brands. Day also controls Bonmarché, the ailing 50-plus women’s fashion chain, via a separate investment vehicle and is thought to want to significantly reduce his potential liabilities after difficulties across the many brands he owns. Day will have a big say in the future of the company even if administrators are appointed on Thursday as he holds a charge over certain assets of the group – making him first in line above other creditors to recover debts. The Day family has also benefited from more than £24m in dividend payments since August 2018 from the group which had a cash balance of nearly £118m in March last year, according to the most recent accounts available."
"A record number of shops disappeared from high streets across the country in the first half of 2020 as the Covid-19 lockdowns hammered the retail sector.  A total of 11,120 chain store outlets closed between January and June, while 5,119 opened. The 6,001 net store closures was a record high and compared with 3,509 in the first half of last year. Analysts predict there will be many more closures to come as the data does not include outlets that were temporarily closed under lockdown rules when analysts visited and which might end up permanently shuttered. The figures, published by the Local Data Company and advisory firm PwC, show that on average more than 60 stores closed per day while 28 opened. The research covers high streets, shopping centres and retail parks in England, Scotland and Wales. York was the worst affected, with 55 net shop closures in the first six months of the year, followed by Newcastle upon Tyne (43) and Worcester (26). The shop closure data reflects a crisis on the high street that has cost thousands of jobs as chains, led by already struggling fashion, mobile phone and betting shops, closed their doors. During the period, Carphone Warehouse closed all 531 standalone branches, and fashion chains including Oasis, Warehouse, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston all closed down. Big names including Marks & Spencer, Debenhams and House of Fraser also closed stores. Lucy Stainton, the head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company, said: “The results from the first half of 2020 are a stark reminder of the challenges faced by retailers in the first six months of the year, which included a national lockdown.” She feared this was the tip of the iceberg, with 22% of chain stores still closed temporarily “With each week that passes since retail and hospitality businesses were given the green light to reopen, the likelihood of these occupiers ever trading again in those units reduces.” She added that local lockdowns and other restrictions such as the 10pm curfew would continue to have “a devastating impact” on the sector, with more closures likely after the key festive trading season ends. The reports says: “Unless further government stimulus is announced, we’re guaranteed to see further closures” as a result of factors such as further movement restrictions, the unwinding of the furlough scheme this month and the end of business rates relief and VAT reductions for the hospitality sector in March. The data does not cover independent stores, which researchers said were likely to have seen a resurgence as more people worked from home and shopped locally during the pandemic. The report found that among the chains, takeaways and coffee shops were among the fastest-growing types of high-street outlet. In regional terms, Greater London saw the highest total number of net closures – 1,008 – followed by the south-east of England and the north-west. But Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the biggest loss of chain stores in percentage terms, with a net 3.4% of outlets disappearing, compared with 2.2% in the east of England, which was the best performing region. Shopping centres were the worst-affected location. Lisa Hooker, a consumer markets leader at PwC, said the pandemic had accelerated existing changes in shopping behaviour as it had “forced experimentation” during the lockdown. “We all knew that consumers were shifting to shopping online or changing their priorities in terms of the things they buy, but what Covid-19 has done is create a step-change in these underlying trends to where they have now become the new normal,” she said. “We all still want and need to physically visit shops and leisure operators, it’s likely then that whatever happens retail will come out of this smaller but stronger.”"
"“They have absolutely crucified us,” says Steve Holden, when asked what the month-long high street lockdown in England means for his family’s three Essex gift shops. “We have spent thousands of pounds on Christmas stock and it is crucial we sell it in November and December, which is our busiest time of year,” he said. “Without that money coming in we can’t get through January and February when the high street is dead.” The new lockdown has forced about 363,000 specialist shops to temporarily close, a situation that means retailers will now miss what are traditionally among the biggest sales weeks of the year. The British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) says its members are upset that high-street lockdown rules have not created a level playing field. Its members fear customers will do all their Christmas shopping in stores that are considered essential such as supermarkets, which are allowed to stay open, not forgetting online marketplaces such as Amazon, leaving them with heavy losses. Andrew Goodacre, the Bira chief executive, urged shoppers “not to panic and buy everything now”. “Your favourite shop will reopen, so remember why it is your favourite shop and use it, because it needs you now more than ever,” he said. Goodacre added that there are good independent stores that “through no fault of their own could be forced out of business” by a poor Christmas, a period which usually sustain shops through the rest of the year. “Even though it’s only four weeks compared with 13 weeks in the summer, this lockdown could do more damage because of the loss of sales this month, and possibly in December if everyone does their shopping early.” The pandemic has resulted in big changes in shopping behaviour, with online sales booming, a shift that has accelerated the pace of high street closures and job losses. Some analysts think another 18,000 premises could be left empty in 2020, almost double the number in 2019, as the coronavirus pandemic hammers retailers, restaurants and leisure businesses. During the earlier lockdown independents adapted by offering services such as personal shopping and click and collect. New business channels have also emerged to help small businesses cope, including the website Bookshop that allows readers to buy online while supporting their local independent bookseller. The lockdown has seen the big retail chains focus their energies on running their websites and collection services amid fears of a sales bottleneck in December. John Lewis is redeploying thousands of department store staff to its sister chain Waitrose, and potentially even to its distribution centres, as it prepares for another surge in online orders. Andrew Murphy, group operations director, said that John Lewis’s recent strong sales showed customers had already begun to do their Christmas shopping. “People are making the assumption they need to accelerate all their plans,” he said. “The more that happens, the more able retailers will be to manage demand across the UK.” John Lewis is offering a click-and-collect service from its closed department stores, as well in Waitrose – a network of collection points that Murphy said would make “a big difference” during the lockdown. With its stores closed, the Currys PC World chain said it will have 3,000 staff working on its virtual personal shopping service, assisting shoppers who are trying to choose the most suitable game console, tablet or mobile phone. It is also offering “zero contact” collections, where shoppers can have their purchases placed in the boot of their car. Mark Allsop, chief operating officer at the chain’s owner Dixons, said that it did not anticipate furloughing as many staff during this lockdown as the last as they would be organising online orders, selling via video conference or helping with phone queries. The setup would help to spread out demand, he said: “The last thing we want is condensed periods of time when people can shop. It creates a pinch point in demand.”"
"Nearly 100 British businesses could be blocked from securing promised top-ups on government-backed Covid loans after their lender ran out of cash. The Guardian understands that small firms that successfully received a bounce back loan (BBLS) from non-bank lender Tide are struggling to secure further loans to cope with the second lockdown after the finance company ran out of funds this summer. Unless Tide can secure private investment or cheap funding that is only available to licensed banks, the small firms affected could be locked out of the loan system as most accredited lenders are shut to new customers. The Treasury’s bounce back loans scheme (BBLS), which has so far doled out £40bn to 1.3m firms, has already come under fire from an all-party parliamentary group after it found that around 250,000 small and medium-sized businesses could have been locked out of the first scheme because they do not bank with any of the 28 accredited lenders. Business groups said they were concerned that if the number of accredited lenders shrinks, as seems likely, the number of businesses unable to access funds from the second round will be even higher. British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director, Hannah Essex, said: “Banks, regulators and the government must work together to ensure firms who previously applied to non-bank lenders are not denied the cash they need to get through a difficult winter.” Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was important that struggling businesses are given access to much-needed funds. “Given that many firms applied for bounce back facilities at a time when the extent of disruption was so unclear, it’s vital that the roll-out of the top-up initiative is a success.”  Tide – a non-bank lender – managed to hand out £50m worth of bounce back loans earlier this year, but halted lending in July when it failed to secure extra funding from investors. It is now reviewing formal documents linked to the scheme, and trying to figure out how it might finance the top-ups promised by the UK government last week. Under the Treasury’s new rules, small businesses that have already received a loan– but failed to ask for the maximum allowance when they first applied – can request a top-up in light of new lockdown measures. The total loan can be worth 25% of annual turnover, worth up to £50,000. The extension, which is expected to launch by Tuesday this week, will be a lifeline for small businesses across the UK during the new lockdown.  The British Business Bank, which is in charge of administering the emergency loan programme, said: “Lending decisions under the bounce back loan scheme are fully delegated to the accredited lenders. If a lender does not have the capital to support continued funding of new BBLs or top-up BBLs, the British Business Bank is not in a position to force them to lend.” “We are unable to comment on commercial discussions with our delivery partners, but expect most borrowers to be able to start applying for top-up BBLs early next week, subject to meeting eligibility criteria.” Tide is a non-bank lender, which means it does not hold deposits, and instead has to rely on money raised from investors to package into loans. Tide also does not qualify for the Bank of England’s term funding scheme aimed at small business lending, which has made it easier for banks to borrow cash to fund bounce back loans, which come with a flat interest rate of 2.5%. Tide said in a blog post in August that it “continued to ask” the government for access to Bank of England loans to fund further bounce back loans. The Treasury declined to comment."
"Economies struggling with the costs of Covid-19 could face a double blow from escalating trade wars unless international talks to rewrite cross-border tax rules are successful, the OECD has warned. The Paris-based organisation, which has been steering the talks, said governments would come under further financial pressure from retaliatory tariffs should governments fail to agree a global tax framework by an extended deadline of mid 2021. An agreement could offset some of the costs of the pandemic by raising as much as $100bn (£77bn) in extra tax, the OECD said, but only if a consensus among the 140 countries that have embarked on talks can be reached. Several countries have resisted plans for a global tax regime, including the US, which has sought to protect major digital companies from targeted tax rises and tough regulations in the EU and UK. Pressure has mounted on politicians to force large corporations to increase their tax payments following a string of reports showing that many firms pay only a fraction of the headline rate. But anti-poverty campaign groups said the OECD blueprint was weak and failed to establish a system that would trouble a global elite of rich corporations, many of which use sophisticated financial tools to shift their profits to low tax havens. Alex Cobham, chief executive at the Tax Justice Network, said: “The OECD has once again shown that it is incapable of delivering the urgent tax reforms the world needs. “Countries are losing hundreds of billions in tax to tax havens every year, and yet the OECD’s blueprints offer little more than a ‘tax haven lite’ model where tax havens can keep the majority of profit they siphon from around the world so long as they share some of those profits with the richest of countries.” The blueprint sets a minimum corporate tax rate that corporations must pay on their profits, wherever they are domiciled, including low tax jurisdictions. This follows an agreement in the first phase of talks that companies must pay tax on their income where transactions take place. Cobham said the first phase, which Google, Apple and Facebook have said they support, was “highly complex” and only reverses “a few billion dollars” of corporate tax savings, with almost nothing going to lower-income countries.The OECD’s secretary general, Angel Gurria, said: “The alternative to finding an agreement would be a trade war ... The last thing you want at this time with Covid-19 is to have to deal with further trade tensions.” In such a worst-case scenario, trade disputes could knock global GDP back by more than 1%, the OECD estimated in an impact assessment. However, new rules for digital taxation and a proposed global minimum tax would increase global corporate income tax worldwide by 1.9% to 3.2%, or about $50bn to $80bn per year. That could reach $100bn after including an existing US minimum tax on overseas profits, amounting to 4% of global corporate income tax, the OECD said."
"The British heavy machinery firm JCB’s sale of equipment used in the destruction of Palestinian villages in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is being examined by a UK government body to determine whether its due diligence process complies with human rights guidelines set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The case is likely to test the degree to which multinationals are responsible if their export goods are sold by local distributors in ways that potentially infringe human rights. JCB, which has donated millions of pounds to the Conservative party and at least £25,000 to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign, can now enter into government-overseen mediation with the NGO that made the claim or it can outright contest the claim. The claim was launched by Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights last December after JCB refused to communicate with the lobby group over claims that its tractors were being used to tear up Palestinian villages. The little-known complaints procedure was set up in 2000 and is designed to give an avenue to press multinationals to abide by their corporate social responsibility undertakings as set out by the OECD. The National Contact Point quango, a subsidiary of the Foreign Office that oversees the complaints, issued a statement on Monday. It said that after examining the Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights complaint and hearing JCB’s rebuttal, it deemed that JCB had a case to answer in relation to some claims and that the issue fell within its remit. The chair of JCB is Anthony Bamford, a Conservative peer. The company gave Johnson £25,000 for his leadership campaign. Overall the firm has given the Conservatives more than £10m since 2010, according to the Electoral Commission. JCB had defended itself to the National Contact Point by saying that it simply sold its equipment to a third-party Israeli distributor, Comasco, and therefore had no responsibility over what was done with the equipment thereafter. It said it could not be sure that equipment that it had sold to Comasco had been used in the destruction of Palestinian villages or the construction of new illegal settlements. It added that its equipment was also used positively in the construction of hospitals, schools and roads. But the Palestinian legal group said Palestinian Bedouin communities in area C of the occupied West Bank were particularly vulnerable to demolitions and displacement in violation of their human rights. The OECD guidelines require firms to seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts directly linked to its business operations and products by a business relationship. It also asks them to have a policy commitment to respect human rights, and to carry out human rights due diligence. The director of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, Tareq Shrourou, said: “We welcome this initial assessment and the UK National Contact Point’s acknowledgment that there are serious human rights issues raised by our complaint under the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises which warrant mediation or thorough investigation. “JCB’s apparent failure to address the material and prolific use of its products in demolition and displacement incidents that cruelly impacts Palestinian families, and also its use in settlement-related construction which creates pervasive human rights violations, must cease immediately. “We look forward to constructively engaging with JCB and expect it will do the right thing by complying with its human rights responsibilities.” JCB said: “We are very pleased that the UK NCP has dismissed at the earliest opportunity any suggestion that JCB is involved in, or causes or contributes towards any human rights abuses whatsoever. There was no basis for the Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights to make their complaint alleging this. “As an organisation JCB does not condone any form of human rights abuse and we have a consistent record of providing urgent and substantial support in response to natural disasters around the world. “While the NCP will now examine JCB’s human rights due diligence process, it has made clear that its decision to do so is not a finding against JCB and does not mean that it considers that JCB has acted in any way inconsistently with the OECD guidelines. We welcome the opportunity of engaging further with the NCP on these matters.” JCB also pointed out that the NCP did not consider that the information provided by LPHR “demonstrated that JCB has caused or contributed to the issues raised”."
"Goldman Sachs is preparing to offer free Covid-19 tests for its UK staff within weeks, as part of its global efforts to get bankers back to the office. The Wall Street lender revealed a testing programme for workers in the US on Friday, and indicated in a staff memo that similar programmes may be considered for its other large offices “in the future”. The Guardian now understands that preparations are under way to offer free mass testing for members of its 6,000-strong London workforce who choose to return to the office. The move is likely to mean free off-site Covid-19 tests are offered to workers who have either returned or are planning to return to Goldman’s London offices at Plumtree Court in the City. These will include saliva-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which confirm whether someone currently has Covid-19, and antibody tests, to determine if a worker previously carried the virus. If the UK office were to follow the US programme, staff who plan to continue working from home but still want to take a private test may be reimbursed through Goldman’s health insurance programme but would have to pay upfront. Most private tests in the UK cost between £100 and £200. Currently about 25% or 1,500 Goldman bankers are coming into its London office on any given day. A Goldman spokesperson said the bank was not setting any targets for office workers in the UK to return. The UK government has encouraged people to continue working from home where possible amid another rise in Covid-19 cases. Goldman bankers at the London office are already subject to temperature checks on arrival and are asked to sign in to a bespoke app to answer questions about recent travel or potential symptoms on a daily basis. However, the bank is not enforcing use of the UK government’s contact-tracing app. In the memo announcing the US testing programme last week, Goldman said: “Testing is one part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes wearing masks, following general hygiene and handwashing best practices, and practising social distancing.” Goldman’s London bankers are already eligible for office perks including free takeaway breakfast and lunch, having previously had to pay for food. Staff who were previously entitled to 20 days of free childcare at an onsite creche have been able to claim an extra 10 days as they try to juggle work and family life."
"The bitter legal battle between the financier Amanda Staveley and Barclays bank has intensified as lawyers from each side called into question the evidence of some of the most high-profile witnesses in the case. The high court trial of Staveley’s claim against Barclays is entering its final week. She claims her client Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi invested £3.25bn as part of an emergency fundraising that saved Barclays from a state bailout at the height of the financial crisis 12 years ago, only to then discover that the UK bank secretly offered superior terms to Barclays’ largest investor, the state of Qatar. Those hidden terms contributed to her being ousted as an investor on the deal and cost her an estimated £660m in lost gains from the investment at the time, the financier alleges. She had initially made a claim of up to £1.5bn, including interest. Barclays has described Staveley’s case as “opportunistic and speculative” and argued that she was an adviser on the deal and not the principal. Her company, PCP Capital Partners, was paid a fee of £30m for its work on the fundraising, of which £11m was then paid out to other advisers, the company’s court filings have said. In closing submissions, Joseph Smouha QC, for Staveley, told the court that some of the evidence of the former Barclays chief executive John Varley was a “heavily constructed submission about what he thinks happened in circumstances where he accepts his actual recollection was thin at best”. He said it was an “ex post facto attempt to justify” a last-minute demand by Qatar to be paid millions more in fees in return for entering into a second fundraising to bail out the bank. Staveley’s closing submissions also attempted to undermine the credibility of Stephen Jones, a senior Barclays executive during the financial crisis who resigned as boss of the lobby group UK Finance in June, just before alleged sexist remarks he had made about Staveley were due to be revealed in court. Staveley says Jones’s evidence during the trial conflicted with an account he gave to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) before a previous criminal trial surrounding the fundraising. The difference “can only be explained as having been drafted with a view to assisting Barclays’ case in these proceedings”, the closing submission states. The tactic of attempting to undermine the evidence of key witnesses was mirrored by Barclays. In its closing submission, the bank said: “PCP’s case depends on Ms Staveley’s credibility, but she was a thoroughly unreliable witness. Her evidence was in material respects inconsistent with the documents; her recollection can be shown to be flawed in material respects; and she was guilty of obvious embellishment and invention. In many respects her evidence was not credible: in a number of respects it was simply untrue.” In February three former Barclays bosses were cleared of fraud over the investment made by Qatar. The SFO had alleged that lucrative terms given to Qatar were hidden from the market and other investors through bogus advisory service agreements. Charges against Barclays were thrown out in 2018."
"The co-founder of Arm has said that if the government does not stop the $40bn (£31bn) takeover of the British chip designer, its proposed buyer, Nvidia, will become the next US tech monopoly alongside companies such as Google and Facebook. Detailing his concerns in a letter to the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, Hermann Hauser said that a deal would end Arm’s position as the “Switzerland of the semiconductor industry”.  Arm, which employs 6,500 staff, including 3,000 in the UK, is a global leader in designing chips for smartphones, computers and tablets. “There is not a single important semiconductor company in the world which does not have an Arm licence,” said Hauser. “Nvidia has an opportunity to become the quasi monopoly supplier of microprocessors to the world. This [deal] will give Nvidia a dominant position in all processor segments and create another US technology monopoly which has created so much angst in Britain when the country worries about the surreptitiously controlling influence Google, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon has on the UK economy.” Hauser argued that because Nvidia is one of more than 500 Arm licensees worldwide, becoming the Cambridge-based business’s parent company will destroy its “even-handed” model and ultimately kill the world-leading British tech firm. “Technology sovereignty is fast becoming the defining issue of the decade,” said Hauser. “Given the importance of our IT infrastructure, which is correctly compared with our water and electricity infrastructure, [the takeover] clearly relates to national security as well.” Hauser has previously said the government should use its powers to prevent the takeover but has also backed indefinite legally binding conditions as an alternative. These include a guarantee to keep Arm’s staff in Cambridge, Belfast, Manchester and Warwick and a promise that Nvidia does not get preferential treatment on new versions of the designer’s chips. “The obvious and highly desirable alternative to the Nvidia deal is for the government to use its convening power to lead a syndicate of Arm licensees, UK pension funds and other instructions to take Arm public on the London Stock Exchange, New York stock exchange or Shanghai Star market and take a golden share so that we are never again in this invidious situation of having to fight to keep our own UK technology assets,” he said. Hauser has also said that holding on to a genuinely world-leading company such as Arm would give the UK a powerful weapon in post-Brexit trade talks. SoftBank acquired Arm for $32bn in 2016 as the Japanese technology firm took advantage of the fall in value of the pound after the Brexit vote. Hauser said he sold his shares in Arm as part of the Softbank deal so could “freely speak my mind” about the Nvidia takeover."
"Britons spent an extra £261m on alcohol in grocery stores last month as the government’s eat out to help out scheme came to an end and a 10pm curfew on pubs and bars began. Total sales in supermarkets and corner shops rose 10.6% in the four weeks to 4 October, up from 8% in the previous month, with stores the busiest they had been since a wave of stockpiling in March according to the latest market data from research firm Kantar. Sales of toilet roll and flour rose by 64% and 73% respectively in the week to 27 September, but Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at the data company Kantar, said there was little evidence of panic buying as the number of supermarket trips that week was well below that before the national lockdown. “Shoppers are moving a greater proportion of their eating and drinking back into the home. This is likely a response to rising Covid-19 infection rates, greater restrictions on opening hours in the hospitality sector, and the end of the government’s eat out to help out scheme,” he said. As fears built of a second wave of the virus, online sales rose by 76% year on year in the month to 4 October. Waitrose was the fastest-growing online retailer after splitting with Ocado, which increased its sales by nearly 42% after launching with its new partner, Marks & Spencer. Morrisons’ sales growth was the fastest of the UK’s four biggest supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda – as it benefited from new delivery services including food boxes, a partnership with Amazon and expansion of its online shop. Mike Watkins, the UK head of retailer and business insight at the market research firm Nielsen, which also identified a continued shift to online grocery shopping, said he expected about 15% of groceries to be bought via the internet in the run-up to the festive period, about double that last year, as shoppers increasingly prefer buying from home. “While shoppers are slowly becoming more comfortable returning to stores, online remains the biggest winner and a third of shoppers who shopped online in the last 12 weeks are new to online. Shoppers who first shopped online in the early summer are staying online and making repeat purchases, which means online is likely to take an even bigger share of sales as we head into the festive period,” Watkins said."
"Ikea is to buy back its unwanted furniture from customers to resell as secondhand as part of the Swedish group’s efforts to become more environmentally friendly. The Buy Back initiative will be launched in Ikea stores across the UK and Ireland on 27 November – the Black Friday discount day. Customers will receive vouchers to spend in store, with their value calculated according to the condition of the items returned. Sideboards, bookcases, shelving, small tables, dining tables, office drawers, desks, chairs and stools without upholstery, all previously bought from Ikea, can be taken back after customers register a request online. Some children’s products will also qualify for the scheme. Well-used pieces with several scratches will get vouchers worth 30% of the item’s original value and “as new” pieces can be exchanged for up to half their value. The items will be put on sale in stores and anything that cannot be resold will be recycled. Peter Jelkeby, the country retail manager for Ikea in the UK and Ireland, said: “Sustainability is the defining issue of our time and Ikea is committed to being part of the solution to promote sustainable consumption and combat climate change. With the launch of Buy Back we are giving a second life to many more Ikea products and creating more easy and affordable solutions to help people live more sustainably. It is an exciting step forward in our journey towards becoming a fully circular and climate positive business by 2030.” Ikea, the world’s biggest furniture chain, began trialling the sale of used and patched-up furniture in the UK more than a year ago in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The company is attempting to build a circular business model in which materials and products are reused or recycled. The company is investing more than €3.2bn (£2.9bn) on sustainability measures to become carbon neutral by 2030. Other experiments include textile recycling and leasing office furniture such as desks and chairs to business customers in Switzerland. Ikea’s move comes as the trend for more environmentally friendly services becomes increasingly mainstream. John Lewis began renting out furniture this year and is considering a marketplace to sell used products, Selfridges is hosting secondhand fashion boutiques and Liberty has tested rental services."
"The number of people being made redundant in the UK has risen at the fastest rate since records began as the economic fallout from Covid-19 and the scaling back of the government’s furlough scheme drives up unemployment. The Office for National Statistics said the number of people being made redundant in the UK almost doubled in the three months to August, increasing by 114,000 to reach 227,000, as the shock from the Covid recession rippled through the jobs market. The unemployment rate rose by more than expected to 4.5%, up from 4.1% in July, with the biggest increase in the jobless rate in more than a decade leaving 1.5 million out of work. Stoking concerns of a full-blown jobs crisis this winter after the furlough scheme ends, the figures showed the increase was driven by self-employed men losing their jobs and women working part-time falling out of the jobs market altogether. Overall employment has fallen by 480,000 since the start of the year, with 16- to 24-year-olds accounting for 60% of the decline as the pandemic strikes a heavy blow for a generation of young people whose lives have been disrupted by the global health emergency. Signalling that redundancies will peak at a higher level than in the 2008 financial crisis, as growing numbers of companies shed jobs in response to the economic shock, analysts warned unemployment would continue to climb during the second wave of Covid-19.  The news of the rise in unemployment came ahead of a virtual meeting of the International Monetary Fund at which the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will call on fellow finance ministers to work together in he fight against the pandemic Sunak will call for the burden on the world’s poorest countries to be eased by an extension of the debt suspension agreed earlier this year. “No economy has been spared the effects of this crisis – and every recession brings the risk of countries turning inwards. Let’s work together to sow the seeds of recovery.” Nye Cominetti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “With economic support falling just as lockdown restrictions increase across the country, we should prepare for a major increase in unemployment over the coming months.” The figures come after the chancellor, Sunak, last week announced an expansion of the government’s job support scheme to replace furlough, in an attempt to save jobs at businesses forced to close their doors. The chancellor had insisted throughout the summer that furlough would end in October, before staging an 11th-hour change in direction amid intense pressure last week as the government moved to launch the three-tier system. However, business leaders and Labour warned the figures showed Britain’s labour market was already at its weakest in more than a decade and would require Sunak to provide further measures to protect jobs through the winter. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said: “More people are going to lose their jobs until the government gets a grip. The chancellor’s chaotic habit of trying to fix problems of his own making at the last possible minute risks unemployment spiralling to levels we haven’t seen in decades.” Responding to the figures, Sunak said: “I’ve been honest with people from the start that we would unfortunately not be able to save every job. But these aren’t just statistics, they are people’s lives. That’s why trying to protect as many jobs as possible and helping those who lose their job back into employment is my absolute priority.” Despite grim prospects for Britain’s economy as the second wave of coronavirus takes hold, the latest figures from the jobs market also showed some signs of improvement over the summer months. Figures from HMRC showed the number of staff on company payrolls rose by 20,000 in September, slightly reducing the total number of job losses recorded by the tax office since the start of the pandemic to 673,000. There were some other potentially positive signs, including a record rise in the number of job vacancies in the three months to September, although the number of positions being advertised is still down 40% compared with a year ago. However, business leaders warned the government would still need to provide further support to businesses and workers to protect jobs through a difficult winter with tough new restrictions in place. Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “Job losses are likely to keep mounting as this turbulent year draws to a close. “With the furlough scheme unwinding, cash-strapped firms have been forced into difficult decisions about retaining their staff. Demand remains weak and as restrictions ramp up again many businesses will be stretched when it comes to paying wage bills. The job support scheme may need to be beefed up if the government wants to avert further rises in unemployment.”"
"The Australian government is seeking assurances from China over the impact of reported curbs of coal imports, while calling on Beijing to end the freeze on ministerial talks as concerns grow about widening trade tensions. The Greens seized on the reported moves as evidence Australia needed a “Plan B” and a transition plan for when the rest of the world no longer wanted the country’s coal. The uncertainty was fuelled by reports by two industry newswire services that China’s customs authorities had told several state-owned steelmakers and power plants to stop importing Australian thermal and coking coal. Scott Morrison said the government was investigating the reports, but it was “important not to get ahead of ourselves here” because it was “not uncommon” for China to impose domestic quotas to support local coal production and jobs. “That is not uncommon to see that and I can only assume, based on our relationship and based on the discussions we have with the Chinese government, that that is just part of their normal process,” the prime minister said in Brisbane on Tuesday. But the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the reports were “a huge concern” and he accused the Morrison government of failing to make efforts “to have a positive, constructive relationship” with China to the mutual benefit of both countries. He said that while Australia should pursue trade diversification, China remained an economically important export market and it was worrying that ministers were unable to speak directly with their counterparts. “We are a democracy, they’re not, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t have an economic relationship with China,” Albanese said in Wollongong. “It’s too important for us to ignore that.” There has not yet been any official confirmation of the move – first reported by S&P Global Platts and Argus Media – but Australia’s trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the government had made approaches to China “through diplomatic channels overnight”.  He said on Tuesday the government took the reports seriously enough to “try to seek some assurances from Chinese authorities that they are honouring the terms of the China-Australia free trade agreement and their [World Trade Organisation] obligations”. Birmingham told Sky News the government was “working with Australian industry, as always, to try to save Australian jobs”. He cautioned that the reports might relate to temporary moves connected to import quotas, saying it was “not the first time in recent years that we’ve seen some possible disruption to the timing and sequencing of exports of coal, in particular into China”. “And what we have seen is almost a pattern in relation to some informal quota systems or the like, seemingly operating within the Chinese system,” Birmingham told ABC Radio National. “But we’re monitoring closely to see whether there’s anything more to it on this occasion.” The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said it was wrong for the major parties to say coal would be in the system for decades “because at some point soon the rest of the world won’t want it”. “Liberal and Labor have no ‘Plan B’ for when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging coal,” Bandt said. “This news reinforces the need for the Greens’ plan to diversify our economy and look after coal communities as we transition.” China has taken a range of actions against Australian exporters this year, including imposing prohibitive tariffs on barley, suspending imports from five red meat processing plants and launching two trade investigations into wine. By extending its trade actions to coal and iron ore, China could intensify economic pressure on Australia, which has insisted it will not be deterred from standing up for its values. Government figures show Australia exported $7.3bn of coal to China in the first six months of this year – up 8% compared with the same period last year. The value of Australian exports of iron ore and concentrates to China rose 16% to $43bn. Last week’s federal budget said coal export volumes were expected to be subdued in the near term due to lower global demand. But it said overall mining exports were expected to grow by 0.5% in 2020-21 and 4% in 2021-22, “supported by robust demand for iron ore from China, and a gradual recovery in other key export partners”. “Metallurgical and thermal coal prices have remained subdued alongside lower global demand and uncertainty over China’s import policies,” the budget papers said. Birmingham said on Tuesday the Australian government had reaffirmed its desire to have ministerial-level talks with the Chinese government and “our door remains wide open to do that”. He said Australia had also contacted the Chinese embassy in Canberra and stressed its desire to engage in dialogue after Madame Fu Ying, China’s former ambassador to Australia and an influential figure in Beijing, made conciliatory comments last week. Fu told the Australian Financial Review both countries needed to “show their sincerity and courage to get out of the current dilemma” and increase contact and mutual understanding “instead of resorting to confrontation and abusing language based on assumptions and hypothesis”. The Australian government infuriated China with its early and vocal calls for a global independent investigation into the origin and early handling of the coronavirus – a step Beijing took as being aimed against it. Guardian Australia approached the Chinese embassy on Monday seeking confirmation of the reported moves against Australian coal but is yet to receive a response."
"ITV is to increase its focus on streaming to compete with rivals including Netflix, in a move that will lead to job losses at its traditional TV broadcasting operation. The move, which involves the formation of a new on-demand division that will become the home of the BritBox and ITV Hub streaming services, marks the first step towards the hugely successful streaming model pioneered by Netflix. ITV said viewers could expect more new content commissioned for its streaming services, in the same way that Netflix and Disney+ have built global businesses with exclusive hits such as Stranger Things and The Mandalorian, but it said the reorganisation did not signal the end of household hits from The X Factor to Love Island being made available on traditional TV. “Linear channels will be around and be profitable for many years,” said Carolyn McCall, ITV’s chief executive. “But we also need an on-demand [streaming] business, which will increasingly be the focus of our new investments in content and technology, and which will be our growth engine attracting younger and more targeted audiences to ITV.” ITV has an annual programming budget of more than £1bn, which is almost totally geared toward its existing portfolio of broadcasting channels. These provide almost all of the company’s £1.8bn advertising revenues.  A source said the changes were about “setting up ITV for the future” as more viewers, particularly younger audiences, gravitate towards streaming content online. “It is the start of a long-term change in focus,” said the source. McCall said: “ITV will continue to broadcast shows which entertain millions of viewers. Most are watched live [rather than streamed on-demand], and that fact together with the scale of these audiences will continue to offer unrivalled opportunities for brands to reach consumers.” While ITV’s streaming businesses remain minuscule by comparison – both in terms of audiences and revenue generation – they are both growing at double-digit percentage rates annually. The amount of hours viewed on its free online streaming service ITV Hub passed 500m last year, while registered users passed 30 million. BritBox, a joint venture with the BBC that operates in the US, UK and Australia and is to be rolled out to 25 countries, is growing at pace, with more than 1 million paying subscribers. ITV Hub+, which offers an ad-free experience, has attracted about 500,000 subscribers. The BritBox UK venture made a loss of £21m last year and ITV has forecast that it will lose around £55m to £60m this year. ITV said the restructure, which will be completed by March next year, would also work as a cost-cutting programme. “Both divisions [broadcast and on-demand] will be supported by leaner central support services,” the company said. “As well as aligning ITV’s resources and investments clearly to the two main ways of viewing, the restructure will drive improvements in efficiency and reduce cost.” ITV’s broadcasting business, which employs about 4,000 staff, will be replaced with a new media and entertainment division that will have two units – broadcast and on-demand. ITV said it planned to reduce its office space in London as leases on its properties come up for renewal in the next two to three years. ITV has three sites in the capital – Gray’s Inn Road, home to the news broadcaster ITN, Holborn, and White City in west London – and it is likely to reduce that to two. The company said the move was partly to cut costs, while also acknowledging the move to more flexible and remote working as a result of the coronavirus pandemic."
"A Super Mario-themed Lego set and “loveable” animatronic pets are predicted to be Christmas bestsellers at the retailer Hamleys, as toymakers try to please both children and adults this year. Hamleys, famous for its flagship store on Regent Street, London, thinks the £50 marriage of everyone’s favourite plumber and Lego will have blockbuster appeal. The battery-powered Present Pets pups, which respond to your voice and shower kisses, are also expected to be a winner for households unable to own a real puppy. Victoria Kay, head of buying at Hamleys, said creating “simple Christmas magic” would be more important than ever after such a tough year. She thought new versions of classic family games such as Cluedo and Monopoly would also sell well. “We can see carefree shared play and togetherness featuring heavily this year,” she said. With possibly small family get-togethers the order of the day, the retailer anticipates demand for toys with “inter-generational appeal”. The rise of the kidult has already meant bumper toy sales this year as adults in Britain embraced Lego, jigsaws and board games during the coronavirus lockdown. Last year Hamleys became part of Reliance Industries, the business empire of India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, whose $88bn (£67bn) fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index, makes him the 6th richest man in the world. The absence of tourists in central London, however, has hit trade at Hamley’s flagship store. But, with a quarter of all toys sold in the UK each year purchased in December, the retailer is planning for busy weeks to come. It is in the process of opening 11 pop-up stores around the country, including temporary branches in Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester. “We have had huge success with our online business,” said Kay. “Central London is challenging but our shopping mall stores are bouncing back. We’re not waiting in the shadows for customers to come back. Yes it is tough but we are not letting that put us off.”"
"A £183m fine levied on British Airways for a data breach has been reduced to £20m after investigators took into account the airline’s financial plight and the circumstances of the cyber-attack. The £20m fine is nonetheless the biggest ever issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), following the 2018 incident in which more than 400,000 customers’ personal details were compromised by hackers. The initial £183m fine announced last year was reduced after investigators accepted BA’s representations about the attack and also noted the dire financial position of BA since the onset of Covid-19. Investigators found BA had failed to put sufficient security measures in place to protect its customers’ details. The airline took more than two months to detect the cyber-attack, which started in June 2018. The information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said BA failed to take adequate measures to keep customers’ personal details secure. “Their failure to act was unacceptable and affected hundreds of thousands of people, which may have caused some anxiety and distress as a result. That’s why we have issued BA with a £20m fine – our biggest to date,” she said. “When organisations take poor decisions around people’s personal data, that can have a real impact on people’s lives.” The BA case was the first major one to be carried out under toughened data laws that allow for far heavier fines as a proportion of a company’s turnover than had previously been the case. The ICO found BA ought to have identified weaknesses in its security, and could have resolved them with security measures available at the time. Of the approximately 430,000 customers and staff affected by the breach, about 244,000 people had their full name, addresses and payment card details, including the CVV security number, exposed. A BA spokesman said: “We alerted customers as soon as we became aware of the criminal attack on our systems in 2018 and are sorry we fell short of our customers’ expectations. “We are pleased the ICO recognises that we have made considerable improvements to the security of our systems since the attack and that we fully cooperated with its investigation.”"
"The toy retailer Hamleys is shedding more than a quarter of its workforce in London as the health crisis prompts shoppers to shun the capital’s world-famous shopping district. Founded in 1760, Hamleys is the world’s oldest toyshop, with its store on Regent Street a magnet for international tourists in normal times. But the absence of foreign holidaymakers and tightening local restrictions, which mean the number of office workers is once again dwindling, is devastating trade in the area. Hamleys confirmed that 60 of the 208 staff working in the store and nearby head office building were leaving as part of a redundancy programme. The pandemic has also delayed plans to refurbish the seven-storey shop which is now part of the business empire of India’s richest person, the billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Known as the “mile of style”, Regent Street is one of the world’s top shopping destinations with retailers paying through the nose for a pitch. But after an initial bounce when shops reopened, footfall has stalled since the summer, with the area attracting half the usual number of visitors, according to the New West End Company, which represents hundreds of businesses in the area. Last week, the coffee and sandwich shop chain Pret a Manger announced a second wave of store closures in London after suffering a fresh slowdown in sales because of the pandemic. “Regent Street relies massively on the tourist trade but there is none and the people who work in head offices around here are sitting at home,” said one Hamleys insider, who said retailers in the area were grappling with a devastating slump in trade. “The store has always been the goose that lays the golden egg but it is suffering.” With shoppers “fearful” about using public transport for shopping trips in the capital, the New West End Company is trying to convince them it is safe by promoting measures such as 24-hour cleaning. The business group is also turning on Christmas light displays earlier than usual to spread out trade during the “critical” eight-week period when retailers there take a third of their annual sales. While shoppers are reluctant to visit major city centres because of the health crisis, regional shopping centres are faring better.  Hamleys, whose web sales have surged during the pandemic, has also seen stronger sales in stores outside London, which include the Lakeside mall in Essex. To capitalise on the important sales weeks between now and Christmas the toy specialist is also opening 11 pop ups shops. The temporary stores, which include branches in the Metrocentre in Gateshead, and Liverpool One, have created 80 jobs."
"The supply of food to care homes, schools, hospitals and prisons is at risk unless the government steps in to support struggling wholesalers, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been warned. Trade bodies representing major food companies said the loss of business from the hospitality sector, which has been rocked by the 10pm curfew and limits on household mixing, meant that firms which also serve the public sector could fail. “Without the income from the commercial sector, the supply of food to institutions such as care homes, prisons, schools and hospitals is at immediate risk,” they told Sunak in a letter seen by the Guardian. They highlighted items made especially for care homes and hospitals, such as easy-to-swallow foodstuffs for people who have difficulty eating. “Wholesalers send specialist food to care homes and this cannot be replaced by deliveries from supermarkets,” said the Federation of Wholesale Distributors and the Food and Drink Federation. “The same supply chain is also essential to the ongoing supply of food to primary and secondary schools for the provision of school meals.” They urged Sunak to hand out discretionary grants and extend the furlough scheme to wholesalers in areas under tier 2 and 3 restrictions, to avoid supply warehouses closing. They also want business rates relief to be extended to the wholesale sector. “The above measures are essential to ensure continuity of critical public sector food and drink supply and the government must introduce them immediately,” they said. Andrew Selley, chief executive of wholesaler Bidfood, said the industry had not been eligible for support offered to hospitality businesses affected by the government’s tiered system of Covid-19 restrictions. “Our customers range from Michelin-starred chefs through to high street casual dining, cafes, restaurants, pubs, workplace, travel catering and all of those in areas that have been affected,” he said. “But we also do schools, universities, care homes, hospices and prisons. That varies by wholesaler but it’s about 70% hospitality and 30% public sector. When 70% of your customer base is impacted, your income goes down significantly. “Whilst we have some variable cost like the number of people picking and delivering, the public sector contracts require delivery to every postcode. There’s a limit to how much cost you can take out. “Not all of the wholesalers will survive and that means disruption to supply. The thing that’s galling for us is that the wholesale sector and supply chains in general have had no sector-specific support.” The Treasury is understood to believe that financial packages on offer for some struggling hospitality businesses is, by proxy, support for the supply chain. The Treasury said: “We’ve put in place a comprehensive plan to protect, support and create jobs, with more than £200bn of support since March – with particular support for the hospitality sector and it’s [sic] wider supply chain. “And our winter economy plan will ensure this continues in the difficult weeks and months to come – providing a toolkit of support for all situations. “Our expanded job support scheme will protect jobs in businesses that are open or closed, we’ve increased grants for firms required to close and are providing additional funding for local authorities and devolved administrations. “This is alongside existing support measures including extended VAT cuts, businesses rates holidays and our extended loan schemes.”"
"The Harry Potter publisher, Bloomsbury, has reported its most profitable first half in more than a decade, after a nation tiring of box sets fuelled a lockdown boom in book sales. The company furloughed staff as the coronavirus crisis forced the publishing industry to shut down, but has seen a remarkable change in fortune as the pandemic has persisted. “It is a complete surprise because we had as grim a beginning to the pandemic as everyone else in March when 100% of our customers shut down worldwide,” said Nigel Newton, the chief executive. “And then we found that early on people showed short attention spans and were watching TV. But then reading reasserted its power and people found they could escape through books, and sales have been booming ever since.” Profits surged 60% to £4m in the six months to the end of August, the highest first-half earnings since 2008, as revenues grew 10% to £78.3m. The better-than-expected performance sent Bloomsbury shares 15% higher, to 242p, at midday on Tuesday. A key driver has been the consumer division, which includes the Harry Potter series. There was a more than fourfold increase in profits at the division, to £2.7m, as sales rose by 17%. The publisher said print sales of Harry Potter books grew by 8% from mid-July to the end of September.  Overall online book sales and e-book revenues, from readers using devices such as Kindle, were “significantly higher” but the group would reveal its figures. Newton said certain books had captured the mood of many during the lockdown, such as Rutger Bregman’s Humankind: A Hopeful History, Polly Samson’s Greek island-set A Theatre for Dreamers and a resurgence in popularity of Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking To White People About Race, as the Black Lives Matter movement took hold. Other titles to do well included cookery books by Paul Hollywood and the restaurant Dishoom, as people looked for indoor hobbies as bars, pubs and restaurants were shut. “Books turned out to be essential components of so many people’s periods of being at home and rediscovering the joy of reading,” Newton said. With schools and universities shut, Bloomsbury’s digital learning resources division reported a 47% year-on-year rise in revenues, with a near three times increase in customer numbers. Alastair Reid, media analyst at Investec, said: “Despite early investor concerns over the impact of Covid-19 on demand, and Bloomsbury’s ability to fulfil it, the group’s performance continues to confound these fears. “The performance in fundamental terms reflects the strength in demand for its titles, alongside a surge in demand for digital products.” Why I’m No Longer Talking To White People About Race – Reni Eddo-Lodge White Rage – Carol Anderson Humankind – Rutger Bregman Such a Fun Age – Kiley Reid Lose Weight for Good – Tom Kerridge Dishoom: From Bombay with Love – by Dishoom restaurant A Baker’s Life – Paul Hollywood"
"Whitbread, the owner of Premier Inn, has slumped to a loss of £725m in the first half of its financial year and warned that bookings had slowed since regional lockdowns were imposed in October. The UK’s biggest hotel operator, which also owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub-restaurant chains, has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, which triggered a 99% collapse in sales during the national lockdown in the spring. Whitbread reopened its hotels and restaurants in July and August and benefited from a staycation boom, with bookings strong for seaside and traditional tourist destinations such as Brighton and Bath. In those towns, its hotels were almost 80% full in August. But elsewhere most travellers stayed away, particularly in London and other cities. Overall, hotel occupancy averaged 51% in August, rising to 58% in September, but has fallen to about 50% in October. Alison Brittain, the Whitbread chief executive, predicted a further decline in occupancy in November and December after the introduction of tiered systems of coronavirus restrictions in England and Scotland and the firebreak lockdown in Wales. Of Premier Inn’s 840 hotels, 440 are in areas with increased restrictions but remain open, while its 40 hotels in Wales are closed. It has introduced a more flexible booking system allowing customers to cancel more easily. The £725m loss in the six months to 31 August, compared with a profit of £220m in the same period last year. Revenues plummeted to £250.8m from £1.084bn. Its results came as a report from the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted it could take the UK hotel industry four years to return to 2019 levels of business – even if an effective coronavirus vaccine, expected sometime next year, leads to a return of travellers. Brittain said the surge in hotel bookings in popular destinations in August, where “anywhere with a mountain or a beach was full”, showed people were still keen to travel. “Even post-pandemic, people will still want to travel and see family.” She said Premier Inn did not tend to host business meetings, so had been cushioned somewhat from the slump in business travel, as firms held more virtual meetings. Whitbread has announced up to 6,000 redundancies in the UK and raised £1bn from shareholders in May to shore up its finances. It has suspended its dividend payments and management has taken a pay cut. Brittain is pinning her hopes on Germany, where Whitbread trebled its hotels to 21 over the first half. It plans to sign up 15 more hotels by December, with the ambition to make Premier Inn the biggest budget-hotel chain in the country."
"Retailers and hospitality firms have warned of the devastating financial impact of a new month-long lockdown in England which they say threatens billions of pounds worth of Christmas trade and puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk. The next two months should be the most lucrative time of the year for the high street but 500,000 shops, restaurants and pubs will have to close on Thursday and remain shut until 2 December. Shoppers usually spend around £50bn on goods other than food in the weeks leading up to Christmas as they gift clothes, toys and the latest technology to friends and family. But the new measures will force about 363,000 specialist stores to close, leaving major retailers such as Marks & Spencer and John Lewis with mountains of stock to shift through their websites and the click-and-collect services still allowed to operate. The challenge faced by retailers is underlined by the prediction that shopper numbers in England will drop by about 80% during the November lockdown as Britons are told to shop only for essentials. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard which tracks shopper numbers, said the restrictions meant retailers would now miss out on “essential weeks of Christmas trading, including Black Friday”. During the spring lockdown, the closure of non-essential retail stores meant the high street missed out on £1.6bn of sales each week. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the importance of the festive shopping period meant losses are certain to be much bigger and would impact the viability of “thousands of shops and hundreds of thousands of jobs”. The fashion retailer Next said even a fortnight-long lockdown would cut its sales by about £57m. Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics, said the new lockdown was a “devastating blow” for the industry. “Small retailers remain in survival mode and profits made during the festive period will determine whether they continue to trade into the new year,” he said. Analysts said the closure of the high street would push shoppers into the arms of online specialists such as Amazon. The British Independent Retailers Association said a quarter of independent retailers did not survive the last lockdown and the sector risked being “decimated” by a second. Waterstones managing director James Daunt said the pandemic had been “very, very, very, very, underline ‘very’ as many times are you like, good for Amazon” but bad for small high street businesses. The bookseller could still despatch web and click-and-collect orders from its stores but independent stores would not have that infrastructure to fall back on. “For a big retailer like Waterstones there is a narrow and difficult path through this but I worry for people without that additional capability,” said Daunt. Even before the lockdown was announced Amazon had warned the tilt towards online shopping meant even it was going to be “stretched” to meet the huge volume of orders expected. Similarly Gary Grant, the founder of The Entertainer, has warned that couriers were “already overloaded” and the toy industry would face a struggle to get toys into children’s hands in time. Lim said the shift towards online shopping this Christmas would now be of “epic proportions” and there were serious doubts over whether the industry could cope. “There will be a strain on websites, warehouses and, crucially, delivery networks,” he said. “The industry just isn’t set up for such a colossal switch to online.” The weeks of frenetic socialising in the run-up to Christmas and new year are also extremely important for Britain’s struggling pubs, restaurants and hotels. Some venues bank as much as 40% of their annual profits between Halloween and January. But this year nearly 53,000 pubs, restaurants and cafes in England will have to shut, according to data from the retail estate adviser Altus Group. Hospitality firms were already buckling under the strain of existing restrictions such as the 10pm curfew. UKHospitality, the industry trade body, said the costs of a second lockdown would be “even heavier than the first” as some businesses, such as nightclubs, had never even re-opened. Kate Nicholls, its chief executive, said the hospitality industry had been “pushed to the limits” by the pandemic, with many venues already closing. “For those that have survived, viability is on a knife edge.”"
"Some people who are working from home have been looking for alternative workplaces, such as fitness clubs and cocktail bars, to break the monotony of working at the kitchen table. Guardian business reporter Joanna Partridge said: “Businesses are hoping that the offer of a desk, reliable wifi and refreshments will attract workers weary of half a year of working from home, while boosting their income in challenging times.” We want to hear about the different places people in the UK are working from when they are not at home.

"An estimated 6m small businesses in the UK supporting 16.6m jobs are in a financially precarious position as a result of the pandemic, a London business school has warned. Nearly two-thirds of entrepreneurs felt their business might not survive the pressures of Covid-19, while more than half predicted they would run out of money within the next 12 months, according to the new study from King’s Business School. Adding to the gloom, two out of three small firms in a separate survey of 1,500 small businesses said they expected trading to get worse. In the poll by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), the small firms said they expected an “incredibly difficult” trading period in the run-up to Christmas and the end of the Brexit transition period. The studies follow criticism by the Labour party that almost half a million self-employed workers have been “left in the lurch” by government support, which covers only two-fifths of their normal income despite the onset of tougher coronavirus restrictions. Rishi Sunak said last Thursday that he would significantly expand the coronavirus-related job support scheme to pay a larger share of workers’ wages than initially planned, alongside more money for the self-employed and grants for businesses in areas affected by local lockdowns. In the study by Kings’ Business School (part of King’s College London), more than 350 entrepreneurs were questioned at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown to map and evaluate the impact on their businesses and on them personally. Almost two-thirds (61%) reported that the future existence of their business was under threat due to a slump in trade. Researchers said this suggests that there are potentially 16.6 million UK jobs at risk. Small businesses contribute 52% of the £2.2tn turnover generated by the private sector and employ 60% of all private sector workers. Prof Ute Stephan, who led the research alongside colleagues Dr Przemysław Zbierowski and Pierre-Jean Hanard, said: “While entrepreneurs were optimistic and could see possible long-term positive impacts on their businesses, it was also clear that many were in survival mode.” She said entrepreneurs were agile and adaptable by nature, “but there are only so many things they can do to keep their businesses afloat. With many parts of the country facing stricter lockdown, we urge the government to help SMEs find ways to adapt and build on their potential to ‘build back better’ as the backbone of a more inclusive and greener post-Covid UK economy.” Businesses led by women were impacted more adversely than those led by men, with 72% reporting lower trading volume, compared with 56% for male-owned concerns. Mike Cherry, chair of the FSB, said: “Short memories are common in a crisis, but we must not forget that small firms were already under the cosh thanks to political uncertainty, rising costs and creaking infrastructure well before the spring. “The chancellor made some welcome adjustments to support measures last week, and it’s critical that the new job support scheme is straightforward to use, the self-employed can access the help they require, and local authority cash grants reach as many of those in need as possible, as swiftly as possible.”"
"The government will close the furlough scheme this weekend, with redundancies rising at the fastest rate on record and the second wave of Covid-19 pushing Britain’s economy to the brink of a double-dip recession, according to a Guardian analysis. As the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to end the multibillion-pound coronavirus job retention scheme and launch a less generous replacement programme, early warning indicators show business activity faltering as local lockdowns take effect. The number of people losing their jobs is rising much faster than during the 2008 financial crisis, while the economic fightback from the March lockdown is gradually fading. Faced with official forecasts that suggest unemployment could hit the highest levels since the 1980s by Christmas, Sunak was forced into unveiling a last-minute package for business and workers amid anger over lack of state support as the number of new infections rose rapidly. Writing in the Guardian, the Conservative peer David Young, who was employment secretary in the second Thatcher government, said people were losing their jobs “through no fault of their own and yet have the skills and energy to flourish when conditions return to normal”. He urged Sunak to develop new measures to spur job creation. Lord Young said the situation today was different from that in the 1980s, when he said old industries needed to change, but added that help was needed fast. “The longer people are out of work, the harder it is to get back,” he said. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. In the past month, official figures show that UK economic growth slowed in August despite the government’s “Eat out to help out” scheme providing a shot in the arm for struggling hospitality firms. Business activity has since continued to slow at the start of autumn as the number of Covid infections rises and local lockdowns are imposed. In a bright spot for the economy on this month’s dashboard, retail sales have remained resilient, as UK consumers who saved money while working from home earlier this year increase their spending on DIY and garden products. House prices have also risen at the fastest rate in four years, as people able to afford buying a property reassess their living conditions after lockdown. However, the latest dashboard shows problems are mounting for the economy as a difficult winter draws nearer. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of redundancies almost doubled, to 227,000, in the three months to August as the government started to scale back the furlough scheme and the pandemic fallout forced companies to cut jobs. The headline unemployment rate also increased by the most in a decade to 4.5%, up from 4.1% in July. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economics forecaster, has warned that the jobless rate could hit 12% – about 4 million people – before the end of 2020. As the furlough scheme ends on Saturday – when it is replaced by the less generous job support scheme (JSS) – the ONS said almost one in 13 UK workers were still in receipt of wage subsidies from the state, about 2 million people. Against a backdrop of rising unemployment and tougher restrictions across large parts of the north of England, as well as in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, Sunak has come under increasing pressure to provide further emergency support. The JSS will offer workers two-thirds of their wages rather than 80% under furlough, while there are also tougher eligibility criteria for businesses. Local leaders and rebellious Tory MPs representing northern constituencies have called for further financial assistance to protect shuttered businesses in their areas. In a message to the chancellor, Young, who was an adviser to David Cameron, said the government urgently need to use state-backed job-creation schemes to boost employment opportunities and help people start a business. “Government should now – for time is very much of the essence – re-create the programmes that worked so well in the past, market them actively, and encourage those newly out of work to get together either by themselves or with friends or colleagues and set up their own new enterprise,” he said."
"Royal Mail is to hire a record 33,000 temporary workers for the Christmas period – two-thirds more than usual – to handle the UK festive parcel frenzy triggered by the surge in online shopping. Christmas is always the busiest time for the postal service, but this year it is seeking record numbers of temporary recruits to help to sort an even higher flow of packages as high-street closures during the pandemic have forced shoppers online. The UK has about 90,000 postal workers and Royal Mail typically hires 20,000 seasonal workers. This year, the extra staff will work mainly in sorting offices, delivery vans and data centres. Sally Ashford, the Royal Mail’s chief human resources officer, said: “During these unprecedented times we believe it is critical that Royal Mail continues to deliver. We want to do our best to deliver Christmas for our customers and support the effort on the pandemic. This helps the whole country to celebrate and stay safe during these difficult times.” The company aims to fill more than 13,000 vacancies in mail sorting offices in England, 1,400 in Scotland, 700 in Wales and 500 in Northern Ireland. About 1,000 additional workers are also sought for Royal Mail’s dedicated Covid-19 testing kit collection team, while other sorting and driving roles are on offer in logistics and at its Heathrow international hub. There are also temporary positions in data inputting. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to online shopping, with restrictions closing non-essential high street shops for months during 2020 and further closures not being ruled out. Royal Mail staff have worked throughout the pandemic, despite significant safety concerns from unions. Last week, Royal Mail announced that its postal workers would for the first time collect parcels on the doorstep, in one of the biggest changes to the service as it adapts to the decline in letters and rapid growth in online shopping. Royal Mail reported a £139m increase in total revenue in the five months to 30 August, as the pandemic caused a surge in parcel deliveries. While letter deliveries collapsed, parcel volumes during that period rose by a third year-on-year – an increase of 177m parcels. It normally carries 1.3bn parcels a year. Rivals such as Amazon and other parcel companies have, however, helped to erode its market share."
"Escort and security officers working for Serco and other firms have been told to wear face masks in courts and cells amid complaints about inadequate social distancing in the criminal justice system. The abrupt policy change, which comes into force on Monday, has been imposed by the Ministry of Justice on the outsourcing company, which also runs a widely criticised contact-tracing service for the government that is supposed to limit the spread of coronavirus infections. The MoJ instruction also requires all security staff, including those working for GeoAmey, another outsourcing company that carries out similar prisoner guarding and transporting duties, to wear masks when on duty. Until recently it was assumed by the court service that work inside courtrooms was sufficiently socially distanced or individuals adequately protected by perspex screens. But the rapid rise in infections during the pandemic’s second wave has forced a review of health safety measures. The Guardian has been told of one incident in a criminal trial where a judge requested security staff to put on face masks but they declined to do so. Concern has been expressed by lawyers and other court staff over the more relaxed regulations inside court buildings compared with compulsory mask wearing in shops. Last week, the barrister Sarah Forshaw QC tweeted that mask-wearing for security at court would be desirable.  Another barrister tweeted: “Well, none of us could have predicted this. Also, why are GeoAmey etc not telling the cells staff to wear masks or providing PPE? In every cell area I’ve been in during the pandemic, gaolers have been maskless.” Concerns have also been expressed by Intermediaries for Justice, the experts who sit alongside vulnerable witnesses and defendants in court, helping them to understand and communicate during proceedings. Catherine O’Neill, the chair of the charity, said: “Our members are concerned that dock officers are not wearing masks. The conference rooms are extremely small and intermediaries throughout the country are reporting concerns that when they visit the custody suites there’s poor ventilation but no one seems to be wearing PPE [personal protective equipment]. “I have seen barristers wearing visors and masks. One judge used gloves. But the dock officers in Serco uniforms were not wearing any PPE. Serco is running the test-and-trace contract. I cannot understand why they do not have a duty to look after their employees and to the prisoners who will be the last to have a voice. “After being in court the other day where no masks were worn in the building, it felt like a different world when I stepped outside and all the cafes and shops were compliant and doing their best.” A Serco spokesman said: “As of 21 October [the date the MoJ letter arrived], all Serco officers have been mandated to wear PPE face masks by our customer, the MoJ. “Prior to that date, safe systems of work were in place which were endorsed by the MOJ, where a risk assessment process determined whether a mask was to be worn; for instance for confirmed or suspected Covid cases only or where the 2-metre rule could not be met. “All safe systems of work and risk assessments were aligned to PHE guidance; this has clearly now changed to reflect more stringent measures.” A spokesperson for GeoAmey said: “With limited exceptions, from Monday 26 October it will be mandatory for GeoAmey employees to wear GeoAmey-provided medical-grade PPE face masks when entering an HMPPS establishment, within the court custody suite and associated docks, and aboard vehicles and in offices where social distancing cannot be maintained.” An MoJ spokesperson said: “All custody and security staff are required to wear masks where social distancing is not possible. Following consultation with partners this will be extended to all circumstances.” Judges are understood to have been given discretion to decide whether security staff need to wear them while sitting in the dock alongside a defendant."
"Airlines are struggling to find enough planes to take holidaymakers to the Canary Islands during the half-term break, after the industry was caught short by the government’s decision to remove the islands from England’s quarantine list. Prices for flights to the Canaries surged after the islands – along with the Maldives, Mykonos and Denmark – joined the list of “travel corridors”, meaning visitors do not have to self-isolate on their return. On Friday afternoon, no-frills airline Ryanair was quoting a £690 “value fare” return trip to Lanzarote, leaving on Sunday and coming back a week later. Other travel companies were unable to offer any flights at all. Jet2, the UK’s second largest tour operator, said it would not resume flights to the Canaries until 30 October – the last day of the half-term holiday for most English schools. Industry figures told of a mad dash to find planes as tour operators – including a reborn Thomas Cook – fielded a wave of inquiries for next week, when much of the UK will be subject to restrictions on socialising and recreation. Airlines had reduced the number of available flights during the pandemic and are casting around for short-notice capacity to meet the unanticipated demand. John Hays, who runs tour operator Hays Travel, said the return of the Canary Islands was “the first piece of good news we’ve had in ages”. “We’ve done double the number of bookings across the group compared to the same time yesterday. But there’s virtually nobody flying. The reports we’re getting is that it’s only [tour operator] Tui with any availability because they hadn’t cancelled flights. “The other guys, I’m told, are rushing to put capacity on, but the logistics at short notice of getting a plane crewed is not as easy as you might think.” Hays said there was a risk of would-be holidaymakers being left disappointed if not enough planes could be found to meet demand. The flight price comparison site Skyscanner said traffic to its website doubled after the government added the Canaries to the travel corridor. A spokesperson said: “It looks like Brits are clamouring to flock south for the winter, and demand for holidays in the sun-soaked Canaries has come at just the right time for people looking for a break.” While airlines and tour operators have struggled to increase capacity, easyJet said it had managed to add flights from London Gatwick and Manchester in time for half-term, which starts on Sunday. It has put on 180,000 extra seats between now and the end of March and brought forward the launch of new routes to the Canaries, in response to a 500% increase in searches overnight. But its package holiday arm will not resume trips to the Canaries until 2 November. Tour operator Tui said it was ramping up flights from regional airports to cope with the extra demand. “The phenomenal reaction from our customers to the reintroduction of the Canary Islands shows just how much people want a holiday,” said Tui UK’s managing director, Andrew Flintham. “Our half-term bookings have soared since the announcement at 5pm yesterday, with 25% of those booked to travel to the Canaries departing for the islands tomorrow or Sunday.” Thomas Cook, relaunched as a “Covid-ready” online-only brand by its Chinese owner Fosun after its 2019 collapse, said traffic on its website had tripled, with searches for destinations such as Tenerife and Lanzarote soaring."
"Legal & General has sold its personal investing business worth nearly £6bn to Fidelity, in a deal that will add 300,000 customers to the new owner’s client base. The deal involves £5.8bn in assets under management held in individual savings accounts (Isas), junior Isas and general investment products that are invested in Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) funds. While Fidelity International will now be in charge of the administration responsibilities linked to the 300,000 accounts those customers will still be invested in LGIM funds. LGIM will continue to earn an investment management fee as a result. However, Fidelity said customers would “pay the same or less” than they do in their direct arrangement with LGIM and would also have access to 3,000 funds, shares, investment trusts and exchange-traded funds that can be held in an Isa, self invested personal pensions (Sipps) or investment account. “The transaction therefore gives customers the best of Fidelity International’s large scale administration and the LGIM investment expertise that they chose,” LGIM said in a statement. However, Jason Hollands, of advisers Tilney, said: “Over time that may mean those customers who previously owned LGIM products may choose to invest in wider range of funds available on that platform.” The deal will double Fidelity’s personal investing client base, which hosts 280,000 customers, with £20.3bn worth of assets under management. The transaction is expected to be completed in the next 12 months. However, the amount that Fidelity paid for the consumer book has not been disclosed. LGIM said the transaction would not have a material impact on group earnings. Hollands said the LGIM book sale was the latest example of fund managers deciding it can be easier to either manage customers directly or manage the funds – rather than do both. “Fund groups are clearly thinking about whether they want to interface directly with the end investors and coming to different conclusions,” he said. “In recent years a number of groups have passed their direct client bases on to third-party platforms, but conversely there has also been evidence of some providers wanting a more vertically integrated approach with the likes of Schroders and M&G building out wealth management divisions.” Stuart Welch, the global head of personal investing and advisory at Fidelity International, said:“This is an exciting acquisition for us. It follows our recent purchase of Cavendish Online Investments and reflects our ambition and commitment to the UK direct investor market.” The acquisition of Cavendish Online will add a further £900m-worth of assets and 30,000 customers to Fidelity’s client base."
"The boss of online rail ticket seller Trainline is stepping down, less than two months after cashing in more than £3m worth of shares. Clare Gilmartin, who has run the business for seven years, said she was leaving to spend more time with her family. She led Trainline into a successful London stock market flotation last year when it was valued at around £2bn, having overseen the company’s growth into international markets and offering coach tickets. However, the Covid-19 pandemic, which initially saw passengers advised to stay off public transport, saw Trainline revenues sink to less than a quarter of 2019 levels in the first half of this year. Its share price had recovered from a sharp plunge in March, when emergency rail contracts were announced by the UK government to replace rail franchises, but dwindled and then dropped 13% on Tuesday after Gilmartin’s departure was announced. The shares she sold in August were worth almost £900,000 less on Tuesday evening. Analysts have predicted that the long-term shift away from business travel, as well as potential changes in ticketing, could leave the company exposed. Gilmartin – who sold almost £16m worth of shares in the 2019 float – will be succeeded in February by Jody Ford, who recently joined the company as chief operating officer. Ford was previously the chief executive of Photobox group, which included the Moonpig greetings card brand, having earlier worked for online auction platform eBay. Gilmartin will stay on as a senior adviser. Gilmartin said: “The decision to step down next year is a personal one; after seven years at the helm the time has come for me to spend more time with my family. “I am immensely proud of our progress over the last several years – including driving the advancement of digital ticketing and the customer shift online, our international expansion and our track record for meeting and exceeding expectations, particularly in our first year as a public company.” Trainline was started in 1997, then part of the Virgin Group, and quickly became established as the leading seller of rail tickets in the UK’s post-privatisation market, with the growth of online ticketing, and as rail operators made advance tickets available at a huge discount for rail travellers. It continues to provide “white label” booking systems for several UK rail operators. With the slump in travel this year due to coronavirus, revenues were down to £129m for the first half of 2020. In the first quarter, it issued so many refunds that its business travel division took in just 1% of the net revenues from the same period in 2019."
"The Metropolitan police has ditched a “despotic” proposal to demand that pubs and restaurants check customers’ IDs and addresses to prevent household mixing, in an apparent U-turn after a backlash from the hospitality industry. Venues in London had received a letter telling them to “take steps to satisfy themselves” that patrons were not gathering in groups of more than one household. “This could include requesting photographic identification with names and addresses,” the letter says, prompting concern that forces around the country could place the onus on struggling venues to police social interactions. The letter, first published in the Daily Mail, drew fire on Wednesday from publicans, trade bodies and industry figures, including JD Wetherspoon’s founder-chairman, Tim Martin. “The great danger of granting emergency powers to governments […] is that they are used for illicit purposes,” Martin said. “Now civilians – publicans – are being required to verify living arrangements for other civilians. “If Boris, Hancock and co are not deliberately despotic, they’re certainly innumerate and incompetent – and are playing a dangerous game with civil liberties.” The British Beer & Pub Association chief executive, Emma McClarkin, branded the proposal “fundamentally inappropriate and completely unacceptable”, while the UK Hospitality chief, Kate Nicholls, cautioned against piling more pressure on staff who were “already stretched and under enormous pressure”. The Night Time Industries Association said that it had taken legal advice and believed that the Met should withdraw the “misleading and unlawful” proposal. In an apparent climbdown on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson said the letter did not reflect the policy of the Metropolitan police service. “The MPS will be in contact with the recipients of the letter to clarify that the advice, although well-intentioned, does not reflect MPS policy,” the spokesperson said. Pub chains have largely taken the approach of asking whether people are from separate households but were ultimately relying on their guests’ honesty. Greene King said it did not take addresses but bar staff would intervene if there was a clear breach of the rules, such as a table of locals known to be from different households. The London-focused Fuller’s chain said it asked people entering the pub: “Can we just check that you are from one household?” Pubs have been among the hardest-hit businesses by measures designed to restrict the spread of Covid-19, including the new three-tier system imposing curbs on household mixing and preventing venues in some areas from serving alcohol. Figures released on Wednesday by the hospitality analysis firm CGA found that businesses in the highest-alert tier in England – where they can open only if they serve substantial meals, and people cannot meet with anyone outside their household – suffered most. Daily sales dropped 60-62% last weekend, compared with the same weekend in 2019."
"Poultry farmers are urging the government to lift travel restrictions to allow hundreds of specialist EU turkey pluckers to fill jobs in the UK, with a warning that there could be a shortage of birds or higher prices if the restrictions are not waived.  An urgent exemption from Covid-related quarantine is needed to avoid shortages of highly skilled turkey pluckers and butchers that could trigger the collapse of this year’s supply, says the British Poultry Council (BPC). Around 9m British turkeys are reared for Christmas each year but the seasonal sector cannot survive without non-UK labour, it warns. The proposed exemption would cover at least 1,000 seasonal workers who normally travel from Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia at the end of October to help slaughter, pluck and prepare birds destined for UK Christmas dinner tables. It says workers with typical two-month contracts will not come if they have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, even if they are provided with Covid-secure accommodation and “work bubbles”. “The seasonal turkey sector is vital to delivering the Great British Christmas and it cannot survive without access to non-UK labour,” said BPC’s chief executive, Richard Griffiths. “If these vacancies cannot be filled, it will have a significant impact on the production of, and therefore cost of, food – all of which will pose a risk to affordability.” “Government must ensure that British poultry meat, and the quality it represents, stays affordable and available for all. Losing control of ourselves as a nation would penalise British food producers at a time when we should be taking matters of food security into our own hands.” The BPC is the trade association for UK producers of poultry meat – chicken, turkey, duck and goose. Its members account for nearly 90% of production, and raise nearly 1bn birds every year. Turkey farmers rely heavily on seasonal help to assist with the intensive job of slaughter: hand-plucking, weighing, hanging and evisceration. With lockdown forcing smaller festive gatherings, farmers are finding it difficult to predict consumer demand, and there are fears that larger birds will be out of favour.  Chicks – or poults – typically ordered in February grace the Christmas dinner table as fully grown birds the following year. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), between January and June 2020 there were 6.2m poults being reared on farms, compared with 6.1m in the same period in 2019. Intensive meat processing plants have already fallen victim to outbreaks of Covid-19. A thousand staff at Bernard Matthews’ facility in Holton, Suffolk, have been tested after 72 colleagues were found to be Covid-19 positive."
"Langan’s Brasserie, the London restaurant once co-owned by the actor Michael Caine and famous as a 1980s celebrity haunt frequented by diners as diverse as Princess Margaret, Muhammad Ali and Mick Jagger, is teetering on the brink of administration. Up to 100 jobs are at risk at the brasserie, which was opened in 1976 by Caine and the restaurateur Peter Langan. The eatery was a favourite destination for the rich and famous, and known for the antics of Langan, who would climb on tables and crawl beneath them to nibble his customers’ ankles. He once put out a fire in the kitchen with vintage champagne. The restaurant, in Stratton Street, Mayfair, central London, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal measure that provides 10 working days of protection from creditors as advisers examine options for the business. The brasserie has been battered by Covid-19 restrictions and a lack of tourists in the capital; it also faces the end of the UK government’s furlough scheme, due to end on 31 October. The financial advisory firm Begbies Traynor has been lined up as potential administrator and is understood to be in talks with a number of possible rescuers, thought to include Richard Caring, owner of The Ivy restaurant and a string of other upscale London diners including Scott’s. Langan lined the walls of the restaurant with work by artists including David Hockney, a regular at the restaurant, who helped design the menus turning them into collectors’ pieces, and Patrick Caulfield. The Irish restaurateur had a reputation for throwing out customers, but the restaurant, which had no dress code, pulled in stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando and Mick Jagger in 1970s and 1980s to dine on its signature dish of spinach soufflé with anchovy sauce. Caine reportedly said of Langan: “Peter stumbles around in a cloud of his own vomit and is a complete social embarrassment. You would have a more interesting conversation with a cabbage.” Langan died in 1988 aged 47. The chef Richard Shepherd, who joined Langan’s in 1977 and was instrumental in its survival for more than 40 years, retains an interest in the business, although it is controlled by the entrepreneur Vijay Malde and former Bolton Wanderers chairman Ken Anderson. Langan’s closed temporarily in March just ahead of high-street lockdowns. It has not reopened. Staff were retained under the furlough job protection scheme but have been told their jobs are at risk now. Restaurateurs said London’s dining establishments were under serious strain from the loss of tourists and high-spending shoppers during the pandemic. New coronavirus restrictions on meeting other households indoors and the advice to avoid public transport were also taking a toll. One rival restaurant group said it had thousands of cancellations last weekend as “tier 2” restrictions were imposed; another said that many restaurants in London were experiencing a 75% slump in takings. One said Langan’s might struggle to find a buyer. “All restaurants have been struggling since March. After lockdown we were starting to see a recovery when more restrictions came in and knocked it for six. “Restaurants like Langan’s? How can they survive without regular visitors from out of town who want a relaxing long lunch or dinne? Those people are not around any more. London has been crippled and on the course we are on it could take a decade or more for it to recover.” Other London landmarks including Simpsons on the Strand, several Brasserie Blancs, and Le Caprice restaurant have also kept their doors closed since the lockdown in England ended. The Soho restaurant Polpo went into administration as did the dining chains Carluccio’s and Gourmet Burger Kitchen."
"International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways, has slashed its flight schedule for the rest of the year as it reported a €1.3bn (£1.16bn) loss over the third quarter. In an unscheduled trading update, the group said it was cutting flights between October and December to just 30% of normal levels, blaming the reintroduction of travel restrictions by many European governments. The loss was significantly worse than analysts’ forecasts of €920m and compares with a profit of €1.4bn in the same period last year. Third-quarter revenues plummeted by 83% and the group – which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus – warned the capacity cutbacks meant it would no longer reach breakeven in terms of net cash flows during the fourth quarter. In July, IAG raised €2.75bn to strengthen its balance sheet after reporting a record loss of €4.2bn over the first half as passenger numbers collapsed. Liquidity remained strong, it said on Thursday. The results were the first to be published under the new chief executive, Luis Gallego, who took over from Willie Walsh in early September. The group previously announced a reduction in flight capacity in September, but said bookings had since levelled off because of the measures implemented by European governments in response to a second wave of Covid-19 cases. IAG called the current environment “highly uncertain” and said passengers were not booking flights as expected because of government restrictions, including local lockdowns and extension of quarantine requirements for travellers from an increasing list of countries. The group has cut thousands of jobs at its airlines including Iberia and BA, where it sought to make 12,000 staff redundant as the pandemic took hold in the spring. IAG complained that governments had not swiftly adopted initiatives to give people confidence to book or travel on flights, such as pre-departure coronavirus tests or arrangements for “air corridors” between countries, which allow passengers to travel without needing to quarantine. Airport owners and British carriers, including BA, have called on the government for several months to allow the urgent introduction of coronavirus testing on passengers arriving at UK airports, warning that failure to allow this was weighing on the aviation industry and putting thousands of jobs at risk. The UK’s first pre-departure coronavirus testing facility has opened at Heathrow, but the £80 test is only available to passengers flying from London to Hong Kong on airlines including BA, Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific. The tests must be pre-booked, and results will be available within an hour, a move that is seen as a significant breakthrough in demonstrating the possibility of clearing healthy passengers to travel and potentially ending quarantine rules. BA has been pushing for trials of pre-departure testing between the US and UK, previously its most lucrative route but currently vastly reduced because of travel restrictions. The carrier retired its entire Boeing 747 jumbo fleet this year to cut costs with the drop in long-haul demand. One of BA’s 747s has been saved from the scrapyard, it was announced on Thursday, and is returning homewards to Dunsfold aerodrome in Surrey for future use as a film set."
"The government would save taxpayers’ money and 1.4 million people might keep their jobs if the wage subsidy for firms using the coronavirus short-time working scheme was increased, Rishi Sunak has been told. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) said as many as 2.7 million people will be at risk of redundancy this winter when the government winds down the furlough scheme next week and replaces it with the job support scheme (JSS), the plan to protect people in “viable” jobs, which the chancellor announced last month. The thinktank said as few as 500,000 of these jobs would be saved by the new scheme of wage subsidies, which offers firms a government contribution to the wages of staff working shorter working hours during the Covid crisis. Under the government’s plans, the Treasury will cover a third of an employees’ wages while they are off work, and their employer has to contribute the same amount to get the state support, maintaining the worker’s pay packet at 77%. However, the NEF said cutting employer contributions from 33% to 10% would have a dramatic effect, helping to save as many as 1.4m jobs – almost triple the number of jobs it estimated the JSS would support. It said failure to take such steps would result in 2.2m job losses this winter, with most redundancies falling in the accommodation and food sector, whereas many as 360,000 jobs could miss out on support. Experts have said the JSS offers little incentive to companies to retain workers, because of how much they have to contribute to obtain government funding. In most cases, the NEF said, it would be cheaper for an employer to make one worker redundant while keeping a second on 100% of their hours, rather than keeping both on 50% and using the scheme to top up their wages. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, who worked with the Treasury to develop the job support scheme and joined Sunak on the steps of Downing Street to launch it, said urgent changes to the scheme were needed as the Covid emergency had worsened. Responding to the NEF research, she said: “With restrictions tightening, it’s clear that we need a more generous short-time working scheme for businesses hit by reduced demand. Reducing employer contributions could help save many more jobs. Ministers must act on this now and increase support for workers in businesses forced to close, and for the self-employed.” Sunak, faced with mounting pressure to raise the level of job support as the government imposed tough local lockdown restrictions across the north of England, announced an expansion in the JSS earlier this month to protect workers at companies forced to close by the new controls. The expansion of the JSS involves the government paying two-thirds of workers’ pay and removes the requirement for company contributions – in effect a new furlough scheme from November for firms in tier 3 areas. However, the NEF said businesses facing tier 2 controls would also have reduced demand for their goods and services, and that high levels of employer contributions to use the JSS would trigger a surge in unemployment. It said cutting the level of employer contribution would require the Treasury to contribute more, but that would be cheaper for the public purse than allowing millions of people to fall out of work. The research showed the cost to government of making up the difference to ensure employee wages were protected at 77% would, on average, be just £200 a month for each worker – significantly less than the costs of unemployment benefit, which started at £410 a month for a single adult before support for housing costs. Alex Chapman, senior researcher at the NEF, said: “The present scheme was designed for a period of recovery, not a second wave, and it will not meet the chancellor’s stated aim of protecting ‘viable’ jobs. The good news is that there is a simple fix.”"
"Shaftesbury, the central London landlord that owns Chinatown and swathes of Soho and Covent Garden, has announced emergency plans to raise almost £300m to help it survive the coronavirus crisis as tourists and workers stay away from the West End. The property firm is still struggling to collect rent payments from its retail, restaurant and bar tenants, who have had persistently lower footfall and trade in the capital. Shares in the company fell 15% to 415p on Thursday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, after it announced intentions to raise £297m from shareholders to boost its finances, pay some debts and make investments once the outlook for commercial property improves. Shaftesbury, which owns 16 acres of land in central London, blamed government restrictions designed to limit the spread of coronavirus, and uncertainty about their duration, for the continued slump in footfall and trade in the West End, a district that has a low number of residents and relies on office workers and international tourists. Brian Bickell, the chief executive of Shaftesbury, said: “The capital raising will ensure the group maintains the financial flexibility and resources to navigate the unprecedented near-term operational challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and that we will be well-placed to benefit from the gradual return to more-normal patterns of life and activity that have always made London’s West End an unrivalled global destination.” Shaftesbury said in September that it had received less than half (44%) of rent for the six months to 30 September, and had offered new lease terms to struggling tenants, including rent waivers, shorter leases and monthly, instead of quarterly, rental payments. It added last month that it was struggling to re-let flats, with a fifth of its 622 residential properties lying empty, after many of their previous occupants, such as international students and young professionals, returned to their home countries at the start of the pandemic. Shaftesbury is offering its new shares for 400p, an 18% reduction on Wednesday’s closing price of 487p. The landlord said it had been given commitments by shareholders who own 52.2% of the company’s stock they would take part in the fundraising. Analysts at the stockbroker Peel Hunt said Shaftesbury’s cash call had come “as a bit of a surprise, especially its size”."
"Airbnb has hired Sir Jony Ive, the lead designer of Apple’s IMac, iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, to create the next generation of the home rental firm’s products and services. Ive, who quit as Apple’s chief design officer in 2019, will also be charged with redesigning Airbnb’s website and app as the struggling San Francisco company tries to convince people to travel again despite the pandemic. Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s chief executive, said the company had signed a multiyear “special collaboration” with Ive’s design company LoveFrom. Chesky said he and Ive shared the same belief in the value and importance of creativity and design. “We each believe not only in making objects and interfaces, but in crafting services and experiences,” Chesky wrote in a blogpost. “We’ve seen how design can facilitate trust and enable more human connection, something people are desperate for during an unprecedented time of loneliness and disconnection. “We have made the decision to work together through a multi-year relationship to design the next generation of Airbnb products and services.” Ive, who was born in Chingford, east London, and studied at Newcastle Polytechnic, was knighted for services to design and enterprise in 2012. He joined Apple in 1992, and led its design team from 1996 to 2019. Airbnb is struggling in the face of the pandemic as many people have stopped travelling. The company, which expects 2020 sales to bring in less than half of that collected in 2019, laid off 25% of its staff in May. “We are collectively living through the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime, and as it began to unfold, global travel came to a standstill,” Chesky said in an internal memo at the time. “Airbnb’s business has been hit hard, with revenue this year forecasted to be less than half of what we earned in 2019.” Airbnb had planned to float on the stock market this year, but has had to delay the initial public offering (IPO) and slash the price. Some investors hoped the flotation would value the 12-year-old tech firm at up to $42bn (£32bn) – even though the Wall Street Journal reported the business lost nearly $320m in the first nine months of last year. In August it filed confidential IPO paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission but did not detail the size of the float, the expected price or the timetable. Airbnb employees have long been pushing executives to press ahead with an IPO because stock options granted to long-serving staff will start to expire next month. Those shares could be worthless if the platform is not trading on the public market."
"Royal Mail postal workers will for the first time collect parcels on the doorstep, in one of the biggest changes to the service as it adapts to the decline in letters and rapid growth in online shopping. From Wednesday customers across the UK will be able to pay a fee of 72p on top of standard postage costs for every package under the new “parcel collect” service. Pre-paid return items will cost 60p per item. Postal workers will collect up to five items per customer per day between Monday and Saturday, subject to limits of 61cm x 46cm x 46cm in volume and 20kg in weight. Items will be collected from the door or from a safe place on the property chosen by the customer. Customers will be able to make bookings only via Royal Mail’s “click and drop” online service up to five days in advance until midnight on the day before collection. The service will provide collection slots of between two and four hours. Royal Mail said the collection service was one of the biggest changes to the daily round since the postbox was launched in 1852. The first parcel post was introduced in 1883. The postal service, privatised in 2013, has struggled with the shift away from letters to parcels as firms rely more on email for routine communications just as consumers become more comfortable with online shopping and returning items. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to online shopping, with restrictions closing non-essential high street shops for months during 2020. Royal Mail staff have worked throughout the pandemic, amid significant safety concerns from unions. Royal Mail reported a £139m increase in total revenue in the five months to 30 August, as the pandemic caused a surge in parcel deliveries. Parcel volumes during that period rose by a third year-on-year – an increase of 177m parcels. At the same time, Royal Mail has repeatedly signalled that it must make major changes to its business to raise profitability as letter volume declines. Addressed letter volumes fell by more than a quarter during the same period – a decrease of more than 1bn letters. The new parcel collect service, which was first trialled around Bristol, will not result in new jobs, a Royal Mail spokeswoman said. Instead, the new work is expected to fit into the daily rounds of the UK’s 90,000 postal workers, after discussions with the Communication Workers Union. Royal Mail declined to share estimates of how many packages it expected to collect with the new service, or how much profit it expects to make. However, it said that its research showed that 44% of respondents said they were likely to use a home collection service."
"The biggest union representing Virgin Australia workers has walked away from negotiations with the stricken airline following reports its chief executive, Paul Scurrah, is leaving the company. The Transport Workers Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Scurrah’s exit raised concerns that Virgin Australia’s new owners, Bain Capital, would backslide on commitments to run a full-service airline. Running Virgin Australia as a budget airline would likely result in even more job cuts at the company, which has already sacked more than 3,000 workers, and limit competition with bigger rival Qantas, potentially increasing airfares. “The ink is not yet dry on the sale of Virgin and it appears that private equity firm Bain Equity are behaving as we feared: ripping out the heart of Virgin and reneging on promises to the Australian people,” Kaine said on Wednesday. “We are suspending negotiations on enterprise agreements while we seek clarification on these developments. For our part, we are engaged in talks in good faith. If the plan and scope of the airline as outlined in August by Bain Capital has already been scrapped then this is a serious betrayal that must be addressed.” The West Australian reported on Wednesday that Scurrah, who was a champion of running a full-service airline, had fallen out with Bain Capital and would be replaced by Jayne Hrdlicka, who was CEO at Qantas budget arm Jetstar and is disliked by unions. Industry sources told Guardian Australia that Scurrah was set to leave Virgin Australia within weeks but had agreed not to speak about his departure. Scurrah did not answer directly when asked about the West Australian’s report at a conference held by the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday. “There’s been ongoing speculation for some and I’ve never been in the habit of commenting on speculation,” he said. A Bain Capital spokesman would not confirm or deny Scurrah’s exit. Kaine said he wrote to Bain Capital on Wednesday seeking urgent clarification of Scurrah’s position and whether the company would stand by commitments it made in August that include keeping on 6,000 workers. He said he also wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, asking him to “make any further public money conditional on receiving commitments about jobs and the future direction of Virgin”. “We want answers from the federal government also on these developments and how it expects to save jobs at Virgin,” Kaine said. “If confirmed it shows how the federal government has stood by and allowed a private equity firm to take over one of Australia’s most valuable assets and renege on commitments.” Bain Capital declined to comment on Kaine’s allegations."
"Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Fortescue Metals Group should appear sooner rather than later before a parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of Juukan Gorge after two days of “quite damning” evidence from traditional owners regarding the company’s conduct in the Pilbara, the inquiry’s chairman has said. “In light of recent evidence over the past few days it is very much in their interest to present their side of the story,” the chairman, Warren Entsch, told Guardian Australia. Entsch said the federal joint standing committee on northern Australia had reached out on several occasions to Fortescue and was waiting for the company to respond. “We will continue to reach out to them because it is absolutely critical they have the opportunity to respond,” the Liberal National party MP said. The parliamentary inquiry was set up after Rio Tinto destroyed a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site in the Pilbara in May. The committee was tasked with examining how the destruction came about, the processes that failed to protect the site, and the legislative changes required to prevent such episodes from recurring. Over the past two days, Aboriginal traditional owner groups have made serious allegations about their dealings with Fortescue. Eastern Guruma Aboriginal traditional owners said the company was withholding $1.9m in royalties because they had asked “for information about their plans” for nine mining leases in areas with significant and sacred sites. “We have asked FMG to reconsider their position and they have advised us that they will only pay the royalties when we sign off on the mining leases,” the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation’s Joselyn Hicks told the inquiry on Tuesday. In reply, Fortescue said it took its relationship with traditional custodians seriously. “We are committed to open and transparent engagement to facilitate the outstanding royalty payment, in accordance with the contractual agreement and the obligations of both parties,” said its chief executive, Elizabeth Gaines. On Monday the Puutu Kunti Kuurrama and Pinikura people, the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge, said they were “pretty upset” to discover Fortescue had applied for mining leases in the area after the PKKP had managed to secure a six-month moratorium from Rio Tinto on any further work in areas of high cultural sensitivity. “We weren’t told by anyone that there was potential for FMG to come in from the side and actually apply for a mining licence,” said the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation chief executive, Carol Meredith. Fortescue said it had held prospecting licences since 2012 over an area near Juukan Gorge. In the Australian, Gaines questioned the PKKP’s version of events, stating she had been “surprised and a little disappointed because we did advise them that we intended to convert that prospecting licence to a mining lease”. Entsch said Fortescue had already lodged a written submission to the parliamentary inquiry but the new evidence had raised questions for the company to answer. “As the Rio Tinto written evidence has shown, it was contested and proven to be less than accurate,” the chairman said. “The inquiry is trying to get to the facts. This is an opportunity for FMG to put forward their facts. It would be very useful for them to give us their side of things, sooner rather than later, because the evidence we have heard over the past few days is quite damning.” A spokesman for FMG said that from the outset Fortescue had intended to appear before the joint standing committee. “Fortescue had previously confirmed arrangements for the committee to visit two Fortescue sites as part of the inquiry and for Fortescue to appear as part of that trip,” the spokesman said. “This trip was unfortunately cancelled due to the closed West Australian border. Fortescue has been in regular contact with the committee secretary to find a suitable time to appear with appropriate notice. We look forward to the secretariat’s advice.”  The inquiry is planning to visit the Pilbara in early November."
"HSBC put £1.5bn of its customers’ cash out of reach in frozen accounts, according to an internal report that raises questions over whether the bank heeded its warnings about potential financial harm to its customers.  An internal HSBC UK report seen by the Guardian shows compliance staff tried to warn Britain’s largest bank more than three years ago that it should make a concerted effort to reunite customers with their cash, and was running a “significant reputational risk” by failing to address the issue. A whistleblower took the internal report to regulators amid concerns that HSBC was not willing to overhaul its policies. The whistleblower is understood to have told the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that HSBC seemed far more willing to chase down its debtors than seek out lost account holders. However, the FCA closed the case without taking any public action despite it being part of a year-long investigation in 2019. The report, produced by members of HSBC’s UK Conduct Risk team two years earlier, said the bank had effectively frozen 1.9m accounts by labelling them “dormant”. It further alleged that HSBC made little effort to track down the rightful owners of the accounts and reunite them with their cash – including those who, the report illustrated, were easily traceable via the electoral roll or a quick online search. The report also found that HSBC’s dormant account policies were potentially harming customers, including elderly and vulnerable savers, who may have lost track of their money. Around 100,000 dormant accounts, the report said, held deposits worth more than £1,000. HSBC denied it had mistreated customers, or that it took insufficient action. It told the Guardian it had made “substantial and continuous improvements” to its dormant account policy since 2016. However, the bank has not implemented some of the key recommendations listed in the report. These included setting up a compensation scheme for customers who may have been inappropriately charged fees or temporarily blocked from accessing their funds, and hiring a credit reference agency and external specialists to conduct a “bulk trace” of customers it had lost touch with. “Once an account goes dormant, over 50% of customers never regain access to their funds,” the report said. The “Dormant bank accounts” report also found: Banks largely self-regulate their dormant accounts policies, and are not forced to report the value of dormant accounts on their books, making it difficult to track how they are managing customer funds. When an account is dormant, no money can go in or out, and the account can only be unfrozen after identity checks – often requiring customers to go into a branch and provide their account number, balance or old bank statements. After 15 years, the money is usually transferred into a government-backed charitable fund. HSBC sets accounts to dormant after 12 months for current accounts, and 24 months for savings, which is one of the shortest periods among the big four UK banks. Dormancy is typically only triggered by Barclays after 18 months for current accounts and five years for savings, while NatWest Group applies the change after more than five years, and Lloyds Banking Group after three years. There are no rules about how, or how often, banks should contact dormant account owners, and the banking industry’s own voluntary set of “pledges” merely states that banks should send a single letter before the account is frozen. While the dormancy process is meant to protect against fraud, the HSBC report found the accounts were less likely to be hit by fraud, based on data covering the 12 months before accounts were frozen. “We should consider not using this as a justification for our policy in communications with customers,” the report said. A series of 12 anonymous and randomly selected cases contained in the report illustrate how easy it could have been for the bank to find customers who may have lost track of their accounts. In one case, HSBC failed to track down a south London woman who had £3,973 of her savings frozen and then transferred to the government-backed Reclaim Fund. It sent letters to a non-existent home address that was probably mis-recorded due to a language issue. But the report suggested “customer B”, who had a Vietnamese surname, was living about a mile and a half from the postcode originally recorded by HSBC. “It took a couple of minutes to find the customer … she was the first hit of that Google search. The customer’s uncommon name makes it easy,” the report said. Another customer had £9,969 transferred into the Reclaim Fund after his account was deemed inactive for a total of 15 years. The report’s authors said the father of six was found via a search of Google and the electoral register, and that he lived in the same home listed on HSBC’s database. “It should not be difficult to reunite this customer with their funds,” the report said. In its response to the Guardian, HSBC said the recommendations in an initial report into dormant funds – which was produced in 2016 – were the “opinion of a single individual and were not submitted to any governance committee for consideration”. However, the Guardian understands that the conduct team tried to escalate the issue by expanding the report in 2017, assigning at least two staff to the project, which was later reviewed by two superiors. HSBC also said some of the circumstances described in the case studies, which were in the 2017 version of the report seen by the Guardian, were “based on unverified data”, and it questioned their accuracy. The bank insisted it tries to contact customers – via annual statements in the post or electronically – even after their accounts are made dormant. It said customers may also receive text messages and can see their dormant accounts through online banking, where the majority of customers can reactivate accounts without providing extra information. The report raised concerns that HSBC was depriving some customers of funds in frozen accounts while simultaneously earning fees and interest through other accounts and credit cards that were kept active. Over 10 years, HSBC had charged those customers around £153m, which the report said could have been covered by cash in customers’ own dormant accounts. The report urged HSBC to make sure customers were aware of their dormant accounts before approving loans, in order to cut down or cover their borrowing needs. It also recommended HSBC consider using dormant account deposits to cover defaults on the customers’ own loans. HSBC said: “We strongly refute any assertion that we have mistreated customers or have taken insufficient action to reunite customers with funds.” It said the figures outlined in the 2017 report were “either inaccurate or materially out of date and does not reflect HSBC’s current processes”. It did not disclose how much money it currently holds in dormant accounts, but said publicly available information from the Reclaim Fund shows that in 2019 it transferred £7.46m to the scheme. It is not clear why the the bank’s head of UK regulatory compliance or other executives did not pursue the allegations further. “HSBC is absolutely committed to helping customers avoid losing track of both their accounts and the funds in those accounts,” the bank said. The FCA said: “Dormant accounts is an area we have looked into and are keeping under review. If ever we discover an issue, we will work to ensure no customer loses out financially and require the firm in question to improve their processes. That is what happened in this instance. After becoming aware of the issue, we discussed our concern with the bank, which changed how it handled dormant accounts and is reviewing old accounts to ensure customers received their money.”"
"When the Kraft company responsible for America’s favorite mac and cheese set up a promotion asking people to “send noodz”, they thought customers might see the funny side of their pun. Instead, their Instagram was quickly flooded by parents lamenting the company for sexualizing mac and cheese. The promotion encouraged adults to send their loved ones boxes of Kraft’s Mac & Cheese noodles. In a broadcast since removed from the internet, Saturday Night Live’s Vanessa Bayer says to camera: “In these strange times, people are in need of extra comfort. That’s why it’s always a nice gesture to send noodz … To be clear, I’m not advocating you send nudes to anyone. Send noodz, not nudes.” But outraged customers have complained that Kraft is a “family company” and have even suggested that the advert is a gateway to children actually sending nudes. One customer told Buzzfeed’s Tanya Chen that the post “grooms children into believing it’s OK and even FUNNY to “send noods”.. “Horrible. Never buying Kraft again,” another wrote in response to the promotion. “If you’re going to use children in your advertising then you should NEVER have advertisements like your noods commercial,” wrote another. Things escalated quickly. Soon, some posters were using the campaign to spread the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that a gang of Satan-worshipping Democrats and high-profile celebrities routinely traffic and abuse children. “We’re all trying to save our kids from you grooming monsters! Take down your noods campaign!!!!!!” one angry customer wrote. (While the conspiracy theory is clearly ridiculous, it also has had an outsized impact on political discourse, and has caused real-world harm.) The response that ensued was enough to cause Kraft to halt the campaign, remove content related to the promotion and apologize publicly. “For National Noodle Day last Tuesday, we encouraged adults to send free noodles to loved ones to provide comfort and make them smile. The social promotion resulted in 20,000 consumers across the country receiving boxes of America’s favorite Kraft mac ’n’ cheese. We sincerely appreciate and hear all of your feedback. The content will be removed from our channels,” it said in a statement to its Instagram."
"My father, Tony Mason, who has died aged 86, was one of the last of the old-style branch bank managers whose mission was to look after their customers rather than increase company profits. When the nature of British banking began to change in the early 1980s he refused to push products – such as endowment mortgages – that he knew to be inappropriate, and was proud that he regularly came bottom of league tables of performance against lending targets. The idea of such goals was anathema to him: he believed his purpose was not to lure customers into debt but to lend to people who really needed the money and had a plan to repay it. Partly due to his lack of enthusiasm for the new kind of banking, NatWest offered him redundancy at the age of 56, and he jumped at the chance. With my mother, Christine, he subsequently enjoyed many happy and relaxed years of retirement as they travelled around their favourite parts of Britain. Tony was born in Nantwich, Cheshire, to Francis, a booking clerk on the railways, and Mary (nee Hyde), a housewife. Brought up in nearby Alsager, he joined the old National Provincial Bank as a clerk after Crewe grammar school, working first in their Stoke-on-Trent branch and, after national service with the North Staffordshire regiment in Korea, at various other branches as he worked his way up the ladder. By the late 50s he had moved southwards to Daventry, Northamptonshire, where he met Christine Kemp, a clerk in the same branch. They married in 1962 and moved around as promotions took him to branches in Bedford, then Rayleigh and Wickford in Essex, Welwyn Garden City and Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and finally to Luton, where he retired. Tony’s good humour, honesty and conscientiousness were great assets for branch banking, but in another life he might have pursued interests in writing and acting. A keen amateur dramatist, he also had a talent for producing comedy scripts, born of his excellent sense of humour. In middle age, after winning a TV Times competition, he received tuition from the comedy writer Brad Ashton and some of his material was used on radio. But gag writing was too precarious a living for a staunch family man, and so he continued in his day job. In retirement golf was a consuming passion, and he remained fit enough to play right up to his death. He and Christine lived in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, from 1979 onwards, and as a supporter of Crewe Alexandra football club he monitored their fortunes from afar via match commentaries on his iPad, which he also used to keep in touch with world affairs. He is survived by Christine, his children, Anne, Stephen and me, and his grandchildren, Evie and Ingrid."
"The global aerospace industry has endured its worst quarter ever with record low orders for new aircraft and 12,000 UK jobs already lost or at risk because of the collapse in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Aircraft manufacturers received only 13 orders in July and August, according to the aerospace and defence lobby group ADS. No orders were placed in September. That compares with 152 in the same period in 2019. More than a 10th of the jobs in the UK’s aerospace industry could go as the plane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing and their suppliers adjust to lower demand, according to separate figures shown to the Guardian. At least 12,000 aerospace workers are either being made redundant or are at risk of losing their jobs, according to legally required notices of possible redundancies received by the Unite union. There were 111,000 workers in the aerospace manufacturing and maintenance sectors in 2019, according to ADS. A large number of those job losses will come from Airbus and the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which are both making thousands of redundancies. The difficulties have spread throughout the supply chain, however, and smaller companies across the UK are also cutting workers. The Labour MP Mark Tami, whose Alyn and Deeside constituency contains Airbus’s UK factory, said: “There’s a lot of focus on the prime [manufacturers], but the weakest parts of the chain are the customers and suppliers. The danger is we lose these companies and they don’t come back.”  He said the government should take a “tiered approach” in its support for business to mirror the health controls, with specific aid for the worst-affected industries, including hospitality and aerospace. The components supplier Senior has cut 600 jobs. The Chinese-owned metal components maker Gardner Aerospace and the Canadian manufacturer Magellan Aerospace, both based in north Wales, are also thought to be struggling. Tods Aerospace in Somerset fell into administration with the loss of 56 jobs in June, ending a business founded in 1932. The Canadian plane maker Bombardier announced 600 cuts in Northern Ireland and Thompson Aero Seating made about 500 workers redundant in June. General Electric and Collins Aerospace, owned by the weapons manufacturer Raytheon Technologies, have announced more than 300 redundancies in south Wales and the Midlands respectively. Rhys McCarthy, Unite’s national officer, said the UK government should match support given to their aerospace industries by Germany, which spent €9bn (£8.2bn) bailing out Lufthansa, and France, which gave out €15bn to the sector. “Other governments around the world who value their aerospace industry have taken this information and acted,” he said. “It is time the UK government, instead of always reacting with too little and too late, actually for once gets ahead of this crisis and puts in the appropriate support that will in the long term more than pay its way back.” Industry proposals for a long-term supply chain investment fund to draw in private-sector investment in smaller companies were included in the business department’s submission for the comprehensive spending review, but the three-year strategy has been delayed by the pandemic. The Treasury has previously stood in the way of another plan to bring forward defence spending. Paul Everitt, ADS’s chief executive, said the supply chain needed access to finance now in order to prepare for the industry’s recovery, including Airbus’s preparations to increase the rate of production of its bestselling A320 single-aisle aircraft from summer 2021. Suppliers have been running down the resources that they have, he said. “At a point over the next three to six months those businesses will have to start spending money again.”"
"BP’s share price has tumbled to a 25-year-low as investor jitters over the company’s ambitious transformation plans collide with fears for the future of the global oil market. The company is now worth less than half its £5-a-share value at the start of the year before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, and on Wednesday reached £2.10, the lowest point since March 1995. The oil company’s market decline accelerated in August, days after it cut its dividend for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in order to fund a shift away from fossil fuels. Market analysts believe BP faces a double risk due to its potentially expensive and financially risky transition into low-carbon energy, and the uncertain outlook for the oil industry. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that oil producers might need to wait until 2023 for the global oil price to return to $50 a barrel given the sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases affecting the outlook for an oil market recovery. A report from the global energy watchdog, published on Wednesday, found that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has already weighed on global market prices, causing the price of oil futures contracts to slip. The first wave of the virus caused oil demand to fall to the lowest point in 25 years before producers reined in their production to protect the oil market price. But further market interventions will be more difficult due to the “uncertain” timescale of the oil market’s “fragile recovery”, according to the IEA. The IEA said: “The longer term offers little encouragement for the producers. The [oil price] curve shows prices not reaching $50 a barrel until 2023. Truly, those wishing to bring about a tighter oil market are looking at a moving target.” Meanwhile, BP’s green energy plans could prove to be “expensive” and “a bit of a money pit” in the short term, according to analysts at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Although clean energy is increasingly lucrative that industry remains largely unchartered for BP. The company plans to increase its budget for low-carbon technologies from $500m or 3% of its total spending, to $5bn or almost a third of its budget within the next 10 years. “Even the reduced dividend is more than the group can really afford and until the oil price recovers it’s going to bleed cash. While there are some cost saving levers to pull, management really have little option but to batten down the hatches and weather the storm,” Hargreaves said."
"China’s stock market has soared to a record high of more than $10tn as the world’s second-largest economy continues a rapid bounceback from the coronavirus pandemic. The total value of all company shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzen markets rallied to hit $10.08tn (£7.7bn) on Wednesday, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. The rebound comes as the Chinese economy recovers steadily from a record drop in output earlier this year when Covid-19 first spread, driven by stimulus measures unleashed by Beijing to cushion the economic fallout. The recovery in shares has now lifted the market capitalisation of Chinese equities higher than the previous $10.05tn peak reached in June 2015, just before regulators imposed restrictions on risky trading practices which led to a crash in share prices. China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index, which tracks both the Shanghai and Shenzen markets, has risen by more than 17% so far this year, compared with an almost 9% gain for the S&P 500 index in the US. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK company shares remains down by more than 20%. China became one of the few major global economies earlier this year to avoid a technical recession – two successive quarters of economic contraction. Growth rapidly recovered in the three months to the end of June after the relaxation of lockdown measures. As the first country hit by Covid-19, and after imposing tough controls on business and social life earlier this year to contain the spread of the virus, China’s gross domestic product shrank by a record 6.8% in the first quarter. This was the first such contraction since Chinese quarterly economic records began in 1992. China’s economy grew by 3.2% in the second quarter, and is expected to have grown at a faster pace in the third quarter. Chinese trade with the rest of the world surpassed expectations in September – imports rose 13.2% compared with the same month a year ago while exports increased by 9.9%. However, economists warned that consumer spending and tourism remained below normal during China’s “golden week” national holiday, reflecting the continuing effect of coronavirus. According to data from the country’s ministry of culture and tourism, 637 million domestic tourists travelled around China during the eight-day break, generating 467bn yuan (£53.2bn) in revenue for the tourism sector. The numbers travelling and the money spent were 79% and 70% of the levels seen last year, said Miguel Chanco, senior Asia economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “China’s Golden Week holiday fell flat this year from an economic standpoint, underscoring the lingering pressure on households and pouring cold water on the economy’s supposed V-shaped recovery,” he added."
"Almost two-thirds of all businesses could be at risk of insolvency, according to official figures that reveal the UK could suffer “a flood” of bankruptcies over the coming months. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that 64% of businesses across all industries were at risk of insolvency last month, with 43% of companies running on less than six months’ cash reserves. The latest Business Impact of Coronavirus Survey (Bics) from the ONS found that the accommodation and food service industries and the administrative and business support industries had the highest percentages of firms at severe risk of insolvency, at 17% and 9% respectively. Earlier this month the business secretary, Alok Sharma, reinstated rules that force directors to stop trading if they believe their business is insolvent. The rules were lifted in March to allow businesses to continue trading, often using large government loans. A separate report by the insolvency practitioners Begbies Traynor found that more than half a million UK businesses were in “significant distress” due to the impact of the pandemic. The latest “red flag alert” report for the previous quarter revealed that 557,000 businesses were under severe strain after government restrictions hit sales. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said a ban on lease forfeiture and winding-up petitions has caused a backlog in company collapses. She said the government’s decision to lift protections that shielded directors from the laws that ban trading while insolvent was expected to result in mass insolvencies and redundancies. “With so many businesses limping along there could be a flood of insolvencies when the courts do get back to anywhere near normal capacity and attempt to clear the backlog of pending cases,” she said. “This in itself, combined with the end of the furlough scheme and other government support measures is likely to have a material impact on the UK business failure rate,” she said. “A combination of grim economic data, and very poor trading conditions, particularly in the most vulnerable sectors, such as hospitality, will take its toll and this is expected to feed through to next year’s first quarter, particularly when the government ends its high-profile corporate life-support measures.” The report also revealed a 14% increase in the number of food and drug retailers in significant distress since the start of lockdown in March. Across all sectors, there has been a 9% jump in the number of companies in significant distress since March, representing around 63,000 firms."
"The US economy bounced sharply back from the record-setting slump at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to government figures released on Thursday, handing Donald Trump a key talking point days before the election. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annualized rate of 33.1% between July and September and was up 7.4% compared with the previous quarter. The previous record was a 3.9% quarterly increase in 1950. Trump was quick to claim credit, tweeting the figures were the “Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close.” But the numbers show the US still has a long way to go to escape the devastation wreaked by Covid-19, and were boosted by extra unemployment payments, business loans and direct payments, none of which have been replenished for the fourth quarter. The news comes just five days before the US election and is the last major economic release before polls close. Even before the figures were released the Trump campaign released ads boasting: “FASTEST GDP GROWTH IN HISTORY.”  Big issues remain for the economy, however. The growth rate announcement came on the same day that the labor department announced that another 751,000 people filed for unemployment claims last week and the unemployment rate, at 7.9%, is twice as high as it was in February before the pandemic struck the US. A closer look at the numbers shows that the US’s economic woes are far from over. Thursday’s figures follow an equally historic slump in the second quarter. The US economy shrank by a revised annual rate of 31.4% between April and June, its sharpest contraction since the second world war, as much of the US went into lockdown to control the virus. The annual rate suggests the economy will continue on its current trend for the rest of the year. But such huge swings make the annualized figures misleading – no one expects such massive losses or gains to continue but most economists expect the US economy to be smaller at the end of the year than it was at the beginning. Gus Faucher, the chief economist at PNC, said the figures represented “real growth” but added “there is still a long way to go before we get back to normal.” The decision to reopen much of the economy has provided a considerable boost, especially to consumer spending, which drove much of the recovery. But it comes as coronavirus infections are soaring in the US. Covid cases hit new highs over the weekend and the US now has the largest number of infections, more than 8.6m, and deaths, over 225,000, in the world. There are also signs that the recovery has slowed in recent months. Unemployment claims remain at historically high levels and the number of new jobs being created has dropped month on month. The economic situation for women, people of colour and teenagers remains difficult. The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% for the US population overall in September. For Black Americans it was 12.1% and for Black teens (16-19) it was over 20%. GDP is the broadest measure of the economy and includes personal consumption, business investment, government spending and net exports. The figure has often been criticized as a measure of economic health - GDP growth has, for example, done little to address growing income inequality. For some still feeling the impact of the pandemic and its attendant recession the latest GDP news was little comfort, especially as Congress remains deadlocked over further stimulus relief. Tim Swartz in Mesa, Arizona, stopped receiving unemployment benefits on 5 September after the unemployment office flagged an issue with his payments. When the pandemic hit he had to stop working as an Uber and delivery driver to care for his five children, including one with special needs. His wife works full-time as a medicine technician at a facility for Alzheimer’s patients. “I cannot get any answers from anyone on the phone or through emails. I’m behind on rent and utilities,” Swartz said. He has now received an eviction notice. “I’m not sure how we will pay the outstanding balances for rent and utilities,” he said. “Many of us are losing hope along with everything we have worked so hard for,” said Swartz. Three of his children had to recently return to online learning after exposure to classmates who tested positive for coronavirus, further delaying his return to work. “Without any relief package to help keep the economy going I don’t see much growth in the near future and unfortunately even darker times ahead for American families.”"
"The person who duped many of the UK’s leading news outlets into running stories wrongly claiming Woolworths was returning to the high street can be revealed as a 17-year-old sixth-form student from York. On Tuesday dozens of mainstream British websites, including Mail Online and the Daily Mirror, ran prominent articles asserting that Woolworths was reopening based on nothing more than a typo-strewn Twitter account with fewer than 1,000 followers. The story, which was quickly denied by the company that bought the Woolworths brand when it went bust in 2008, led to questions about the standard of factchecking at many online outlets and the pressures on journalists to publish stories quickly in order to attract readers. BBC Two’s Newsnight programme even ran a segment asking how the public had been duped. The sixth-former told the Guardian they had been practising skills learned while taking a course in digital marketing as part of their business A-level: “The experiment wasn’t meant to get that big … but thanks to the media and over 5,000 followers, the story got big and it spread further.” They said that rather than being a textbook case of disinformation spread via social media, it was largely amplified by mainstream news outlets. “Fake news is so easy to spread, and it took Twitter over 12 hours to shut down the account. There was spelling mistakes and a lack of a website purposely injected into the account, and yet some of the media still took it as gospel. I feel bad for the reporters.” The student asked to remain anonymous because they did not want to “receive hate” from disappointed Woolworths fans hoping for the return of pick ’n’ mix selections. They provided the Guardian with evidence that they had access to the email account that controlled the short-lived Twitter account, which they worked on with a small group of fellow students during half-term. The individual, who was only five years old when Woolworths went bankrupt, has never been in one of their stores. Instead they chose the brand for an experiment testing the brand loyalty of the British public because of its nostalgic appeal and to capitalise on a pre-existing Twitter trend. Regional newsrooms across the country owned by Daily Mirror publisher, Reach, were among those to write localised takes on the viral story. “It looks like the Woolworths story we are running on a number of our sites might not be all it seems,” said one internal email to staff at regional publications owned by Reach. “The story is based on a tweet from an unverified account with just over 1,000 followers and links to a website which does not exist. A newsroom has been in touch to say they now think it is fake. The story needs looking at urgently and either verifying or changing.”"
"Spending on chocolate has soared by £50m year on year, powered by sales of chocolate bars bought in supermarkets to eat at home. The increase in sales of multipacks and large “sharing bars” has offset a dip in sales of single bars, often impulse buys to eat on the go, from newsagents and other outlets. While the £50m sales increase is only 3% up on the total value of chocolate sales, the amount of chocolate eaten is likely to have risen by two or three times that level because the kind of chocolate bought in supermarkets is so much cheaper.Sales of multipacks of chocolate bars in supermarkets are up by more than a fifth, according to analysts at research group Kantar. But the biggest increase has come from large chocolate blocks, sales of which are up nearly 46% in supermarket outlets. Waitrose said its sales of big sharing bars of brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk were up by 37% as shoppers turned to comfort eating during the lockdown. However, demand for the supermarket’s premium own-label bars was also up by a fifth as people indulged in what the grocer described as “self-treating at home”. Sales of small single bars and gift boxes for family and friends have declined after travel and visits to other households were curtailed by government restrictions. Jane Goodson, a confectionary buyer at Waitrose, said: “We’ve seen a notable increase across premium chocolate and multipack chocolates. Little treats can help lift our spirits and clearly chocolate has been a popular remedy for some during this difficult year.” Half the UK population have found their weight more difficult to manage since the pandemic hit, according to a survey. Analysts put the rise in chocolate sales down to the “lipstick effect” – a spending pattern where cheap treats sell especially well during tough economic times. Jackson Woods, a consumer specialist at Kantar, said: “Shoppers have spent an extra £260m on chocolate to enjoy at home in the past six months. The pandemic has changed our priorities, and for much of it we have been less focused on counting calories, and more on treating ourselves during a difficult time. Chocolate is a relatively cheap and easy way to do that, and people have found comfort in their favourite brands.” But despite the craving for chocolate, not all brands have cashed in. The upmarket British firm Hotel Chocolat said sales rose just 3% in the year to 28 June – with big gains made in the first half nearly wiped out by a 14% fall in sales during the last six months.  The closure of its stores for three months, including over the key Easter and Mother’s Day selling periods, hit sales hard. But the company said its customers switched in droves to buying online during that period."
"At least 115 people who work for the federal government are paid more than Scott Morrison, a Guardian Australia analysis has revealed. The list of those receiving more than the prime minister’s $549,250-a-year salary is topped by the boss of the state-owned company charged with rolling out the troubled National Broadband Network, Stephen Rue, who is on a package worth more than $3.1m a year – close to six times Morrison’s wage. An additional four NBNCo executives are in the $1m-plus club, a group of eight people that also includes Australia Post chief executive Christine Holgate, who is on $1.6m a year. It comes amid an uproar over the benefits enjoyed by commonwealth public sector workers including Holgate and top brass at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, where chairman James Shipton, who is on $775,000 a year, stood aside last week while Treasury investigates $118,000 worth of tax advice he received at taxpayers’ expense. Asic deputy chair Daniel Crennan QC resigned on Monday, walking away from his $620,000-a-year position after Treasury said it would investigate almost $70,000 in rental payments he received from the regulator. Holgate, meanwhile, has endured weeks of negative press about spending on executives at Australia Post, which included claims of $34,000 spent on luxury hotel bills while she was staying in Melbourne, where the organisation is headquartered, and $20,000 spent on Cartier watches she handed out as bonuses.  Shipton, Crennan and Holgate have all denied doing anything wrong. Guardian Australia compiled pay from across the commonwealth public sector, including government business enterprises, such as Australia Post; statutory bodies, such as Asic; and the national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. The survey is unlikely to be complete, and not all the costs of the large pay packets are borne by taxpayers; some organisations, such as Australia Post, have big revenue streams that mean no contribution from Treasury is required to pay executive wages. In the case of Australia Post, it has been struggling with the move away from mail to online, but has remained profitable due an increase in parcels, which enabled it to return a $21m dividend to the government last year. Others are dependent on government funding – by the end of June, NBNCo had drawn down almost all of a $19.5bn line of credit made available by the commonwealth. And for most statutory bodies, the cost of employing people such as Rebecca Skinner, who is paid almost $750,000 a year to run the agency responsible for the botched robodebt program, Services Australia, falls entirely on the taxpayer. The woman who was in charge of what is now Services Australia during the program, Kathryn Campbell, has moved up in the world to become secretary of the Department of Social Services, a position attracting a wage of between about $776,000 and $864,000. Among departmental heads, Morrison’s former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, earns the most – $914,000 – as secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The chief justice of the high court, Susan Kiefel, is the commonwealth’s highest-paid judicial officer, receiving $608,000 a year – $50,000 a year more than each of the six regular justices of the court, who at $551,880 a head are paid only a little more than the prime minister. Most statutory office bearers are paid a standard rate but some get special deals. For example, the coordinator general of the National Drought and North Queensland Flood Response and Recovery Agency, former conservative politician Shane Stone, receives an individual loading of $100,000 a year, taking his total wage to $544,390 – a few thousand dollars short of Morrison’s pay. However, across the broader public service the top 10 highest-paid positions are dominated by executives at NBNCo and power generator Snowy Hydro, whose managing director, Paul Broad, came in second at just over $2m a year. The data also shows that wages tend to be highest among government business enterprises, which have to compete for executive talent with a private sector where the rage of shareholders is the only curb to bosses’ pay. Guardian Australia’s analysis also shows that at Australia Post there are five executives, including Holgate, and 27 staff, whose names are not revealed in the organisation’s annual report, who earn more than Morrison. A payment of more than $836,000 to one unnamed staff member is believed to be due to a redundancy. However, Australia Post also has six staff members paid between $595,000 and $620,000. The $120,000 Holgate’s boss, Australia Post chair Lucio Di Bartolomeo, receives for the role leaves him well short of the PM’s pay. However, when added to his roles as chair of Australian Naval Infrastructure and the deputy chair of the Moorebank Intermodal Company, which is developing a freight centre in Sydney, his total pay from commonwealth roles swells to $353,000."
"Wetherspoon’s pubs will sell pints of ale for 99p to try to clear stock that will otherwise be poured down the drain during England’s new lockdown. Britain’s largest pub chain will close its English locations on Wednesday at 10pm before the lockdown, after the government’s surprise announcement on Saturday. The statement by the prime minister has prompted a scramble to prepare for another round of forced business closures. “Wetherspoon’s had already introduced significant price cuts, with pints of ale going for £1.29 as it tried to keep customers coming when the government-funded ‘eat out to help out’ scheme expired,” the company said. Wetherspoon’s had previously never lost money since its foundation in 1984, but the pandemic caused a 30% sales slump in the year to 26 July. That pushed it to a £105m loss. The short notice of the lockdown has meant pubs face the prospect of throwing away expensive stock again. Approximately 70m pints of beer were thrown away during the first UK-wide lockdown in March, according to data from the British Beer and Pubs Association. The industry group estimates 7.5m could go to waste this time. Jonathan Neame, the chief executive of Shepherd Neame, one of Britain’s oldest breweries, criticised the government for repeatedly changing its approach to the hospitality industry. Neame also criticised a ban on selling takeaway beer – which was allowed when the first lockdown eased – once the pubs close on Wednesday night. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, he said: “Now we’re told that all the beer that is in pub cellars, we can’t even sell a pint of ale as a takeaway with a meal during lockdown, so we’ve got to tip that all down the drain,” he said. A spokesman for Wetherspoon’s, Eddie Gershon, said: “All of our pubs in England will be serving their real ales at 99p a pint until the pubs close on Wednesday night. “The reality is that any real ales not sold between now and lockdown will have to be thrown away, so it is better that customers can enjoy it at a great price while the pubs remain open.” Wetherspoon’s denied the promotion would have any effect on transmission of Covid-19. Gershon said each pub had brought in government-mandated safety measures and restrictions on visitor numbers."
"The car industry has said a no-deal Brexit will add thousands of pounds to the cost of electric and conventional cars. A no-deal Brexit would add 10% to the cost of new cars imported from the EU. The average price of cars imported to the UK from the EU is about £19,000, meaning car buyers could overnight face an additional £1,900 per vehicle, according to sales data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. Electric cars are on average more expensive because of high battery costs, meaning the tariff hit for the lower-emissions vehicles would be an average of £2,800 if sales remained unchanged, the SMMT said. That would all but wipe out the £3,500 subsidy given by the government to buyers of electric vehicles and potentially deal a blow to the UK’s plans to ban fossil-fuel cars outright as early as 2030.  Car industry bosses have been among the most vocal opponents of a no-deal Brexit, but the sector is becoming increasingly concerned that it will face another damaging hit at a time when the pandemic has already cost it more than 600,000 sales compared with 2019. The UK government last week said talks were “over”, and Boris Johnson told UK businesses to prepare for leaving without a deal. However, talks were planned to resume on Thursday. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “Just as the automotive industry is accelerating the introduction of the latest electrified vehicles, it faces the double whammy of a coronavirus second wave and the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. “No-deal tariffs will put the brakes on the UK’s green recovery, hampering progress towards net zero and threatening the future of the UK industry.” Tariffs would apply on trade in both directions, meaning that demand for products from the UK’s car factories could also be directly hit, threatening UK jobs. Even if a deal is reached, some of the biggest UK factories still face the prospect of tariffs. The BBC last month reported that the EU has rejected requests for parts imported from a third country – most notably Japan – to be counted as UK products for the sake of tariff calculations, a loophole known as diagonal cumulation. The UK’s Japanese car factories, including Nissan’s in Sunderland and Toyota’s at Burnaston and Deeside, could be at a significant disadvantage if that is the case. Nikkei, the Japanese newspaper, reported that the companies had asked the UK to pay the costs of any tariffs, a prospect thought unlikely within the industry because it would contravene international trade agreements."
"An energy company is investigating how an underwater cable connecting the Western Isles with mainland Scotland was cut suddenly, causing a blackout that affected roughly 18,000 homes. The 20-mile (32km) cable, which runs on the sea bed from Skye to Harris, failed without warning six days ago. That forced Scottish and Southern Energy Networks to call on a diesel-fuelled power station in Stornoway to provide back-up electricity, and airlift extra diesel generators from the mainland in case Stornoway’s turbines fail. SSEN announced on Thursday that the 33,000V cable was unrepairable, adding that it could take between six months and a year before a new cable could be commissioned and laid. It believes the breach happened at a depth of over 100 metres about 15km offshore from Skye, and is now investigating whether it was cut by a trawler or another vessel. SSEN has asked for local shipping records so that it can pinpoint which vessels were in the area at the time the cable failed. Mark Rough, the company’s director of customer operations, said: “We’re acting as quickly as possible to progress this significant cable replacement project. “We’d like to reassure our customers that our well-established resilience plans are in place to maintain power supplies to local homes and businesses as we source and install the new cable.” John Cunningham, head of the energy unit at Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the local council, said he and the council’s leader, Roddie Mackay, had met SSEN earlier on Thursday and had been reassured that the company was working hard to restore supplies. Cunningham said the delay in replacing the cable was due to the difficulty of commissioning a new subsea cable of such length at short notice. SSEN said it also needed to hire the right vessels to carry out the work, but it could install a bigger cable, with greater capacity. The cable’s failure has major implications for the islands’ windfarms and small hydro-schemes, which are community-owned. With a total capacity of 21.5MW, they export electricity to the National Grid, raising money for local communities and investors. They have rent, wages and other costs to pay, and are counting on their insurance policies to cover income losses of up to a year, Cunningham said. “The council has very ambitious green ideas,” he said. “We’re looking to be net-zero by 2035, 10 years earlier than Scotland as a whole, so it’s disappointing to be running the whole system on diesel at this point in time.”"
"The question of what constitutes an essential item has become a vexed and politically charged one in Wales as the country heads into a 17-day “firebreak” lockdown. With most high-street shops forced to close, the Welsh government has said it is only fair that supermarkets are not allowed to sell non-essential items either. This means shoppers will be able to buy food and household supplies from their local supermarket during the lockdown, which begins at 6pm on Friday, but not clothes, toys, electrical goods, games or garden items. Items for the house, such as batteries, light bulbs and rubber goods, can still be purchased – but not utensils, crockery, furniture, bedding or “decorative items” for the home. A pumpkin? Supermarkets might still be able to sell them, as they are a food item. If they happened to be an inedible object that children carved into Halloween decorations, they would almost certainly not be allowed. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said supermarkets only selling essential goods during the firebreak was “a simple matter of fair play”: “We are requiring many hundreds of small businesses to close on the high street right across Wales. We cannot do that and then allow supermarkets to sell goods that those people are unable to sell.” Drakeford was also keen to stop people lingering in supermarket aisles perusing luxuries. “This is not the time to be browsing around supermarkets looking for non-essential goods.” The Labour leader denied that he was anti-supermarket. “It is a straightforward matter of fairness – we are in this together here in Wales,” Drakeford said. Retail lobbyists expressed concerns that the rules were difficult to navigate, while the Conservatives in Wales went further. Their health spokesperson, Andrew RT Davies, said it was an example of power going to the heads of Labour. “This is a dangerous path for Mark Drakeford and his fellow socialist commissars to go down. Who are they to determine what is essential? That varies by individual and should not be a decision taken by the state. It’s power-crazed nonsense.”"
"A majority of young Australians feel uncertain about their financial future and are delaying major life goals due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a survey has found, revealing widespread pessimism. Eighty-four percent of 1,000 millennial and Gen Z Australians said that getting a job and entering the workforce has become harder since Covid-19. The survey, conducted by ME Bank, asked 1,000 Australians between the ages of 18 and 39 about their financial futures during September. According to Australia’s McCrindle social research firm, millennials or Generation Y are defined as born between 1980 and 1994 (aged 26 to 40) and Generation Z are defined as born between 1995 and 2010 (aged 10 to 25). The survey found that nearly 70% of millennials and Gen Z feel that retiring by age 65 and owning a “dream” home will be impossible for them to achieve. Sixty-four percent felt uncertain about their financial future and 69% said they will be delaying major life goals as a result of Covid-19 pandemic and their finances. A majority said it was unlikely they would retire before 65, find a dream home or a job that wasn’t just paying the bills. Young women felt especially pessimistic about their future, and said they were disproportionately affected. Seventy-one percent of women surveyed said it was unlikely they would retire before 65, compared with 59% of men, and 52% said it was unlikely they would ever pay off their student debt, compared with 37% of men. Overall, only 47% of all those surveyed said they thought they would eventually find a job that wasn’t just paying the bills. Sixty-five percent overall said it was not achievable anymore for young Australians to retire before 65. The vast majority of those surveyed (82%) said the Australian dream – defined as owning a “dream home” and retiring by age 65 – was harder to do now than in previous generations. Nearly 70% said this would be impossible to achieve. Viv Micic, a 20-year-old from Melbourne, said she and her peers felt more pessimistic about their futures, and were struggling to find even entry-level jobs. “One of my friends has stopped receiving shifts at work – she had been working at McDonald’s,” she told Guardian Australia. “For something open 24/7, she had been hoping for more shifts.” Micic, an aspiring actor, said she had put that career path on hold during the coronavirus recession. She said she had experience, and had volunteered at community radio stations and film festivals, but was still finding it hard to even get a job in retail. “I applied for 20 jobs at the Cotton On group and I am really, really passionate about wanting to work at Typo. I love their stuff. But all of them come back as ‘Thank you for applying but no thanks’. “I started acting classes when I was a kid,” she said. “I have done seven years of acting classes. This year I really wanted to get a casting agent and start looking for casting jobs. But instead as I’ve been stuck at home, I thought the best thing to do is start working on my demo reel at home. “I definitely feel like, because the arts industry, especially in Melbourne, has been impacted so much by the pandemic, I will have to probably look overseas for acting because they’re probably going to end up, after the pandemic, cutting crew, cutting casts, trying to cut corners to make things possible.” Micic said there was no chance she would be as financially well off as her parents. “Especially for someone breaking out into the industry there are going to be even less chances. “My parents didn’t have a pandemic, shaking up everything,” she said. A 2019 Grattan Institute report found young Australians were projected to be the first generation since federation to not reach a better standard of living than their parents. It found wage stagnation and underemployment meant that household wealth for people under 35 had not risen since 2004. Andrew Bartolo from ME Bank said he had noticed that young people were feeling more and more pessimistic. “Young people are delaying, for one to three years, reaching their goals,” he said. “I’ve got cousins and nieces and nephews and friends that have really struggled and had their jobs impacted by the pandemic. There is definitely a feeling of uncertainty about their financial future.” Micic said she and her peers felt they needed to be more qualified and spend more time studying, due to a job market with fewer opportunities. “The Australian dream is going to become really, really competitive. One of my friends wants to be an agronomist. She wants to be the most qualified agronomist, because she wants to have the best chance to work in the agriculture industry “If anything, my friends will do a lot more study than they would have. To make sure they are in that top percentage of the most qualified.” Micic said she hoped she would be able to own her own home eventually, but she wouldn’t “be able to afford something close to the city”. “My parents have been really good savers, even if I do take their advice into consideration I am still probably going to be living a bit far out.”"
"From beers to spirits and even ready-to-drink cocktails, supermarket sales of no- and low-alcohol drinks have soared during lockdown as consumers become used to popping them into their trolleys with their grocery staples. Steep growth in the “nolo” drinks category was previously driven by sales in pubs, bars and clubs, but Covid-related restrictions and curfews have increased consumers’ thirst for hangover-free options from the supermarket and corner shop, as drinking habits have become home-based. Even with the end of “sober October”, this trend is likely to continue into the festive season, driven by the younger generation, with almost half of 18- to 34-year-olds planning to serve low- and no-alcohol drinks with the Christmas turkey, according to research by Tesco. The Portman Group, the social responsibility and regulatory body for alcohol in the UK, said the “nolo” category was becoming mainstream as part of the weekly shop. “The trend has grown hugely again this past year and notably during lockdown,” said its chief executive, John Timothy. “Before 2020, sales were driven largely through pubs, bars and clubs, but the increase this year has come from shoppers including low and no options in their baskets to be enjoyed at home. They are likely to be part of the moderate majority who continue to enjoy the experience of drinking but are sometimes choosing reduced alcohol or nonalcoholic options.” Low- and no-alcohol sales increased by 32.5% immediately before the March lockdown, according to the market research company Nielsen, as shoppers stockpiled to moderate their drinking. Since then, retail sales have increased by 30% to £188m, as part of an increased focus on health and wellbeing. There is anecdotal evidence of a marginal increase in “nolo” sales in some pubs and restaurants. Innovation from big brands has bolstered choice for consumers. This week Guinness launched an alcohol-free version in Waitrose and Morrisons supermarkets in the UK. And Ghost Ship (alcohol by volume 0.5%), launched by the Suffolk brew Adnams two years ago, now accounts for 10.7% of its beer sales. Of smaller new entrants, the Small Beer Brew Co, which specialises in classic beer styles below 2.8% ABV, has been selling its Small Beer in 200 Waitrose stores, and introduced its session pale in Majestic Wine stores in October. Overall, sales have more than doubled (up 149%) compared with the same time last year. Small Beer’s co-founder James Grundy said: “At a time when small luxuries were more important than ever, we found Small Beer provided those who enjoyed it with a moment to step back from the melee of lockdown.” The Wine and Spirit Trade Association noted a sharp rise in the popularity of “nolo” ready-to-drink cocktails such as gin and tonics in cans – convenient in the warmer weather when meetings were allowed in parks and open spaces. The category was worth £109m between April and June, when drinkers knocked back more canned cocktails at home during lockdown than sparkling wine. Waitrose reported that its sales of low- and no-alcohol spirits and wines increased by 22% on the same time last year, versions of beer were up 29% and cider 13%. Jamie Matthewson, Waitrose’s buying manager for wines, said: “Sales of low- and no-alcohol drinks have been consistently strong, and we’re now diversifying our range even more, including alcohol-free sparkling wine and milk stout. ‘Stoptober’ and Dry January definitely have a positive effect on sales, but this is a trend that has grown exponentially over the last few years.”"
"The Treasury is extending its emergency business loan scheme and will allow firms to “top up” their borrowing as part of new rules meant to keep businesses afloat during England’s second lockdown. UK firms will now have until the end of January to apply for emergency business loans, including bounce back loans (BBLS), coronavirus business interruption loans (CBILS) and the CLBILS scheme for larger firms. That is two months longer than the existing 30 November deadline. The extension also applies to the Future Fund, aimed at UK startups. “To help more businesses access additional support, deadlines for applications to our government-backed loan scheme and the Future Fund have been further extended until 31 January 2021,” the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said on Twitter. Small businesses that already received funds through the 100% government-backed BBLS programme – which offers firms cheap loans worth up to £50,000 – will also be able to top up existing loans if they need additional cash. The top-up is meant to help firms that borrowed less than the maximum sum available – up to 25% of their turnover to a limit of £50,000 – to avoid taking on extra debt. However, most firms made those calculations before the second lockdown in England was announced. A government document outlining the changes said: “We understand that some businesses didn’t anticipate the disruption to their business from the pandemic would go on for this long; this will ensure that they are able to benefit from the loan scheme as intended.” Firms will be able to request a top-up from next week but will only be able to do so once, according to the document. The bounce back loan scheme has so far distributed £40.2bn to 1.3m UK businesses.   The changes were announced only hours after the Treasury convened an emergency meeting with Britain’s largest banks – including HSBC, Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds – in order to review the terms of the government-backed loan programme.  “We need to convene an urgent meeting at noon to discuss the favoured bounce back loans,” the email read, according to a banking source. It was the first direct communication with banks regarding the loans programme since Saturday’s national lockdown announcement. While the chancellor had committed to crafting a new government-backed loans programme for 2021, the reality of a second lockdown put more businesses under pressure without additional emergency funding. Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on fair business banking, welcomed the Treasury’s announcement but said firms would benefit form a longer extension into the middle of 2021.  He said the top-ups should also apply to the larger CBILS scheme, which allows firms to borrow up to £5m and comes with an 80% government guarantee. Hollinrake said the Treasury had also failed to address the fact that non-bank lenders are blocked from accessing cheap funding from the Bank of England. It means they cannot afford to offer bounce back loans – which come with a flat 2.5% interest rate – to their customers. Meanwhile, most lenders that do have access to cheap Bank of England funds are not processing applications from non-customers. “That’s still a work in progress and an issue that needs to be resolved as soon as possible,” Hollinrake said. The APPG estimates that about 250,000 businesses are in effect blocked from emergency loans as a result. "
"Black Friday has long been the traditional start of the holiday shopping season in the US. As dawn breaks after Thanksgiving long lines of shoppers trying to score the best deals camp outside of stores and malls across the country. Not this year. The pandemic has dramatically altered this year’s Black Friday. Covid-19 is most likely to spread in indoor, crowded spaces. Many state and local governments have enacted regulations that encourage social distancing, including limiting the number of customers in the store at once. This does not mean holiday shopping is cancelled – far from it. Even as many Americans suffer the economic effects of the pandemic, people are still buying things, especially since they are spending less on traveling, , movies and concerts. Consumer spending rose throughout the summer and into early fall. A survey from the National Retail Foundation found that consumers’ budgets for holiday shopping are down just $50 compared with last year. But for many US retailers, already suffering from Covid restrictions, Black Friday looks bleak and the usual Christmas bonanza far from certain. So far this year, major retailers including J Crew, Neiman Marcus and JC Penney have filed for bankruptcy. Others, notably Amazon and Walmart, have thrived. But the holiday season will probably prove critical for a number of other household retail names and even more small businesses. Many customers will be shopping online, continuing a Thanksgiving trend that has been seen over the years. Black Friday’s most popular retailers already have their major sales under way online in an effort to encourage people to shop online instead of going to stores. Best Buy opted to sell new gaming consoles like the PS5 online only. Walmart and Target spread out its online Black Friday sales over the month of November. Home Depot is making its Black Friday prices available throughout the holiday season. “The deals are available now – you don’t have to wait. You don’t have to concentrate your shopping over a single weekend,” said Katherine Cullen, senior director of retail and consumer insights at the National Retail Federation. Besides reducing the potential for crowded stores, lengthening the period of Black Friday sales also lessens the pressure on the supply chain that handles online orders, Cullen said. While the big box stores and prominent online retailers will probably fare well during this Black Friday, some retailers may struggle to reap the increased sales the holiday promises. Small businesses especially have struggled to adapt to the surge of online shopping during the pandemic. Yelp, the online reviewing platform, has estimated that by September, 17,503 businesses in the country will have permanently closed, including many small businesses. Department stores, once the most powerful retailers in the US, are also likely to see another tough holiday season after many years of decline as consumers seek the speed and selection of online shopping. Alongside Neiman Marcus and JC Penney, Lord & Taylor and Century 21 have also filed for bankruptcy over the course of the pandemic. “Department stores were already weak and are certainly getting weaker,” said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence for GroupM, a media agency. “When you compound all of this with the idea that many of these retailers are at risk of going out of business, it certainly begs the question if anything like the old Black Friday will possibly return in a year’s time.” Yet there are some signs that the brick-and-mortar shopping experience will not fade away with the pandemic. In consulting firm Deloitte’s annual pre-holiday survey of Black Friday shoppers, more people indicated that they will be shopping online than in-store – a first for the survey. Still, 54% of people surveyed indicated they planned on shopping in stores over the weekend. Many retailers will be welcoming customers into stores for the Black Friday weekend, though at limited capacity and with extra safety measures, like masks and increased sanitizing. Walmart said it will open at 5am on Friday at 20% of a store’s capacity. Target is letting customers check out their items themselves on the company’s app to avoid waiting in checkout lines. Most brick-and-mortar stores are also facilitating some kind of curbside and in-store pick-up for online shoppers. In-store shopping will stick around since consumers are happiest when they are given different choices of how to shop, Cullen said. Consumers like the convenience of online shopping and curbside pick-up, but they also want the opportunity to browse and see a product before they buy it. “Particularly during the holiday season, we’ve seen people like in-store shopping. It’s a social activity, they’re seeing decorations, they’re picking out gifts,” Cullen said. “Holiday seasons down the road, we’re going to continue to see an interest in that in-store element, even if people embrace some of the conveniences of online shopping.” Maybe, just maybe, the lines will be back next year."
"US retailers have rolled out their traditional Black Friday and Christmas sales and shoppers look eager to make big savings, but this year’s spending bonanza means potentially worsening labor and health safety conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers in the warehouses that supply all the consumer goods. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, essential workers in grocery, retail and warehouses that handle online orders have struggled with coronavirus outbreaks in the workplace, increased workloads, and revoked hazard pay for months. Workers expect the holiday shopping season to exacerbate these conditions as coronavirus cases in the US near 200,000 per day and daily death rates are reaching numbers unseen since economic shutdowns earlier this year. Despite the pandemic and restrictions on in-person shopping, consumer spending in the US is projected to increase this holiday shopping season from last year by 1% to 1.5% between November and January 2021, according to Deloitte’s annual holiday retail forecast. Online shopping is expected to dramatically increase, with projections of between $182bn to $196bn in e-commerce holiday sales revenue. That’s likely to be good news for the retail industry, but not for its workers. Courtenay Brown, who works at an Amazon Fresh fulfillment center in Newark, New Jersey, explained demand and workloads, already high due to the coronavirus pandemic, have worsened with Thanksgiving and holiday shopping, while workers continue getting sick from coronavirus and are faced with mandatory overtime shifts. “Right now we’re going through the turkey apocalypse,” said Brown. “It’s chaos. Everyday we’re being pushed to do even more and more. The amount of stress everyone is under is ridiculous.” Brown, who is also organizing with United for Respect in a call for large retailers to enact a $5 hazard pay for essential workers, criticized the decision of the Amazon founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, to rescind a $2-an-hour hazard pay from Amazon workers in June 2020 despite ongoing risks for coronavirus exposure and Amazon’s immense profits through the pandemic, with a significant jump in sales projected for Amazon through the holiday shopping season. “The pandemic is making literally one of the world’s most selfish, disgusting human beings in the world even richer. Even if they didn’t want to give us hazard pay, there are so many things he could have done for the country with the money he’s made,” she added. Several large US retailers have profited immensely during the pandemic, but have shared little of those profits with workers in the form of additional compensation. In a report conducted by the Brookings Institution, Amazon and Walmart were found to be among the least generous to workers of large US retailers analyzed in the report. Despite a combined extra $10.9bn in profits compared to 2019, Amazon paid workers an average $0.95 an hour in coronavirus compensation and Walmart $0.63 an hour. The owners of Walmart, Rob, Jim and Alice Walton, have seen their net worth climb by $48bn during the pandemic. Amazon’s Bezos increased his wealth by 62% since the pandemic began, to $188.3bn as of 17 November. A Walmart cashier in California, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, complained that workers have to use their own paid time off days if they want to be compensated for Thanksgiving day, for which Walmart closed its stores after previous years where they remained open and provided no holiday pay to employees. “While this is the first Thanksgiving we’ve had off in years, Walmart will automatically pull from our paid time off to cover the day, or they’ll pull from sick days or the day is unpaid if we don’t have enough,” they said. “We lost a lot of people so the workloads on us have tripled,” said a Walmart associate in North Carolina. “We can’t keep up so we have to do all we can as fast as we can with impossible expectations from managers and customers.” Workers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods claim working conditions have worsened during the pandemic, and risks posed by coronavirus are even greater since a $2-an-hour hazard pay was revoked in June 2020. With the holidays coming up, stores have gotten even busier in dealing with holiday orders while coronavirus cases among staff continue to occur. “The conditions are even more hazardous with all the customers who refuse to wear masks and lockdown restrictions having been lifted. The store is more crowded with customers and Amazon Prime shoppers,” said a Whole Foods associate in Birmingham, Michigan, who requested to remain anonymous. A Whole Foods associate in New Orleans noted morale had been low throughout the pandemic, even more so since hazard pay was cancelled, and departments are widely understaffed, but are still expected to complete extra work through the holidays. “Upper management is pushing departments to do more than they are capable of for the holidays for platters, meals and special orders, but everyone has made it known what kind of a strain this is on them,” they said. At Target, an associate in Oklahoma explained team members are not permitted to work over 40 hours in a week, but the holiday season is the best scheduling hours they receive throughout the year due to the increased demand. With several coronavirus cases at her store and an influx of seasonal employees, they are nervous about working. “It’s been very busy. They sometimes will schedule people for six, seven or eight days in a row as long as they don’t hit 40 hours,” they said. “The new seasonal team members receive very little training and are sent out without really knowing how to do their assigned jobs, which is frustrating, and they won’t even tell us which department the coronavirus case is in when it’s reported so we can know if we should get tested or not.”"
"The pub companies Mitchells & Butlers and Fuller, Smith & Turner have reported heavy losses and said they had axed about 1,700 jobs, highlighting the impact of continued coronavirus restrictions on Britain’s hospitality sector. Mitchells & Butlers, which operates bar, pub and restaurant brands including All Bar One, O’Neills, Harvester and Toby Carvery, slumped to a £123m loss in the year to the end of September, down from a £177m profit a year earlier. The group said it had made 1,300 people redundant since the end of its financial year, despite receiving government support through the furlough scheme and the business rates holiday. The firm, which operates about 1,700 venues across the UK, believes it is well placed to recover once Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. However, given the ongoing disruption to trading, it noted a “material uncertainty” about its ability to continue as a going concern and the valuation of its property portfolio. That view was echoed by Fullers, which fell to a £22.2m pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of September, compared with a £17.9m profit a year earlier. The group said it had made 350 people redundant. Fullers has shed 20% of its workforce, just under 1,000 roles, since March. The pub operator, which sold its beer business to the Japanese group Asahi in 2019, said trading conditions meant it would not be paying a dividend to its investors. The chairman, Michael Turner, said the government had been “supportive and destructive in almost equal measure” during the pandemic. He said the company was grateful for the extension of the furlough scheme but urged the chancellor to extend support measures, including the business rates holiday and temporary reduction in VAT on goods and services, for hospitality and leisure firms. Hospitality is one of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, with Fullers pubs and hotels closed for more than half of the six-month trading period. Several pub operators including JD Wetherspoon have announced job cuts and said they could not rule out further redundancies. When England’s national lockdown eases on 2 December, the majority of the country will enter the two toughest tiers, which place significant restrictions on hospitality. The Fullers chief executive, Simon Emeny, said the imminent rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine meant “a return to normality is in sight”, however he warned business would be difficult in the interim. “We are optimistic about the future in the medium term and beyond but there is no doubt that this will be a tough winter and a very different looking Christmas,” he said."
"The fast-fashion retailer Boohoo has appointed Sir Brian Leveson, the retired judge who led the Leveson inquiry into the activities of the media, to oversee the firm’s overhaul of its supply chain after allegations of poor working practices. An investigation by the Guardian found that factories in Leicester were failing to pay workers the minimum wage and were putting their health at risk during lockdown. A damning independent review, conducted on behalf of the retailer by Alison Levitt QC, found that reports of failings and poor conditions in the company’s supply chain were “substantially true” and criticised the company’s “weak corporate governance”. Levitt found that Boohoo’s monitoring of the factories was “inadequate”, and called the failure to assess the risk to workers during the coronavirus pandemic “inexcusable”. Following the publication of the review, Boohoo released what it called its “agenda for change” programme to overhaul its use of garment manufacturing in the UK. Leveson will report directly to Boohoo’s board and his reports will be published, which the retailer said would bring transparency and independence to the process. Leveson joins other independent organisations, including ethical audit and compliance specialists Verisio and Bureau Veritas, which are already working with Boohoo. Mahmud Kamani, the billionaire co-founder of Boohoo, said that he and the board were fully committed to the planned changes at the firm “with the appointments of Sir Brian Leveson and KPMG bringing independent oversight, additional expertise and further transparency to a programme that will help us on our journey to lead the fashion e-commerce market globally in a transparent manner.” Kamani has also agreed to appear in front of MPs examining the environmental impact of fast fashion next month. The environmental audit committee originally tackled the subject in 2018, but ministers subsequently rejected its recommendations, which included a 1p per garment levy. Philip Dunne, the EAC chair, said it had received 50 pieces of written evidence since the follow-up inquiry was announced in October. That information had guided who the committee had invited to appear, with representatives of other organisations including the British Retail Consortium and Wrap, the waste advisory body, also expected to answer questions. “Employment, public health and safety laws must be enforced in the UK’s garment factories and we must reduce the amount of fashion waste we are producing as a country,” explained Dunne, who said the committee planned to make fresh recommendations on what could be done to improve sustainability and working conditions.  Leveson said Boohoo recognised that it needed to “institute and embed change so that everyone involved in the group’s supply chain is treated fully in accordance with the law and the principles of ethical trading. “I look forward to providing independent oversight of the Agenda for Change programme and to working with the Boohoo team, KPMG and the other independent experts to achieve this, while, at the same time, providing publicly available progress reports.” The wave of negative publicity over working conditions at some of Boohoo’s Leicester suppliers does not appear to have dented shoppers’ enthusiasm for its clothing during the pandemic. The firm reported in September that its sales over the previous six months had soared by 45%, well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Greg Lawless, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: “Today’s news is another step in the right direction and highlights the need to effect real change at the company, which we believe will be welcomed by independent shareholders. “We will watch developments closely and look for signs of both improved corporate governance and tangible changes to the operating mode.”"
"A cross-party group of national and local politicians will this week lobby the government for emergency funds to tackle the impact of Covid-19 on workers whose livelihoods rely on airports. The aviation industry has been identified as one of the business sectors hardest hit by the pandemic – costing the local economy of Hounslow, which neighbours Heathrow airport, a total of £1bn over three years, a study commissioned by the local council suggests. Steve Curran, the Labour leader of Hounslow council, and Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, which includes Gatwick airport, said their two constituencies “have the awful distinction of heading the national league tables for numbers furloughed and unemployed” and that “at the end of the summer 40% of our workforces were being supported by the state, [with] this number … likely to worsen.” In an opinion piece shared with the Guardian, the politicians said: “In all, some 733,000 jobs in, and connected to, Britain’s international and regional airports, are at risk from a prolonged downturn in air traffic. “Little mention is made of the support workers, among them the cleaners, mechanics, attendants, drivers, waiters, kitchen staff, who toil behind the scenes … Many of these jobs are low-skilled and pay low wages. Many of those who do them are from the younger and older age groups of the working population; many too, are from BAME communities. They’re likely to have difficulty in finding alternative suitable employment.” Representatives of Hounslow and Crawley, plus other affected areas around UK airports, said they will meet on Tuesday “to assess the economic and social harm”, as well as to ask the government to establish an “aviation communities fund” to meet the immediate and longer-term needs of workers reliant on airports. In July, Hounslow commissioned a study by the forecasting group Oxford Economics, which stated that 11,000 of the borough’s residents work in jobs directly linked to Heathrow out of a total workforce of about 150,000. The research paper added that up to 43,000 jobs were associated with the airport’s “catalytic impact”."
"Eurostar has appealed to the UK government for urgent financial support, warning it is “fighting for survival” with just one train a day now running from London to Paris. Passenger numbers on the cross-Channel train service have been down 95% since March but are currently believed to be less than 1% of pre-Covid levels under travel restrictions that will last into at least December. The Eurostar chief executive, Jacques Damas, has written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, asking for assistance after the Treasury announced it would help struggling airports with up to £8m each, based on their equivalent business rates. Eurostar hopes to receive similar assistance, as well as a review of track access charges it pays to use the UK’s only stretch of high-speed rail line, owned on a concession by HS1 Ltd. A spokesman said: “The new scheme of rates relief for airports puts Eurostar at a direct disadvantage against its airline competitors. Eurostar has been left fighting for its survival against a 95% drop in demand, whilst aviation has received over £1.8bn in support through loans, tax deferrals and financing. “We would ask this scheme to be extended to include international rail services, and more generally for the government to incorporate high-speed rail in its support for the travel sector, and in doing so help protect the green gateway to Europe.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said ministers recognised the significant financial challenges facing Eurostar, adding: “The government has been engaging extensively with Eurostar on a regular basis since the beginning of the outbreak. We will continue to work closely with them as we support the safe recovery of international travel.” Eurostar carried 11 million passengers last year and was planning to expand services with the introduction of direct trains to Amsterdam. However, it is currently operating just four services in total daily, with a return Brussels service as well as Paris. Because of social distancing requirements, each train’s maximum capacity has been halved but many tickets have remained unsold. Eurostar is majority owned by the French state railway, SNCF, but is believed to have exhausted options for governmental assistance from Paris. Franchised UK train operators bailed out under emergency agreements since the coronavirus pandemic – at a cost of £8bn this financial year – are also largely owned or co-owned by foreign state rail operators. The RMT rail union said Eurostar was “staring into the abyss” and urged the government to step in. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “‎It is wholly wrong that Eurostar, an eco-friendly service that is a beacon for the future of our railways, is being denied the kind of financial support being offered to the airports.” Damas told Sunak the firm backed all measures to restart international travel, but contrasted the treatment of the sole international rail link with the aviation sector – not least given the comparative environmental costs of rail, at a time when the government has talked up its green ambitions. Eurostar says its emissions are almost 90% lower than equivalent flights. Its UK terminus, London St Pancras, part of HS1’s concession, passes on costs to operators in the same way as airports, Eurostar argues, but has not shared in the same emergency funding."
"The comparison website GoCompare has agreed to a £594m takeover offer from Future, Britain’s biggest magazines publisher. The cash-and-shares deal to buy GoCompare, known for its adverts featuring the fictional opera singer Gio Compario, means another huge windfall for GoCompare’s non-executive chairman, Sir Peter Wood. Wood, GoCompare’s largest shareholder, holds a 29.65% stake in the business, worth almost £170m under the terms of the deal. The cash element will involve a £41m payout to Wood, who will also become a top five shareholder in Future with a stake of about 5.5%. Investors in GoCo Group, the parent company of GoCompare, will receive 33p in cash and 0.05 shares in Future, valuing each GoCo share at 136p. The deal with Future will bolster Wood’s estimated net worth of £790m, which ranks him as the 179th wealthiest person in the UK, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Wood, 74, had already made two fortunes from insurance after founding Direct Line in 1985 and Esure, which owns the women’s car insurance brand Sheilas’ Wheels, in 1999. GoCompare was spun out of Esure, which Wood still chairs, in 2016, the year he received a knighthood for services to UK industry and philanthropy. The sale of Esure to the US private equity group Bain netted Wood a £360m payday. After paying £62m in capital gains tax on the deal, placing him among the UK’s top 10 taxpayers, Wood later criticised Amazon, Apple and Sir Richard Branson for using tax havens. Earlier this year Wood, who gave £1m to the Conservatives ahead of last December’s general election, sold a residence in Palm Beach, Florida, for $37m (£28m). The move marks a further drive into digital for Future, which owns titles including Country Life, Marie Claire and Metal Hammer and has a market value of £1.9bn. It already makes significant online income by referring readers of its independent reviews of products to retail partner websites to make purchases. Zillah Byng-Thorne, Future’s chief executive and a former financial chief at Auto Trader, has sat on the board of GoCo Group since 2017. “A few weeks ago Zillah came to me and said a deal makes a lot of sense given Future’s range of magazines,” said Wood. “The biggest problem with price comparison sites is that there is four of us slugging it out with the biggest expense being the cost of acquisition. Future captures one in every three eyeballs in the UK, the same in the US, with hundreds of magazines, they can really help us on the costs of that.” Under the terms of the deal, shareholders in GoCo Group will own approximately 19% of the new combined company. The board of GoCo has unanimously recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the deal. Future has undertakings representing 33.5% of GoCo Group shares committed to backing the deal, including Wood’s holding. Future says it has identified £10m in annual cost savings after completing the deal, which is expected in the first quarter next year. Future has been one of few winners in the publishing industry during the coronavirus pandemic. A resurgence of interest in hobbies and crafts during lockdown, as well as entertainment such as live gigs being halted, has fuelled a boom for its stable of brands, which include Total Guitar, Practical Caravan and Real Homes. The publisher registered an 18,000% surge in online traffic to Golf Monthly from people searching for articles explaining how to create a makeshift course in their back garden during lockdown. The company published its results on Wednesday, reporting a 300% surge in pre-tax profits to £52m, and a 53% rise in revenues to £339m in the year to 30 September. Future publishing has been on a buying spree in recent years, with the company seeking to build scale in the ailing magazine market while also moving towards a primarily digital model. The company cemented its place as Britain’s biggest magazine publisher earlier this year after completing a £140m deal to buy TI Media, formerly Time Inc UK, which publishes 40 titles including NME, Horse & Hound, Woman & Home, and Wallpaper."
"Hedge fund billionaire Sir Chris Hohn has been ordered to pay £270m to a charity setup by his ex-wife in the latest chapter of their acrimonious divorce. The UK’s highest court on Wednesday ordered that Hohn’s Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) must hand the money to his ex-wife Jamie Cooper’s charity, Big Win Philanthropy. The dispute over the charity cash emerged following the couple’s bitter divorce in 2014. Hohn, who runs the Children’s Investment Fund hedge fund, was ordered to pay Cooper a £337m divorce settlement – one of the largest ever. In 2002 the couple jointly set up the CIFF charity to help children in developing countries. It is one of the biggest charities in the world with assets of about $4bn, mostly resulting from the profits of Hohn’s hedge fund. The supreme court heard that the charity “became difficult to manage when their marriage broke down”. The couple agreed that £270m of its funds would be transferred to Cooper’s new charity in return for her stepping down from the board of CIFF. The deal required the approval of the CIFF board, which has just three members: Hohn, Cooper and Marko Lehtimaki, a friend of Hohn’s. Hohn and Cooper recused themselves from the decision, leaving only Lehtimaki. The supreme court on Wednesday upheld a previous ruling that Lehtimaki should vote in favour of the transfer agreement. Cooper, chair and president of Big Win Philanthropy, said: “I am extremely gratified by the supreme court’s decision. This will enable Big Win Philanthropy to significantly expand its support to African leaders pursuing ambitious initiatives to improve the lives of children and young people.” Her lawyer Matthew Dontzin described the ruling as “a complete victory”. “The truth of her claim could not be denied no matter how many legal obstacles they tried to throw at her,” he said. “This is a well-deserved and long overdue victory for Ms Cooper, who has dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children in developing countries and plans to use this money to continue that important mission.” CIFF said the court ruling would have “no significant impact on the work that CIFF does around the world to improve the lives of children”. Hohn, who was knighted in 2014 for his services to philanthropy, was paid £200m in 2018 (the latest year for which figures are available), making him one of the highest paid people in the country.  He is one of the UK’s more generous philanthropists and gave away $232m (£177m) through CIFF in 2018. The charity directed $80m at tackling the climate crisis and gave $140m to various children’s charities and projects. Hohn has also personally donated £200,000 to Extinction Rebellion."
"The Eat out to help out scheme launches across the UK on Monday and has been hailed by Rishi Sunak as a lifeline for the beleaguered hospitality industry. It will give diners 50% off food and soft drinks, with a maximum discount of £10, on certain days in August. Here is a guide to the scheme. If you dine out on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday this month you can save up to half the price of your meal – subject to some terms and conditions. You must eat at the venue. The discount is not available on alcoholic drinks and does not apply to the service charge on the meal. It is also capped at £10 a person – so if you splash out on £50 worth of food with your partner you will only get £20 knocked off your bill. The government has told businesses that it is expecting the offer to apply all day, and on all qualifying food and drink. The deal applies to children and there is no minimum spend. There is no limit to how many times each customer can use it. In theory, you could eat out multiple times a day and get the discount each time. The scheme runs for 13 days in August. A family of four who chose to eat out every Monday could save up to £200. Independent eateries and the big chains can join the scheme and more than 53,000 outlets have signed up. These include casual dining chains such as Pizza Express, upmarket establishments including the Ivy, Michelin-starred venues and myriad independent cafes, bars and restaurants. Even workplace canteens can sign up. You can find out which local businesses are offering the deals on the government website. You just put in a postcode and it shows every business that’s signed up within a five-mile radius. Many will have posters in the window too. Bear in mind that some big names are franchises, and not all branches may be taking part – this is the case with Starbucks, for instance. Companies can sign up throughout August, so it’s worth keeping an eye out if your favourite place is not offering the deal at first. The discount doesn’t apply to takeaways and you won’t get it at mobile food vans. Hotel room service and catering for private functions are also excluded. No. You don’t need to take a voucher or remember to turn up by a particular time to make use of the scheme. You just go along to the restaurant or cafe, and it applies the discount. This is up to the individual firms. Pizza Express says customers can still use Tesco Clubcard vouchers, for example, but Nando’s says it won’t let you use it with another offer. If an eatery does let you use a discount or voucher, that has to come off before the Eat out to help out reduction – so if, for example, the offer is two £10 main courses for £15, you will pay £7.50. For deals involving alcohol – say a pub is offering a main and a glass of wine for £12.50, the normal cost of the drink has to be taken off before the discount is applied. So if that was £4.50, your 50% saving would be on the remaining £8. The discount is up to £10 for each person, regardless of how much the meal you eat costs, so it may make sense to split the bill after you have paid, rather than asking to be charged separately. If, for example, you have a glass of water and a £8 main course, and your friend goes for a three-course affair costing £25, the restaurant will knock £16.50 off the £33 total, rather than taking off £14. Obviously you will need to work out how you share the extra discount. Bear in mind that we are still in the middle of a pandemic and that eating out is not like it used to be. For a start, you should check that the place where you want is open – not everywhere has started up again, and those that are may have shorter operating hours than usual. Next, check if you need to book in advance. With social distancing still in place, many businesses are operating at reduced capacity and some are managing this by insisting on reservations. Some places are not taking cash, so make sure you have an alternative if that is how you usually pay. Hospitality businesses are struggling, so if you do make a booking and then find you can’t turn up after all, let them know – they need to fill up their tables if they can."
"Major companies in England have been told that, from 1 August, they can discuss with workers whether it is safe to return to work. Up until now, the government had asked all employees to work from home where possible. In addition, the advice in England to avoid public transport is being scrapped. However, some of the largest office occupiers in the country do not appear to be in a rush to return to their workplaces, with many waiting for the end of the school summer holidays at the start of September. And some will be waiting until 2021 at the earliest before they consider asking homebound employees to return to their offices. Here we take a sector-by-sector look at some major employers and their working plans. NatWest Group NatWest Group – also the owner of Royal Bank of Scotland – has told 49,000 of its 65,000 staff to keep working from home until 2021. Its CEO, Alison Rose, said the bank would by that time consider bringing people back in a “gradual and cautious way”. Around 10,000 staff have kept 95% of its branches open during lockdown. Another 400 staff in highly regulated roles were asked to return to offices in June. Rose said some staff benefited from the flexibility of home working, but said the bank would likely end up with a “hybrid model of still needing offices and space to bring people together to make sure our culture stays strong”. It has offered bank branch staff washable face coverings that they can wear on their commute or at work. It has also imposed limits of two people per lift, and installed thermal cameras and temperature checks at building entrances. The bank has also temporarily banned hotdesking and put up screens in areas where social distancing is not possible. Lloyds Banking GroupAround 50,000 of Lloyds Banking Group’s 65,000 workers have been able to work from home during the Covid-19 outbreak, and will continue to do so until at least the end of September. It is also reviewing whether it needs so much office space, given the home-working trend. Most of those unable to work from home are bank branch staff across its three high street brands – Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland – who count as essential workers. BarclaysThe lender doesn’t intend to bring the bulk of its 50,000 UK staff back to the office until at least the end of September. However, around 20,000 people are working in the bank’s branches and call centres, as well as at its trading desk in Canary Wharf. Like Lloyds, Barclays has also said it is weighing up its needs for office space. “We are going to think about our real estate mix, given the lessons that we’ve learned,” said Jes Staley, Barclays chief executive. HSBC Around 46,000 of the bank’s 52,000 UK staff have been working from home during lockdown, including those in its call centres. Those who are working remotely will continue to do so until at least September. The bank has told staff it is aiming for a phased return to a limited number of buildings, and will keep capacity in offices below 20%. Goldman SachsThe bank has welcomed back around 1,000 of its 6,000 UK employees to its London offices since 15 June. As the sole occupant in its London building, staff have been spread across six floors, masks are offered at reception, and temperature checks are conducted on arrival. The US-headquartered bank has also opened its roof garden, to allow staff to hold meetings while still abiding by social distancing rules. Most of those who have returned so far are working in highly regulated jobs, or have struggled to work from home. JP Morgan Around 1,800 of JP Morgan’s 12,000 London staff have returned to the office so far, with that figure expected to rise to 20% at the start of August. A further 400 staff have returned to work in its Bournemouth office, though the rest of the site’s 4,000 employees continue to work from home. Its 2,500 staff in Glasgow – most of whom work in tech – have not yet returned to the office. The US bank will cap office capacity at 50% to maintain social distancing, and has a private nurse stationed at reception in its Canary Wharf offices, where staff temperatures are monitored on thermal cameras on arrival. Santander UKOver 15,000 of Santander’s 18,000 office-based staff have been working from home during the pandemic. However, around 60% of its 6,000 branch staff have been keeping those locations open. Those working from home will continue to do so until at least the end of August while the bank considers its next steps. Deutsche BankLess than 10% of the German bank’s 7,500 workers based in the City of London are back in the office, but it started to invite more workers back on a phased basis in July. Those returning first include traders and the staff who support them. PwCThe accountancy and consulting firm has set itself the target of having more than 50% of its workforce back in its offices by the end of September, if it is safe to do so. All PwC offices reopened at the start of July, and a few thousand people of its 22,000-strong workforce have returned to their workplace if they had a business or personal need to do so. From 1 August PwC is giving staff more flexibility to spend time in the office if they are comfortable doing so. DeloitteThe accountancy and consulting firm has had its 20,000 employees working from home since mid- March, reopened a small number of its offices in early July, and is considering reopening more. EYAfter carrying out a consultation with 1,300 of its employees, EY has decided to reopen its UK offices from 7 September with reduced capacity, which they will steadily increase. Workers can request to return to the office, but the majority of staff will continue to work from home for the time being. Lloyd’s of LondonAround 40 people returned to the insurance market at the end of July, as part of a phased reopening that will eventually see its underwriting room open at 45% capacity from 1 September. The market, which usually hosts around 6,000 people on any given day, has traditionally relied on face-to-face deals, but members have had to conduct most complex deals online or over the phone since the building closed its doors in March. AstraZenecaBritain’s biggest pharmaceutical company has around 8,300 employees in the UK, three-quarters of whom have been working from home during the pandemic. The remainder have been working on site as key workers in labs, manufacturing and support. No staff have returned to offices so far, but a phased return will begin in September. GlaxoSmithKlineGSK, which employs 15,000 people in the UK, has started bringing small numbers of staff back to its offices, if they have said they would prefer to work in the office. It doesn’t have a date for a “mass return” to the office yet. Scientists who work in “critical” areas in research and development and those who work in manufacturing or distribution have been working on site throughout the crisis.  BPThe oil giant has around 6,500 office-based staff in the UK. The company says the number who have returned is extremely low, and it doesn’t expect it to increase significantly in the short term.National GridAlmost all of National Grid’s 4,000 UK office-based employees continue to work from home. It expects to maintain its current working arrangements until at least September. It also expects any return to the office to be gradual and carefully managed. SSEThe energy company has reopened some of its sites so that certain employees can return to its offices, where appropriate measures have been put in place. All 10,000 office-based staff continue to work from home, and the firm says the current arrangements will remain in place until at least September, when it will review the situation. Allen & OveryThe law firm is opening its London office from 7 September to any of its approximately 1,900 staff based in the capital who want to return. Those going back to the office will work there on alternate weeks to allow for social distancing. Clifford ChanceThe vast majority of the law firm’s approximately 2,000 UK staff continue to work from home, and there are no immediate plans for change. A small number of critical staff are working from Clifford Chance’s offices in London and Newcastle.Slaughter & MayThe London office reopened on a limited basis in early July, but the law firm only anticipates a small number people to be working there on any given day. The firm keeps the situation under review, but does not expect it to change in the near future due to social distancing requirements. ShoosmithsThe firm’s 13 locations will reopen on 3 August to its 1,600 employees, but will give workers the choice to decide where and when they work. The two-metre social distancing rule will be maintained inside offices, with caps on the number of staff allowed to attend each office each day, who must register their attendance three days in advance. FacebookThe US tech firm has over 3,000 employees in the UK, and three offices in London. It has yet to set out its reopening plans. Founder Mark Zuckerberg has told its workforce that the firm will permanently embrace remote working, even after the pandemic, and expects around half of its global staff to work remotely over the next five to 10 years. VodafoneThe mobile operator does not plan to return to its offices in Newbury and London before the end of 2020. It employs just under 9,000 people in the UK, and has contact centres in Newark, Stoke, Manchester and Glasgow. PearsonAll the publishing firm’s UK offices remain closed, with its 3,600 staff working from home. The company does not expect workers to return to its headquarters on the Strand in central London until 2021, while those who want to work from another central London office will be able to do so later this year. GoogleThe search engine firm has decided to allow all its global employees to work from home until July 2021. The majority of the US tech firm’s 4,500 UK employees continue to work remotely. The company has also said it remains committed to its vast 330m-long “sidescraper” office currently under construction in London’s King’s Cross."
"Barclays’ pre-tax profits plunged by 75% in the second quarter of 2020 after the bank put aside another £1.6bn to cover bad debts in preparation for a wave of defaults caused by the coronavirus crisis. The second-quarter provision was more than the £1.4bn analysts had expected and brings its total credit impairment charges to £3.7bn for the six months to June. It is also three times the £480m charge it logged last year. Meanwhile, the Spanish lender Santander put aside €3.1bn (£2.8bn) to cover potential Covid-19 loan losses, including £145m relating to the UK. It also slashed €6.1bn from the value of its UK business as part of a €12.6bn impairment charge. This pushed the bank to an €11bn loss in the second quarter – the first loss in its 163-year history. Barclays said its latest provision reflected a forecast deterioration in some parts of the economy, including a prolonged period of higher unemployment in the US and UK. However, this has been partially offset by the impact of government and central bank stimulus measures. The bank’s group financial director, Tushar Morzaria, said economic models were pointing to a relatively shallow recovery. “We’re not assuming a very sharp snapback.” He said the bank had “quite significantly” increased provisions for potential defaults in high-risk sectors such as airlines, retail, hospitality and transport, which have been hit hard by the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. Barclays said its total exposure to those sectors was £20.7bn. The total loan loss provision pushed pre-tax profits down by 75% to £359m for the three months to June, compared with £1.5bn in the same period last year. Analysts had been expecting profits of £491m, according to consensus estimates. Barclays’ net interest income – which measures how much the bank earns from loans minus what it pays on deposits – tumbled by 20% to £1.9bn after the Bank of England slashed interest rates to record lows of 0.1% in March. However, a strong performance by Barclays’ investment bank helped prevent a sharp fall in total income, which was down 4% year on year to £5.3bn. While Barclays said it expected lower loan loss provisions in the second half of the year, it warned that the next six months would be difficult. “Given the uncertain economic outlook and low-interest-rate environment, the second half of the year is expected to continue to be challenging,” the bank said. Barclays said its capital buffers – which ensure the bank can absorb major losses – were strong, but its chief executive, Jes Staley, struck a cautious tone. “Though we will remain well capitalised and ahead of our minimum requirements, we may experience stronger capital headwinds in the second half of the year,” he said. However, Staley said the bank’s risk and exposure levels were very different from those during the 2008 financial crisis, and meant it could play a very different role in the recovery. “Our hope is to be a firewall in the economy recovery and in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic; it’s much different than what happened with the banks some 10 years ago,” he said. Barclays has so far extended 600,000 payment holidays to customers affected by the pandemic and provided £7.7bn worth of government-backed bounce back loans and a further £2.5bn in coronavirus business interruption loans. However, Staley said demand for emergency funding and payment breaks had “slowed markedly” in recent weeks. The bank is now gearing up to help businesses raise funds on financial markets, a trend that could further benefit its investment bank. “The financial markets are increasingly open,” he said. “So if you’re a company and you’ve got some financial challenges and you’re in the leisure sector or the travel sector, you can go out and raise new capital in the public markets. That’s probably one of the greatest things that we can do financially to provide financial security for these corporates.”"
"Tourist hotspots across the UK are bearing the brunt of the ailing jobs market, an analysis of data on unemployment benefit claims since the Covid-19 lockdown has shown. Figures from Labour show that in areas heavily reliant on tourism the rise in the number of people seeking unemployment benefits in recent months is an average of 65 percentage points higher than in other areas. The data has prompted Keir Starmer to warn that holiday towns are facing a jobs crisis. Labour analysed data from the Office for National Statistics showing that in 32 places in England, Wales and Scotland where one fifth or more of the local workforce are in tourism-related jobs, the unemployment benefits claimant count among working-age adults has risen by an average of 174% from February to June – compared to 109% for the UK as a whole. The Labour leader will visit Falmouth, Cornwall, on Wednesday, where 24% of workers are in tourism related jobs and the unemployment claimant count has risen by 140% since lockdown. As the government winds down its furlough scheme, Starmer is calling for more targeted, flexible support to protect jobs in communities reliant on tourism. Other areas highlighted in the analysis include Portree, on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, which has endured a 393% increase in unemployment benefits claimants. Penzance, in Cornwall, where 32% of the workforce are employed in tourism jobs, has seen a 155% increase. Along the coast, St Austell & Newquay, where 24% of workers are in tourism jobs, has suffered a 135% increase. Meanwhile, Yorkshire seaside town Whitby, where a third of the workforce are employed in tourism, has seen a 157% increase in unemployment benefit claimants. Kendal, in the Lake District, where 24% of the workforce are in tourism, has endured a 281% increase in claimants. Starmer said: “We are lucky to have many world-class tourist destinations across the UK. But the jobs crisis facing tourist towns is stark.” Tourist destinations are now benefiting from an influx of visitors with many Britons reluctant to travel abroad but there is a lack of foreign visitors, resorts missed out on most of the early season trade and many businesses are unable to reopen fully due to distancing requirements. Starmer said: “We need a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors and proper support in place to help those who are unemployed back into work.” Labour is pressing for an extension of the government’s furlough scheme – due to finish in October – for the worst-hit sectors. Joss Croft, CEO, UKinbound, a trade association representing the tourism sector, labelled the results of Labour’s research “very worrying” but added that it was “unfortunately not surprising”. He said: “Adding to this, a significant proportion of our members, who rely solely on international visitors and deliver a large proportion of visitation outside of London, have told us they will fail over the next six-months without further government support. This equates to over 10,000 job losses by Christmas.” UKinbound wrote to Boris Johnson last week calling for improved action to support the tourism industry, urging the government to set up a “tourism resilience fund” to help shore up businesses until the industry is able to recover next year. The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said: “At a time when we are protecting almost 10 million people’s incomes – and supporting millions more through our safety net welfare system – it is disappointing to see Keir Starmer using selective figures to chase headlines and score cheap political points. “We have been honest with the British public that while we cannot save every job, we have introduced an unprecedented package of support for jobs and businesses, which have particularly helped the hospitality and tourism sectors. Our plan for jobs will support Britain getting back into work, something we hope the Labour party will get behind.”"
"Google has reaffirmed its commitment to its new central London headquarters, a horizontal skyscraper known as the “landscraper”, and will move thousands of workers there once it is completed. This is despite the tech firm’s decision to allow all of its global employees to work from home until July 2021. The vast majority of the US tech firm’s 4,500 UK employees continue to work remotely. It is understood that Google has not yet reopened any of its five UK offices, which include four in the capital and one in Manchester. Construction has resumed on the site next to London’s Kings Cross station, south of the Regent’s Canal, after it was temporarily paused during the lockdown. Google has not confirmed the completion date for the building, or when it expects to move in. However, up to 7,000 workers, more than the number currently employed by the company in the UK, could be housed in the area, with up to 4,000 in the landscraper, with the others in Google’s existing Kings Cross office, and a third building nearby, which the company plans to move into. The establishment of a Google campus in the area could accelerate the creation of a tech hub, with Facebook due to become a future neighbour with the development of its own building in Kings Cross. It is understood that the switch to remote working during the pandemic has not altered the London office plans of the world’s largest social network, despite the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that some employees will permanently work remotely. Like many of the capital’s prestigious commercial developments, the new Google HQ building has already earned itself a nickname. The “landscraper” will stretch out for 330 metres, longer than the 310-metre height of the Shard skyscraper, alongside the railway lines that run in and out of Kings Cross station. The building was designed in the studios of Thomas Heatherwick and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, who have also worked together on Google’s Californian headquarters in Mountain View. The gleaming glass building will stand 11 storeys tall, topped with a roof garden, and will boast a 25-metre swimming pool, indoor basketball court and nap pods for weary staff. However, in the medium-term, Google is content to let all of its 118,000 global full-time employees continue to work from home. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, the Google parent company, sent staff an email outlining the tech giant’s plans for the next 12 months. “To give employees the ability to plan ahead, we are extending our global voluntary work-from-home option through 30 June 2021 for roles that don’t need to be in the office,” said a Google spokesperson. A small number of workers who are required to be in the office have continued to work from the company’s sites. Many other firms that occupied large offices were reassessing their requirements, said Graham Harle, global chief executive of property consultancy Gleeds. “Clearly everyone is looking at their office space and how much they need,” said Harle, adding that staff surveys conducted by the consultancy’s clients showed a preference to work flexibly, splitting time between home and the office.

"Denise Frederick hasn’t stopped working since the pandemic began. But the nanny and home carer in New York City has also seen her pay cut in both jobs and she is uncertain about how long she will have either with the coronavirus outbreak far from under control. Like many women, the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has hit Frederick hard. For the first time in history, the US is in a “shecession” – an economic downturn where job and income losses are affecting women more than men. The family Frederick worked for left the city in the early days of the outbreak, but continued to pay her normally until last month when they cut her pay to hire a nanny where they are staying. They don’t know if they will return to the city before her contract expires at the end of the year. Meanwhile, Frederick’s pay was cut at her home carer job, which she has commuted to on the bus and subway since the pandemic began and where she has to pay for her own personal protective equipment (PPE). Frederick, a single mother, moved from St Lucia four years ago to fulfill a life goal: to put her 19-year-old daughter through college. “I keep saying to her, focus on school, let me figure out where the next meal is going to come from, let me figure out how the bills are going to get paid, because I don’t want her to get stressed out about me and then it’s affecting her grades,” Frederick said. In the Great Recession, men lost twice as many jobs as women. But from February to May, 11.5 million women lost their jobs compared with 9 million men because of business closures intended to stop the spread of Covid-19. By the end of April, women’s job losses had erased a decade of employment gains. The staggering figures have underlined the changing nature of the workforce and brought into focus the overlooked issues attached to that shift. Women, especially women of color, are more vulnerable to sudden losses of income because of the gender pay gap and are more dependent on childcare and school to be able to work. C Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), said: “We didn’t do enough in the 2008 recession to make sure there was an even recovery, and what I am hoping this time around is that we learn those hard lessons and we make sure the communities who are most impacted, that there are targeted programs to make sure they are able to recover successfully.” In this economic crisis, job losses have shot across industries where women, particularly Black and Latina women, held a disproportionate number of jobs, such as hospitality, leisure and education. Hispanic women experienced the steepest decline in unemployment, 21%, in this recession, though their employment was essentially unchanged in the Great Recession. When employment figures rebounded slightly in May, they did so for every population except Black women, one in six of whom were unemployed that month, according to an analysis by the National Women’s Law Center. Women gained the majority of jobs between early May and early June, but are still farther from pre-coronavirus employment levels compared with men, according to an IWPR analysis. Those improvements were not reflected in childcare services, where employment is still a quarter below pre-pandemic levels. With children possibly going to school remotely in the fall, this is a problem for women inside and outside the sector, because they tend to be the primary caregiver for children in heterosexual couples. “Many of the challenges that are facing women of color workers, issues around childcare, issues around lower wages, issues of lack of flexibility and lack of job security, have all been made worst by the pandemic,” Mason said. “So the situation for women who were struggling before the pandemic has only gotten worse.” There is also the question of when childcare, hospitality and leisure jobs will return. More than 148,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US and the country has failed to put in place measures which have helped other countries control outbreaks. At least 70% of Black, immigrant domestic workers like Frederick have either lost their jobs or had a cut in pay or hours, according to a survey by the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Institute for Policy Studies. Of the 800 people surveyed from late May to early June, 65% said they were worried or at risk of being evicted or having a utility shut off in the next three months. But Frederick is optimistic this desperate situation has given people a greater awareness for what their nannies are responsible for each day. Frederick said some of her friends have received frantic calls from the families they used to work for saying: “I don’t know how you do it.” Frederick said: “It has shown some of the employers that nannies are very beneficial to them and maybe, just maybe, helped them realize that when a nanny comes to an interview and says ‘look, my rate is $25’, they should be given the rate they are asking for because it’s a lot of work.” Frederick is one of many who have identified an opportunity in this crisis for women to seize more rights because problems made worse by the pandemic, such as low wages, have become impossible to ignore. Kristin Rowe-Finkbeine, the executive director and co-founder of MomsRising, a group which advocates for women’s and family issues, said: “The cracks in our system that were here before the pandemic have now become catastrophes and we absolutely need every member of Congress to focus on what actually fuels our economy and the health of our nation.” Congress in March passed the unusually generous Cares Act, a stimulus package which increased unemployment insurance by an extra $600 a week. At $15 an hour, that is equivalent to what unions have been fighting to become the federal minimum wage. And while the US is one of the only countries that does not mandate paid sick leave, workers are now eligible for it because of Covid-19. Mason, of IWPR, said discussions about things such as paid sick leave were on the sidelines in February, when coronavirus was bubbling under the surface. But now that people have lived with an expanded social safety net, it’s an opportunity to institutionalize more robust social support programs. “I’m optimistic about the possibility of creating a more equitable economy and bringing some of the issues that many women and families had to deal with by themselves so it was seen as an individual issue, not a structural, institutional issue,” Mason said. “And what we’re realizing now is that what is happening now is the result of broken systems that were not working for the majority of Americans and people.”"
"UK retailers enjoyed their best sales in more than a year following the reopening of non-essential stores in mid-June, according to the latest snapshot of spending from the CBI. The employers’ organisation found there had been a much sharper bounce-back than retailers had been expecting following the lifting of restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. More retailers said business was up year on year than reported a decline – 47% to 43% – the strongest showing by the CBI’s distributive trades survey since April 2019. The +4 percentage point balance followed negative readings of -55 in April, -50 in May and -37 in June. The CBI said the recovery was largely the result of sales of groceries, although there had also been a pick up in demand for hardware and DIY products, cards, flowers and stationery. The survey of 62 retailers – conducted between late June and mid-July – found that sales were seen as average for the time of year, the highest balance since November 2019. Sales were expected to be remain close to seasonal norms in the coming month. Orders placed by retailers on their suppliers fell for a fourth month, but at a slower pace than between April and June. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said: “It’s great to see retail sales stabilise this month, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. This crisis has created winners and losers within the retail sector and for some businesses the picture remains bleak. “The reopening of non-essential retail was a vital step towards recovery but isn’t a cure-all. The government has provided critical support for firms and jobs throughout the crisis. But ongoing financial pressures are a major challenge for some retailers, and additional direct support to shore up cashflow, such as extension of business rates relief, should be considered.” The distributive trades survey – which also covers wholesalers and motor traders – was in line with the latest official data showing a marked pickup in retail sales in June. Car dealerships reported their first annual sales growth since February, following a period in which business had come to a virtual standstill."
"Consumer demand for cleaning products from Dettol to Lysol provided a pandemic sales surge for Reckitt Benckiser, although the company admitted it is still struggling to keep shelves stocked in “pockets” of the UK and US. The consumer goods group, which owns brands including Cillit Bang, Nurofen and Durex, beat market expectations with total revenues rising 11.9% to £6.9bn in the first half. The performance was driven by sales at its hygiene division, with Lysol rising 70% in North America and Dettol 62% globally. Total online sales of Reckitt Benckiser products surged 60% fuelled by stay-at-home shoppers under lockdown. Laxman Narasimhan, the Reckitt chief executive, said that once the pandemic passes demand for personal and household cleaning products would return to more normal levels. “There has been quite a seismic shift in how people are living,” he said. “We expect it to continue but not at levels it has been. People are nesting at home, you see that in the number of plates being washed and cooking at home. When the pandemic hit, the lockdown hit, we did see pantry loading. People did go out and buy more than they normally would to make sure the pantry is stocked. But at the end of the day underlying consumption [of cleaning products] doesn’t necessarily change. We are seeing an unwind of that.” Narasimhan described Lysol and Dettol as “mega brands” with combined sales of more than £4.5bn each year. He highlighted global demand, pointing to a Dettol handwashing challenge campaign run on the video site TikTok in India, which attracted 124bn views. However, he admitted that while the company has managed to cope with disruption to supply chains during the early stages of the pandemic it is still struggling to keep up with demand in some markets. “Supply clearly is stronger and we are producing more than what we did in the past, but not enough and we are bringing more on,” he said. “[It is about] ensuring we have the right mix in place so when people walk into a store [our products] are available. Clearly in certain pockets we are still not available to the level we would like to be and that continues to be an area of focus. Certainly some pockets of the UK, which we are working to fix, and certain parts of the US, no question.” He added that “lower social interactions” during the pandemic, with pubs, bars and clubs shut and the nation social distancing under lockdown, impacted Durex sales."
"The online fashion retailer Boohoo has promised to “act decisively” on any recommendations made by lawyers investigating its UK supply chain, after it faced allegations that factories making its clothes in Leicester were paying workers below the minimum wage. So far, the company has not committed to publishing the full report. The independent review is being led by Alison Levitt QC, the former head of law firm Mishcon de Reya’s white-collar crime unit, and on Tuesday the company said her full report would be ready by 15 September for the company to consider. That is four months earlier than expected and comes after investors – who have seen the value of their shares fall by a third in the wake of a Sunday Times article – pushed for a speedier resolution. The group said it would “provide an update on the findings of the report” alongside its half-year results, which are due a fortnight later on 30 September. The review’s purpose is to examine Boohoo’s “obligations and relevant duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain”. Levitt is being assisted by a team of solicitors from TLT, a UK law firm, as well as two junior counsel. The methodology used, which will include a public call for evidence, is to be agreed by Levitt and TLT. The main objectives are to ascertain whether the allegations are well-founded and, if they are, look at how closely the company monitored its supply chain in Leicester and had knowledge of the allegations. It will also consider the group’s compliance with the relevant law and make recommendations for the company to act upon. While traditional high street clothing chains have struggled with the rise of online shopping, in less than 15 years Boohoo has gone from a three-employee operation to a business with sales of £1.2bn and a 5,000-strong workforce that ships millions of parcels a week. It now owns a stable of brands including PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal, Karen Millen and Warehouse. However, the company’s share price has fallen sharply since an undercover reporter found staff allegedly being paid as little as £3.50 an hour in the factory, even though the minimum wage in Britain for those aged 25 and over is £8.72. Brian Small, the Boohoo deputy chairman and senior independent director, said: “We are pleased to share the terms of reference for the upcoming independent review into our Leicester supply chain. We believe this demonstrates how seriously we, as a board, are treating the recent allegations into our supply chain.” He added: “The group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency.” Aneesha Sherman, an analyst at Bernstein, said: “Bringing the date forward is a positive for shareholders, creating a faster path towards getting some clarity and certainty on the magnitude of the problem, as well as outlining the steps that will be taken to resolve it.”"
"HSBC has pledged to at least double the number of black staff across its upper ranks, but has admitted it does not know the exact number of minority ethnic individuals in senior positions across the business. In an internal memo to staff, HSBC’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, admitted that the bank’s failure to collect and publish ethnicity data had created a “feeling of mistrust” among black colleagues, who are concerned that the bank had been “relatively silent” on issues affecting the black community. Quinn said he wanted to assure colleagues that HSBC would act. “The Black Lives Matter movement has rightly created more urgent demand for action,” Quinn said. “These are the initial steps that we as a group will take in response.” A steering committee made up of black leaders and staff from different ethnic backgrounds is to oversee a newly created global ethnicity inclusion programme. The bank has also pledged to “at least double” the number of black people in director-level positions, which includes the executive team, by 2025. However, a spokeswoman for HSBC said the bank did not have statistics confirming the current number of black staff in director-level positions.  Quinn’s memo said a “diversity data enhancement programme” was under way as part of plans to improve the reporting and transparency of ethnicity data. Those figures will be released for the first time alongside its annual report in 2021. The London-headquartered lender said it would work with headhunters to “engage” black and ethnically diverse candidates for leadership roles and improve their representation on shortlists in mid-career roles. Quinn said the bank would update its recruitment processes to reduce potential bias and “enhance” hiring strategies for its graduate programmes. “Saying the right words is easy. Doing the right thing is harder. I want us to be judged by the concrete, sustainable actions we take to be a more diverse and inclusive bank,” Quinn said. HSBC’s announcement comes a week after Lloyds Banking Group said it would increase the number of black staff in senior roles from 0.6% to at least 3% over the next four years. It will mean recruiting about 168 more black staff into senior roles by 2024. Lloyds – which currently employs 40 black members of staff across its 7,000-strong management team – will also publish its first ethnicity pay gap report later this year and include at least one candidate from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background on every executive director shortlist."
"The government closing its furlough scheme this autumn is a “mistake” that will drive up unemployment by 1.2 million by Christmas, one of the UK’s leading economics thinktanks has warned. Sounding the alarm over the mounting risk to jobs, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said extending the wage subsidy scheme until the middle of next year would dramatically cut the number of redundancies across Britain and would probably pay for itself. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, confirmed at the summer statement that the furlough scheme would be wound down from August before it is removed entirely by the end of October, despite calls for an extension from Labour, trades unions and business leaders. As many as 9.5 million jobs have been furloughed at 1.2m companies since March, at a cost to the exchequer of £31.7bn so far. To ease the transition from the scheme, the government will offer £1,000 bonuses to companies for every worker they bring back from furlough and retain in employment until January, at a total cost to the Treasury of up to £9.4bn. However, NIESR said extending the furlough scheme until the middle of next year would have about the same cost – with a direct cost of £10bn – and would be more effective at saving jobs. “The planned closure of the furlough seems to be a mistake, motivated by an understandable desire to limit spending,” said Garry Young, the NIESR deputy director. “The scheme was intended by the chancellor to be a bridge through the crisis and there is a risk that it is coming to an end prematurely and this increases the probability of economic scarring.” Britain’s oldest economics research institute said without an extension it expected unemployment to surge to 3 million by the end of this year. However, it said keeping the furlough programme open would protect as many as 1.2 million workers who are set to lose their jobs, and would reduce unemployment in Britain in every year up to 2024. Despite the initial high costs for the Treasury, NIESR said extending the scheme could pay for itself. This is because furloughed workers would still pay tax, would be more likely to spend in the economy with income from the scheme, and would not need to receive unemployment benefits. The rolling back of government support for jobs comes as the British economy slowly recovers from a 25% drop in economic output in March and April at the onset of the pandemic. With the gradual relaxation of lockdown restrictions, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) returned in May, albeit at a weaker pace than first hoped. NIESR said it expected UK GDP to fall by 10% this year and rise by 6% in 2021. However, it said the level of economic activity at the end of 2019 – before the crisis struck – is unlikely to be regained before the second half of 2023. Steve Barclay, the Treasury chief secretary, said it was the right thing to do to close the furlough scheme. Speaking at an online event hosted by centre-right Onward thinktank, he said the purpose of the programme had been to keep people connected to their jobs during the pandemic. “It would be odd to have such a focus on retaining the link to jobs and ensuring people aren’t out of the labour market, and then have a scheme that was extended and perpetuated that.” Ruling out an extension, he said the government was providing more funding to help the creation of new job. “The furlough scheme won’t be extended. We don’t think it’s the right thing for people to be outside of the labour market for very long periods.”"
"The price of gold has climbed to a record high, as investors poured their money into the precious metal amid fears about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy and the worsening US-China trade row. The spot gold price rose 2.3% to $1,944.68 (£1,509) an ounce, overtaking its previous record of $1,920 during the financial crisis in September 2011, adding to the previous week’s gains of more than 7%. So far this year it has risen 28%. Gold has long been viewed as a “safe haven” asset, a secure place for investors to put their money when other investments are volatile and a way of hedging against falls in assets such as stocks or currencies. Investors have become increasingly nervous as economies around the world struggle to reopen following coronavirus lockdowns, and the threat of a large global recession looms. The US dollar has been sliding in recent weeks and fell to its lowest level in almost two years against a basket of other currencies, as concerns have increased about the American recovery and the intensification of the trade row between the world’s two largest economies. Gold is seen as “insurance from turbulence on currencies markets”, said Carlo Alberto De Casa, the chief analyst at online trading platform ActivTrades. “While currencies can all be printed, the finite nature of gold and silver makes them better stores of value at these times of uncertainty,” he said. The latest rise in gold came as Chinese authorities took over the US consulate in the city of Chengdu. China had ordered the closure in response to Washington’s order for the Chinese consulate in Houston to be shut. The price of gold is expected to rise further because of geopolitical tensions, said Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. “In our view the primary drivers of the gold price are its negative correlation to real interest rates and the dollar. We think these factors, in combination with limited supply growth as miners continue to restrain capital spending, will drive gold prices higher,” Haefele said. Analysts forecast that gold could reach $2,000 an ounce for the first time, as the dollar is expected to remain under pressure before the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting, where central bankers could decide to keep interest rates low for longer. The price of silver has rallied along with the gold price, rising by as much as 8% to $24.57, reaching its highest level since September 2013. Large investors, such as private banks, have been buying gold, along with individual investors who moved money into the metal in growing numbers during the first six months of the year."
"Lloyds Banking Group plunged to a second-quarter loss after putting aside £2.4bn for bad debts, saying the economic impact of the Covid-19 lockdown was “much larger than expected”.  Britain’s biggest high street lender reported a loss of £676m for the three months to June, down from a £1.3bn profit during the same period last year. Analysts had been expecting a loss of £31m. It came after the bank took a loan loss provision of £2.4bn, as it readied itself for a surge in defaults in the coming months. Lloyds said the charge reflected the “significant deterioration in the economic outlook during the quarter”. Business and personal customers are expected to struggle to keep up with payments as the pandemic drags on and coronavirus support programmes, such as the government’s furlough scheme and state-backed loans, are wound down.  Lloyds, which is the UK’s largest mortgage lender, said the UK’s economic performance “remains uncertain and largely dependent on how Covid-19 transmission responds as the economy gradually reopens”. “The outlook has clearly become more challenging since our first-quarter results, with the economic impact of lockdown much larger than expected at that time,” said the bank’s chief executive, António Horta-Osório. The bank’s central forecast predicts a 10% drop in UK economic growth in 2020, with the jobless rate peaking at 9% in the fourth quarter. Its worst-case scenario would see unemployment jump to 12.5% by the second quarter of 2021 and gross domestic product fall by 17.2% this year.  The latest provision adds to the £1.4bn charge that Lloyds booked in anticipation of losses related to Covid-19 in the first quarter. It brings the bank’s total credit impairment charge to £3.8bn for the first six months of 2020. Lloyds, which is seen a bellwether for the UK economy as it is one of the most domestically focused banks, said it expects impairments to total £4.5bn to £5.5bn by the end of the year. “The negative economic impact remains profound and we have revised our expectations accordingly,” Horta-Osório said.  He added:  “We are, of course, aware that the support we are providing to our personal and business customers to help them through the current crisis will have a cost to the group. We believe this is the right thing to do, as supporting our customers directly aids the recovery of the economy from which we benefit. We view this as an investment in the business.” Lloyds also suffered a 17% drop in net interest income – which measures the difference between interest earned on loans versus paid on deposits – to £2.5bn after UK interest rates were cut to a record low of 0.1% in March.  The company’s shares dropped 8% to 26p after the results. Like other UK lenders, Lloyds has seen its price drop significantly since February, when its shares were trading at 58p. On Wednesday, Barclays reported a 75% plunge in quarterly profits, to £359m, after putting aside £1.6bn to cover bad debts. Standard Chartered released its second-quarter results on Thursday, showing pre-tax profit falling 37% to $741m (£570m) after taking a $611m (£470m) loan impairment charge."
"The government is expanding its Covid-19 rescue loan scheme to cover small businesses on the edge of collapse, a move that Labour warned would come too late for many troubled firms. With less than a week before the furlough scheme covering 9 million employees is cut back, plunging more employers into debt, the Treasury said it would use a change in EU state aid rules to allow firms previously locked out of the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) to access government funds.  The economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said he would write to major lenders advising them of the change, which will make more small businesses – specifically those that have racked up large losses and debts – eligible for loans of up to £5m. By the end of June, more than £11bn had been lent to more than 50,000 businesses under CBILS. Previously, businesses classed as “undertakings in difficulty” were unable to access CBILS under EU state aid rules, which the UK has been required to adhere to during the Brexit transition period. “From today, businesses in this category and which have fewer than 50 employees and a turnover of less than £9m can apply to CBILS,” he said. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said: “Any help in breaking down the obstacles to loans is welcome, but this has all taken far too long, with too many businesses left out in the cold. Time will tell whether this sorts out the growing backlog of CBILS loans. “There also remain serious, unaddressed problems of loans for larger firms, CBILS, and growing evidence of firms being shut out of bounce-back loans unless they are an existing customer of a major high street bank. Every week that passes with these problems being allowed to continue puts at risk the future of businesses, the livelihoods of workers and the strength of our economy.” The business lobby group, the CBI, said widening the eligibility rules for the CBILS scheme was “an important step that will help more businesses get the critical support they need”. But some experts warned that the expansion of CBILS to weaker companies could add billions of pounds to the rescue bill and prop up firms that should be allowed to go bust. The government provides all CBILS loans with an 80% guarantee, meaning banks will be left to shoulder 20% of potential losses. The more popular bounce-back loan scheme, under which £29.5bn had been distributed to 967,000 businesses by 28 June, provides a 100% government guarantee. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent economic forecaster, has forecast default rates of 10% for CBILS loans and 40% for bounce-back loans. Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic & Social Research thinktank, said: “While providing a simpler approvals process is helpful and providing support to businesses that were in difficulty in December 2019 may support some in their recovery during the pandemic, there is a danger that older businesses that should otherwise go out of business may continue to trade with even higher levels of debt, which may hold back future investment and job creation. “It would be just as important, perhaps even more so, to consider boosting lending for new businesses and startups.” Glen said it had taken months of lobbying by the government and industry groups for a relaxation of rules in the European Temporary State Aid Framework “to make sure that small businesses who are not insolvent or receiving rescue aid can benefit”. He said: “Our loan schemes have been a key part in supporting businesses, enabling them to bounce back as we kick-start the economy.” The small business minister, Paul Scully, said: “Small businesses will play a vital role as we seek to recover our way of life and get the economy moving again, and it is essential we continue to support them through this difficult period.” "
"A slew of England’s biggest businesses are set to defy the government’s push to get workers back into offices in August, a Guardian analysis shows, with many big businesses sticking to home working arrangements or delaying a partial return until September at the earliest. Law firms, insurers, energy providers and tech firms are among those reacting cautiously to the change in government advice, which means from Saturday employers can decide whether staff can safely come back to offices. Some companies, such as Google and NatWest Group, are allowing workers to stay at home until 2021 amid signs of a permanent shift in working culture. However, businesses that are trying to maintain or grow an office-based workforce are taking remarkable steps to keep staff safe. Banks are offering staff home coronavirus testing kits, conducting temperature checks in offices and in one case even stationing a nurse on reception as part of efforts to reassure workers it is safe to return to their desks. JP Morgan has placed a nurse in the foyer of its Canary Wharf office in London, where 1,800 staff are monitored by thermal cameras as they enter the building. The US bank, which already employs a private GP on the site, is also supplying private Covid-19 home testing kits to any of its 18,500 UK staff that might be exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms. But many major British employers contacted by the Guardian are not planning a wholesale return to offices from 1 August, when government advice on working from home changes in England. Boris Johnson said this month that from Saturday employers can decide whether staff can safely come back to offices. In Wales, the law requiring people to work from home will cease to take effect from today, although First Minister Mark Drakeford said last week that working from home “remains a cornerstone of our approach”. but the Scottish government continues to advise that employees work from home where possible, and this is also the recommendation in Northern Ireland. The previous advice in England to avoid public transport, a crucial component in bringing large numbers of workers back to cities around the country, is also being scrapped. Two major employers dealt a blow to the government’s hopes of an office return on Thursday, with travel company Tui announcing that it was shutting high street stores and moving 630 of the workers affected into a home-working unit. Lloyds Banking group also announced on Thursday that it was reviewing the amount of office space it uses as it admitted that working from home had made it “less reliant on office space”. September is emerging as a more likely date for a phased return for businesses. PwC, the accounting and consultancy business, aims to have more than 50% of its workforce back in its offices by the end of September, while rival EY will welcome back some staff from 7 September. Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and Barclays are among the financial institutions with substantial workforces that are expecting thousands of staff to stay at home until at least September. Energy firms SSE and National Grid will review their working arrangements in September. Remote working was hastily introduced by British companies in March, but has generally been viewed as a success, thanks to the availability of high-speed internet and video services such as Zoom. As a result, few of the firms which in pre-pandemic times had thousands of workers in their offices are rushing to bring people back under one roof, despite the installation of hand-sanitiser stations, one-way systems and limits to the number of people who can travel in a lift. However, the banking sector in particular has been looking at ways to ensure that staff can return to the office safely. Goldman Sachs checks the temperature each day of its 1,000 London staff who have returned out of a total in the capital of 6,000, and is considering offering its employees regular Covid-19 tests. Lloyds Banking Group has also been piloting thermal cameras in a small number of offices and bank branches, to try to identify colleagues who may be suffering from Covid-19. Yet even the banks already returning to their headquarters aren’t expecting to welcome back more than 50% of workers this year, according to Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, because of the need for physical distancing. More than half a million people usually work in the Square Mile financial district, the vast majority of whom commute in on public transport. The Institute of Directors isn’t expecting a “mad rush back to the office come August”, said its chief economist, Tej Parikh, due to concerns around public transport and need for childcare. “The onus is on directors to secure the wellbeing of their staff, and they must make judgments on any return to the office based on their firm’s particular circumstances. Adjusting workspaces can take time, and isn’t without costs,” Parikh said. Britain’s largest office occupiers are also reluctant to bring many staff back during the school summer holidays, when many take time off. September, when schools are expected to open again, is being viewed by many firms as a natural restart, once parents are no longer solely responsible for childcare.  Yet alongside Google and NatWest, other firms are much more reticent and are already scheduling their return for 2021. Facebook has not laid out its plans for reopening its three London offices to its 3,000 staff, while other multinationals including Vodafone and publishing firm Pearson are expected to keep employees at home until next year."
"The busmaker Alexander Dennis is cutting 650 jobs in the latest blow to the UK automotive industry as it reels from the coronavirus pandemic. The job losses are expected to affect workers at sites in Guildford, Scarborough and Falkirk, the company’s main manufacturing facilities, as well as other sites. Alexander Dennis employed 2,700 people worldwide before the cuts, which have come as part of a global restructuring by its Canadian owner, NFI Group. Busmakers have suffered after their customers, public and private bus operators, had their income wiped out by travel restrictions that have led to passenger volumes falling to as little as a tenth of 2019 levels. Alexander Dennis made 1,250 buses for the UK market in 2019, but it has received no orders since March. It said it needed to move to “a leaner, more flexible manufacturing model” with lower costs. Colin Robertson, the Alexander Dennis chief executive, who is set to to join NFI’s board, said the company had been on track for record sales before the pandemic hit. He warned of an “unprecedented crisis” hitting the bus industry. Robertson called for the government to act quickly on its pledge to order 4,000 environmentally friendly buses to support the UK’s manufacturing industry as well as cutting bus emissions. This echoes other bus companies such as Northern Ireland’s Wrightbus, which was taken over by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, last year and is working on separate zero-emissions technology. Alexander Dennis had been pushing to increase the number of electric buses it produces before the pandemic, making 80 in 2019. In the early months of 2020 more than a third of its orders were for electric buses. Steve Bush, a national officer at the Unite union, said the job losses were “a devastating blow for Alexander Dennis workers and their communities”.“The coronavirus pandemic has impacted the automotive sector greatly,” he said. “However, ADL [Alexander Dennis Limited] is in a good position to take advantage of the need to reduce the carbon footprint of the UK’s passenger transport network. Unite is clear ADL must not impact its future operating capacity by cutting jobs opportunistically for the sake of short-term savings.”"
"Amazon is stepping up its competition with British supermarkets by pressing ahead with the wider UK rollout of its online grocery service by the end of the year. Larger orders on Amazon Fresh will be free to members of the online retailer’s Prime service from Tuesday and will begin to cover more areas in the UK, as the $1.5tn (£1.2tn) company seeks to capitalise on the growth in doorstep deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic. Amid criticisms that the scheme amounts to a “postcode lottery” that many Prime members living outside London and the home counties have been unable to access, the e-commerce giant is also expanding the scheme to cover more areas of the UK and to allow greater take-up by its estimated 15 million members. Amazon Fresh is currently available in just 300 postcodes in and around London. It is understood that Prime members in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh will be among the first to benefit from a wider rollout by the year end. Last month the Bradford-based supermarket chain Morrisons – which collaborates with Amazon on the US company’s same-day grocery service – said it had more than doubled the number of stores serving Amazon Prime customers to 40. Until now, Amazon Fresh purchases have required a monthly add-on fee of £3.99 or a £2.99 delivery fee (in addition to the annual Prime subscription fee of £79 annually). From Tuesday, orders worth more than £40 requiring two-hour delivery will be free but will cost £3.99 for a one-hour slot. Orders under £40 will cost £3.99 for two-hour delivery and £6.99 for one hour, however. The minimum order value will also be lowered from £40 to £15. In other changes, the service is also being speeded up, with same-day grocery deliveries up to midnight in, initially, more than 40 postcode districts in the south-east guaranteed, provided shoppers order by 9pm. The bold move by Amazon means it is keen to carve out a slice of the rapidly growing online UK grocery market – forecast to grow 76.2% to £19.5bn in 2020 – following the significant uplift in demand amid the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. “Prime members love the convenience of grocery delivery at home, which is why we’ve made Amazon Fresh a free benefit of Prime,” said Russell Jones, country manager, Amazon Fresh UK. “Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon … We will keep improving the grocery shopping experience so by the end of the year, millions of Prime members across the UK will have access to fast, free delivery of groceries.” “They will certainly cause major disruption, ruffle feathers and capture a material slice of the market,” said retail expert Richard Hyman. “Amazon has deep pockets and the massive luxury of not needing to make a profit from food retailing. This is just as well because no one really makes much if any money from online food retailing now. A new kid in town with the immediate muscle of the others, and no need to make money, and the best data-driven logistics in retail has been the incumbents’ nightmare for some time, and it’s about to come true.” Recent figures from Nielsen reveal that online grocery sales jumped 115% in the four weeks to 11 July, compared to the same period last year.  One analyst, however, warned that Amazon will have to overcome shoppers’ loyalty to established grocers. “This will not be an easy mountain to climb for Amazon, despite its financial and logistical prowess. Many UK shoppers have a much more emotional bond with food than non-food, and Amazon’s greatest challenge will be in presenting itself as a “go to” destination for food purchases,” said Tom Brereton, associate analyst at GlobalData.

"Aston Martin Lagonda’s losses surged to £227m in the first half of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic closed the embattled UK luxury carmaker’s dealerships and prompted an executive clear-out. The carmaker was also forced to restate its income statements over two years after detecting an accounting error that led it to overstate profitability in 2018 and 2019. Aston Martin has endured a torrid 12 months, as heavy spending on a new factory for a new car, the DBX SUV, followed by the pandemic pushed it close to bankruptcy. Its main plant, at Gaydon, Warwickshire, is only due to resume manufacturing at the end of August, later than originally planned. In January the billionaire fashion mogul Lawrence Stroll led a consortium that in effect took control of Aston Martin in a bailout shortly before the pandemic forced a deep drop in sales. Stroll has focused on restoring profitability at the carmaker, as well as firing Andy Palmer as chief executive and in his place installing Tobias Moers, the former boss of Mercedes-Benz’s performance division, AMG. The pandemic meant that Aston Martin sold only 1,770 cars in the first six months of 2020, down 41% compared with 2019. It sold only one of its highly lucrative “special” cars, such as the £2.7m DB5 Goldfinger Continuation, which comes with a smokescreen emitter and fake tyre slashers and machine guns to mirror the car made famous by the James Bond film. Last year it sold 36. The carmaker’s revenues plunged by 64% year on year to only £146m as dealerships around the world were forced to close. Aston Martin was also forced to restate its income statements for 2018 and 2019 after overstating profits by £15.3m in 2019. The new management found an error in the way the US region was recognising revenues that meant it counted payments to dealers and discounts for retail customers later than it should have done. Stroll, who took the role of executive chairman, said it had been “a very intense and challenging six months” and the company pointed to more difficulties ahead. Reducing the number of cars at dealerships, a key aim of Stroll as he tries to restore Aston Martin’s air of exclusivity, will continue until 2021. In its statement to the stock market, Aston Martin said: “Trading remains challenging in many markets and the pace of emergence from lockdown and consumer recovery varies significantly.”"
"Vodafone has been inundated with complaints on social media from mobile customers struggling to make and receive calls on Tuesday afternoon. Users started reporting problems shortly after 5pm, according to the Downdetector website. The problems are believed to have affected people across the country. The issue prevented voice calls connecting, but customers have still been able to text, use mobile data and make WhatsApp calls. Responding to one customer on Twitter, Vodafone UK said: “We are aware that some customers may be experiencing issues with making outbound calls from their mobile, we have teams working to resolve this, sorry for any inconvenience.” It is unclear how many people have been affected, though Vodafone has 18 million customers in the UK. Customers have relied heavily on phone and internet access during the Covid-19 outbreak, which has forced people to isolate and work from home during the UK lockdown. Vodafone said the problem was fixed shortly after 6pm at which point the network “started recovering”. The company said the problem was caused by a change it had made to block a range of telephone numbers being used to make spam calls. “We’d like to apologise to any customers who struggled to make phone calls this evening,” said a Vodafone spokesman. “We had an incident at around 17.20, which was fixed at 18.10. The service is now fully back to normal. Any customer struggling to make a call should quickly turn their phone off and on again to restart. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” Last month, millions of Virgin Media customers had problems accessing the internet during a series of outages across the country. The TV, broadband and mobile company, which has 5.3 million UK customers, said that the problem was not caused by its network being overloaded by high demand during the coronavirus lockdown."
"When the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly jobs report earlier this month, the unemployment numbers were jaw-dropping: the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% in March to 14.7% in April – a decade’s worth of job gains wiped out in mere weeks. The jobs report also unveiled the grim reality of which communities have been hit hardest from the economic impacts of Covid-19. Hispanic Americans saw the highest unemployment rate of any racial group at 18.9%, over 4% more than the national unemployment rate of 14.7%. Clara Lopez of Miami, Florida, worked for 17 years as a room attendant at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel and was laid off at the end of March as things were starting to shut down. She has been trying to apply for unemployment insurance since 29 March, but has yet to have success. Florida, which has a 12.9% unemployment rate, continues to have a backlog of unemployment applications, meaning people like Lopez have been left with no unemployment insurance to pay essential bills. “I have my light bill, my water bill, my car bill, my electric bill. As of now, I don’t even have one cent left to be able to pay for any of it,” Lopez said. Even though Lopez is able to buy groceries with food stamps, prices in supermarkets have gone up, meaning she is barely able to buy the groceries she needs. The mass job losses hitting the community are a devastating blow in light of the gains that Hispanic Americans had made before the pandemic hit. In September, the Hispanic unemployment rate hit a historic low at 3.9% and hovered about 4% through February. Median household income had risen to $51,450 in 2018, another record high. Hispanic Americans were buying homes at a rate higher than any other race and had the highest labor force participation rate of any race. Just this past March, Donald Trump took credit for the supposed economic boom that Hispanic Americans were seeing. “Under the booming Trump economy, Latinos are achieving record gains,” the president said while giving remarks at the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit on 4 March.  Yet even when measurements of wealth showed Hispanic Americans were doing better than ever before, they were still far behind white Americans. The median household income for white households in 2018 was $70,642, while the median household income for Hispanic households was $63,179. Less income means that Hispanic American families struggle to build wealth. The average net worth of a Hispanic American household is $191,200, compared with the average net worth of a white household, which is $933,700. Hispanic American families are also more likely to be in poverty than white families, with 17% of Hispanic families in poverty in 2018 compared to 10% of white families. “Even though the economy, you could say, was good, when you look at the numbers, once you pull back what was really happening, you saw that Latinos were working harder but were still barely struggling to get by,” said Orson Aguilar, director of economic policy for UnidosUS, an advocacy group for Hispanic Americans. The disproportionate economic effect Hispanic Americans are seeing is reminiscent of the effect the Great Recession had on the group. The wealth of many Hispanic families was concentrated in the value of the homes they owned, and many owned homes in states that were hit the hardest by the housing crisis, the Pew Research Center found in 2011. Thus, Hispanic families saw the largest decrease in household wealth of any racial group, dropping by 66%. In comparison, black families saw a 53% decrease in wealth while white families saw a 16% decrease. While Covid-19 is causing a very different crisis that is hitting all groups, economists and policymakers have long said that job segregation has left Hispanic Americans overrepresented in the low-paying industries that have been hit hardest by Covid-19. Though they make up just over 17% of the American workforce, Hispanic Americans make up 49% of maids and housekeeping cleaners, 46% of construction workers and 38% of grounds and maintenance workers. Many of those industries were the ones that saw the most layoffs due to shutdowns. “Latinos support a lot of industries that were hardest hit, and now we’re seeing as a result Latinos being the hardest hit,” Aguilar said. Yaquelin, who asked that her last name be withheld for fear of repercussions from future employers, from Tamarac, Florida, was laid off once lockdowns in the state began by the three families that employed her as a nanny and cleaner. She is unsure of whether she will be able to work for the families again once the pandemic subsides or how that work will affect her health. “Our work is the type of work that is done privately inside homes,” Yaquelin said in Spanish through a translator. “Domestic workers don’t have health insurance, we have no contract to outline our hours.” The National Domestic Workers Alliance estimates there are nearly 2.5 million domestic workers in the US. In a survey, the not-for-profit found 72% of their respondents reported having no jobs in early April. While Congress’s giant coronavirus stimulus package included $600 more in unemployment insurance for those who have been laid off, the checks can only go to people who have been able to successfully file in their state. Many states have antiquated online systems that are unable to handle the mass of people who have been laid off due to the pandemic, meaning millions could be left without unemployment insurance. For Yaquelin, not having a job has also meant considerable stress over bills, especially as she has also not been able to successfully file for unemployment. “I have no appetite, I have insomnia, I wake up many times during the night,” Yaquelin said. “I feel like this is going to change my life completely, and I don’t know how I’m going to manage all my finances.”"
"The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week. Earlier this month, the department reported that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression.  Job losses have hit virtually every industry, though some harder than others. Figures from the Department of Labor earlier this month showed the leisure and hospitality industry was the hardest-hit, with 4.8 million jobs lost – nearly a 40% unemployment rate – as traveling came to a halt with shutdown measures. Millions of education and health services, retail and manufacturing jobs were also cut.  Even months after shutdown orders were put in place, the reported unemployment figures may not show a complete picture of how many people were laid off due to the crisis. Many states are still trying to work through backlogs of thousands of applications as antiquated online systems struggle to keep up with the number of applicants. Oregon, for example, announced this week that it is still trying to process 38,000 unemployment claims. At the end of April, only a third of claims in Hawaii, a state that relies heavily on its tourism industry, had been processed.  After Jazz Salm was laid off from her job as a server at Chile’s, she immediately got onto Florida’s unemployment system to file her claim. It took her about a week to get through the system since the website kept crashing. When she was finally able to submit her claim, it took another month until she started receiving payments. During that month, Salm, who lives in Sarasota, had no idea what the status of her application was. Having just used her savings to move in February, Salm was left without money to pay her bills or even buy groceries until payments came in. “I think the government just needs to realize that we just want to be heard,” Salm said. “It all comes down to acknowledgement that us little people – you know, what are we supposed to do? We’re stuck.” Over the last few weeks, all 50 states have begun some type of reopening measures, bringing hope that the economy will revive as people start going back to work. But it is unclear what effect the measures have had on unemployment.  The majority of the 20 million Americans – about 78% – who filed for unemployment in April indicated they were temporarily laid off, meaning they expected to be called back to their jobs after the pandemic. But many businesses that have reopened are operating with far-from-normal procedures, like social distancing in dine-in restaurants and movie theaters, that mean foot traffic is still down compared with pre-shutdown times. Many local businesses have had to shutter permanently, probably leaving tens of thousands of Americans unemployed indefinitely."
"More than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the last 10 weeks – a number of jobless the US has not seen since the Great Depression.  The economic impacts of Covid-19 have been far and wide, hurting virtually every industry and leaving tens of millions of people without paychecks to pay the bills. Here are the key numbers that tell the story of the masses of unemployed workers, and the devastating economic impact the crisis has had.  The Department of Labor releases the latest national unemployment rate at the beginning of each month. In the figures for April, which was released earlier in May, the rate was 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While many states have begun gradual reopening processes, the figure only represents those whose claims were filed up until mid-April. Millions more have filed claims since then, though we will not know how that has affected the unemployment rate until May’s figures are released in early June. Economists have long known that black and Hispanic Americans are the most vulnerable during economic recessions, and while many workers of color are in essential jobs, the Covid-19 economic crisis has proved no different. Even at its lowest, the black unemployment rate is typically double that of white unemployment, with Hispanic unemployment not too far behind. Experts say job segregation pushes black and Hispanic workers into low-paying industries, like hospitality, that come with little to no benefits and have been hit hardest. Though women make up a smaller percentage of the working population, a slight majority of people who were laid off in the last few months are women. At the beginning of May, the Department of Labor reported nearly 11.5 million women had lost jobs, compared with about 11 million men. This is no coincidence given that the industries that have been hardest-hit by shutdown orders, hospitality and leisure, education and healthcare, employ more women than others. Last month’s Department of Labor figures confirmed that the leisure and hospitality industry has been the hardest-hit by the economic downturn. About 4.8 million workers, the highest of any industry have lost their jobs in the industry. Nevada’s unemployment rate is the highest of any state at 28.2%, meaning one in four people in the state of 3 million was unemployed in April. Nevada’s economy relies heavily on tourism, which brought in $67.6bn in 2018. Michigan and Hawaii had the second and third highest rates with 22.7% and 22.3% unemployment, respectively. Pre-pandemic, the average unemployment insurance check was about $380. But because each state is in charge of its own unemployment system, and sets the amount that is given in unemployment insurance, it varies widely. Some states give about a fifth of a person’s paycheck while others give half or more. To compensate for the widespread differences, those who successfully file for unemployment are given an extra $600 a week through the end of July with money Congress set aside in its massive coronavirus stimulus package in March. While this means some are still barely making ends meet, others are getting more than they were getting in the jobs they were laid off from. Between 29 March and 4 April, 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment, a staggering number that signaled the true depths of the economic crisis. An analysis by the Brookings Institution found one in five households in the US were deemed food insecure by the end of April. Food banks have seen shortages in light of increased demand as millions of families struggle to pay for groceries. The analysis found the situation is worse for families with children: two in five households with mothers and children under the age of 12 are food insecure. In its latest stimulus package, Congress included a federal program that allows self-employed workers and contractors to receive unemployment benefits. In its unemployment report last week, the Department of Labor said that 6.1 million Americans who classify as self-employed were receiving unemployment insurance.  In remarks given on 13 May, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, delivered a shocking statistic from a Fed survey: 40% of households making under $40,000 a year lost a job in March. “This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words,” Powell said."
"Sandra Rivera Del Valle, a cabin cleaner with airline contractor Eulen America at Orlando airport in Florida, started experiencing cold-like symptoms on 13 March. As a cancer survivor over the age of 60, she was advised by her doctor to quarantine for two weeks as a precaution, as she was unable to get tested for Covid-19.  After taking two weeks off of work, unpaid, Del Valle’s supervisor then told her she had been laid off – and would have to reapply for her job.  Suddenly, she was staring economic ruin in the face. “I started getting very anxious about where I was going to get money. I maintain a household with my daughter and father. I don’t have a way to pay my bills. I don’t know how I’ll survive from now on because I don’t have a job,” said Rivera Del Valle. “I feel like I’m going crazy because I don’t know how I’m going to pay rent, buy food, pay the electric bill or my car.”  She is hardly alone. More than 40 million Americans have now filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus pandemic began, and triggered widespread economic shutdowns that have brought havoc to the American economy. Across the US, it has been a devastating blow for individuals, families and communities, as stores have closed, factories have ceased production and household names such as Hertz and Macy’s have filed for bankruptcy. Theirs are stories of lives put on hold; of finding themselves on the edge of poverty; of not making the rent; and where putting food on the table suddenly becomes a question, not a certainty.  For Rivera Del Valle, it means she can no longer afford her health insurance premiums, and the Florida unemployment benefits website has not been accessible for her to use. She filed an application for unemployment benefits by mail, but has yet to receive any money.  Tens of thousands of workers around the US have found themselves in similar circumstances as they seek to access the benefits they now desperately need. They are still navigating overwhelmed state agency systems in order to complete their claim applications, or struggling with the lack of options because they are deemed ineligible to obtain benefits.  Though parts of the US economy have begun to reopen with lockdown restrictions being eased, US unemployment is expected to continue to climb through June 2020. In a recent interview, the White House economic adviser Ken Bassett forecast the unemployment rate will climb to over 20% through June, with double-digit US unemployment rates possible through November. Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley said the high unemployment rate is likely to have a long-term effect on US workers beyond the next few months.  “Some workers who were let go will be able to return to their original jobs; a few others will find new jobs. [But] unemployment for the vast majority is likely to last longer than the current maximum duration of unemployment benefits. These need to be extended beyond the standard 26 weeks to 52 and even 99 weeks, as they were during the Great Recession,” said Reich. Workers in formerly booming sectors like travel and leisure, such as Adriana Castillo, a driver for airlines catering contractor LSG Sky Chefs at O’Hare in Chicago, are currently struggling with concerns over returning to work.  Castillo tested positive for coronavirus on 16 April, but she has been out of work sick since the end of March. Because her job is deemed essential, she has been unable to file for unemployment benefits, and only received 24 hours of paid sick leave. “I don’t have income. I don’t know how to pay my mortgage next month. I don’t have money for food, bills, utilities. I’m upset and scared,” said Castillo. “Right now I’m still sick. My coughing isn’t ending after weeks, and I’m scared to go back to work because they don’t clean the kitchen and they don’t practice social distancing.”  [Update: After publication of this article, LSG Sky Chefs said in a statement that the company’s Covid-19 safety measures included enhanced disinfecting regimes, staff training and provision of masks for anyone in need of one.] In Buffalo, New York, Jill Slomba has been out of work from her two jobs as a dental hygienist and third job as a bartender since 17 March, but has struggled to get in touch with an unemployment claims specialist to complete her claim. After seven weeks, she finally was able to speak to someone only to find out the agency did not have her complete employment records.  “I just uploaded my W2 form, so hopefully in a few days it will go through,” said Slomba. “Also, the system locked me out when I tried to sign up for direct deposit, saying I spelled my mother’s maiden name incorrectly. But I didn’t.” Shelly Suit, a convenience store cashier in Martinsburg, West Virginia, filed for unemployment benefits and was approved on 19 March, but has still not received benefits. She’s now racking up credit-card debt. “I have been putting everything on credit cards with the assumption that by the time I got the bills I would have the benefit payments to pay,” said Suit. “I had to put my mortgage on deferral. I don’t know how I am going to pay it when it comes due.”"
"McDonald’s will reopen all of its 1,000 restaurants in the UK and Ireland for drive-through or delivery by 4 June, as it returns to trading after the coronavirus shutdown. The fast food chain reopened 33 of its drive-throughs in south-east England last week as a trial and it is now expanding the programme to every drive-through branch, alongside an expansion of its delivery service at sites that do not serve drivers. McDonald’s said all remaining branches would reopen between Tuesday and Thursday next week. It will announce which Golden Arches branch is reopening only on the morning that service is resuming in order to manage demand. The burger chain is trying to avoid a repeat of its experience in France and Switzerland, where advance notice of drive-through reopenings led to queues of up to seven hours in some locations. The company said it was working with local authorities and police in the run-up to the reopenings in the UK and Ireland after almost two months’ closure. McDonald’s, along with its competitors Burger King, KFC and Nando’s, have been trialling phased reopenings of their restaurants, with increased safety measures. Staff at McDonald’s are protected from customers by perspex screens installed at the drive-through windows, and from their colleagues inside the restaurant’s kitchens. The company has introduced physical distancing inside the restaurants, including floor markings in each branch. Each worker has their temperature checked with a contactless thermometer when they arrive for a shift, and is given protective equipment including masks and gloves. Once reopened, the McDonald’s branches will continue to offer a limited menu, which does not include breakfast, owing to smaller teams working in each location. Customers are asked to use contactless payment methods if possible and spending is capped at £25 per vehicle. The company expects high demand and has asked customers to give “patience and support” to its workers as they continue to adjust to new ways of working. A McDonald’s spokesperson said: “Over the last fortnight, our employees, franchisees and suppliers have worked tirelessly to implement new procedures to enable safe working so that we can now help all parts of the UK and Ireland to enjoy the return of the Big Mac.” Restaurants and pubs in the UK were closed from 24 March under the government lockdown but were allowed to prepare food for collection or delivery, with many providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers. As restrictions are eased, several chains have been gradually reopening locations.Burger King is reopening about 20 restaurants a week until its entire UK chain is open, and aims to have at least one open in every city by the end of May. Nando’s has reopened 94 of its restaurants for delivery and click and collect across the UK and Ireland, and is also operating a reduced menu. The company says PPE is available for staff to wear, and designated waiting areas have been set up for delivery drivers and customers collecting orders."
"An effective track-and-trace system to prevent a second coronavirus peak will not only save lives, it could reduce the number of working hours lost to illness by as much as 50%, according to a major global study. The International Labour Organisation said the effective testing and tracing of infections was essential if employers wanted staff to return to work and for them to stay healthy. The Geneva-based, United Nations body estimates that working hour losses can be reduced from about 14% in countries that put in place weak track-and-trace systems down to 7% in countries with the “highest intensity of tracking and tracing”. On the day before England introduces a testing and tracing scheme to prevent a second peak of the virus, the ILO said an effective system was needed or employers and workers would miss out on much of the benefit of returning to work. If workers remained wary about the health threats of returning to work, it would leave many vulnerable people excluded and exposed to the threat of redundancy. “Creating an employment-rich recovery that also promotes equity and sustainability means getting people and enterprises working again as soon as possible, in safe conditions,” said the ILO’s director general, Guy Ryder. “Testing and tracing can be an important part of the policy package if we are to fight fear, reduce risk and get our economies and societies moving again quickly.” According to the ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work, 4th edition: “A track and test and trace system reduces reliance on strict confinement measures; promotes the public confidence and so encourages consumption and supports employment; and helps minimise operational disruption at the workplace.”It added: “Testing and tracing can itself create new jobs, even if temporary, which can be targeted towards youth and other priority groups.” Countries with an effective testing and tracing programme, such as South Korea, tended to have lower duration and severity of confinement and lockdown measures, which reduces the economic toll of these measures, the study said. The report also found that young people were being disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and the “substantial and rapid” increase in youth unemployment since February was affecting young women more than young men.“The pandemic is inflicting a triple shock on young people. Not only is it destroying their employment, but it is also disrupting education and training, and placing major obstacles in the way of those seeking to enter the labour market or to move between jobs,” the report said. Ryder added: “The Covid-19 economic crisis is hitting young people – especially women – harder and faster than any other group. If we do not take significant and immediate action to improve their situation, the legacy of the virus could be with us for decades. If their talent and energy is side-lined by a lack of opportunity or skills it will damage all our futures and make it much more difficult to rebuild a better, post-Covid economy.”"
"John Lewis is to begin its phased return to high street shopping by reopening two stores in Poole and Kingston upon Thames on 15 June, followed by 11 more three days later. The retailer said it would open more depending on the response from shoppers to the initial wave. The first stores to open are a full department store in Kingston, in south-west London, while the Poole store on the south coast is one of John Lewis’s smaller “at home” outlets, selling furnishings and homewares but not clothing. The plans emerged after the government gave the green light for “non-essential” retailers – including clothes stores, booksellers and toy shops – to reopen from 15 June, two weeks later than hoped. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will be able to open from 1 June. Safety measures in place at the John Lewis stores will include limits on shopper numbers, protective screens at tills and the closure of cafes and fitting rooms, in line with government guidance. Other measures being considered include virtual queueing systems, drop boxes for returned goods and enabling the collection of online orders in stores’ car parks. Kingston and Poole. Bluewater, Cambridge, Cheadle, Cheltenham, High Wycombe, Horsham, Ipswich, Norwich, Nottingham, Solihull and Welwyn."
"BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, will lodge multiple votes against ExxonMobil at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday as it flags concern over the oil company’s failure to make progress on its climate change targets. BlackRock will vote against the re-election of two directors and in favour of a shareholder motion that proposes splitting the role of chief executive and chairman. The US investment firm is ExxonMobil’s second largest shareholder, with a stake of almost 5% in the company. It will not back the re-election of Angela Braly, the chair of Exxon’s public issues and contributions committee, nor that of Kenneth Frazier, the board’s lead independent director. The shareholder motion it will back proposes creating separate chief executive and chairman roles once the incumbent, Darren Woods, steps down. Two US shareholder advisory firms have recommended to investors that they back the proposal, arguing that having a CEO who also leads the board can create a potential conflict of interest and lack of independence among a company’s directors. BlackRock declined to comment. In April the Church of England’s investment arm, the Church Commissioners, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund wrote a joint letter to fellow ExxonMobil investors asking them to vote against the re-election of the company’s entire board. “As the world, ExxonMobil’s peers and investors confront the climate emergency, ExxonMobil is carrying on as if nothing has changed,” the letter said. “It is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil’s inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a specific failure of independent directors to oversee management.” BlackRock manages assets worth $6.9tn (£5.3tn), including large holdings in oil producers such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil. It announced at the start of the year that it would divest from holdings related to thermal coal and would focus on sustainability when making investment decisions. The firm has joined Climate Action 100+, an influential pressure group calling for the biggest polluters to reduce their emissions. BlackRock’s chief executive, Larry Fink, wrote in his annual letter to chief executives in January that financial markets had been slower to reflect the threat to economic growth posed by the climate crisis, and added that the firm would vote against companies that were not making progress. “Where we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues, we will hold board members accountable,” Fink wrote. Environmental campaigners have previously accused BlackRock of hypocrisy for routinely voting against shareholder motions directing boards to take action on the climate crisis. Fink wrote in his letter that the firm preferred to vote against individual directors at annual shareholder meetings, a strategy it is pursuing at ExxonMobil’s AGM. “Last year BlackRock voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies,” Fink wrote. A blogpost written by ExxonMobil’s vice-president of investor relations, Stephen Littleton, and published on the company’s website this month called the statements from the Church of England and the New York State Common Retirement Fund “misleading”. The oil firm said it had been expanding its shareholder engagement, and it directed investors to a report on “how we are working to reduce emissions in our operations through efficiency gains and new technologies”. ExxonMobil, like other oil firms, has had a tumultuous few months, seeing a slump in its share price and recording a $610m (£495m) loss in the first quarter of the year after demand for oil slid to the lowest level in 25 years."
"Boohoo has defended its accounting practices after criticism by an investor known as the “Dark Destroyer” hit the online fashion specialist’s share price. The ShadowFall hedge fund led by Matthew Earl, a specialist in taking positions that bet against a company’s share price, issued a 54-page report accusing Boohoo of misleading investors about profits and cashflow. The report also claims that a recent £200m fundraising effort by Boohoo could be handed over in dividends or buyout costs to Umar Kamani, the son of Boohoo’s chairman and co-founder, Mahmud Kamani, who owns about a third of the group’s Pretty Little Thing (PTL) brand. ShadowFall also suggests the funds could be used to buy up I Saw it First, an online fashion business set up by Jamal Kamani, the chairman’s brother. The report, published on Tuesday, claimed that an option to buy out a remaining stake in the PLT site could cost Boohoo nearly £1bn, and raised concerns about the presentation of profits and cashflow relating to PLT, which it said inflated the brand’s value. Boohoo paid £3.7m to buy a 66% stake in PLT in 2016. Boohoo said on Wednesday it “strongly refutes” the allegations made by ShadowFall. Shares in the company, which fell nearly 6% yesterday on news of the intervention, fell a further 4.5% on Wednesday. The company said it intended to use the proceeds of its share placing “to take advantage of numerous opportunities that are likely to emerge in the global fashion industry over the coming months, particularly following the disruption caused by the onset of Covid-19”. It said it was reviewing a number of possible opportunities. Boohoo denied it had understated costs incurred by PLT and thereby overstated the brand’s profitability. It said the group had not inflated PLT’s contribution to profits in its accounts but said it had added all the brand’s profits to one measure of the group’s profits – adjusted profit after tax – “to allow its shareholders and readers of the accounts to fully understand PLT’s underlying profitability”. Analysts downplayed ShadowFall’s allegations saying that most professional investors and analysts would not have been confused by Boohoo’s presentation of cashflow and profits. Eleonora Dani, a retail analyst at Stifel, said ShadowFall had a “fair point” in questioning the valuation at which the remaining 33% of PLT could be bought in 2022. But said it was “hard to prove” the practices ShadowFall alleged Boohoo had used to artificially inflate PLT profit and potential value. “We think the report raised fair points but missed the mark in identifying underlying business issues to justify a short position. PLT has complemented Boohoo’s portfolio and created a healthy internal competition with its other brands,” she wrote in a note. Analysts at City stockbroker Numis said: “We don’t believe this report brings to light any new information that should give cause for concern.” They added that it was highly unlikely Boohoo’s chairman would want to acquire his brother’s business."
"Corner shops and independent grocery stores have reported a 63% surge in trade as shoppers turn to local outlets during the coronavirus crisis. Sales at independently owned retailers, many of which trade under brand names such as Spar, Londis and Budgens, soared by more than double the pace of the fastest growing grocery chain, the Co-op, in the three months to 17 May, according to grocery market data from the analysts Kantar.  The latest grocery industry figures show a marked change in behaviour by shoppers during the high street lockdown, with small local shops benefiting alongside online retailers. Online grocery sales leapt 75% in the last month of the period. Nearly one in five households bought their weekly shop online. Digitally ordered groceries represent 11.5% of the market – up from about 7% before the pandemic hit. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said more shoppers – 1.6 million – had switched to buying groceries online so far this year than in the previous five years. “While the gains made by online shopping are unlikely to be sustained at these levels, the crisis has certainly accelerated the move towards online,” he said. “The grocers have attracted a new group of customers, in particular older demographics, and we expect some of them may continue using online services and enjoying the convenience that home delivery provides.” He added that takeaway deliveries were also soaring – up 250% year on year. The closure of restaurants, cafes, workplace canteens and – until recently – most takeaways has led to a surge in demand for groceries as families cook more at home. Total grocery sales rose 14.3% during the three-month period, the fastest rate since 1994. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and the Co-op all achieved faster growth than the discount chain Aldi, which has led the market with the fellow German chain Lidl for several years. As a result, Aldi lost market share for the first time in almost a decade, according to Kantar. The 75th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May was the biggest shopping day of the month, when £488m was spent on groceries as families stocked up for bank holiday barbecues. With plans for the reopening of cafes and restaurants still uncertain, Kantar has predicted that sales of groceries could rise by 12% over the course of 2020 as a whole. However, McKevitt said it was not all good news for the supermarkets. The figures do not include spending on takeaway sandwiches, drinks and other “on-the-go” foods sold by supermarkets, which usually add up to £1bn of sales over the three-month period. Sales of those items have sunk as commuting has been replaced by working from home or being furloughed. “While these are bumper figures, it remains true that the overall picture for some grocers will be less positive as supermarkets continue to feel the impact of a considerable reduction in on-the-go spend on meals, drinks and snacks,” he said."
"Halfords is to fully reopen 53 stores after a successful trial of physical-distancing measures on its shop floors. The bike and car parts retailer said the reopenings follow successful tests at its Peterborough and Bristol Cribbs Causeway stores. It will be the first time Halfords customers will be allowed in store since the UK lockdown started on 23 March.  Among the sites reopening are Gloucester, Huddersfield, Inverness and North Shields. A number of the stores opened over the bank holiday weekend and all 53 will be open by Friday. The distancing measures being implemented include queueing marshals outside stores, “sneeze screens” for shoppers and staff, and customers being asked not to handle or try on products. The decision comes a day after the government said most non-essential retailers could reopen from 15 June. “We are pleased to be in a position to start letting our customers back into our stores,” said Graham Stapleton, the chief executive of Halfords. “However, we are going to be reopening them to our customers gradually and cautiously in order to be absolutely certain that our colleagues and customers have a safe environment in which to work and shop.” In March, bike shops were designated an essential service under the government’s coronavirus control measures. Halfords has been operating 335 of its 446 retail shops under a “dark store” model during the lockdown, meaning customers have been unable to browse and instead have been placing orders with Halfords staff outside the front of the store. “There has been a big surge in demand for our bike products and services as people have taken to cycling during the lockdown, both for commuting and for fun,” Stapleton said. “We are anticipating a similar level of demand for our motoring products and services in the competing days, as people begin to use vehicles again that in some cases will have been off the road for many weeks.” In addition to its retail stores, Halfords has 346 of its 373 garages, and 77 vans, operating under a contactless model.

"The luxury carmaker Aston Martin has confirmed it has sacked its chief executive Andy Palmer as part of a wider board overhaul, following a collapse in its share price and a slump in sales because of the coronavirus pandemic. Palmer’s replacement, Tobias Moers, will join on 1 August from Mercedes-AMG, where he is the boss of the German carmaker’s high-performance division. Palmer had served as Aston Martin’s chief executive since 2014, and the company confirmed his departure after reports over the weekend. Palmer left the company on Monday. Its share price collapsed 98% from its £19 float price in October 2018 to just 35p on Friday, giving it a market value of about £540m, compared with £4bn when it floated. Aston Martin’s shares jumped 28% to 45p on Tuesday after Palmer’s departure was announced. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets.com, said the reaction from investors was “a pretty damning indictment of his tenure that the shares jumped this much after news of his sacking.” He added: “Aston Martin has been one of the worst stock listings in living memory. Things had already got pretty horrendous before this year; the coronavirus outbreak has been the coup de grace.” Lawrence Stroll, a billionaire who became the executive chair of Aston Martin after leading a £536m rescue deal in March, said: “The board has determined that now is the time for new leadership to deliver our plans. On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Andy for his hard work, personal commitment and dedication to Aston Martin Lagonda since 2014.” The company’s chief manufacturing operations officer, Keith Stanton, will oversee operations until Moers takes up the top job. The change at the top comes after a difficult few months at Aston Martin. The British company, best known as the maker of James Bond’s cars, came close to going bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history. Over the weekend, Palmer told the Financial Timesthat he was unaware he was due to be sacked and declined to comment further. In the company statement to the stock exchange on Tuesday, Palmer said: “It has been a privilege to serve Aston Martin Lagonda for almost six years. The launch of many new products including the new DBX demonstrates the dedication and capability of our employees. “I would like to thank my management team and all the staff for their hard work and support, particularly during the challenges presented by Covid-19.” The company said it had not yet finalised Palmer’s “termination arrangements”. His £1.2m salary, plus an additional £153,000 in pension contributions and benefits, had been previously criticised by investors who were disappointed by the company’s performance. Palmer’s potential bonus and share awards were worth £6m annually if certain targets were met, although he did not receive a bonus for 2019. At the time of the company’s stock-market listing, Palmer received 3.27m shares worth £62.2m at the float price of £19 per share. He immediately sold £29.2m worth of shares to settle tax and national insurance due, and was allowed by the company to sell a further £6.6m of shares and keep the proceeds. Aston Martin also announced the appointment of Peter Espenhahn as chair of the audit and risk committee and Lord Carrington as chair of the remuneration committee. Stroll agreed in recent weeks to inject more than £75m in short-term funding to enable the company to fight off a cash crunch as it battled stock market turmoil. The carmaker has been further hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced it to close 90% of its dealerships around the world and caused its sales to plunge. Earlier this month, Aston Martin reported a loss of £119m for the first quarter of the year, which pushed its shares to a record low.  The company said Moers had a track record of turning businesses around and Stroll added: “He is the right leader for Aston Martin Lagonda as we implement our strategy for the business to achieve its full potential.” Aston Martin, like other European carmakers, was forced to stop production for several weeks because of the coronavirus crisis. It closed its two factories at its main site at Gaydon in Warwickshire and its facility at St Athan in south Wales, which had been preparing to start production of its DBX SUV."
"Global financial markets have rallied on rising hopes for a coronavirus vaccine and a smooth recovery for the world economy as governments gradually ease lockdown restrictions. In the UK the FTSE 100 rose by 1.2% or 74 points as countries around the world begin the lengthy task of reopening their economies as the health emergency shows signs of gradually easing. Airline company stocks, holiday firms, pubs and cinema groups were among the biggest risers on London’s stock market on Tuesday, after Boris Johnson signalled plans to further lift restrictions on high street shops from next week. Shares on Wall Street were up more than 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 600 points, hitting more than 25,000 in early afternoon trading in New York as investors bet on a swift global rebound from the Covid-19 crisis. The S&P 500 index of leading American company shares rose above 3,000 for the first time since March, as stocks gradually regain ground lost during the sharpest market crash in a generation suffered at the onset of the pandemic. Investors in the London stock market were boosted by the prime minister setting out a timeline for the reopening of outdoor markets and car showrooms in England from 1 June. High street shops, department stores and shopping centres will all be allowed to open from 15 June as long as they can show they are “Covid secure”, the prime minister said on Monday. Analysts said updates from pharmaceutical companies working to develop Covid-19 vaccines were also encouraging investors to push share prices higher, despite the extensive economic damage caused by lockdown controls and fears that no vaccine will be found. Shares in US biotech group Novavax rose more than 17% after it announced it had joined the race to test vaccine candidates on humans and enrolled its first participants. Shares in the drug company Merck also rose after it announced plans to develop two separate vaccines. However, there were warnings financial markets were failing to reflect the unfolding economic damage and risk of a slow and lengthy recovery from what is expected to be the worst recession in living memory. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the trading platform IG, said: “Once again there is a feeling that traders are wearing blinkers as we head higher. “As stock markets continue to close the gap created by this crisis, questions over quite when this rebound will end become more prominent than ever.” The prime minister’s move to reboot the retails sector comes as world leaders announce tentative steps to lift tough controls on business and social life that had been used to limit the spread of Covid-19 but also brought the world economy to an effective standstill. Japan has formally exited its national state of emergency, while Germany is moving to ease travel restrictions from mid-June. Airline and hotel companies, among the hardest-hit companies as the Covid-19 emergency brought global travel to a standstill, were the best UK performers , as British Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) soared 22% and budget carrier EasyJet rose 19%. Whitbread, the pubs group and owner of the Premier Inn chain, rose 10%. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce  climbed 12%, while cruise operator Carnival was 13% higher. Alongside the gains on the leading index of UK company shares, the more UK-focused FTSE 250 index closed up by more than 3%. Europe’s largest travel group Tui, which has also received a German state bailout, surged 52%, and pubs group Mitchells & Butler jumped 26%. Cineworld gained 19%. European shares hit an 11-week high, with investor sentiment also boosted by Germany’s €9bn (£8bn) bailout of the Lufthansa airline. “Travel and airlines stocks have had a pretty decent day on the back of a combination over the planned reopening of European holiday destinations sometime in July, as well as yesterday’s reports that German national carrier Lufthansa is on the brink of a controversial €9bn bailout from the German government,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Retailers were also among the gainers on Tuesday, with clothing chains JD Sports up 10% and Next up 5%. However, a continuing stock market rally depends on whether lockdown measures can be further eased, said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell: “Another key unknown is the extent to which a period in effective quarantine has affected consumer behaviour. This could take longer to become apparent.”"
"The governor of the Reserve Bank has warned the government the jobkeeper program may need to be kept going beyond its current cut-off date to avoid the Australian economy falling off a cliff. Statements made by the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman, Wayne Byres, about the risk of economic collapse when the jobkeeper program expires at the end of September will increase pressure on the Morrison government to defy a ginger group of Coalition backbenchers and extend stimulus into the new year. Appearing on Thursday before a Senate inquiry into the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis, Lowe said it was “too early” to say what the economy would look like in four months’ time. “But if we have not come out of the current trough in economic activity, there will be, and there should be, a debate about how the jobkeeper program transitions into something else, whether it’s extended for specific industries, or somehow tapered,” he said. “I think it’s very important we don’t withdraw the fiscal stimulus too early.” Lowe said the economy was performing slightly better than previously thought, but jobless numbers in the hundreds of thousands were still shocking. He said sectors hardest hit by the initial coronavirus shutdown, such as hospitality and retail, were showing signs of recovery but the pipeline of work in other areas such as construction and professional services that have so far kept going was beginning to dry up. The RBA had earlier predicted a 20% fall in hours worked by employees across the economy, but Lowe said this had now been revised to 15% – still a “staggering” fall. “We will see further declines in jobs,” he said. “They will not be as stark as the declines we saw in April. I think the worst of it was the period up until mid- to late-April. Since then, there has been some stabilisation.” Byres told the committee that $60bn in loans had been approved under a scheme that deferred repayments on small business borrowing for six months. Half of the loans are guaranteed by the government and half by the banks. Banks have also deferred repayments on $250bn in other loans, mostly residential mortgages, Byres said. Asked by the Labor senator Murray Watt what the risk to banks and the economy was when deferral schemes all ended at the same time, Byres said it was hard to tell. “We often talk about the cliff, when everything ends in six months’ time. No one has an interest in going off the cliff, so we have to work out what the next phase will be. I think the risks are there whether the loan deferral schemes end or not.” The health minister, Greg Hunt, said that there would be a review of the jobkeeper program next month and would not “try to foretell or foresee the future”. “But the prime minister has said that all of these measures are temporary measures to get Australia through,” he said. “That principle remains the case. The review is something where he’ll be looking at the needs.” The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the “sudden withdrawal of support for the economy in the last week of September makes no sense at all”. “The Morrison government’s lack of a plan for the months and years ahead means the downturn will be deeper than necessary, the unemployment queues longer, and the recovery more difficult,” he said. “The less done to protect jobs and support vulnerable workers, business and communities in the coming months, the harder and longer the recovery will be.”"
"The historic decline in jobs and incomes as a result of Covid-19 and associated restrictions may have come to a halt in May, according to a new ANU study. The ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods found that – with dramatically improved health results and easing restrictions – employment has levelled out at 58% and average hours worked actually increased from 32.3 per week to 32.8 in May. Despite improvements in wellbeing and job prospects, the study warns more than half of Australians are still anxious about Covid-19, almost a third think it is very likely they will be infected in the next six months and more than a third of the population are lonely at least some of the time. The ANU’s longitudinal survey of more than 3,200 Australians predicted a loss of 670,000 jobs in April – close to the official figure of 600,000 lost jobs measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics heralding the largest contraction since the Great Depression. The latest edition of the survey, conducted on 12 May, just days after restrictions began to ease, found the employment rate had arrested its decline, nudging down slightly from 58.3% to 58%. The report’s co-author, Nicholas Biddle, said “the fact that employment outcomes have not continued to worsen appears to have translated into a significantly more positive outlook for the future within the Australian workforce”. People expecting to lose their jobs over the next 12 months fell from 24.4% in April to 20.6% in May. The proportion who thought there was no chance they would lose their job rose from 34.6% in April to 39.2% in May. Household after-tax weekly income has also slightly improved, increasing from $1,622 in April to $1,652 in May. Australians in the lowest household income bracket continued to enjoy the greatest percentage gains, with the lowest decile experiencing a 39% pay boost from February to May in large part due to jobkeeper wage subsidies and the doubling of the jobseeker unemployment benefit. On Thursday the Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, warned against withdrawing these payments too early, telling the Senate Covid-19 committee that “if the labour market is not improving we will need to keep the fiscal support, some way or other”. Although unemployment sits at 6.2%, the Treasury believes the figure is in line with estimates of 10% unemployment once those who stopped searching for work due to restrictions are factored in. Scott Morrison has insisted that fiscal supports are temporary – even likening them to “medication” the economy should not become accustomed to – although the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has left the door open to “further support” to the hardest hit industries, such as tourism. Labor has warned against withdrawing economic supports too soon and called for jobkeeper to be extended, although the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, believes the $1,100 fortnightly rate of jobseeker should not continue, as it now sits higher than the aged pension. The ANU study found life satisfaction had declined from 6.98 out of 10 in January, to 6.51 in April, before bouncing back to 6.86 in May – “almost back to what it was prior to the spread of Covid-19”, according to the report’s co-author, Matthew Gray. Fewer people reported being lonely at least some of the time, down from 45.5% in April to 35.8% in May. Overall Australians are less worried about the pandemic, with 57.4% saying they were worried or anxious as a consequence of Covid-19, down from 66.4% in April. “However, young people are still doing it tough,” Gray said. “Our analysis shows that 18- to 24-year olds still feel the most anxious about Covid-19. “In April 76.7% of them felt this way – the largest percentage of any age cohort in the country.”"
"Britain’s economy is on course for a shallower recession than feared after a series of surveys showed business activity has recovered at a modest rate, the Bank of England’s chief economist said. Andy Haldane said recent data was coming in “a shade better” than a scenario for the economy published by the Bank this month, but risks remained that the recovery could be slower as companies and consumers remained cautious. The Bank’s monetary policy committee warned this month that economic contraction in the second quarter of the year, which includes the period of the most severe lockdown, would be steep and lead to a 14% decline in 2020 overall. It said a rapid recovery should be expected next year, leading to its scenario being viewed as relatively rapid V-shaped. “This is perhaps still a V but perhaps a fairly lopsided V,” he said, referring to the shape of the economy’s downturn and recovery. “The risks to that probably … lie to the downside rather than the up and as I say, a rather more protracted recovery even than the one that I have mentioned.” Haldane’s recasting of the Bank’s outlook follows a poll of City economists last week that showed they view the downturn over the coming months as less severe than Bank policymakers. The median average of more than 70 economists surveyed forecast that Britain’s economy would contract 7.7% this year, then grow by 5.2% in 2021. This prediction came as IHS Markit said its composite index – measuring activity in the dominant services sector and in manufacturing – rose to 28.9 in May’s preliminary from 13.8 in April’s final reading, revealing a stronger bounce back in business confidence than earlier estimates. PMIs below 50 represent a decline in activity. Speaking at a CBI webinar on Tuesday, Haldane also played down the prospect of an emergency cut in interest rates to below zero as a way to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis. It followed comments last week by Bank of England governor that the central bank would consider pushing borrowing costs below zero if it considered that the policy would help businesses stay afloat. Haldane said the key factors for the Bank to consider were the consequences of negative interest rates for Britain’s banks and lenders, which would trigger a squeeze on margins, and how such a move would affect confidence in the broader economy. “Those are the aspects that we will look at. To be clear, reviewing and doing are different things, and currently we are in the review phase and have not reached a view remotely yet on the doing.”"
"During the coronavirus outbreak, deserted high streets across Britain have been one of the most potent reminders of the economic damage being inflicted by the health emergency. Retail accounts for about a third of consumer spending in Britain. With much of the high street closed and the economy slumping into the worst recession since 1706, Boris Johnson’s plan to reopen non-essential shops from 15 June is key to limiting the hit to jobs and growth. Such is the importance of consumption to the UK’s economic model, that overall household expenditure, which adds total retail spending together with bills, rent, mortgage payments and other outgoings, accounts for almost two-thirds of national output. About three million people work in retail, roughly one in 10 of all jobs in Britain, and it is the largest single private sector for employment. Millions more working in public transport, warehouses, restaurants and elsewhere depend on the high street and online sales to thrive. Retailers have been battered during the lockdown period. Sales fell by almost a fifth in April as shoppers stayed at home, the biggest slump since records began in the late 1980s. Wiping out 15 years of growth, sales volumes fell back to their 2005 level. The impact, however, has not been uniform. While restaurants and pubs have closed, food sales have proven resilient and spending on alcohol has surged. Fashion retailers and departments stores have had their high street business completely wiped out, although online trade has risen from about a fifth of sales to almost a third. A rebound across the board will depend on consumer confidence in two things: their personal finances and whether they feel safe on the high street. With rising job losses, the continued risk of infection and mixed government messaging, reopening retail is no guarantee of rebound. Unemployment is expected to more than double by the summer as companies buckle. There are concerns job losses could rise further as the government scales back its furlough scheme. There are, though, some positive pointers. Household savings have been growing fast as those still earning have been forced to cut their spending on everything from travel and tourism to leisure and haircuts. And there are signs of pent-up demand after two months of confinement. Footfall on high streets and at retail parks over the bank holiday was up a third compared with the Easter weekend, according to the data tracker Springboard. But the fact is a summer spending spree is not expected. Fashion chains might open again but with many offices still shut, few social events on the horizon and pubs, clubs and restaurants still closed, few will be rushing to buy a new outfit. In China the government has been handing out retail vouchers to encourage shoppers back into the stores. Social distancing measures will be used to protect shoppers. But for some retailers that will push up costs and lead to shop closures and job losses. Shoe shops and clothes stores face some of the biggest challenges, as they will need to isolate stock every time an item is tried on. For many, buying new shoes and fashions may cease to be an enjoyable way to spend time. Britain’s retailers were struggling before Covid-19 struck, with the potential death of the high street a key issue at the 2019 election, after a wave of high-profile shop closures. According to the consultancy Retail Economics, pretax profit margins at the UK’s top 150 retailers have halved over the last decade, dented by the rising minimum wage and business rates. Since at least the 1960s, British households have increasingly spent on services and activities rather than objects, while the shift to online spending is presenting ever bigger challenges to bricks-and-mortar retailers. Weak wage growth since the 2008 crash, a lacklustre economic recovery and austerity cuts combined to dent the spending power of consumers. Brexit also threatens to disrupt supply chains and push up prices. Covid-19 is expected to exacerbate and magnify these trends. It threatens to compress changes that were expected over five years into a matter of months. Combined with the unfolding economic damage, continued lockdown measures elsewhere and the risk of infection, Johnson will need to do much more than simply hang an “open” sign on the British high street. "
"The British economy is showing the first signs of emerging from the worst of the economic damage triggered by the coronavirus pandemic but is heading for a longer and slower recovery than previously anticipated, according to a Guardian analysis. As the government gradually begins to lift controls on business and social life, economic developments in the past few weeks suggest the UK has now passed the moment of maximum damage for jobs and growth. However, writing in the Guardian, the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said Britain was entering the “second phase” of the crisis and warned the risks are “undoubtedly on the downside for a longer and harder recovery”. His intervention comes as the economic fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak is laid bare in a new Guardian project that will track the repercussions of the pandemic. We have chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to illustrate the state of the economy. With expectations of a synchronised global recession of the kind unseen since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch will also weigh how the UK is faring compared with other countries. Illustrating how Britain has reached a crossroads in the crisis after more than two months of harsh government restrictions, data combed from iPhone users’ searches on Apple Maps now points to the lockdown fraying at the edges. Although still significantly down from the start of the year, daily trips on Britain’s roads are gradually climbing. Economic activity should recover as more people leave their homes. Surveys of business activity suggest the low point for the UK economy probably came in April, during the first full-month of lockdown, with a slight improvement detected in May. Despite warnings that City investors are ignoring the outlook for jobs and risks to growth, global stock markets have rallied. However, the early results suggest companies are bracing for a protracted recovery as lockdown measures are only gradually lifted and consumer confidence takes time to return. Analysts have also warned the lack of a vaccine and continuing health risks will keep a lid on consumer demand, while a second wave of infections could force harsh new lockdown controls. The flash IHS Markit and Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply purchasing managers index – compiled from surveys of business activity – reveals a steeper pace of economic contraction than at the worst point of the global financial crisis has persisted in May. Firms told surveyors they expected customer demand to take a long time to recover. In a reflection of the scale of the damage and only tentative steps to lift controls, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has played down the chances of a swift bounce back. Pouring cold water on hopes of a V-shaped recovery, Sunak said last week that Britain faces a “severe recession, the likes of which we haven’t seen”. Official figures for growth from the Office for National Statistics, which come with a six-week time lag, revealed that GDP – the broadest measure of economic activity – plunged by 5.8% in March, despite only accounting for nine days of lockdown. In the first official signs of the damage to come, retail sales in April plunged by almost a fifth. The Bank has also warned that GDP could contract by 25% in the second quarter, putting the country on course for the worst economic slump in three centuries. Faced with a lengthy recovery and gradual easing of lockdown after Boris Johnson announced non-essential shops could reopen from the middle of June, business groups have called on ministers to maintain the emergency financial support unveiled in March to smooth Britain’s economic reboot. A third of the British workforce is now receiving government wage subsidies, with more than 8m jobs protected on the Treasury furlough scheme and more than 2 million self-employed people claiming grants for lost profits. However, in the coming days Sunak is expected to unveil steps to scale back the support from August given the spiralling price tag attached to the support schemes. Government borrowing surged by £62bn in April, more than was previously anticipated for the whole of 2020-21. Experts have warned that focusing on the deficit and slashing the support too soon could choke off the economic recovery and trigger more job losses. Despite the furlough scheme, millions of people are slipping through the safety net. Unemployment is expected to more than double this summer after the number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by almost 70% in April, the most since records began, to reach 2.1 million."
"Many retailers given the go-ahead to reopen next month will face a “fight for survival” in the coming months, as they try to restore their fortunes with tough new physical distancing and health and safety requirements, a senior retail executive has warned. Clothes shops, toy stores, electronics retailers and booksellers were on Monday given the green light to get back to business on 15 June. The date was two weeks later than most retailers had anticipated. Other high street businesses allowed to reopen on that date include indoor markets, shoe shops, tailors, auction houses and photography studios. Outdoor non-food markets and car showrooms will be allowed to open from 1 June. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents high street stores, said the lockdown had cost non-food shops £1.8bn in lost sales each week and many retailers would not bounce back. Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said shop groups were looking forward to reopening, but added: “With sales expected to remain weak, even as shops begin to reopen, many retailers will still be in a fight for survival.” Chris Wootton, the finance director at Mike Ashley’s Frasers group, which runs Sports Direct, told ITV News the extra fortnight of closure would spell the end for some stores: “It will definitely put some businesses out of business. I think if you are a retailer that is living on the edge of your credit line and you’ve basically got no cash left, every day is essential.” He blamed the Cummings scandal for the delay: “The government clearly said they were going to start phasing opening from the first of June if the science allowed them to. We actually think that the whole Dominic Cummings fiasco over the weekend has clearly made them hesitant to act decisively and made them more cautious.” Sofie Willmott, an analyst at research group GlobalData, said the unexpected two-week delay was another blow for retailers, especially fashion stores, which have been closed for almost 10 weeks and will now have two weeks less to clear summer stock. She said: “Stores being shut for a longer period than anticipated will add to the swathes of discounting we can expect when branches reopen. Clothing and footwear is set to be the sector hardest hit by Covid 19 with offline clothing and footwear spend set to plummet over 40% this year.” The government has provided substantial financial support to retailers, including business rates holidays, paying retailers’ staff through the furlough scheme, changing insolvency laws and urging landlords to do rent deals with under-pressure shop owners. Retailers are far from certain that shoppers will flock back to high streets after weeks of shopping from home. Many are nervous about bringing staff back from furlough on to their own payrolls. Many will therefore reopen outlets slowly, as they monitor the level of interest and test the safety measures. The New West End Company (NWEC), an alliance of central London retailers and hospitality businesses, said its shopping streets were likely to remain much quieter than usual because of continuing advice to avoid public transport and because about half of London’s West End trade usually comes from international and domestic tourists, who are unlikely to visit until the autumn at the earliest. Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of NWEC, said 70% of the area’s customers and workers usually arrived by public transport. He described the situation as “really challenging”. The area is working with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on measures such as additional cycle and car parking, bikes for hire and pavement widening to encourage visitors. A sharp increase in the number of people on the UK’s high streets over the bank holiday weekend suggests there could be significant pent-up demand. Even though most stores remain closed, high streets recorded a 49% leap in visitor numbers on bank holiday Monday compared with Easter Monday – the height of lockdown – according to shopper monitoring firm Springboard. Diane Wehrle, Springboard’s insights director, said she was optimistic there would be a rebound in consumer spending, but that the gloomy economic outlook meant any spending spree may not last long: “An anticipated spending spike could possibly be short-lived, as consumers will be cautious and looking at reining in their spend due to ongoing financial uncertainty in many UK households.” The retail trade union Usdaw urged retailers to work with the union to do thorough risk assessments, as required under the new rules, and ensure stores are safe for staff and customers.  Paddy Lillis, Usdaw’s general secretary, said: “Usdaw is concerned that businesses will pay little attention to government advice as they rush to reopen. The government must make it absolutely clear that a business can be closed down if they fail to comply.”"
"Greggs’ popular vegan sausage roll – and its bestselling meat equivalent – are to make a return next month, after the bakery chain revealed it is to reopen 800 stores across the UK from mid-June. The move follows a successful trial of the reopening of a handful of branches in the north-east this month, when Greggs tested safety measures put in place to protect staff and customers. The chain temporarily closed all its 2,050 stores on 24 March as lockdown restrictions came into force, even though the new government rules specified that kitchen areas could stay open for takeaway orders. It subsequently changed its mind about plans to reopen 20 of its locations, fearing that enthusiastic customers might gather in crowds. A Greggs spokeswoman said: “We have planned and delivered robust shop trials using our new operational safety measures and they have progressed well, allowing us to now move to open an increased number of our shops from mid-June.” It will be offering a slimmed-down menu, but its vegan sausage roll and longer-established pork version will feature, along with hot drinks. The UK’s fast food and coffee shop chains are accelerating their reopening plans now that the initial lockdown is gradually being eased. UK restaurants and pubs have been allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery in spite of the lockdown, with many providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers. McDonald’s has reopened 33 drive-through restaurants in London and south-east England with more to come in the north, while Burger King has reopened about 50 branches for drive-through and delivery. At the weekend KFC hit the milestone of 500 restaurant openings – more than half its 964-strong estate in the UK and Ireland, including 350 drive-through outlets. On Tuesday the chicken chain Nando’s announced the reopening of a further 54 outlets for delivery and click and collection across the UK and Ireland, with 40 more due to reopen on Wednesday. It had until now only reopened six for delivery orders in London and Manchester, and click-and-collect to customers at other sites including Belfast, Maidstone, Sevenoaks and Worcester. All delivery orders placed through the Nando’s website are eligible for reward points, which can be redeemed when the restaurants open their doors for a full dine-in service later in the year. The menu will be reduced to help the team maintain social distancing in the kitchen and food preparation areas, but Nando’s favourites such as peri-peri chicken wings, butterfly chicken, halloumi sticks and peri-peri chips will all be available to enjoy at home. Designated waiting areas have been set up for drivers and collect customers, and order volumes will be monitored to avoid queues building up. Subway has reopened 600 of its 2,600 sandwich stores across the UK and Ireland. The Leon chain, which remained open for takeaways and providing meals for NHS workers, has just reopened two of its busiest London restaurants, in Canary Wharf and London Bridge."
"For most businesses, the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic were an economic horror story measured in job losses and plummeting sales graphs. But this was not the case for everyone. As lockdown measures were imposed around the globe, certain companies struggled to cope with sudden demand from a confined populace with new, highly specific needs. So what was it like to be the focus of such frenzied consumer interest? How did they cope with self-isolating staff and faltering supply chains? And what are their hopes now the world is tentatively reopening? Here, five different companies reflect on their accidental boom. Polly Rodriguez, CEO and co-founder of Unbound, in New York  At the beginning of Covid-19, on 31 March, someone tweeted: “All my strongest soldiers on life support” with a video of all these vibrators charging. She tagged us, and it went viral; I think a million people watched it. Suddenly we had all this traffic. The second surge happened on 15 April, which, it so happens, was the day the US federal government gave a lot of people a cheque to get through the crisis. People had this discretionary income that they were spending on our products. From then we were at a new normal: sales were up by 150% compared with this time last year. This is usually our slowest time of year, because people are travelling and spending on vacations, but every day we’d wake up and say, “Are the numbers going to go down? Is this the day it ends?” It’s like being on a rollercoaster, thinking, it’s got to stop somewhere. And it honestly hasn’t. We have a stimulating lubricant that has sold really well – 8,500 units in three months – which is probably down to couples trying to make sex a little more interesting. I moved back to the Midwest to stay with my parents for a while, and my mom, dad and boyfriend had to help me get about 2,000 lubricants into packaging. Vibrators are our bestsellers – particularly Bender, a £55 dual stimulation product; pretty soon we ran out of inventory. We were scrambling to set up remote working systems and paying an exorbitant amount to ship product from China, because so many of the commercial flights we use were grounded. Morale has been tough. We’re a small startup and it has been hard to hear people on the team say that they miss being in the office and seeing other people. I’ve encouraged staff to take a mental health day when they need it. For me, there was one day when I was working from home, I had no groceries, an investor call in 10 minutes and a new, five-month-old puppy. I ran downstairs to grab some delivered food, the puppy freaked out because he didn’t know where I was, and when I came back up he had sprayed diarrhoea everywhere. I burst into tears. We made more than $400,000 in April which, traditionally, is our slowest month; there was a wholesale order for $70,000 in a single day. It’s weird to have your business doing well during such a sombre time. But I don’t feel guilty; I feel proud. We’ve donated product to nurses. It’s a remarkable thing, that in such a horrific time people are still giving themselves permission to experience pleasure. I think [sex toy] sales will stay at this level until there is a vaccine. It’s going to take a while before normal human behaviour – and the option to have sex with someone you don’t know that well – returns. Humans are sexual by nature. That’s not going to change. Miki Agrawal, founder, and Jason Ojalvo, CEO of Tushy, a bidet attachment company based in  New York JO In early March, we started to see a little uptick in sales and my first instinct was that [because of the virus] everyone wanted to be more hygienic, and that a bidet would give them that. We ship internationally, and the Tushy Classic – our bestselling bidet attachment – costs $79 and takes 10 minutes to install [it fits under the seat and is attached to the cistern with a hose]. Then the viral videos of people fighting over toilet paper came out. On 9 March, we did twice what we’d normally sell; the next day it was three times; the day after that it was maybe 20 times, and we had a million dollar sales day when we sold more than 10,000 bidets.  We had a team night out – we call it Forced Fun – and it was this last hurrah, where everyone was on edge and weirded out in this empty bar. The early challenge was production capacity, which we managed to up by about six times. A big part of that was convincing our factories in Asia that it wasn’t just one crazy day, or one crazy week. In April, we changed our revenue target for the year, from $20m to $50m. We also had to hire a dozen new people. We also sell bamboo butt towels, for people who want to stop buying toilet paper and pat dry. A new, two-month shipment sold out in two or three days. So people are going zero waste and to the next level. I don’t think people will go back now they have discovered bidets, because it’s a game changer – it’s like being given an iPhone and then having to go back to using a rotary dial. MA It’s a weird product that scares some people. A lot of the negative connotations come from the fact that US soldiers in the second world war associated bidets with the French brothels they visited, so they came back to puritanical America and shunned them. We fully launched Tushy in 2016; the last four years have been about getting people to go against generational attachment to toilet paper and say, “OK, I’ll wash my butt.” We’ve been using humour and a ton of education to lead them towards that cliff edge. So the whole coronavirus thing was just like everyone jumping off at once. I was in California on sabbatical when everything exploded. I remember FaceTiming the team and everyone was like, this is fun. But after a few days, we were trying to forecast how much stock we needed – and we just couldn’t; I felt the pressure and sadness of the world. It was like we were on a rocket ship, so after a few weeks of the insanity I decided to come back to New York.  If we hit the $50m target, the team will earn a double bonus. Down the road, we’re planning a heated bidet seat. Even though the toilet paper shortage has passed, things are not going back. That part of our body has been neglected and deemed taboo for societal reasons for so long. What we’re saying is, clean it properly, respect it and honour it. Paul Bodger, MD of Origin Fitness, an exercise equipment company in Edinburgh A lot of our products are manufactured in China and Taiwan, so we started hearing about factories shutting in January, and that home fitness sales were taking off in Asia. But in early March, our website went bananas. Online sales jumped 1,900%; revenue from those jumped 2,300%, an increase of more than £1m. We were getting a million page views a day and our website, which isn’t built for that traffic, kept crashing. We put a couple of refurbished rowing machines on the site one day and in the 60 seconds it took our web manager to add them, they were sold. On 17 March, we stopped accepting new orders online, and did the same for two weeks in April. It took the heat and emotion out of the situation. We don’t specialise in retail – about 98% of our business is commercial sales to gyms and other organisations. So I had to furlough most of the staff; when gyms do reopen, the market is going to be slow. Before we ran out of stock, the e-commerce was a lifeline. And I, with other senior management, have been working dispatch, driving forklifts and packing 100kg weights. It’s tough work, but has helped me understand the business again. Our product range covers everything from £8 dumbbells to exercise bikes costing £5,000; a lot is high-end and not designed for home use. Equipment for online or app-based circuit training – medicine balls especially – exploded. Olympic bars ran out; I thought that would mean the plates that go with them would stop selling, but they didn’t. I imagine there are a lot of people out there lifting our weights with broom handles. For a lot of customers, it was almost like we were sending their medicine. They would tell us we were helping not just their physical health but their mental health. A good home gym will set you back £10,000, but we had people spending twice that. I keep thinking, are people going to keep this stuff, or is eBay going to be flooded with it? I hope they will keep hold of it, because they won’t want to get caught out again. Lincoln Romain and Georgina Taylor, workers at Brixton Cycles, a staff-owned bike shop in London LR I’ve been here 30 years. When the pandemic started, I remember thinking that if we had to shut for three months, I didn’t know how we would survive. We’re a non-profit organisation and it’s hand-to-mouth.  Then after Boris Johnson’s announcement about the lockdown [on 23 March], we found out bike shops were an essential business. People started turning up with bikes for repair, left, right and centre. You couldn’t move in the shop for bikes. One morning in April, we sold six in 30 minutes. They were shotgun sales, where people just wanted to ride out on something. Very quickly we had to bring in social distancing, allowing only four people in the shop at a time. I had one guy approach me, so I put my hand out to get him to stay back, and he was offended. I was like, “Wow. There’s so much going on, people are dying, and people of colour like me are high risk. But you’re getting your nose slightly twisted because you didn’t want me to put my hand up?” On the whole, though, people have been good. More people are cycling, and I’m seeing local families out on bikes with their kids. I like that. For many people, buying a new bike is not an option. So when you can revive a rusty old thing by giving it new cables and tyres, and oiling up the chain, their eyes light up. They can’t believe you’ve transformed this garden ornament into something useful. GT It started with fixing zombie bikes: things that had been pulled from gardens and still had snails living on them. Now, a lot of new bikes in Europe and the UK seem to have sold out, so it’s incredibly frustrating – if our suppliers had more bikes, we’d be selling them. You develop a skill for letting people down gently. Every day people would call and ask for the same thing – a hybrid bike that costs around £400 – and I could hear in their voices that they had already phoned around 20 shops and were distraught. All the money we’ve made has gone into future-proofing the co-op rather than on bonuses or pay rises, because you never know what’s round the corner. Even though we wish it was under different circumstances, it has been important for us to be open and help so many people. We pushed NHS staff up the queue, and we gave a second-hand bike to a psychiatrist who offered us free group therapy as part payment. I said I’d have to talk to the other co-op members, but maybe after this, it might be quite good. I’m a cynic, and think maybe only 20% of people will stick with cycling. But those of us who rode a bike during lockdown all saw what a pleasant place the city could be with cleaner air and fewer cars on the road. I don’t like the idea of going back to how things were. The world has got a chance to make things a lot nicer – and riding bicycles can be a big part of that. Jamie Stanford, managing director of Liberty Games, a game table retailer in Epsom, Surrey Our business started with renting coin-operated equipment to pubs and clubs 20 years ago. But, of course, the pool machine in a pub has been replaced by a dining table now. What we’ve found is that people want to replicate the experience at home, with air hockey, football tables and table tennis sets that start at under £100 and top out at £50,000. In early March, people started asking, “Can you deliver before lockdown?” When the announcement came, people piled in. Demand was spiking at around four times the average level. A normal March might mean 80 transactions each day – we were selling more than 400 in a 24-hour period. We didn’t run out of stock immediately. I’d love to say that was because I’d been some wizard and predicted it; really, it was because after Christmas you have leftover stock. But then that got depleted, and, working from home, we were a company with one hand tied behind our backs. I can picture a moment about two weeks into lockdown when I got back from the office at about 7pm, and looked at the sales graph. I refreshed and it jumped up by the equivalent of a week’s sales in one day. I had dinner, thought about how we’d manage that volume. Then I refreshed it again, and another week’s worth of sales had happened in an hour. That was overwhelming. But our delivery companies were set up to deal with seasonal changes in demand, so took on extra staff and vans. My staff were clocking overtime; our more experienced suppliers ringfenced stock; and I was driving sackloads of pool cue chalk to the post office. It was seven days a week, but we muddled through. There was a slightly guilty, awkward feeling to it, when things are so desperate for other businesses. But this stuff does give people a bit of a lift. One lady who bought a table tennis top said, “This is the first time I’ve seen a smile on my teenager’s face in three years.” Most of us are introduced to games tables on holiday. They are not a miracle product, but they bring families together. If you’ve got a kid playing Xbox all day and not interacting with his dad or his mum, and a pool table turns up, the family has a communal, enjoyable game that they can try to master. When restrictions started to ease on 13 May, we thought, OK, that’s it, things will settle down. But we still had the same level of demand. I think this [crisis] is changing the psychology of a lot of people. Going to a restaurant, you’ll just become hypersensitive to every cough, every droplet in the air. It will probably take as long as lockdown lasted for these attitudes to wear off. I’m sure the desire to buy a pool table or a football table will eventually wane. But this has surprised me every single day. So I’m done making predictions. "
"Consumers are being warned about a sharp rise in coronavirus-related holiday scams, including a spate of fake caravan and motorhome listings targeting those planning a summer staycation. The warning from UK Finance, the banking industry body, comes three days after the government announced an easing of the lockdown rules in England aimed at helping to get the tourism sector back up and running. UK Finance said criminals were exploiting the uncertainty around travel restrictions and cancellations to target would-be holidaymakers and commit fraud. Fraud prevention service Cifas has recorded a big jump in the numbers of holidaymakers being contacted by fraudsters purporting to be from travel companies or insurers and offering to refund or rebook cancelled flights and holidays. The banking body said financial firms were working closely with law enforcement agencies, but that others needed to play their part too. It called on auction websites and social media sites to take “swift action” to remove fraudulent posts and listings being used to promote holiday scams. On Wednesday, ministers announced that “from 4 July, people can now take a well-deserved staycation”. It means people can stay overnight at holiday homes and second homes, and book hotels, caravan parks and campsites, provided businesses and individuals comply with the official regulations and guidance . This new regime relates to England, with different rules for other parts of the UK – for example, in Wales, travel restrictions are scheduled to be eased from 6 July. With many people now looking to book a summer break, the government-backed Take Five anti-fraud campaign has published detailed guidance with information on common holiday scams and advice on how to stay safe from them. The banking body said criminals were trying to cash in on the growing demand for staycations by advertising fake listings for caravans and motorhomes on websites, and citing lockdown restrictions as the reason why a vehicle cannot be viewed in person. “These vehicles are advertised at attractive prices to tempt people into believing they are getting a good deal, when in reality they simply don’t exist or don’t arrive once paid for,” a spokesperson said. Consumers are being advised to do their research and ask to see a vehicle over video if they are unable to view it in person. They should also steer clear of requests to pay someone via bank transfer rather than using one of the recommended secure payment methods. UK Finance said that in some recent cases, criminals had been requesting that the buyer pay using PayPal. The criminal then fails to send a PayPal invoice, at which point the buyer is contacted by someone pretending to be a PayPal representative, and receives a reference and bank account number for payment to be made into. Ultimately the buyer does not receive their goods as the payment has gone into an account controlled by the fraudsters. Meanwhile, with airlines expected to resume flights and travel companies offering discounted prices, consumers are being urged to watch out for fake websites offering “cheap travel deals” which are used to steal people’s money and personal information."
"German payments giant Wirecard has filed for insolvency in the midst of a major accounting scandal linked to a €1.9bn (£1.7bn) hole in its finances. The company, which processes tens of billions of euros in credit and debit transactions every year, said it failed to reach a deal with its lenders that could help it stay afloat following a turbulent week that involved the resignation and arrest of its chief executive.  Following the announcement, its auditor EY, which discovered the missing funds a week ago, said there were clear indications of “an elaborate and sophisticated fraud involving multiple parties around the world”. It said during the 2019 audit it was given false information and reported this to the relevant authorities. It added: “Even the most robust and extended audit procedures may not uncover a collusive fraud”.  Wirecard declined to comment following the EY statement.Earlier, announcing the insolvency move, Wirecard said: “In the absence of an agreement with the lenders, there was a likelihood of termination and expiry of loans with a volume of €800m on 30 June 30 and €500m on 1 July 1.” A regulatory statement released by the company on Thursday added: “The management board of Wirecard AG decided today to file an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings on behalf of Wirecard AG at the competent Munich local court due to the threat of insolvency and over-indebtedness.” The development comes just days after its former chief executive Markus Braun was arrested on suspicion of falsifying accounts at the company. He was arrested after presenting himself to police, according to German media. Braun, 51, was bailed from police custody after posting a deposit of €5m on Tuesday, according to public prosecutors in Munich.  Wirecard said it was evaluating whether it would have to file insolvency applications for its subsidiaries, which include UK operations based in Newcastle. The company, founded in 1999, employs about 5,800 staff across its 26 locations and has more than 313,000 customers, according to its website. The company’s shares, which have lost more than 95% of their value within days, were temporarily suspended from trading in Frankfurt. The shares were trading hands at around €2.65 on Thursday, comparedwith €104 last Wednesday. The German tech company, which was one of the country’s fastest-growing blue-chip companies, was thrown into crisis last week when EY said it was unable to trace about €1.9bn of cash in the company’s accounts. That sum was worth about a quarter of its balance sheet. Wirecard initially said the money was supposed to be in trustee accounts in two banks in the Philippines. However, the country’s central bank said the cash had never entered its monetary systems, while two commercial banks – BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands – said that despite the company’s insistence, they had no relationship with Wirecard. Braun resigned last Friday, the same day the company confirmed its headquarters were searched as part of a market manipulation investigation launched by Germany’s financial regulator BaFin. By Monday, the management board admitted that the funds in all likelihood “do not exist”. Braun presented himself to police and was arrested on Monday evening. German prosecutors have said they believe the former chief executive may have artificially inflated the company’s assets and income through fake transactions, to make the company seem financially stronger and more attractive to investors and customers. The arrest came nearly two months after a special six-month audit by KPMG was not able to verify some of Wirecard’s transactions with third parties. The scandal has thrown BaFin under the spotlight over the the way it has handled critics of Wirecard since 2018. The watchdog temporarily banned short selling of Wirecard shares, a step it had never taken for an individual company, saying there were signs of “manipulative behaviour” potentially including insider trading. It also launched an investigation into reporters at the Financial Times, who in October reported that Wirecard staff had potentially conspired to fraudulently inflate sales and profits for a decade. BaFin president Felix Hufeld admitted on Monday that the Wirecard scandal was a “complete disaster” and criticised his own organisation’s inaction. Meanwhile EY itself is facing a class action suit by Berlin-based law firm Schirp & Partner and attorney Marc Liebscher on behalf of “aggrieved” shareholder and bond investors. “It is frightening how long Wirecard AG was able to operate without being objected to by the auditors,” the law firm’s founding partner Wolfgang Schirp said in a statement. A spokesperson for Schirp said the claim could end up being worth more than €500m. EY said: “We don’t comment on pending litigation.”"
"Simon Roberts has only just got his feet under the desk at Sainsbury’s, but shareholders are already asking whether the supermarket’s new chief executive can follow the retailer’s own advertising slogan and “live well for less”. Roberts will get his first outing before shareholders at the company’s quarterly results on Wednesday before the annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, where questions are expected to be asked about both his potential bonuses and finance director Kevin O’Byrne’s pension. Pirc, the shareholder advisory group, is urging investors to oppose Sainsbury’s remuneration report. Admittedly, most of its ire is directed at the payout to Roberts’s predecessor Mike Coupe, who stepped down last month. However, Pirc says that potential bonuses for the year ahead could add up to 470% of salary, which it believes is excessive. It also raises concern about the basis on which long-term bonuses are earned. The Observer has also learned that the influential Investment Association’s Institutional Voting Information Service (Ivis) has slapped Sainsbury’s report with a “red top” alert – its strongest possible objection – over pay arrangements for O’Byrne. The Investment Association, which represents City fund manager with a combined £7.7tn worth of assets, warned companies last year to publish credible plans to cut retirement packages down to size by 2022. But Sainsbury’s is set to blow through the IA’s deadline. O’Byrne, who has been pocketing pension payments worth about 25% of his salary, will gradually see his pension pay reduced over the next four years until it is worth 7.5% in March 2024. It is that long goodbye to the annual cash handout that the IA objects to. The row, which follows similar recent battles at Morrisons and Tesco, comes as Sainsbury’s is expected to unveil healthy trading figures. In an ideal world Roberts might not have chosen to present his first set of results during a pandemic. But the UK’s attempt to limit the virus with a lockdown on restaurants, cafes and a shift to working from home has been a huge boost for supermarkets. Sainsbury’s is growing faster than German discounter Aldi for the first time in about a decade. Analysts expect Sainsbury’s grocery sales in the three months to the end of June to be up by 12%. A long spell of unusually warm and sunny weather, and the enforced closure of many of its high street rivals, is also likely to have helped Sainsbury’s Argos chain to a better than expected start to the year. Unlike many rivals, the catalogue shop was able to keep dozens of its sites open within Sainsbury’s stores. Roberts, who has worked for Sainsbury’s for about four years and shared in many of Coupe’s decisions, is unlikely to be unveiling any major strategic changes. His challenge will be to convince investors that the retailer has an exciting story beyond this short-term growth spurt. The shares have yet to recover from the collapse of Coupe’s attempted merger with Asda just over a year ago and the group will be wary of other major takeovers in the near future. Investors will want to know how Sainsbury’s plans to cater to the shift online and to more local shopping without blowing the budget. The impending recession in the UK is also likely to mean a new wave of tough price battles with the discount chains. Tesco kicked things off by more than doubling its Aldi price-match promotion last week. The ball is now in Sainsbury’s court."
"The energy regulator plans to make some of the rules designed to protect customers struggling financially during the Covid-19 crisis a permanent part of its oversight from this winter. Ofgem plans to call on energy suppliers to offer customers having difficulty in topping up their energy meters or paying their gas and electricity bills emergency top-up vouchers or breathing space on bill payments. Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, said the new rules would reduce the number of customers forced to go without lights and heating because they are unable to afford to top up their prepaid meters. Energy suppliers agreed in March to sign up to the measures on a voluntary basis to help customers affected by lockdown measures, but under the new plans Ofgem will make the rules permanent. “It is always best for customers to keep up with their energy bills if they can,” Brearley said. “But at this time when many may face financial hardship, these proposals mean those who are struggling to keep up are assured of some breathing space.” The regulator proposed the extra help for financially vulnerable customers less than a week after it gave the greenlight for suppliers to use debt collection agencies to collect unpaid bills again. Brearley cautioned against “sharp practice or aggressive debt collection” and urged the companies to “give careful consideration to the customer’s circumstances and ability to pay”. Energy suppliers can only disconnect homes from gas or electricity over unpaid bills as a last resort, but about 4 million homes in the UK use pre-paid energy meters, which can lead to “self-disconnection” if a customer is unable to buy a top-up voucher. Under the new rules suppliers may be required to offer emergency credit of between £5 and £20 to customers who run out of credit overnight or during bank holidays, or who are unable to afford to top-up. They will also be asked to agree repayment plans with their customers if they are unable to pay their bills. Ofgem said many suppliers already offered help and energy meter credit to their customers, but making the rules part of the official energy supply licence code means it will be standard practise across the industry. In a separate report, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said arrears on household bills, which had increased sharply in April after lockdown, worsened further in May, suggesting many households were having difficulty in making ends meet. Isaac Delestre, a Research Economist at IFS, said the picture was worrying for the lowest-income households: “Earnings have been hit very hard for those who came into the crisis with the fewest resources,” he said."
"Boris Johnson has been warned that failure to stick to the government’s levelling-up agenda will add to the already serious economic problems faced by Britain’s manufacturing heartlands. A new report from the industrial communities alliance (ICA) – an all-party group representing local authorities in the industrial regions of England, Scotland and Wales – said the prime minister should resist pressure to water down promised support. The ICA said the levelling-up agenda had shown the first signs of delivering in the period between the December general election and the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. “Now that the whole of the UK has been plunged into a new recession, there is a danger that levelling up is forgotten and that all efforts go instead into building a national economic recovery. This would be a mistake,” it said. “All parts of Britain are indeed being hit by the new recession, but the less prosperous parts – which includes most older industrial areas – started off further behind and remain further behind. The recession should not be an excuse to divert funding away from ‘levelling up’, as so many newly elected Conservative MPs can be expected to remind ministers.” The ICA’s message came as the manufacturing industry warned that it could suffer a £35bn hit from the coronavirus pandemic this year due to the temporary shutdown of factories. Faced with the deepest downturn in manufacturing output on record, the industry lobby group Make UK and Santander said it would take until 2022 for the sector to recover its pre-Covid-19 growth trajectory, while calling on the government to launch further measures to support businesses and jobs in the sector. Setting out the scale of the challenge ahead, the report warned that manufacturers were continuing to see sales and orders nosedive owing to the pandemic, with more than 70% of manufacturers reporting a further decrease in income as lockdown measures are lifted. Make UK said the government needed to repurpose its industrial strategy to help mount the fightback, while also helping to promote investment in low-carbon and digital manufacturing. The ICA report called on the government to take a range of actions, including an extension of its job retention scheme, ensuring a trade deal is agreed with the EU, and providing help to keep young people off the dole. Keith Cunliffe, chair of the ICA and a Labour councillor from Wigan, said: “In terms of prosperity and life chances, our older industrial areas started off further behind and the new recession has made things worse. The Boris Johnson government needs to revive the national economy, but it also needs to stick with the levelling-up agenda that was promised in the general election.” Johnson’s 80-seat majority in the 2019 general election was secured by winning Labour “red wall” seats in the Midlands and the northern regions of England. The prime minister has insisted that the government will stick to its promises despite the recession. Steve Manion, a Conservative councillor from a former mining area in east Kent, said: “I believe we have proposals here that lots of people, from across the political divide, can rally around to help build our older industrial areas out of recession. Westminster holds the purse strings, but local authorities and local communities should be trusted to do their bit and be given the chance to rebuild.” "
"Post Office has resumed selling travel currency, as the easing of lockdown rules allows Brits to start planning for overseas trips. Post Office, which handles one in four currency transactions in the UK, suspended sales in late March, but said that as resorts in Europe reopened it was time to start again. It will offer next-day delivery or collection from 11,500 branches for customers who order via its Travel Money website. From 1 July some branches will offer same-day collection for online orders. However, the weakness of the pound means customers will get fewer euros for their sterling than this time last year. Anyone buying £500 worth of euros at Post Office will get a rate of £1 to €1.0774 – 1.7% less than a year ago, meaning €8.49 less to spend. With the possibility of a second wave of coronavirus leading to lockdowns, customers are advised to keep their receipts, because if holidays are cancelled Post Office has said it would offer a full refund. Nick Boden, the head of Post Office Travel Money, said: “With the reintroduction of flights by leading airlines and the reopening of resorts in Europe, we feel that it is appropriate to resume our travel money services so that we can accommodate those who want to start planning trips abroad in the coming months. “We’re following FCO advice closely and we advise holidaymakers to do the same.” Currency bureaus at airports remain closed, but some firms including Travelex, are offering a delivery service. Thomas Exchange, which often offers one of the best exchange rates to customers who book their money online and pick it up from its London stores, has started to reopen its shops."
"Rolls-Royce has burned through £3bn in cash in six months because of the coronavirus pandemic, and warned it could take “several years” to recover from the crisis. The Derby-based jet engine manufacturer said 3,000 UK workers had applied for voluntary redundancy, about 2,000 of whom are due to leave by the end of August. The redundancies are part of wider plans to cut 9,000 jobs globally owing to the pandemic, with UK staff making up two-thirds of the total. Before the job cuts were announced, Rolls-Royce employed 52,000 staff worldwide. Warren East, its chief executive, said: “These are exceptional times. The Covid-19 pandemic has created a historic shock in civil aviation which will take several years to recover. We started this year with positive momentum and strong liquidity and acted swiftly to conserve cash and cut costs to protect Rolls-Royce during the pandemic. “This means we have had to take the very difficult decision to lose people who have helped us become the company we are and who have been proud to work for Rolls-Royce.” Rolls-Royce shares ended the day down 11% at 256p. The company said its cashflow had been significantly affected by Covid-19 in the first half of the year. The company, which charges some companies based on the amount of time its engines are in the air, was badly affected by coronavirus travel restrictions that grounded planes across the globe. Rolls-Royce said engine flying hours fell by 75% in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year, and was down 50% over the first six months of 2020. First-half revenues fell £1.1bn because of the decline and fewer engine deliveries. The company took a further £1.1bn hit after ending a practice known as invoice factoring, which involves a short-term bank loan to bolster cashflow until customers pay for their goods. In total, Rolls-Royce said it expected to burn through £4bn worth of cash by the end of 2020. The company expects to see a “gradual improvement” in engine flying hours, with more long-haul flights expected to restart in the fourth quarter, and a rise in cash savings in the second half of the year. However, it said its income from its US civil aviation business would take a significant hit over the next seven years. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Rolls-Royce is at the sharp end of current disruption. A business model that relies heavily on the number of hours its engines spend in the air is a tough deal in the face of international travel disruption. Engine flying hours are expected to be down 55% for the full year, and aren’t expected to normalise for a while after that. By 2021 engine flying hours are only expected to be at 70% of pre-pandemic levels.”"
"Many Australian tourism operators are preparing to reopen over the next week, despite Melbourne’s coronavirus outbreak sending the city into lockdown and forcing states to close their borders to Victorian travellers. New South Wales closed its border for the first time to Victoria on Wednesday. Queensland reopened its borders on Friday to all states except Victoria. The Northern Territory will also reopen borders to all states on 17 July, but interstate arrivals from coronavirus hotspots will be required to enter mandatory supervised quarantine for two weeks, while South Australia’s 20 July border reopening will not extend to Victorians. The holiday reservation website Wotif has seen not only consistent interest in travel bookings since the NSW-Victoria border closure but a “huge spike in interest for Queensland”, according to its managing director, Daniel Finch. According to Finch, in the 24 hours after the Queensland government’s confirmation that the state’s borders would open to all states, aside from Victoria, Wotif had a 70% spike in travel interest for Queensland from NSW and SA travellers, a 50% increase from WA travellers and a 40% increase from NT travellers. The Queensland Tourism Industry Council’s chief executive, Daniel Gschwind, said the border reopening came as a relief to the state’s $26bn tourism industry, which had been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic. “The bookings and inquiries spiked the moment the premier confirmed the opening,” he said. “We have had reports from accommodation providers that the bookings are looking a bit better now further north.” Metropolitan Melbourne and the regional shire of Mitchell re-entered a six-week lockdown under stage three restrictions on Wednesday after community transmission soared. Given that Victorians usually make up about 30% of the sunshine state’s winter travellers, the Melbourne outbreak will nonetheless stifle Queensland’s reopening, according to Gschwind. “There are plenty of reasons why southerners would want to come up here, and the fact that they can’t is certainly going to have an impact on what we would normally rely on in places like Noosa and the Sunshine Coast and further up in Cairns,” Gschwind said. Melbourne’s coronavirus outbreak has also affected accommodation providers in Victoria and NSW. Cam Grant, the cofounder of Unyoked cabins, has spent the past two days calling guests booked in to stay at Victoria locations, most of whom would have been travelling from metro Melbourne. While occupancy for the next month was going to drop to about 15%, Grant said, most guests were looking to rebook rather than asking for refunds. “Last time when the borders closed we called around 200 guests, and 96% of them rescheduled their bookings,” Grant said. “Only 4% wanted a refund.” Michelle Porter, the accommodation manager of Kimo Estate, said she had also spent every day since Monday fielding calls from guests booked to stay its new boutique hotel in Gundagai, in southern NSW, which “had a good slathering of guests staying on their way through to places and travelling between Melbourne and Sydney”. “We have definitely taken a hit with the border,” she said. “If anything, before the Victorian border closed, we probably found that once we came out of lockdown that we had increased bookings compared to this time last year because people wanted to get out of Sydney and have a change of scenery. “The vast majority were still super keen and more bummed for us than anything else. Everyone wants to go and be in a secluded cabin in the wilderness. Being stuck at your house starting a computer and a wall has accelerated the trends that we built the houses on. Rather than sitting at your desk nine-to-five, seven days a week, people are looking to take time off.” While interstate travel may fluctuate over the next few months, Australia’s tourism sector is benefiting from a significant increase in intrastate visitors. According to Tourism and Events Queensland, some 42% of Queenslanders surveyed said they planned to holiday within the state over the 2020 winter break, compared with last year when only a third did. Porter said while interstate travel had taken a hit, local visitors would keep the business going while the Victorian border remained shut. “We have got our three eco huts that are currently booked solidly until December,” she said. “They were fairly popular before, because people can’t go anywhere but NSW and we are a good stopping point and not too far from Sydney for people to come for the night.” The Australian Medical Association has warned that the states should be cautious about easing restrictions and opening borders further, given Melbourne’s rising cases. “It wasn’t so long ago that we had very low numbers in Victoria, even a case of zero once,” said the AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone. “And now you see the numbers we’ve got and that’s what you see when you have a number of failures coalesce, line up with one another …  “We are all pinning our ears back and going full force as if there wasn’t a pandemic in the first place.” Bartone said opening up was important for Australia’s tourism sector and broader economy but other states needed to be careful that they weren’t headed for a second shutdown. “The shutdowns in Melbourne are playing with hundreds of thousands of lives by shutting down their businesses and livelihoods for the second time around. Let’s open up, but do it in a way that we can be confident that we can stay open and remain open for some time to come.”"
"Energy companies have accused the regulator Ofgem of putting Britain’s climate goals at risk by clamping down on returns for green investors in an effort to shave £20 a year from home energy bills.  Ofgem has proposed halving the returns that companies can make over the next five years through a £25bn green investment plan designed to prepare Britain’s energy infrastructure for a low-carbon future. Ofgem said the lowest ever energy investor returns, which are paid for through energy bills, will offer a fair deal for consumers and energy company shareholders as Britain undertakes huge investments in electric vehicle charging and grid upgrades to connect new renewable energy and battery projects. Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said: “Now more than ever, we need to make sure that every pound on consumers’ bills goes further. Less of your money will go towards company shareholders, and more into improving the network to power the economy and to fight climate change.” The proposed returns would be half what energy network companies currently earn for upgrading and maintaining Britain’s energy pipes and wires, after MPs and consumer groups had criticised the regulator for allowing the companies to pocket “eyewatering” profits at the expense of consumers. But major energy companies including National Grid, SSE and Scottish Power have warned that setting investor returns at 3.95% – down from the current 7% to 8% – could slow the pace of Britain’s energy transition by making the UK less attractive to investors. There is also concern over Ofgem’s decision to cut the total investment allowed in new electricity grid projects to between £5.9bn and £9.1bn for the next five years, which falls short of the £9.6bn invested over the last five years. The proposed limit is well below the spending proposed by the industry at £10.8bn to prepare for a surge in power demand from electric cars, hobs and heat pumps. Nicola Shaw, the executive director of National Grid, said it was “very disappointing” that the regulator had chosen a “short-term gain” for customers while putting “all the work still needed to reach net zero at real risk”. Ofgem’s plan aims to save £3.3bn of company spending from being passed on to energy consumers between 2021 and 2026. This could mean that energy bills fall by £20 a household in 2021 from where they might have been, though the long-term reduction in bills could drop to £10 a year depending on how much is spent on additional green energy projects over the next five years. But Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said the plans are “so far out of step” with the government’s ambition to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050 that they may “slams the brakes” on a green economic recovery, “or even put it in reverse”. He warned that Scottish Power’s parent company, Spain’s Iberdrola, may opt to invest more in the other countries within its global portfolio, which includes France and the US, rather than earn lower returns in the UK. Brearley said there is no merit to the argument put forward by companies that the investment returns proposed by the regulator will slow down a shift towards green energy. “Ofgem are here to deliver a greener and fairer energy system, and we are passionate about supporting the green economic recovery,” he said. “Quite frankly, at this stage of the process, this is the sort of thing that companies often say.” Brearley said the regulator has undertaken “extensive analysis” to determine “a fair balance between investment and customers” including the rate of return which investors earn from investing in any projects in other countries. The regulator will consult with companies again before delivering its final decision later this year, but may be forced to defend the plans to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) if it does not budge. Energy network companies are expected to appeal against the current rate of return with the CMA, which could further delay progress on green energy investment plans, supply chain contracts and green-collar jobs growth. “My job is to look at the evidence, make sure we make the right decision, and then stand firm,” Brearley said. “We are confident that we have got that balance right.”"
"Australia’s flag carrier, Qantas, will sack 6,000 people and continue to stand down half its 30,000-strong workforce as it struggles to cope with the continuing shutdown of the airline sector amid the coronavirus crisis. Alan Joyce, the chief executive who has previously claimed the airline was in a much stronger financial position than its stricken rival, Virgin Australia, said the company would also be raising $1.9bn in fresh capital to help see it through until flying resumes in earnest. He said the stand-down was likely to extend for a long time, with international flights not to resume in earnest before July next year at the soonest. Joyce said he wanted the federal government to extend jobkeeper subsidies, which are due to expire in September, for the airline sector. “We’re having good discussions with the government about possibly extending jobkeeper, or some other form of support, for those in the aviation industry who will be stood down for an extended period,” he said. Qantas’s fleet of 12 long-haul Airbus A380s, which can carry more than 800 passengers, will be sent to the Mojave desert for storage for three years. The airline also cancelled a $200m dividend payment it was due to make to shareholders in September. The move was immediately condemned by the national secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, Michael Kaine, who accused Joyce of being “quick to cut jobs and hang workers out to dry” and said the airline should have held off on sackings until after the federal government announced whether the jobkeeper program would be extended. Kaine said both Qantas and the Morrison government, which has repeatedly rebuffed the TWU’s calls for a bailout of the aviation industry, were to blame for the job losses. “Before Qantas slashed thousands of workers’ jobs and takes more of its planes down to the pawn shop it should be lobbying the federal government for an extension to jobkeeper and financial support to allow the airline to weather the crisis,” he said. “The Qantas CEO is very good at walking the halls of Canberra when it suits his agenda, yet he is quick to cut jobs and hang workers out to dry. We are demanding that he halt these redundancies until the federal government makes an announcement on jobkeeper.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said aviation was a sector that would need continued support with jobkeeper wage subsidies and other coronavirus support measures due to end in September. “We are just working through the best way to target and deliver that support,” he told reporters in Sydney on Thursday. He said “jobkeeper or other measures” could be used to help the sector in the future. Despite the job losses and financial carnage, Joyce stood by his controversial “Project Sunrise” plan to start ultra-long-haul flights of up to 21 hours to London and New York. His sober words on Thursday contrasted with punchy statements in March, when he took aim at Virgin by saying it was “survival of the fittest” in the airline industry and Qantas was “working on is making sure we are last man standing”. These statements drew the ire of the competition regulator Rod Sims, who said they were “unhelpful” and he would investigate them. Since then, Qantas has been able to avoid raising capital, which dilutes the value of existing shares, by mortgaging some of its planes. But on Thursday Joyce said the $1.9bn capital raising, the airline’s first in a decade, was needed to “strengthen our balance sheet and accelerate our recovery”. The airline’s board backed Joyce on Thursday, extending his tenure to at least 2023, by which time he will have been in the top job for an unusually long 15 years. The chief executive, who was paid almost $24m last year, has previously agreed not to take pay until the end of this month and said this arrangement would continue into July. A company spokesman said this would continue until the airline was “flying more”. Senior executives have taken a 15% pay cut and no bonuses have been paid this year. There was no set date for executive pay to return to normal, the spokesman said. The opposition’s industrial relations spokesman, Tony Burke, accused the government of ignoring the airline sector’s woes. “Instead of listening, the government has spent the last few months ignoring the structural problems in the industry, hoping on a wing and a prayer that the market would sort it out,” he said. He blasted the government for denying jobkeeper payments to thousands of workers at airline service company dnata because it was foreign-owned and for allowing Virgin Australia to fall into administration in April. “Now they are too late to save thousands of jobs at Qantas,” he said. The sackings and capital raising at Qantas come as Virgin Australia’s administrators move closer to selecting a new owner for the debt-laden airline. There are two bidders, Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners, but this week bondholders owed more than $2bn complicated the process by lodging a late offer to pour $1bn into the airline and refloat it on the stock exchange. The administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, hope to have a sale agreement struck by next Tuesday."
"EasyJet has launched a £450m rights issue to shore up its cash reserves in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. The issue, worth up to 15% of its current share capital, will need shareholder approval, potentially drawing more opposition from the company’s founder and main shareholder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. It also reported bigger first-half losses for the six months to 31 March on Tuesday, but insisted it had been on track for a much improved performance before the effects of coronavirus hit. The airline made a pre-tax loss of £353m, compared with £272m in the same period in 2018-19, but said £160m of the deficit was down to hedging against fluctuations in fuel prices, which backfired as fleets were grounded in the spring. EasyJet has already raised £1.7bn in additional funding during the crisis and expects to have a cash balance of more than £3bn after the placing – enough to survive a nine-month grounding, according to its latest estimates of cash burn. Its use of state assistance, including a £600m loan from a Treasury and Bank of England fund, has raised eyebrows after it paid a £174m dividend to shareholders in March. The airline said last month it would cut 4,500 jobs, and does not expect demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2023. “We have been decisive in meeting the challenges of the pandemic by cutting costs, vastly reducing our capex while retaining our industry leading fleet flexibility,” its chief executive Johan Lundgren said. EasyJet restarted a skeleton service of flights last week, mainly domestic routes from the UK. It is planning to increase activities in the next two months, although quarantine rules, which it has challenged legally with rivals British Airways and Ryanair, have dampened demand. The airline did not provide financial guidance for the rest of the year, but said capacity is expected to build through the summer, with its fourth quarter at 30% of planned pre-coronavirus capacity. It also pointed to “encouraging” bookings for its easyJet Holidays arm."
"Virgin Atlantic is attempting to secure a privately funded rescue deal worth up to £900m by the end of this week as it fights to survive after the slump in international travel during the coronavirus pandemic. The airline is in talks with hedge funds about borrowing about £250m and is lining up more than £200m from shareholders including founder Sir Richard Branson and Delta Airlines, which owns 49% of the company. Virgin Atlantic is also talking to plane manufacturers, credit card companies and leaseholders about the deferral or cancellation of payments worth hundreds of millions of pounds. One source said there were as many as 60 separate discussions about potential funding lifelines. Virgin has set an “informal deadline” of early July to finalise a deal, according to Sky News, but is understood to be able to stretch talks beyond that deadline if necessary. Airlines across the world have been rocked by the grounding of flights amid pandemic lockdowns, which have jeopardised their business models. Virgin said it could take three years for flight numbers to return to 2019 levels. The company has been told by the government it must explore all private options for finance before any public bailout will be considered. Talks with the government also continue about a potential injection of as much as £100m, it is understood. The company has already announced more than 3,000 job cuts, is reducing the size of its fleet, and ending flights from London’s Gatwick Airport. Virgin Atlantic said: “We continue to explore all available options to secure additional external funding as part of a comprehensive, solvent recapitalisation of the airline. As per the chancellor’s letter of 24 March, HM government is considered as a lender of last resort, and rightly so. “We have already made difficult decisions and taken decisive action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and protect as many jobs as possible. In parallel, constructive negotiations with our shareholders, creditors and partners as well as private investors and HM government are progressing at pace, so that Virgin Atlantic can emerge from the crisis sustainably profitable and with a healthy balance sheet. “While more work needs to be done, we greatly appreciate the support our stakeholders have shown to date and believe we can deliver a comprehensive financing package that ensures Virgin Atlantic continues to provide essential connectivity and competition to consumers and businesses in Britain and beyond.” Advisers from Alvarez & Marsal have been lined up to prepare a pre-pack administration deal if the airline is not able to secure a deal."
"Australian governments need to pour an extra $70bn to $90bn into stimulus and support measures to help the nation weather the biggest economic shock since the second world war, according to a new report. Setting out a wide-ranging agenda for the next six months, the Grattan Institute argues governments need to phase out coronavirus-related emergency support measures more slowly than currently planned to avoid a “fiscal cliff” that could “put a handbrake on the recovery”. It also calls on governments to roll out other forms of economic stimulus including extra rent assistance and childcare subsidies. With Australia facing a “globally synchronised deep recession” triggered by Covid-19, the report notes federal, state and territory governments have already sought to cushion the impacts by spending more than $160bn to support households and businesses. Many of these programs – including the jobkeeper wage subsidy and the increase to jobseeker allowance – are due to expire in or around September. The federal government is considering Treasury’s review of the jobkeeper program and has flagged further targeted assistance to sectors that require longer term support, including aviation and tourism, but on Sunday the Coalition played down fresh speculation about a permanent increase in unemployment benefits. The Grattan Institute argues governments should earmark an extra $30bn over the coming year in order to wind down existing programs “more gradually” and “avoid a severe economic crunch”. Australia’s economy is “fragile”, it warns, and an “abrupt withdrawal” of government support would threaten the recovery by leaving a “substantial hole in incomes for households and businesses”. It suggests extending jobkeeper beyond September for a further three months for some industries still severely affected by government restrictions and expand its coverage to include temporary migrants, short-term casuals and university workers – partly funded by introducing a lower rate for part-time workers. The report also calls for a further $21bn over the next two years for ongoing reforms such as permanent increases to the jobseeker unemployment payment of at least $100 per week, a 40% lift in commonwealth rent assistance, and more generous childcare subsidies. And it warns that further temporary stimulus is needed if governments want to get unemployment back down to 5% or below by mid-2022. It suggests tipping another $20bn to $40bn into services, infrastructure and social housing construction. These proposed measures add up to about $70bn to $90bn over the next two years but the report says now is not the time to “panic” about increasing government debt levels. “Assuming interest rates remain low, governments should be in no rush to consolidate their budgets while economies remain weak in Australia and across the globe,” says the report titled The Recovery Book: What Australian governments should do now. “Failing to provide this support will condemn many Australians to unemployment for longer. During the Great Depression, and in many advanced economies in the past decade, premature moves to austerity held back recoveries and, in some cases, created new recessions.” Additional stimulus will need to be announced soon to support confidence in the coming months, the report says. It says further support may be required if the economic outlook is worse than expected, especially in the event of a second wave of Covid-19 in Australia. While state governments should do what they can, the federal government will need to fund the lion’s share of any stimulus. It also says the Reserve Bank should be prepared to use unconventional policy tools more aggressively – including reducing the overnight cash rate below zero. The report also calls for tutoring and literacy and numeracy programs to be rolled out to help disadvantaged students who have suffered the most from disruptions to their normal schooling during the pandemic. “It would cost about $1.25bn to help about one million disadvantaged students catch up over the next six months, while helping to stimulate the economy at the same time,” it says. Other proposals in the report include tightening eligibility to the early access to superannuation scheme. It also calls on the government to abandon legislated increases in the rate of compulsory superannuation contributions – an idea that may be popular in Coalition ranks but would be fiercely opposed by Labor. On energy policy, the report says governments should “ignore calls for stimulus spending for infrastructure that is inconsistent with a low-emissions future” and should consider a mandatory rollout of smart meters. Noting that parliaments rose and decision-making was centralised at the height of the pandemic, the report calls on governments to act now to strengthen accountability and oversight – saying transparency is even more important in a time of crisis. It says the national cabinet of federal and state and territory leaders should develop rules to provide transparency, while the creation of a national integrity commission “is now even more urgent, given that emergencies often provide cover for wrongdoing”. The Grattan Institute’s recommendations on extending and refining jobkeeper follow a warning from the IMF that winding down wage subsidy schemes “should proceed gradually to avoid precipitating sudden income losses and bankruptcies just as the economy is beginning to regain its footing”. Labor seized on the Grattan Institute’s report, saying it was yet another voice warning of a risk from a blunt “snapback” of economic support in September. Labor’s Treasury spokesperson, Jim Chalmers, and his senior colleagues called on the government to release the Treasury report on the future of jobkeeper before the Eden-Monaro byelection on 4 July. The ABC reported the review’s report was handed to the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on Friday but the government says it will announce any decisions later in July."
"The nation has triggered its own DIY SOS with an “extreme” home improvement binge during lockdown, triggering shortages of paving slabs, fence panels and even bags of plaster and cement. While some Britons turned to baking sourdough loaves and banana bread, others have been tackling much delayed DIY projects, ranging from mending fences to laying patios and skimming walls. “I wouldn’t quite say plaster is the toilet roll of the building materials industry, but it’s probably not far off,” said John Newcomb, chief executive of the Builders Merchants Federation (BMF). “I don’t know where it’s all going, but it is certainly in demand.” With more than 9 million Britons furloughed during the three months of lockdown, there has been plenty of time to address the shortcomings of both indoor and outdoor living spaces. Indeed, a rush back to DIY shops, where sales jumped by 42% in May, was the main driver behind a rebound in the official retail sales figures. Last week Kingfisher, which owns the B&Q and Screwfix chains, said it was hiring up to 2,000 temporary workers after online sales soared by more than 200% in April and May. Similarly, when Ikea reopened at the start of this month, shoppers queued for hours to buy its flatpack furniture and storage systems. With the fallout from the pandemic putting foreign holidays and care-free shopping trips out of reach, analysts think money that would otherwise have been spent on summer getaways and fashion is being diverted into home improvements, with small landscaping projects such as patios and raised flowerbeds proving popular. The online DIY marketplace ManoMano said that over the last three months. sales of power tools had been nearly 250% higher than in 2019. Demand for paraphernalia linked to plumbing and electrical jobs also doubled, but – presumably due to the absence of pubs and holiday plans – the most viewed guides on its blog demonstrate how to make a bar or sun loungers for your garden out of pallets. Homebase said its timber sales were double last year’s and also reported strong demand for insulation, loft ladders and loft boards as people sought to create a home office or additional storage. “The availability issues you’re seeing are either in builders’ merchants or DIY stores,” said Newcomb, who added that plaster supplies were being prioritised for essential projects, particularly within the NHS. “There has been a shortage of plaster and there are also issues around bagged cement. But it is not all cement – it’s the products purchased by jobbing builders and consumers.” The work of housebuilders and major contractors was not being disrupted, added Newcomb, co-chair of the industry’s product availability group, which is monitoring any coronavirus-related disruption. The reason it is hard to get hold of packed cement is because of a shortage of packaging, so it is consumers and tradesmen, who buy smaller quantities, who are worst affected. “We are also seeing excessive demand for external materials like fence posts and panels, exterior paint and garden sleepers,” said Newcomb. “There is this extreme demand from consumers and now, as tradesmen start to return to work, they’re adding to that.” Plaster factories have not been able to keep up with the extra demand, even though some businesses are working overtime, drawing parallels with the flour shortage created by the lockdown baking bonanza. Plaster-makers are optimistic that supply levels will normalise by the end of July, although the shortages created by a 250% increase in demand for Indian sandstone – commonly used to pave driveways and patios – is expected to take longer to level out."
"British Airways has told its longest-serving cabin crew they will have to take a 20% basic pay cut and change working patterns if they are to be retained, as it prepares to lay off up to 30% of its workforce. The proposal comes almost two months after BA notified unions of plans to lay off 12,000 staff after coronavirus grounded almost all passenger flights. All cabin crew would have to apply for jobs in BA’s mixed fleet, a unit set up during a bitter strike a decade ago. Given that cabin crew salaries are largely made up of flight pay and allowances, many are likely to see their overall earnings reduced by much more than 20%. Talks are continuing with the pilots’ trade union Balpa over a voluntary redundancy deal. No offer has yet been put to ground staff. BA says no unions other than Balpa have turned up to talks, despite meetings scheduled almost daily since the airline announced plans to cut jobs and change contracts. MPs on the transport select committee described the UK’s flag carrier a national disgrace for considering moves to fire all staff and put up to 30,000 remaining employees on new contracts. In a report earlier this month the committee accused BA of making “a calculated attempt to take advantage of the pandemic”. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA’s parent company, IAG, Willie Walsh, said he “formally rejected the findings” and that BA was consulting about proposed changes in full compliance with the law, as unions had demanded in earlier disputes.  BA flew only 485 passenger flights in May, the same number it flew in half a day in May 2019. The airline is believed to have been burning £20m a day while the vast majority of its fleet has been grounded. A BA spokeswoman said: “We are acting now to protect as many jobs possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.” Carriers have taken drastic action after the pandemic grounded most flights grounded in late March. Many countries still restricting international travel, and airlines’ revenues have been wiped out. Several say they do not expect to recover until at least 2023, even if flights are swiftly restored. BA’s rivals in the UK are are expecting to lay off a similar proportion of their workforce. EasyJet announced up to 4,500 job losses last month, Virgin Atlantic expects to lay off around 3,000 staff and Ryanair has said it will cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by 20%."
"The bosses of Boohoo are in line for a £150m bonus if shares in the online fashion retailer rise by two-thirds over the next three years. Business has boomed at Boohoo, which owns brands including Nasty Gal, Pretty Little Thing, Coast and Karen Millen, since floating in 2014 and has surged during the coronavirus lockdown. The company said on Friday its remuneration committee had created a long-term incentive plan to “ensure that the group’s leadership team is motivated” and the “continuation of the exceptional levels of performance that [Boohoo] has delivered since IPO [initial public offering]”. Under the scheme, key top executives will share a maximum payout of £150m if Bohoo’s market value can be increased by 66% from £4.54bn as measured on 16 June to £7.55bn by 17 June 2023. At the lower end of the scheme, if the market capitalisation reaches £6.29bn at the end of the three years, the payout pot will be £50m. To achieve the maximum target, Boohoo’s sales will need to increase at an 18% average growth rate over the next three years. Participants in the scheme include the co-founders, Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane, who will each receive £50m or a third of the payout, and the chief financial officer, Neil Catto, who will get 6.67%. A spokesman for the company said this was the first time Kamani, who is group executive chairman, and Kane, an executive director, had participated in a long-term incentive scheme since the business was floated in 2014. Also included in the plan is Samir Kamani, the son of Mahmud, and the chief executive of the menswear brand boohooMAN, who is in line to receive 16.67% of the bonus pot. The remaining 10% is to be used to incentivise other key individuals in the wider management team, with no one person to receive more than 3%. The company said it had consulted on the plan with Zeus Capital, the group’s nominated adviser, and considered “the terms of the plan are fair and reasonable in so far as the group’s shareholders are concerned”. Boohoo is breaking with the UK corporate governance code and is electing not to put the plan to a shareholder vote. It says under two different sets of company rules, the QCA corporate governance code and AIM rules, a vote is not necessary. “The remuneration committee has undertaken some shareholder consultation and taken on board feedback received,” the retailer said. “The committee believes that the interests of shareholders will be best served by granting the awards immediately to the recipients without recourse to a shareholder vote, which will ensure that they are immediately incentivised to deliver stretching share price growth for the benefit of all Boohoo’s shareholders.” The bonus plan is separate to the one the company created for the chief executive, John Lyttle, when he was poached from Primark in 2018. Lyttle will receive a £50m bonus if the company’s market value reaches £6bn by 2024."
"Britons bought 60% more bikes in April as the nation turned to two-wheeled transport during the coronavirus lockdown. Government advice to avoid public transport led to a complete turnaround in the cycle market. In the first three months of the year, 8% fewer bikes were bought in the UK, according to the Bicycle Association. However, in April, the the number of bikes sold rose 60%. The biggest change was in more affordable bikes valued at £400 to £1,000, sales of which doubled in April. Sales of bikes costing more than £3,000 fell. Almost 50% more electric bikes were sold in April, a big step up in the pace of growth from the 29% seen in the first quarter of the year. However, the Bicycle Association said the increase in electric bike sales was disappointing because it was only in line with long-term growth patterns that could be expected for the as yet small market. Steve Garidis, the association’s executive director, said: “It’s brilliant that the UK has been out buying and repairing their bikes under lockdown. Especially for commuters, every journey made by bike frees up space for those who have no alternative to using public transport. E-bikes have the potential to make even longer or more hilly cycling commutes practical and enjoyable – which is why it’s disappointing that take-up under lockdown hasn’t accelerated as it has for bikes.” The association wants the government to support e-bike sales with incentives including a £250 buyers grant and promotional campaign. The latest figures provide more evidence for the switch to two wheels, which is being underpinned by local and government investment in infrastructure including pop-up cycle lanes. There have been reports of shortages of affordable bikes, while cycle shops say demand for repairs has leapt as old bikes are dragged out of sheds and garages. However, one report suggests bicycle sales could fall by 10% to £842m for the whole of this year. The market research firm Mintel said the switch from public transport and cars to two wheels during the pandemic was likely to be offset by a downturn in consumer spending prompted by the likely recession caused by the lockdown."
"Boots has forced nearly 12,000 glasses wearers to wait more than 10 weeks for eyewear after the company closed the vast majority of its opticians outlets. The retailer has continued to operate its high street pharmacies and stores throughout the coronavirus outbreak but shut all but 51 of its 600 opticians stores in March. It put the vast majority of optical staff on furlough. Since then, thousands of customers who bought glasses just before lockdown, or brought in existing pairs for repair, have been forced to wait weeks to receive sometimes essential eyewear stuck in the closed stores. Customers complained that they had found difficulty in getting any updates on deliveries of glasses for which some had already paid hundreds of pounds. One customer wrote on the retailer’s Facebook site: “I bought my glasses [on 20 March] and they are ready to collect in a store but the store is closed. I contacted Boots a couple of times now and every time they are saying ‘we requested for a new pair and they will be delivered to you within 2-3 weeks’ and after that no glasses! I called them today and apparently there is no new order in the system! This is a joke.” Another said she had struggled to track down what had happened to her husband’s glasses, which had been taken in for adjustment in February. “I have called them twice three weeks ago and [in May] and they have given me contradicting information and are unable tell me where the nearest open hub to me is – I am at loss where to go.” Boots said it hoped to deliver all glasses for which it had a validated address within the next week. It delivered 3,000 pairs between Friday 29 May, when it was first contacted by the Guardian, and Thursday 4 June. Boots said it had been slow to deliver glasses because it did not have a delivery infrastructure in place before lockdown. It also did not have the correct address details on file for some customers and had to contact them to update. It added that some orders had not been paid in full and the customer would normally have expected to finalise payment when they picked up the glasses. The company said that some customers had specified they would prefer to come into an opticians for a fitting, before it was clear how long the lockdown would last. A spokeswoman for Boots said: “Given the time that has passed, we have since made the decision to deliver these glasses with instructions for customers on next steps.” It added that for categories of glasses that are restricted from delivery without a fitting, such as children’s glasses, it had set up a mobile fitting service to assist."
"Downbeat assessments of the economic impact of Covid-19 from America’s central bank and the International Monetary Fund failed to dampen spirits on the world’s stock markets as they bounced back strongly from recent heavy falls. Shares in both Europe and the US posted gains on hopes that a mooted $1tn (£780bn) US infrastructure plan and a decision by the Federal Reserve to buy corporate bonds would boost chances of a V-shaped recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. The US central bank took markets by surprise by announcing that it would buy the lowest investment-grade bonds as part of its quantitative easing programme in an attempt to save jobs and stimulate investment. The announcement brought to an end a sell-off in shares prompted by concerns that a pick-up in Covid-19 in some southern US states would lead to the reimposition of lockdown restrictions and slow the pace of recovery. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up by more than 1.5% in early trading in New York that coincided with the Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, telling US legislators that recovery would be a long road and leave the world’s biggest economy “well short” of where it stood in February, before the crisis began. “Recently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilisation, and in some areas a modest rebound in economic activity,” Powell said in evidence to the US Senate. “That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery.” Investors received mixed signals about the state of the US economy, but paid more heed to a record 17% increase in retail sales in May than the more modest 1.4% rise in industrial production. In London, the FTSE 100 – the gauge for the UK’s leading quoted companies – closed almost 3% higher at 6242.79. Germany’s Dax index finished the day 3.4% higher. Oil prices also rose on optimism that demand for crude would bounce back more quickly than expected. Powell’s cautious tone was mirrored by Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s economic counsellor, who used a blog to signal that her organisation would revise down its estimate of growth when it provides an updated 2020 forecast next week. The Washington-based IMF said in April that it expected the world economy to shrink by 3% this year, but completed work on the forecast before the scale of the lockdown became apparent. Gopinath said: “For the first time since the Great Depression, both advanced and emerging market economies will be in recession in 2020. The forthcoming June World Economic Outlook Update is likely to show negative growth rates even worse than previously estimated. This crisis will have devastating consequences for the world’s poor.” She added that the “great lockdown” differed from previous crises in that it was hitting services more than manufacturing, inflation was continuing to fall despite the impact on the supply of goods, and there was a “striking divergence of financial markets from the real economy, with financial indicators pointing to stronger prospects of a recovery than real activity suggests”. Despite the recent correction, Gopinath said the S&P 500 had recouped most of its losses since the start of the crisis; the FTSE emerging market index and Africa index were substantially improved; the Bovespa index had risen significantly despite the recent surge in infection rates in Brazil; and flows of funds to emerging and developing economies had stabilised."
"The UK’s new quarantine rules have come into effect from today. What are the new restrictions on international arrivals and how will they be enforced? Most people arriving in the UK will need to fill in an online form with contact and travel details and the address where they will be staying in quarantine for the subsequent 14 days. Self-isolating people can shop for essentials such as food and medicine. Random checks will be carried out by Public Health England. A large list of people, including anyone on government or defence business, foreign diplomats, regular international commuters, lorry drivers, medical workers and fruit pickers. By and large, the exemptions are international key workers. In England, fines start at £100 for not filling in the form, £1,000 for breaching self-isolation and possible deportation for foreign nationals not complying. However, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to say whether and how they will enforce the rules for any arrivals in their jurisdictions – an anomaly that IAG and others argue undermines the process. Britain’s three biggest airlines have started legal proceedings against the government in a bid to overturn quarantine rules. Although lockdown rules prevent overnight stays in the UK, and the Foreign Office has warned against all non-essential foreign travel, signs of progress had led airlines to plan more flights over the next two months, after grounding fleets in March. Holiday firms hoped that people would start booking trips. They argue that imposing the rules so late in the pandemic is ineffective, illogical, and will deter visitors and potential outward bookings long after the quarantine rules are lifted. The government says the measures are backed by science and will help prevent a second wave of Covid-19 cases imported from abroad, as other countries move out of lockdown, with restrictions on work and movement potentially eased further in the UK in coming weeks. Yes, many either ensured that arrivals self-isolated or closed their borders to foreign visitors. However, Britain decided against doing so early in the crisis and is now bringing in quarantine just as other EU countries are in the process of opening up."
"Personal after-hours shopping trips, online beauty appointments and entertainment for those queuing outside will form part of Selfridges’ coronavirus-era shopping offer when the retailer reopens on 15 June. The luxury department store group, which operates four shops in the UK, including its London flagship on Oxford Street, will not be able to reopen services such as beauty makeovers, hairdressing or its cafes and cinema because of Covid-19 restrictions. It is hoping a mix of virtual experiences and live entertainments – such as DJs – will help shoppers feel no less pampered. “We will be bringing a little bit more life and a joyful experience for customers who come to our stores,” said Meave Wall, the stores director of Selfridges. The retailer’s online sales have doubled since its stores closed when the UK went into lockdown. Treats including lipstick and lingerie as well as kit for lockdown life, including loungewear and kitchen accessories, have proved particularly popular. Food orders have also surged after the retailer widely promoted its food hall delivery service, previously the preserve of those in the know, so that shoppers within the M25 can order in. But the closure of all stores in London, Manchester and Birmingham has dealt a blow to overall sales. “I can’t wait to put on my heels and get back out there,” says Wall. The store has had time to hone its plans after opening the London food hall five weeks ago – with queues of customers waiting outside despite the low-key launch. The food hall’s greengrocer, bakery, butcher and greengrocer have enjoyed steady trade from local shoppers in Mayfair during lockdown and have branched out with new ideas including meal kits for pizza and tacos. The full reopening of the department stores – as non-essential retailers are allowed to welcome customers once again from Monday – will be heralded by window displays going up this week under the theme of “thank you”. Staff have contributed to giant thank-you cards for the displays that will refer to family members, key workers or others who have supported them. “We have given creativity over to our team across the stores and some of the input has been extraordinary,” Wall says. From 15 June, it will be possible to book personal shopping appointments for fashion or beauty – held either via video calls or after hours in the store where advisers will keep to the two-metre physical distancing rule. Store opening hours will be slightly reduced from 11am to 7pm in London, and similar times elsewhere and appointments can be booked for an hour before opening and an hour after closing. Unlike many fashion stores, Selfridges will also be reopening at least some of its changing rooms – with staff on hand to sanitise surfaces and steam-clean items that have been tried on. Items that can’t be steamed will be quarantined for a minimum of three days. Shoppers will be allowed to browse products in stores, with cleaners or shop assistants regularly wiping down surfaces. Tester pots in the beauty halls will not be available but assistants will be able to show products on their own skin from a safe distance. All staff will be given the option of wearing a mask and will have their temperature checked before they start work. Hi-tech people counters will ensure the stores do not get too crowded, with greeters on the door telling shoppers if they can enter or must wait. For those who don’t want to venture to a store, Selfridges is upping its online services with virtual gift advice and Instagram beauty tutorials. Video-enabled personal shopping, which has until now only been offered to regular clients, will be bookable online by anybody from 15 June. “We want to bring Selfridges into the comfort of people’s homes,” Wall says."
"High street retailers must give each shopper a minimum of 10 sq metres of space if they are to maintain social distancing rules, a new study has found, prompting businesses to complain that a lack of official guidance has left reopening plans in chaos. With 10 days to go until most non-essential shops reopen in England, a research paper by Manchester Metropolitan and Cardiff universities has concluded that larger shops must allow substantially more than a 2-metre distance for each person so that they can move freely. The study, which uses tessellated modelling - a combination of circles and squares to indicate available space – finds that people need 10 sq metres in smaller shops, 11 sq metres in larger shops, and 12 sq metres in outdoor spaces where they move more rapidly. That is up to three times as much space as the 4 sq metres needed around stationary people to maintain 2 metres of social distancing, according to the modelling. The expert analysis was produced because its authors say that the official advice on reopening fails to set out how to practically enforce the 2-metre distancing guidelines. Retailers say the report highlights the failure of the government to produce adequate advice for shops as they return to business. The official advice simply tells people to consider how many people can “reasonably” fit and to “limit the number of customers in the store”. “I’m surprised we haven’t got clear guidance that says how many people you can have in a shop of a certain size,” said Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA). “That would create an equal footing in every shop. The risk is that you get a race to the bottom on a street. Consumers will be wary of shops that have no hard and fast policies.” Large and small shops are scrambling to prepare for the reopening of the high street on 15 June, with businesses experimenting with measures from “browsing by appointment” to using floral designs for distance warning stickers because they are believed to be more reassuring. But Goodacre said the difficulty of estimating how many shoppers would be in an average store – alongside complicating factors such as the fact that customers were more likely to buy something if they had been queuing – made it hard to predict the impact of social distancing on business. With an estimated 70% of pre-coronavirus trade needed to break even, Goodacre said retailers would “be lucky to see 30-40% of sales with this kind of capacity”. The report’s conclusions are based on the speed and unpredictability of people’s movements, which means they are much more likely to get near each other when shopping than when queuing or sitting at a desk – and therefore require a bigger “halo”. Chris Turner, the chief executive of British BIDs – the representative group for Business Improvement Districts – said the report showed that maintaining a 2-metre distance was “hugely problematic”. “When you do the sums, you find that a small cocktail bar can fit about two people in,” he added. He warned that more planning needed to be done to prepare shared high street space, saying: “Retailers are finding creative ways to deal with this 2-metre malarkey – but they can’t afford to have them all queuing outside at the same time as it stands because if everybody does that it’ll be chaos.” Prof Cathy Parker, one of the report’s authors, said that “people don’t want to go from one place to another and see that the numbers are really different. Anything that’s going to make people think the rules are being broken and it’s a risky environment, that’s a problem.” “It’s fine to see everybody queuing up, that doesn’t look like a risk,” she added. “But telling people to keep 2 metres apart in shops where people are bunching … You can tell retailers to manage capacity but how do they work that out? None of it is visible in the government guidelines.” Ministers are continuing to debate whether social distancing rules could be relaxed to 1 metre without risking a rapid rise in the coronavirus “R” rate that will determine whether the UK faces a second wave of infections. Some shops, pubs and restaurants are calling for a change to 1-metre distancing, in line with World Health Organization guidelines. The research found that such a reduction would mean that only about 5 to 6 sq metres would be needed per shopper. But while Turner said that for many hospitality businesses “it will not be financially viable to reopen unless the distance is reduced from 2 metres” and called for the minimum to be reviewed, he noted that the uncertainty over the final guidance risked “tossing all the planning into disarray”. “There’s a real sense that the government is making it up as it goes along,” he said."
"Morrisons co-founder Sir Ken Morrison was not a fan of home delivery, which he saw as a step backwards to a boyhood ferrying groceries on a bicycle for his dad. However, like many of its customers during the coronavirus lockdown, his namesake supermarket chain has eagerly jumped back into the saddle – teaming up with Deliveroo’s two-wheeled couriers to deliver essential groceries and even hot meals. Before the pandemic hit the UK and dramatically changed shopping and eating habits across the country, only 7% of UK groceries were sold online. Since then it’s soared to 11.5%, according to market analysis firm Kantar. Under the chief executive, David Potts – a Mancunian who worked his way from the shop floor right to the highest ranks of Tesco before taking the top job at Morrisons five years ago – the company has positioned itself well for this new world, via alliances with Amazon and Ocado to access the fast-growing online market. The Deliveroo tie-up, via 130 stores, is one of three new delivery services introduced by Morrisons in just a few weeks since the coronavirus pandemic hit. While non-essential retailers that closed during the lockdown are preparing to reopen from Monday, supermarket chains such as Morrisons have been grappling with the challenges of an entirely new way of operating since March. The group has been able to triple its number of home shopping slots by starting to offer customers the option of picking up their own goods bought online, phone orders and a food box scheme, which started with essentials and has branched out into supplies for special occasions such as Eid and VE Day. The Bradford-based supermarket chain has also rapidly expanded its existing online grocery shopping services, with products picked from dozens of stores, as well as a distribution centre run by Ocado. The relationship with Amazon has also blossomed, offering the Prime fast delivery service from more than 40 stores, up from about 17 before lockdown. The service Potts is most proud of, however, harks back to earlier days that even Sir Ken could relate to. It is a phone service through which vulnerable and elderly shoppers can speak to a Morrisons employee , who will pass on their shopping list to a local store thatdelivers it the next day. Only set up in April, the doorstep delivery service dropped off its 100,000th order last week and operates from every local authority in the country. The company leased about 600 vans and deliveries are made by staff members, including new recruits such as former airline pilots who have signed up temporarily during the lockdown. “It’s an essential service for those customers. These people no longer have a carer able to do what they did or relatives or dependants either self-isolating or not allowed out,” says Potts. In a week where a supermarket assistant from Waitrose graced the front cover of Vogue, Potts says there has also been rightful recognition of ordinary workers’ efforts to feed the country. “All our colleagues have been putting their bodies on the line every day going to meet members of the public. One purpose has galvanised over 100,000 people – to serve people of Britain. We provide the most important thing outside of public health,” he says. “Our people are the new rock stars. They are working with the British public and doing their thing in society.” When demand soared in March, as shoppers stocked up amid fears of store closures and the need to self-isolate at home if they became ill, the company was forced to recruit 31,000 new members of staff for its stores, distribution centres and food plants. This included abattoirs, bakeries and fish processing sites. Staff absence ballooned, as those forced to isolate stayed at home, from the usual 3% to just above 20%, which Potts describes as “biblical”. Absence remains high at about 10%. There was also a need to step up food production and keep shelves stocked as families switched from eating out and buying takeaways to cooking everything at home. With home bakers desperate for supplies, for example, Potts bought a £540,000 flour packing machine from Italy so that catering-sized sacks could be repackaged for stores. “We’ve wanged it into our bakery in Wakefield and we’re packing flour,” he says. The company’s AGM in its home city of Bradford on Thursday will be a limited affair without any shareholders in attendance, in keeping with social distancing rules. However, despite this, the company is facing a potential shareholder revolt over a proposal for a 24% pension contribution rate for Potts and the chief operating officer, Trevor Strain, this year. Shareholder advisory group ISS is reportedly recommending a vote against the remuneration policy as a result. Potts, 63, says he never thinks about retirement despite having collected a string of very healthy pay cheques from Morrisons. “I feel fully employed in my job of feeding the nation,” he says."
"The luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda plans to make 500 workers redundant as it looks to cut costs under new chief executive, Tobias Moers, because of the slump in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company says it needs a smaller workforce because it is producing fewer cars than previously expected and due to improved productivity. Aston Martin says it will begin consulting employees and trade unions within days. It is also looking to cut costs in other areas, including contractor numbers, marketing and travel, as it battles its way back to profitability. It expects the cost-cutting to save £28m , with the restructuring costing it £12m in 2020. The company said it was still on track to deliver its first sports utility vehicle (SUV), the DBX, to customers in the summer, and says it has a strong order book for the vehicle, which is made at its factory at St Athan in south Wales. The DBX is seen as key for Aston Martin to boost its sales and appeal to new customers. The jobs announcement comes just days after Aston Martin sacked its chief executive, Andy Palmer, as part of a wider board overhaul, replacing him with Moers, who will join on 1 August from Mercedes-AMG, where he is the boss of the German carmaker’s high-performance division. The share price of the British company, known as the maker of James Bond’s favourite cars, has plunged since it floated on the stock market in October 2018. It is down 62% so far this year, currently trading at about 63p, giving the company a market value of around £1.04bn, compared with £4bn when it floated. The shares have traded higher since Palmer’s departure, but slid 8% on the news of the job cuts. The company recently came close to going bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history. The coronavirus pandemic forced it to close 90% of its global dealerships, and in May it reported a loss of £119m for the first quarter of the year. Lawrence Stroll, the billionaire who became the executive chair of Aston Martin after leading a £536m rescue deal in March, agreed in recent weeks to inject more than  £75m in short-term funding to enable the company to fight off a cash crunch."
"The gloomy prospects facing the UK car industry have been underlined by 2,000 new job losses and the worst May car sales since 1952. Only 20,000 new cars were registered in May compared with 184,000 during the same month in 2019, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. Just over half a million new cars have been sold in the first five months of 2020, compared with more than 1 million at the same point last year. The car dealership chain Lookers said it plans to cut 1,500 jobs and close 12 dealerships just days after car showrooms were allowed to reopen in England, although they remain closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The group, which operates 164 car dealerships, said the redundancies were needed to protect the long-term future of the business and it hopes to save £50m a year from the job cuts. It currently employs 8,100 staff and two thirds are on the government’s furlough scheme. The firm will begin consultations on the redundancies shortly, which will reduce its workforce by almost 20%. Warwickshire-based luxury car manufacturer Aston Martin Lagonda also announced 500 redundancies. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the second month of the car industry shutdown had had a “devastating impact” on the market and described this week’s dealership reopenings as “a pivotal moment for the entire industry and the thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.” Car sales in April were down 97% on 2019 levels. The new job losses come just days after McLaren announced it was axing 1,200 jobs. The dealerships closing down at Lookers, which sells vehicles for large manufacturers including Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen, as well as luxury brands including Aston Martin, Bentley and Ferrari, are in addition to 15 closures announced in November 2019. It will be left with 136 outlets. Lookers said it had taken orders for 2,865 new and used cars in the last fortnight – half the number of sales compared with the same period in 2019. Hawes said early reports from dealers was encouraging, but that it is too early to tell how demand would hold up over the coming weeks and months. He added: “Restarting this market is a crucial first step in driving the recovery of Britain’s critical car manufacturers and supply chain, and to supporting the wider economy.” Aston Martin recently came close to going bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history. The coronavirus pandemic forced it to close 90% of its global dealerships, and in May it reported a loss of £119m for the first three month of the year. The company has since been bailed out by billionaire Lawrence Stroll, who led a £536m rescue deal in March, and then injected another £75m  to enable the company to fight off a cash crunch. The jobs announcement comes just days after Aston Martin sacked its chief executive, Andy Palmer, as part of a wider board overhaul. A Mercedes executive, Tobias Moers, will replace Palmer. The sports carmaker has a total workforce of some 2,600, but the trade union Unite said the threatened losses would fall almost entirely on the Warwickshire plant in Gaydon, which employs about 1,600 people. Unite’s regional officer Tim Parker said the job losses would be “a massive hit” to the West Midlands economy and the supply chain. “We can ill-afford to lose such highly skilled, world-class manufacturing workers,” he added. He urged the company to seek only voluntary redundancies and the government to provide financial support, and added: “Aston Martin has been making use of the taxpayer-funded job retention scheme to furlough the majority of the workforce, it is now planning to throw a third of the Gaydon workforce onto the scrapheap – we think that is repugnant.” Mark Raban, Looker’s chief executive, said: “We have taken the decision to restructure the size of the group’s dealership estate to position the business for a sustainable future, which regrettably means redundancy consultation with a number of our colleagues. This has been a very difficult decision.” The company has received the initial results of an investigation into a potential fraud in one operating division of the business, which delayed the publication of its 2019 results. The group said an investigation conducted by accountants from Grant Thornton had shown the need for it to strengthen some “behavioural and cultural aspects relating to its control environment” and it was taking action to remedy this."
"Car dealers have reported relatively strong sales since the government allowed showrooms to reopen in England on Monday morning, more than two months after they were forced to shut in the coronavirus lockdown. Vertu Motors, a Gateshead-based dealership group, sold 451 cars on Monday and 411 on Tuesday, about 100 more than on an average day, said its chief executive, Robert Forrester. The easing of lockdown rules for showrooms and outdoor markets – with physical distancing measures in place – has allowed Vertu to reopen its 121 dealerships in England. About 50% of its 6,000 workers are furloughed, down from 83% at the peak of the lockdown. “It has started off stronger than I expected,” Forrester said. “There is some optimism in the customer base that they want to get out and get on.” The company’s 12 dealerships in Scotland remain closed because the devolved government has not yet allowed car showrooms to reopen. Interest has been broad across customers of different ages. Vertu service bookings hit a record high on Monday and Tuesday. Pendragon, another car dealer, opened 141 of 173 UK showrooms on Monday. It said 2,625 out of 7,250 employees were back at work on Monday. Kim Costello, Pendragon’s chief marketing officer, said demand was not far below pre-crisis levels, although she said it was too early to give exact sales data for June. The company, which struggled to a loss last year, had some demand from buyers looking for alternatives to public transport, she said. The government and environmental campaigners have urged people to consider cycling and walking to avoid increasing pollution, but carmakers said there was evidence in multiple countries of sales bolstered by a desire to avoid public transport. “We have seen quite a bit of traffic,” Costello said. “Some of it has been pent-up demand and some of it is people being extra cautious.” Costello also said Pendragon buyers continued to prefer online transactions and the home-delivery services that it introduced when lockdowns began. Seán Kemple, the director of sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, said: “Car dealers have been working hard to implement social-distancing measures, offering remote services, click and collect approaches and designated collection bays. These measures will put dealers in better stead for a post-Covid landscape where caution will prevail. “The huge release of pent-up demand from the past few months will boost the market in the short term, giving the industry time to work toward longer-term recovery.” However, concerns remain over the medium-term outlook for the sector. Cars are often the second most expensive purchase made by consumers, meaning the market is sensitive, particularly to rising unemployment. Will Craig, the managing director of the car-leasing comparison website LeaseFetcher, said in the past week there had been 70% increase in interest compared with mid-May, but with cheaper used cars more popular. Figures for the next few weeks could be distorted by the need for drivers to replace vehicles after the expiry of leases and personal contract purchase deals in the past two months, Craig said. However, prices had not yet dropped significantly, he added."
"Lachlan Beel, 17, was just over a year into his four-year apprenticeship as an engineering machinist when he got some bad news. His employer, which runs a machine shop and foundry in the Ipswich region of south-east Queensland, told him his apprenticeship was being cancelled because work had dried up amid the coronavirus crisis and it was likely to stay sluggish for at least six to 12 months. Hearing the news from the HR rep last month was a blow because Lachlan had really enjoyed learning new skills and making friends at the work site. He had hoped the training would eventually pave the way for him and his brother to start their own motor reconditioning business – but now he has to try to find a new employer. “I’m currently looking for another apprenticeship, but it’s just really hard right now. No one’s really employing – everyone’s scared,” he says. “I don’t want to be too far between jobs – people look at you funny, wondering why you haven’t got a job yet.” Experts fear Lachlan’s case is just the tip of the iceberg. The number of new apprenticeships and traineeships is expected to decline by 30% within two years, according to research from the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University. That equates to about 130,000 fewer new apprentices and trainees between the start of the pandemic and mid-2023. The number of currently enrolled apprentices and trainees is also tipped to go down. The Mitchell Institute education policy fellow, Peter Hurley, says apprentices are highly affected by what’s happening in the wider economy, because employers are reluctant to commit to a three- or four-year placement at a time of economic uncertainty. This trend could see young people drop out of the workforce or training system altogether and lead to skills shortages down the track. “These are really quite disastrous, cascading effects,” Hurley says. Labor’s education spokesperson, Tanya Plibersek, also worries about the implications. “The number of apprentices and trainees has been in decline for seven years, but without serious government action things are about to get a whole lot worse,” she says. “If the government fails to intervene, apprentice and trainee numbers will fall off a cliff – we will lose a generation.” The concerns about apprentices come at a time when the government has vowed to reform the broader skills and training sector. Scott Morrison, in a National Press Club address last month, said the system was “clunky and unresponsive to skills demands”. “We need to have this system more focused on what it’s actually supposed to do, and that is that someone who’s looking for training can get trained with skills that an employer might actually want,” the prime minister said. The Australian Industry Group agrees. Its chief executive, Innes Willox, says developing skills to drive the post-Covid-19 recovery will be vital, but the vocational education and training (VET) system “already struggles to deliver the skills that the economy needs”. Willox says while many of the training products are “fine”, the resources are too often out of date and inflexible. Training providers make selections that best suit their staffing profile and funding received, not the requirements of the local labour market. “Employers are left feeling that their needs and those of the economy have not been met,” he says. Plibersek contends the whole post-high school system needs fundamental reform. Australia’s training system, she says, has been neglected and undervalued for too long. And students are “paying more for qualifications that often fail to prepare them for good quality, secure jobs”. Plibersek says the training system can only be excellent when the public provider, Tafe, is well funded, yet it has suffered from funding cuts over the past seven years. Australia needs training courses that lay good foundations for long-term careers, not short-term, insecure jobs, she adds. “The best way to do that is to directly involve employers, unions and Tafe teachers, so people are being well trained for good jobs available in their local cities and towns.” Across the nation, the total reported spending on the VET sector is now at its lowest level in more than a decade, although the federal government is playing a bigger role than it did 10 years ago, according to a recent report by the Mitchell Institute. “Good intentions and bad policy” is how Hurley describes the funding trends. Attempts to open up the sector 10 years ago were done in a flawed manner, he says, and then some states were accused of taking advantage of federal funding to reduce their own contributions. Morrison has left the door open to increasing the $1.5bn component funded by the federal government – with conditions. His interest, he says, is in “investment that goes somewhere”. Likewise, the Productivity Commission suggests the $6.1bn in VET funding provided by federal and state governments each year needs to be more focused on helping students get the training they need. In a report published on Friday, it points to differences in the delivery of one of the most popular VET courses – the certificate 3 in individual support, which qualifies people to work in aged and disability care. This varies in cost around Australia, it says, with the standard subsidy differing by as much as $3,700. Jonathan Coppel, a productivity commissioner, says the pandemic driving Australia into recession only increases the urgency of tackling the “big reform questions” in vocational education. “Now must be that moment,” he says. The federal government says it is focusing on three key issues: the complexity of the VET system and its responsiveness to skills demands; the lack of clear information about industry skills needs; and improving the funding arrangements that are marred by inconsistencies and incoherence, with little accountability back to outcomes. A spokesperson for Michaelia Cash, the minister for employment, skills, small and family business, says the government wants to renegotiate the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development because it “sees the federal government hand over $1.5bn in untied funding each year with no oversight of how the money is spent, or what the efficient price for different training courses actually is”. The National Skills Commission will provide the government with advice on funding and will also work on improving labour market forecasting, “helping us identify where the jobs of tomorrow will be, and how to train for them”. But Hurley cautions against getting too prescriptive when it comes to the particular skills that are needed, saying we should also consider the rich learning experience that a student gains from training. “It’s interesting when industry comes along and says things like we want job-ready graduates. I mean, I would expect that most students want to be job ready as well. That’s why they’re doing a course.” It is, by no means, the first time a government has vowed to better link the system to skills needs. But Cash insists this time it will be different. “It’s clear that this time it is not business as usual, as Australia plots a course towards recovery from Covid-19,” the minister’s spokesperson says. “There is a clear urgency here to make high-quality training accessible in a way that helps position Australians for the jobs that will emerge. The jobs that are created coming out of the Covid-19 crisis will not be the same as the jobs that were lost.” In the meantime, industry groups and the Labor party say there is a pressing need to keep apprentices and trainees with their employers as businesses weather the Covid-19 economic storm. “We will need apprentices and trainees to help our economy recover,” says Plibersek, “and quality courses that set people up for successful careers including carpentry, plumbing, hairdressing, renewable energy, advanced manufacturing, aged care and disability care.” The government says its $1.3bn Supporting Apprentices and Trainees package announced in March will ensure up to 70,000 small businesses can keep around 117,000 apprentices and trainees across the country in work and training. So far, about $213m has been provided to support 46,600 apprentices, according to Cash’s office, excluding placements supported by the parallel jobkeeper scheme. But the Ai Group has called for wage subsidies for apprentices and trainees to continue until the end of next year because of fears about a drop-off in numbers caused by the crisis. It is urging the government to spend nearly $4bn between October this year and December next year to subsidise the wages of apprentices and trainees with a contract of training, regardless of company size, number of employees, age, occupational groupings or geography. The proposal is timed to kick in from the expiry of the jobkeeper scheme. But the benefits of such schemes have come under fresh scrutiny, with the Productivity Commission warning in its latest report that there is “little evidence that incentive payments to employers to train trade apprentices have been effective in increasing enrolments”. Lachlan is just hoping for action to help apprentices like him. He says if the government could work with businesses to keep apprentices and trainees employed, there would not be as many people claiming unemployment benefits. “It wouldn’t be just me – there’d be heaps of apprentices who have lost their job like me who would really like to finish their trade, and something from the government would be really helpful.”"
"The head of Rio Tinto’s iron ore division said he has “taken accountability” for the destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site but refused to give a direct answer when asked if the company knew traditional owners did not want the rock shelter destroyed, saying: “clearly, there was a misunderstanding”. In an interview on Radio National on Friday, the chief executive of Rio Tinto iron ore, Chris Salisbury, said it it had “taken accountability” for the destruction of the site, which was one of two destroyed in a blast to expand the Brockman 4 iron ore mine last month.  The two sites were located in Juukan Gorge in the Hamersley Ranges, about 300km inland from Karratha in Western Australia’s iron ore rich Pilbara region. Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people only learned of the planned detonation on 15 May, nine days before it took place. They said the loss was “soul destroying”. Salisbury said the company “regrettably … thought we had a shared understanding with the PKKP about the future of the sites” and would conduct a review to learn “how did this go wrong from our point of view”. He also refused to provide a direct answer when asked if a statement released by the company last week, which suggested the PKKP had only “recently expressed concerns” about the site, was incorrect. It released another statement apologising “for the distress we caused” but not the destruction, on Sunday. “We can’t keep looking backwards,” Salisbury told interviewer Hamish Macdonald. “We want to repair our relationship with traditional owners.” That review, which is being conducted with oversight from the Rio Tinto board, will not be released publicly but will form the basis of a submission to the West Australian government on the proposed reform of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972.  Rio Tinto received ministerial consent under section 18 of that legislation to destroy two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge. Consent was granted by the then minister for Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia in 2013, one year before an archeological survey, approved by Rio, found the site was of high archeological significance and showed signs of human occupation dating back 46,000 years, including throughout the last ice age. It’s the only known site in inland Western Australia to show that continued occupation.  The 2014 survey was a salvage mission that gathered more than 7,000 artefacts, including a plaited belt made from human hair that DNA testing revealed belonged to the direct ancestors of PKKP alive today, and tools and grinding stones which showed those tools had been in use far earlier than archeologists previously believed. The artefacts remain in Rio Tinto’s possession. Salisbury initially said he did not know their exact location, saying “I don’t think that’s important”, then said they were held on site at Brockman 4.  Salisbury said Rio Tinto had been working “very, very closely” with the PKKP since 2003 and he had “taken accountability that there clearly was a misunderstanding about the future of the Juukan Gorge”. He said the company would “overhaul” its heritage process and take a “leadership position” on the reform of the Aboriginal Heritage Act, which has been under way since 2018. “The findings of the review as they are relevant to WA legislation, then we will advocate on their behalf to ensure this does not happen again, certainly not at one of our sites, but also more importantly to raise the bar for industry,” he said. The Australian Greens have called for Salisbury to be sacked.  Rio Tinto has already made a submission to the current review of the legislation. In a 2019 submission to a consultation paper, it said it supported the repeal but that reform should not “introduce uncertainties or disruption to the implementation of existing agreements”.  It said that if traditional owners are granted the right to appeal decisions to destroy heritage there should be clear, fixed timelines “rather than broad appeal rights that may be used to prolong approvals or appeals at a critical point for a project”. Burchell Hayes, a traditional owner and director of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, told the ABC that information provided by Rio Tinto in meetings with traditional owners, including about developments that would have a direct impact on heritage sites, was “sometimes … at a level that a lot of our people cannot understand”. Lawyers for the PKKP wrote to the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, with an eleventh hour plea to save the site and were advised to contact the environment minister, Sussan Ley, to request she intervene on heritage grounds. The federal powers to stop the destruction of Aboriginal heritage are rarely used. Hayes said that Lees’s office was yet to return a call from PKKP lawyers. “It is [disappointing] because now it’s far too late, it’s already happened,” he said. Hayes said the destruction of the two sites was so distressing that he was not prepared to tell one of the PKKP elders, who lives near him in Onslow on the Pilbara coast, about the loss. “I don’t have the strength to go and tell her what’s happened … because she’s very elderly it’s not a conversation I want to go and have with her,” he said. “That’s her father’s country. We named that gorge after her father, my grandfather.”"
"In a perverse way, the record plunge in the economy in April is a measure of success. The government has got what it wanted from the lockdown: a fall in new cases of Covid-19, a drop in the death rate, a decline in the R number to below one. It has been the ultimate pyrrhic victory, though, because the collateral damage has been enormous. A 20.4% contraction in activity is what you get if you close schools, tell people to stay at home and only shop for essentials, close the restaurants and bars, and shutter the theatres and cinemas. From the moment the lockdown was announced at the end of March it has been obvious the April growth figures from the Office for National Statistics would be a horror show. All that was at issue was whether the news would be bad, really bad, calamitous or so far off the scale that even the most hardcore pessimist had not envisaged it. In the end, it was merely calamitous. It goes without saying the April performance of the economy was the worst for a single month on record. The decline was three times as big as that in March and 10 times as big as anything before Covid-19. The economy was 25% smaller in April than in February. Almost two decades of growth has been wiped out in two months. The ONS has only been publishing monthly data since 1997. But even had there been data going back 100 years, it is hard to believe anything could have matched the first full month of Covid-19 restrictions. The scale of the decline in activity should not have been a surprise because pretty much everything in the private sector, outside of food retailing, was either closed or running at a fraction of its normal capacity. Planes were grounded, restaurants and hotels were shut. It was impossible to get a haircut. Output of the accommodation and food services sector (hotels, restaurants and bars) was down by almost 92% on its pre-Covid level. There was a drop of 47% in arts and recreation. As things stand, the economy is on course to shrink by around 15% this year, something that has not happened for 300 years. To prevent that, three things need to happen. Lockdown restrictions have to be eased to speed up the pace of recovery. That has to be done without triggering a second wave of infections. Finally, more support from the Bank of England and the Treasury will be required. Of the three, the only certainty is that the government will provide extra stimulus in the coming months. The one crumb of comfort from the figures is that April will mark the bottom of the trough. Albeit less rapidly than in some other European countries, the economy started to grow again in May as lockdown restrictions were gradually lifted but the improvement will be marginal. Britain’s economy has fallen off a cliff. It will be a long climb back."
"The British car industry produced just 197 cars last month, down from 70,971 in April 2019, as the coronavirus lockdown caused every major UK factory to close. The output was the lowest level since the second world war, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Only a handful of premium, luxury and sports cars were manufactured, with some smaller factories able to put minor finishing touches on the vehicles. It was the second consecutive month of historically low production. In March 78,767 cars rolled off the production lines, down more than 47,000 on a year earlier. Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and BMW were among the major manufacturers that shut plants in March after the UK lockdown was imposed, faced with the prospect of parts shortages and difficulties protecting workers. The first large plants reopened at the start of May, although others, including Nissan’s Sunderland factory, the largest in the UK, will not open until next week. As well as the difficulties of sourcing parts, carmakers have also had to plan for significantly lower demand. Car dealers are among the non-essential retail businesses that can reopen on Monday with new physical distancing rules in place, with the industry hopeful demand for new vehicles will return relatively quickly, as happened after China lifted its lockdown. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With the UK’s car plants mothballed in April, these figures aren’t surprising but they do highlight the tremendous challenge the industry faces, with revenues effectively slashed to zero last month. “Manufacturers are starting to emerge from prolonged shutdown into a very uncertain world and ramping up production will be a gradual process, so we need government to work with us to accelerate this fundamentally strong sector’s recovery, stimulate investment and safeguard jobs.”"
"Potential bidders for Virgin Australia have expressed anxiety over the lack of financial support for the stricken airline from the Morrison government, Guardian Australia has learned. Sources close to the sales process said four shortlisted purchasers, who are due to lodge indicative bids for the airline on Friday, were becoming increasingly worried about a period estimated at between four to six weeks during which the airline will have no cash. The airline’s administrator, Vaughan Strawbridge, has recently indicated Virgin Australia may need a bailout to bridge the gap between any sale late next month and a creditors’ meeting likely to be held in August. Unions have also raised concerns about the role of the government’s liasion with Virgin, former Macquarie Group chief executive Nicholas Moore, who Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine told Guardian Australia has become an impediment to the sales process because he has no power to make decisions. Kaine said Moore was like a sheriff without a badge. “You’ve got to give him the badge, the authority, and the chequebook, the money, and let him get on with the job,” he told Guardian Australia. The government has been approached for comment. Virgin Australia’s crumbling financial position – it had just $100m in the bank a fortnight ago and continues to burn cash – and the lack of clarity from government has fuelled fears among potential buyers that the sale process might fail and Virgin Australia collapse into liquidation. A complete collapse of Virgin Australia would throw 10,000 people into unemployment during a brutal economic downturn and risk handing rival Qantas a near-monopoly over Australian air travel. “It’s certainly not guaranteed this airline will fly again,” one source with knowledge of the bidding process told Guardian Australia. Another well-placed source said bidders were “nervous at the moment”. “They’ll just walk away,” the source said. Virgin Australia’s directors called in administrators after the Morrison government rebuffed its repeated pleas for government help to see it through the almost complete grounding of its 144 airplanes due to coronavirus travel restrictions. The airline owes more than $6.8bn to creditors including aircraft financiers and leasing companies, bondholders, suppliers and employees. As of Thursday, there were four bidders in the race – American investment group Bain Capital, global investor Cyrus Capital, a consortium made up of investment group Oaktree Capital and specialist airline investor Indigo Partners and Australian private equity group BGH Capital. The bids stand to be whittled to two after indicative offers are lodged on Friday. However, the process has been complicated by the continuing interest of Canadian giant Brookfield Asset Management, which had previously been regarded as a leading contender. Despite pulling out of the process, Brookfield remains interested in participating in the purchase of Virgin Australia in some fashion. It also remains indirectly involved as a shareholder in Oaktree. In briefings with stakeholders, the four bidders have set out radically different plans for a reborn Virgin Australia. Sources said BGH plans to restart as a bare-bones airline, with just a handful of planes, which would result in the loss of most of the 10,000 jobs at Virgin Australia. The Oaktree and Indigo consortium plans to turn Virgin Australia into a budget airline, the sources said. Cyrus Capital wants to maintain a stripped-down version of the current airline, by reducing the number of different aircraft it flies and cutting some regional and international routes, while Bain Capital is regarded as the front-runner because it has spent significant resources setting up a well-regarded team of local advisors. However, all four potential bidders, and Brookfield, are understood to have expressed interest in some kind of government help to bridge the gap between agreeing to buy the airline and getting approval from the creditors. Options that have been canvassed include a government loan, the commonwealth purchasing a stake in the airline, the extension of jobkeeper payments to Virgin Australia employees after the scheme is supposed to finish in September, or a government guarantee of tickets sold by the airline. Bidders also want the government to stop airports taking away crucial take-off and landing slots, which are usually allocated on a “use it or lose it” basis, and seek a raft of tax and fee concessions from state governments. Sources close to the process said time for the government to make its position clear was running short because, in addition to the cash burn problem, Virgin needed to be able to sell tickets for travel in August, after the administration is due to end. This was difficult when customers were uncertain they would be able to fly or get their money back, the sources said. Kaine said he met with Moore on Tuesday afternoon to raise his concerns. “Government inaction is now having a material effect on the quality of the airline that gets back in the air – if it can get back in the air,” he said. “There’s already one bidder that’s sat outside of the process because they’re concerned about the funding gap.” The government remains tight-lipped about its willingness to support Virgin Australia through the process. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said: “The government supports a market-led solution for Virgin Australia.” “We will continue to work closely with the administrator.”"
"Britain’s manufacturers are poised to make tens of thousands of workers redundant after a worse-than-expected slump in orders, prompted by the pandemic that has left many firms struggling to survive. A survey by the manufacturers’ lobby group, Make UK, found that 25% of companies are already drawing up plans to cut jobs in the next six months. A further 45% say they are considering redundancies. Only 30% said they expect to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic with all their staff on the payroll. The worst-hit firms, which account for more than a quarter of those planning to make redundancies, expect to cut more than half their workforce while another 30% said they would need to lose a quarter of their staff over the next six months. Orders for cars, heavy machinery and manufactured equipment has declined sharply in recent weeks despite an easing of the lockdown to combat the Covid-19 outbreak in parts of Europe and the US. The Make UK chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said: “There is no disguising the fact these figures make for awful reading with the impact on jobs and livelihoods across the UK.” Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s interest rate setting committee, warned that the outlook for British businesses looked bleaker than it did earlier this month when the central bank said growth could be restored by the end of next year. He said the “searing experience” of the coronavirus crisis would leave its mark long after the lockdown was lifted and the central bank should risk pumping too much stimulus into economy rather than too little to combat a severe downturn. Saunders, who was one of only two members of the nine-strong MPC this month to back an increase in the stimulus programme, said he expected an acceleration in the already high rate of unemployment and an increase in the number of companies going bust would leave long-term scars on badly affected industries. The Office for National Statistics said the hospitality, retail and leisure industries had already suffered a steep decline in job vacancies, with low-income workers the worst affected. The number of vacancies on offer had more than halved since severe restrictions were imposed in March, with even bigger drops in the retail and hospitality sectors. Official monthly figures for vacancies are only available up until April but the ONS said that by using data from the online job search engine Adzuna it was able to add the current state of employment opportunities to its list of Covid-19 tracking indicators. Adzuna said its breakdown of the vacancy data showed job vacancies in hospitality and catering had decreased by 86% since the start of the crisis, with retail down by 70%. While the gradual reopening of construction sites and non-essential shops had led to some industries stabilising, Adzuna said recovery was likely to be slow as employers re-entered the market cautiously. A decline in job vacancies across key sectors such as hospitality had disproportionately affected lower-income workers, with vacancies down by 64% for jobs paying between £15,000 and £24,999."
"Boohoo has bought out a minority stake in its Pretty Little Thing brand for more than £260m just days after criticism over a potential deal. The online fashion specialist said it was paying an initial £269.8m – potentially rising to £323.8m – for the 34% stake in Pretty Little thing owned by Umar Kamani, the son of Boohoo’s chairman and co-founder Mahmud Kamani, and business partner Paul Papworth. The company said the acquisition would create “significant value for the group’s shareholders” and was an “important further step towards achieving its vision to lead the fashion e-commerce market globally by accelerating full ownership of a brand that is in high growth with enormous growth potential ahead of it”. The deal appears to be an attempt to draw a line under criticism from the hedge fund investor ShadowFall, which this week published a note suggesting that a recent £200m fundraising effort by Boohoo could be handed over in dividends or buyout costs to Umar Kamani. Shares in Boohoo had slumped about 12% since publication of the note, which suggested the buyout of PLT could cost nearly £1bn in 2022. ShadowFall also suggests the funds from Boohoo’s share placing could be used to buy up I Saw it First, an online fashion business set up by Jamal Kamani, the chairman’s brother. On Thursday, Boohoo’s share price rebounded more than 16% as analysts welcomed the PLT buyout. Matthew Earl, the head of ShadowFall, who is known at the “Dark Destroyer” for the effect his research can have on companies’ share prices, said that in his view the PLT buyout announced on Thursday “raises more questions”. “Above all, this is another example of the Kamani family reducing its ownership in the company largely using cash,” Earl said. He questioned the relatively low valuation placed on the stake in PLT in the deal, in relation to the value of the group. Earl also said that shareholders were likely to be bemused by Boohoo spending the proceeds of its £200m share placing on the buyout of PLT, when a detailed statement put out on Tuesday confirmed earlier statements that the funds would be used “to take advantage of numerous opportunities” in the global fashion industry. Boohoo did not mention the potential fast-forwarding of acquiring the PLT stake. “To raise the money, suggesting that opportunities may emerge, but with no specific targets and then to buy PLT two years early is perplexing,” Earl said. Boohoo said that after the PLT acquisition it retained a strong balance sheet that would enable it to continue disrupting the fashion industry and take advantage of “numerous M&A opportunities that are likely to emerge in the global fashion industry over the coming months”."
"A courier company that delivers coronavirus samples for testing has been plunged into an industrial dispute over the dismissal of staff who claim they are being victimised for trade union and whistleblowing activities. The confrontation at the Doctors Laboratory (TDL) in London relates to 10 cycle and walking couriers who have been told they are likely to be made redundant during the pandemic. Eight of those affected are taking claims to an employment tribunal, supported by the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gig economy. TDL, which transports Covid-19 samples, denies its employees have been put at risk. It says no one has been chosen for redundancy because of their whistleblowing or trade union activities. The company says those affected are in central London, where there has been a “significant downturn” in business and where cycle and walking couriers mainly work. The dispute escalated on Wednesday after IWGB members at the company voted to strike in protest at the redundancies and over safety issues in transporting medical samples, according to the union. TDL has more than 150 couriers, about half of whom are members of the IWGB. There have been previous disputes at the company in which a number of those now likely to lose their jobs were participants. In legal arguments submitted to the employment tribunal on behalf of the claimants, lawyers said: “The claimants all feel victimised for daring to take part in trade union activities and these decisions will have terrible consequences on their private and family lives. “Many of the claimants have children to support and wonder how they will be able to adequately support them if they are dismissed and unable to find a job.” Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the IWGB, said: “The company has selected the most active trade union members including the main trade union representative, Alex Marshall, [for redundancy].” TDS said in a statement: “It’s exceptionally disappointing that a minority of our couriers have voted to strike in the midst of this pandemic. The IWGB union, which represents TDL’s 157-strong courier workforce, balloted its 80 members, 46 of whom voted to strike, on a number of unfounded allegations relating to proposed redundancies and courier health and safety, which TDL does not recognise or accept. “Like many organisations across the country who are taking action to ensure their survival and future sustainability, TDL is making adjustments as a result of the pandemic, and is proposing to make its 10-person pushbike and walking courier fleet redundant. “This is due to a very significant downturn in the inner London postcodes in which they operate. Proposed redundancies are not a consideration ever made lightly, even in these exceptional circumstances. These proposals are currently subject to consultation with the 10 couriers and no decision has been made.” It added: “It is inconceivable that TDL would deliberately expose any of its workforce, of whom its courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now. All TDL’s health and safety protocols, which include access to Covid-19 testing for those with symptoms, are compliant with current regulations and UK government guidelines [and] are kept under constant review by TDL’s director of health and safety.  “We are working closely with our couriers and will continue to do so. We are absolutely committed to ensuring there will be no disruption to our normal service.” "
"Cineworld is planning to reopen all its UK cinemas in July as the government eases coronavirus lockdown measures. The world’s second-largest cinema chain, which operates 128 venues in the UK and Ireland, is hoping to reopen in time for Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, scheduled for release on 17 July, followed by the Disney blockbuster Mulan. “Cineworld currently anticipates that government restrictions related to cinemas will be lifted in each of its territories by July,” the company said. “Subject to this and confirmation of the schedule for film releases, Cineworld anticipates the reopening of all of its cinemas in July.” The company, which has 787 venues globally, said reopening cinemas would go hand-in-hand with physical distancing and hygiene rules. “Cineworld has put in place procedures to ensure a safe and enjoyable cinema experience for its employees and customers,” the company said. The news provided cheer for investors after Cineworld, which has furloughed staff, cut its dividend and slashed executive pay. Shares rose as much as 25% in early trading. Cineworld also announced it had secured financial support to allow it to continue to stay afloat even if cinemas were forced to remain closed for the rest of this year. It has secured a deal with lenders to waive a financial covenant test in June, and agreed easier terms for its next deadline in December. It has also agreed an increase of $110m (£90m) on a credit facility, and a further $45m in UK government-backed loans to support large businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis. “Cineworld, as always, greatly believes in the theatrical experience and is fully committed to be the best place to watch a movie,” the company said. “Cineworld is excited by the great movie line-up to follow the reopening of cinemas, starting with the highly anticipated new Chris Nolan movie Tenet and immediately after that with Mulan, a new Disney adventure movie.” Rival Vue, one of Europe’s largest cinema operators, has also said it intends to reopen in July with measures including physically isolating family groups and staggering film times to reduce crowding. Vue has previously said other measures would include controlling entrances and exits and reducing the overall capacity of each film screening. In Berlin, one theatre ripped out many seats to ensure safe distancing between members of the audience. Some cinema operators have installed plastic screens between seats. A small-scale reopening of cinemas in China in mid-March was abruptly halted by the government amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections."
"EasyJet has announced plans to cut up to 30% of its workforce, or 4,500 employees, as it prepares for lower customer demand when it resumes flying in the shadow of the coronavirus crisis. EasyJet expects passenger demand to return slowly, reaching only 30% of capacity in the final quarter of the year compared with the final quarter of 2019. It does not expect demand to reach 2019 levels for about three years. The Luton-based airline employs 15,000 people and will start a consultation process with staff in the coming days. The airline plans to reduce its fleet of aircraft to 302 planes, 51 fewer than it had planned ahead of the outbreak of Covid-19. EasyJet has been heavily criticised by its biggest shareholder and founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, for refusing to scrap a £4.5bn order for more than 100 new aircraft from Airbus that he believes jeopardises the airline’s future. The carrier said on Thursday it also intends to reduce costs by revising its contracts with airports and ground handling, reassessing what it spends on maintenance as well as renegotiating what it spends on marketing. The airline had previously announced it would resume flights on a small number of routes from 15 June, with increased onboard safety measures, including the mandatory wearing of face masks, as it restarts flying after grounding its fleet on 30 March. Johan Lundgren, easyJet’s chief executive, said the airline was focused on “doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success”. He added: “We realise these are very difficult times and we are having to consider very difficult decisions which will impact our people – but we want to protect as many jobs as we can for the long term.” The British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa) criticised easyJet for not discussing its plans with the union and said it would need “a lot of convincing” that the airline needs to make “such dramatic cuts”. The Balpa general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: “EasyJet staff will be shocked at the scale of this announcement and only two days ago staff got a ‘good news’ message from their boss with no mention of job losses, so this is a real kick in the teeth. Those staff have taken pay cuts to keep the airline afloat and this is the treatment they get in return.” The airline is planning deeper job cuts than its low-cost rivals – Ryanair said it would lay off 15% of its staff, and Wizz intends to reduce its workforce by 19%. EasyJet will initially restart domestic routes in the UK and France in June, along with flights from four destinations elsewhere in Europe, where it says there is sufficient demand to support profitable flying. Further routes will be added in the following weeks, as and when passenger demand rises and lockdown measures ease further across Europe. However, the airline would not fly to Italy if the government prolonged physical distancing rules on planes beyond 15 June, Lundgren said in an interview with an Italian newspaper. “It would be impossible for companies to operate with only a third of the seats sold, it would be harmful to the recovery: the country risks falling behind,” hewas quoted by Corriere della Sera as saying on Thursday. The airline said it was “not clear … what underlying scientific evidence there is” for the UK government’s decision to introduce a two-week quarantine for almost everyone arriving at ports and airports, including UK citizens, from 8 June. Lundgren told journalists the UK was introducing restrictions just as they were being lifted in other parts of Europe. “How do you explain to British people that the Germans and other European nationalities are going to holidays in Greece and parts of Spain where there is less risk of being infected than in places in the UK? Why would they need quarantine? What’s the rationale behind that?” The coronavirus pandemic halted the majority of air traffic across Europe and has put easyJet and its competitors under severe financial pressure. The airline said it was trying to reduce its costs and conserve cash but could not give guidance on its forecast financial results for 2020."
"Norwich Market, having survived wars, plagues and recessions in over 900 years of trading from the same site, has reawakened once again after the coronavirus shutdown had closed all but a handful of stalls selling food and essential goods.  From early Monday morning, traders selling fruit and vegetables, vintage clothing and household items, rearranged their stalls, hoping to entice the shoppers slowly returning to the quiet city centre. Council workers had hurriedly installed a one-way system in the market alleyways and laid floor stickers to encourage shoppers to keep 2 metres apart. A steady trickle of customers were buying seasonal peonies and baby’s breath at Pond’s Flowers, next to Gentleman’s Walk, which has been run by Alexander Pond’s family for more than a century. “We’re starting on the bottom rung of the ladder, building it back up,” said Kevin Howes, who has worked on the stall with Pond for 25 years. Only about a fifth of the 90 businesses that operate at the market, known for its distinctive candy-striped roofs, had raised their shutters on Monday morning. Many are waiting for high street stores to reopen later this month and for footfall to pick up in the city.  “I’m not sure how many traders will come back,” said Mark Wright, the chair of the market traders’ association and owner of Taxi Vintage Clothing, “I hear some have done well online.” Without his own online business, Wright was hoping his rail of floral Hawaiian shirts would catch a shopper’s eye so he could “break the ice” and make his first sale in 11 weeks.  Norwich city council granted traders a rent holiday during the shutdown but do not intend to cancel rent payments. “We will need to reexamine rents at the end of the summer,” said councillor Matthew Packer. “We are very stretched financially.” Dale Barker had got off to a flying start – he was greeted at 8am by a customer eager for him to open his foam and upholstery supplies stall. Barker was glad to return and, like some of his fellow traders, said a £10,000 small business grant from government had “kept the business afloat”.  From mid-morning, a pair of uniformed council enforcement officers patrolled the aisles to enforce physical distancing – even if the market wasn’t inundated with visitors – instead of their usual role handing out parking tickets. By lunchtime a well-spaced queue had formed at Ron’s Fish and Chips. “People are slowly getting their confidence back,” said James Read as he handed a bunch of bananas over the trestle table separating him from his customers. Nigel Simmeth had cycled 10 miles from nearby Wymondham for toast and coffee at Debs Champion’s stall.  “It’s good to get some sort of normality back,” said Simmeth, 65. “Whatever normality is”. Meanwhile Debs was chilling a bottle of prosecco in her fridge to toast the market’s return with her fellow traders at the end of the day. "
"The pilots union, Balpa, has warned prospective pilots from starting any training courses, saying they would be left with huge debts and no prospect of employment. Trainee pilots could end up owing more than £100,000 and would not find a job to pay back loans, the union said. About 200 trainee pilots in UK flight schools who were set for jobs with easyJet have already had their conditional offers of employment withdrawn, after the airline looked to cut hundreds of pilot jobs in the summer as the effects of Covid-19 battered the industry. Balpa said it was an extraordinary step for them to issue the warning, but it would be irresponsible not to act. Wendy Pursey, its head of membership and careers, said there were about 10,000 unemployed commercial pilots across Europe, including 1,600 in the UK, while many others were working part-time or on reduced pay. The easyJet trainees now had “no clear route to even a licence, far less a job”, she said. Others attempting to enter the aviation industry have been hard hit, including 122 trainee air traffic controllers at Nats being laid off before gaining a licence. The difficulties were underlined by British Airways telling staff on Thursday that many more of them would be placed on furlough, as the airline scales back flights through November. Its few remaining long-haul services from Gatwick will be suspended. Under the lockdown rules that came into effect on Thursday, all holiday or leisure travel is banned with fines for breaches starting at £200. A BA spokeswoman said the airline had been “urgently reviewing” its schedule but would be operating flights to “bring home thousands of customers currently abroad, and ensuring people who are permitted to travel in and out of the UK can continue to do so.” The industry body Airlines UK said the extension of the furlough scheme, which announced on Thursday, was welcome but warned that carriers would “urgently need access to further liquidity measures to shore up their balance sheets”, with more flights grounded. EasyJet confirmed it had had talks with the German government about available support measures, but denied it had made a formal request for funds."
