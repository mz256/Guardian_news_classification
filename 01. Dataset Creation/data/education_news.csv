"Students have called on the universities minister to provide emergency financial support to cover fees and rent after she announced that most of them should not return until at least the end of January. Michelle Donelan also told international students preparing to travel from overseas that they should “consider whether they in fact need to travel to the UK at this time”. The spread of a new Covid-19 variant and the extension of tougher tier 4 restrictions across part of England were cited by Donelan as reasons why the government had to consider further steps to reduce transmission in education settings. However, the announcement on Wednesday evening left students scrambling to make plans, with some directly challenging Donelan on social media to help them with costs including rent for accommodation that will not be used and fees for course that will not be delivered as envisaged. “I’ll be blunt, students want to help but without the government helping them with this endeavour, and to make it cost-effective to them, the plan will fail,” Joshua Connor, an international relations and politics student at the University of Lincoln, wrote in a letter to Donelan. Giving an example of the financial burden he and others faced, Connor told her that he would have to pay £2,100 to the university for the spring term on top of having lost several weeks of accommodation because of travelling home for Christmas during a government-designated “student travel window”. From 5 December to 25 January, he would have paid £1,057 for accommodation he has been unable to use. Like others, he was considering whether or not to travel to use his rented accommodation. Further guidance from the government is expected next week. University authorities have been writing to students in the past 48 hours to advise them of the Department for Education announcement. Cambridge University’s vice-chancellor, Stephen Toope, said in an email to students that the delay was “potentially disruptive and difficult to students”. The academic registrar of Newcastle University, Lucy Backhurst, told students: “We appreciate these last-minute changes will bring their own challenges to many of you.” Support would include January rent rebates for students living in university-owned, university-managed and partnership accommodation arrangements. Universities UK, which represents the sector, said the announcement by Donelan “would understandably raise further issues and uncertainty – for students, universities and staff – which will need to be addressed by government over the coming weeks, including the need for financial support, regulatory flexibility and assessment changes”. The government said it was asking universities to restrict the number of practical students returning from 4 January to those reading subjects in areas including medicine, dentistry and related subjects, social work and courses requiring professional assessments for January and which cannot be rescheduled. Other students with “compelling reasons to return” were also identified. In a separate letter to students, Donelan said her department had worked with the Office for Students to remind education providers that they could use existing funds for hardship support. She added that the government was making available up to a further £20m on a one-off basis to support those who needed it most.",education
"The UK’s largest teaching union has called for all schools in England to remain closed for two further weeks at the end of the Christmas break after a government U-turn which means all primaries in London will be shut next week. The call from the National Education Union came after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, reversed his decision that primary schools in some parts of London should open on Monday. The government bowed to protests and legal pressure from the capital’s local authorities. Williamson said the decision had been a last resort. Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said the government needed to close schools in England before infection rates got out of control. “If you allow the conditions to get so bad in the end you’ll be closing schools for longer. “What the government should be doing is what the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are doing. You don’t get this chaos in the other countries of the United Kingdom. And does the government really believe that somehow Covid in England is different than the other countries of the UK? “I find the government’s recklessness in this regard, both with educational professionals’ health, but also with community health, and the questions increasingly around children’s health, inexplicable.”  Under the government’s initial plan, secondary schools and colleges were set to be closed to most pupils for the first two weeks of January, while primary schools within 50 local authorities in London and the south of England were also told to keep their doors shut until 18 January. But the list omitted several London areas where Covid-19 transmission rates remain high including the borough of Haringey, whose leaders said they were prepared to defy the government and support any schools that decided to close to protect staff and pupils. The protests from local authority leaders came to a head with a letter to the education secretary from nine London authorities asking for their primary schools to be closed to all except vulnerable children and those whose parents were key workers. The action provoked an emergency Cabinet Office meeting on New Year’s Day, which signed off on the revision, adding the remaining 10 London education authorities to the government’s “contingency areas”. In the capital, Richard Watts, the leader of Islington council, said: “I’m very relieved to hear this news. There was enormous concern from parents and schools who couldn’t understand the rationale for why some boroughs were excluded. “We welcome that the government has, belatedly, listened to local areas. We will be working with our schools to ensure they offer high quality online learning and can welcome pupils back as soon as Public Health deem it to be sensible.” The Department for Education (DfE) confirmed the move in a statement: “In light of Covid case rates rising rapidly across the capital and ongoing engagement with London leaders and the evidence submitted, the government has reviewed the London boroughs where the contingency framework will apply, with all further boroughs added.” Pupils not eligible to attend in person will be provided with remote learning by their schools. Early years settings will remain open, as will alternative provision and special schools, the DfE said. “We must make this move to protect our country and the NHS. We will continue to keep the list of local authorities under review, and reopen classrooms as soon as we possibly can,” Williamson said. The move means schools in Camden, the City of London, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Islington, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth and Lewisham will be closed to most pupils from Monday until at least 18 January. After the move was revealed by the Guardian, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the news saying it would mean all the capital’s primary schools would be treated the same. But the decision leaves question marks over the government’s decision-making, and stands as a further humiliating reverse for Williamson during his tenure as education secretary. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “This is yet another government U-turn creating chaos for parents just two days before the start of term. “Gavin Williamson’s incompetent handling of the return of schools and colleges is creating huge stress for parents, pupils, and school and college staff and damaging children’s education.” Several local authorities had been preparing legal challenges to keep their primary schools closed. “We are advised by leading counsel that the omissions from the list are unlawful on a number of grounds and can be challenged in court,” the letter from the nine London authorities sent to Williamson stated. Schools in the contingency areas may remain closed after 18 January, with the Daily Telegraph quoting a senior government source: “We have been careful not to say they will definitely reopen on 18 January because we don’t know that.” Meanwhile, the DfE faces a further rebellion from secondary school leaders in England over its demand that coronavirus testing of pupils is to be mandatory from 11 January. School leaders and teaching unions have been meeting over the new year period to discuss a response to the demand, with many secondary heads arguing that the testing regime is impractical and unworkable.",education
"Until late on Friday evening, the answer had been that most primaries and attached nurseries would open on 4 January, but would remain closed within 50 local authorities spread across London and the south of England, including Kent and Essex. In a U-turn, however, the Department for Education announced that all London primary schools would keep their gates closed until at least 18 January. The schools are required to remain open for remote learning, and for the children of key workers and those classed as vulnerable to attend school in person. The government has not divulged the basis on which it selected the 50 areas where primaries had been told to shut. It said the “contingency framework” plans were being implemented in local areas “with high rates of infection and with significant increases in seven-day case rates, and pressure on the NHS”. All 50 were in tier 4 areas but others in tier 4 had not been included. This led to confusion in areas with higher rates of infection but where primaries had been told to remain open. Haringey council, which has higher rates of infection than some areas on the list, said it would defy government advice and advise its primaries to close to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers. The leader of Greenwich council, which was also not included in the government’s contingency framework, said: “There appears to be no logic to how this list was brought together.” A group of London councils, including Haringey and Greenwich, jointly petitioned the government, asking for their primary schools to be able to close from 4 January. The Department for Education had said it would review the decision on school closures in the 50 named local authorities by 18 January but that move is now redundant. Possible next moves include adding more councils to the list of areas where primaries should close, adding secondary schools to the closures or an even wider closure across England. The latter is a serious possibility on the basis of scientific advice, such as research by Imperial College London into the new Covid-19 variant, B117, which found that it was directly affecting a greater proportion of people aged under 20.",education
"In parts of England, parents face more uncertainty as some local authorities delayed the reopening of schools due to the rise in coronavirus cases in the country.

"The only black composer has been dropped from the syllabus of a popular A-level music exam, along with the study of jazz, because of course changes demanded by the coronavirus crisis, according to the examination board involved. Pearson Edexcel defended its decision to axe the work of the British jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine along with five others, including the Oscar-winning British composer Rachel Portman, because of “feedback from teachers that the volume of work was too high and needed accelerated change in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic”. Pine’s album Back in the Day had been included in the Pearson Edexcel A-level course’s “popular music and jazz” section, alongside Revolver by the Beatles and Hounds of Love by Kate Bush. But after next summer Pine’s work will be removed and jazz dropped from the renamed “popular music” category. In response to the decision, Pine said: “I was deeply honoured to be included in the A-level syllabus, it is a place in the UK education system that I never imagined to be in. “As a musician that tours the world representing who we are, to have a place in the awareness of our young during these times has been inspiring. I have met so many students who have told me that studying my music has contributed to their musical development, they are as aware as I am of the absence of British jazz composers to the syllabus until now. “I hope that there will be more UK composers who will be asked to contribute to such an important, influential subject.” Portman, the first woman to win an Academy award for best original musical score for her work on the 1996 film Emma, has also been removed after Pearson reduced the number of compositions to be studied from 18 to 12. The Cuban ensemble La Familia Valera Miranda was among those dropped. Those retained include the US film and television composer Danny Elfman, best known for his theme tune for The Simpsons, along with JS Bach and Igor Stravinsky. Only four women remain on the new syllabus, including the sitar player and composer Anoushka Shankar. A spokesperson for Pearson said: “We completely agree it is vital pupils get to study music by composers from different cultures and backgrounds. We want to ensure A-level music remains as rich and diverse as possible and will be reviewing this specification again in time for students taking exams from 2022 onwards.” The exam board said in its announcement that “although six set works have been removed from the specification and will no longer appear in questions on the exam paper, centres should add these to the wider listening list as they can prove to be valuable pieces” in answering exam questions. The A-level music syllabus offered by another exam board, AQA, has also been trimmed after Ofqual’s requirement last August “to accommodate potential public health requirements” as a result of the pandemic. In contrast to Pearson, AQA opted to shrink the amount of performance and composition required from students, without reducing its set works. The works in AQA’s pop music category include Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé as well as the black British composer Labrinth. Its jazz option includes the work of the Welsh pianist Gwilym Simcock, alongside Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.",education
"The government’s plans for mass Covid testing of secondary pupils after Christmas are in disarray after unions told members not to work on the scheme over the holidays, branding it “inoperable” and “undeliverable”. A statement by the four main teaching unions and the National Governance Association advised staff to delay preparations until the start of term on 4 or 5 January and refuse to work on the scheme over the Christmas break. “It is our view that due to the chaotic and rushed nature of this announcement, the lack of proper guidance and an absence of appropriate support, the government’s plan in its current form will be inoperable for most schools and colleges,” the statement said. “Schools and colleges simply do not have the staffing capacity to carry this out themselves. As such, most will not be in a position to carry this out in a safe and effective manner.” The Royal Statistical Society said it had “major concerns” that the government’s plans may be unsafe because the tests were “imperfect and must be used with great care”, and it called on ministers to “review them with urgency”. On Thursday the Department for Education announced that the return of secondary school pupils in England would be delayed by a week and replaced by remote learning for most year groups, to allow schools to test all pupils using rapid lateral flow tests. Students and pupils at secondary schools and colleges are to be offered two rapid tests three days apart during the first week of term, with positive results confirmed by a lab-based PCR test. But the government’s plan ran into controversy for lacking detail and for having been announced as schools close for the Christmas holidays. In a measure of the DfE’s desperation to complete its own work on the programme, the Guardian has learned that civil servants in the department have been offered a £1,000 bonus if they volunteer to work over Christmas. The offer was announced by Susan Acland-Hood, the DfE’s permanent secretary, to staff on Thursday. The DfE’s announcements have not included any additional payments for school staff working over the holiday period. School leaders have already been told to remain on call until 23 December to conduct track and trace for pupils who tested positive for the virus at the end of term. Teachers and heads have told the Guardian of exhaustion as they come to the end of “a year of hell”. “I know heads who haven’t stopped since March and it’s not sustainable. At the best of times we work 50-plus hours a week. Now there are some teachers pushing 70-plus,” said one teacher, Matt David. The advice from the four main unions – the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the National Education Union and the NASUWT – reflects deep-seated anger among teachers at the DfE’s latest demands, and its failure to publish more details until just before Christmas. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT, said that while teachers supported the use of mass testing, there was not enough time to safely organise the screening of hundreds of pupils packed into just a few days by 4 January. “Given the lack of detailed guidance or a coherent plan, we do not believe schools or colleges will be able to begin working on this before the start of next term. We will fully support members who choose not to implement the plan if they consider it to be unworkable in their schools, as the government guidance allows for this,” Whiteman said, emphasising that the DfE had labelled its plan an “offer”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of ASCL, said: “It is not possible to recruit and train all the people needed to carry out tests and put in place the processes that would be necessary, over the Christmas period, and it is extremely regrettable that the government has given the public an expectation that this will happen.” The schools minister, Nick Gibb, hosted an hour-long briefing for MPs at short notice on Friday and was unable to allay their concerns about whether schools would be given the resources they need to carry out the program. “It was just dire,” said one person on the call. “The thing that really riled people was that he said several times: ‘This is a good news story.’” The Royal Statistical Society said it had concerns about the scientific basis and safety of the government’s plans for testing in schools, and about “inaccuracies and omissions in the information provided to schools” by the DfE, noting that trials in Liverpool found tests missed more than half of positive cases, including 30% of those with high viral loads. “In the new testing programme for schools, individuals who have been exposed and have received a negative result will still have a significant risk of having the Covid-19 infection and spreading it to others,” it said. Anger at the lateness of the government’s announcement was also shared by school governors, whose national representatives were perplexed at suggestions by Gibb that they pitch in as volunteers. Sam Henson, of the National Governance Association, said: “We’ve heard from a lot of members today who are just angry. Some say they would support their communities of course and would do what they can but others feel that it’s just totally inappropriate. There seems to be an assumption that schools just have this bank of volunteers, which just isn’t true.” One chair of governors tweeted: “Not a chance of any of us volunteering for this. We are eyes-on, hands-off, and certainly not spare capacity to help the government. I do have some time during the day but this crosses a line.” Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: “We have been calling for mass testing for months, it’s a really important thing to do – but the implementation of it, coming out in the most half-baked way in the week before Christmas, when school leaders and staff are exhausted, is really unsatisfactory.”",education
"My husband, Karl Chidsey, who has died aged 83, was a popular teacher at Brighton Polytechnic (now University) on various subjects related to psychology and business within the business school. He was a lecturer there from 1969 until taking early retirement in 1991, after which we moved to Valencia in Venezuela, where he worked as an unpaid adviser to the catholic priest Padre Rivolta, founder of Hogares Crea, a local organisation set up to help with the rehabilitation of drug addicts. Karl also established his own clinical psychology service, running it at our home until 2011, by which time he had dealt with 4,000 cases. Karl was born in Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex to Patricia (nee Le Beau), a care assistant in an old people’s home, and her husband, William, a fitter for the Hunslet Engine Company. Karl’s early days were spent in south Wales in the village of Senghenydd, where his paternal grandfather was a miner. He passed the 11-plus at the age of nine, after which he was awarded a scholarship to start early at Cockburn high school in Leeds, when a family move took them to the city. After national service in Aden in the early 1950s, Karl gained a degree in psychology at the University of Liverpool in 1963, followed by a master’s in ergonomics at Loughborough University in 1966. He then worked at the Furniture Industry Research Association, designing ergonomic chairs, before moving to Lewes in Sussex to lecture at Brighton Polytechnic.  Karl’s first marriage, to Catherine Platt in 1960, ended in divorce in 1980. He and I met at the University of East Anglia, where he was teaching an Open University course and I was writing my PhD thesis. We married in 1981. He is survived by me, two daughters, Karen and Jenny, from his first marriage, two of his three siblings, Bob and Philip, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",education
"Imperial College London has blamed a “clerical error” after it emerged that its longstanding policy on bullying was altered days before staff were told of a completed investigation into bullying allegations against the world-leading university’s president. Alice Gast and the chief financial officer, Muir Sanderson, this week admitted to bullying colleagues after allegations against them were investigated during the summer by a QC who was commissioned to carry out an inquiry. They have remained in post at the London university despite mounting pressure to step down. The Guardian has now learned that changes were made without customary oversight earlier this month to a policy, which had the effect of watering down how severely bullying was regarded. The previous version said that bullying was “gross misconduct”. After the changes, the policy said that “all incidents will be taken seriously”. Hours after it was contacted by the Guardian about the changes, the university said that the policy had been “mistakenly edited and published without approval from the director of HR or due process”. It said the original policy would continue to apply. Clarifications have now also been published on the university’s website stating that the changes were due to a “clerical error” and the provost has launched a formal investigation to find out what occurred. The Office for Students (OfS), which has a role in regulating universities, is now looking into the controversy amid mounting disquiet among staff, students and others who are concerned that Gast and Sanderson are still in post. Anger has been exacerbated by the fact that at least two of the people who were bullied have left the university. Before the changes, Imperial’s policy on harassment and bullying stated: “Harassment, bullying and victimisation are viewed as gross misconduct, and disciplinary action, including dismissal, may be taken if any complaint of harassment, bullying or victimisation is upheld.” It was this wording, which had been in place for at least three years, that informed the investigation into the bullying allegations. However, shortly before staff were told of the inquiry, the wording of the policy was changed to read: “Zero-tolerance means any complaints must not be ignored and will be investigated. All incidents will be taken seriously and could provide grounds for disciplinary action that may lead to dismissal from the College.” Days after the new wording was put in place, an email to staff on 4 December first mentioned the investigation into the conduct of the president. In its clarification, the university said it was a mistake in the updated policy that meant that the passage referring to “gross misconduct” was left out. It is alleged that the revised policy, published after questions from an MP in parliament first made public mention of the bullying inquiry, was relied upon to provided a post-hoc justification for Gast and Sanderson’s conduct. A spokesperson for Imperial said: “We reject these allegations.”  Imperial said on Friday that the policy, which was in place from earlier this year, continues to apply and the passage flagged by the Guardian should not have been removed. The definition of zero tolerance, which had also been inserted, had not yet been consulted on, according to the clarification. The Imperial branch of the University and College Union called this week for the resignation of Gast and Sanderson for gross misconduct, with the union citing the college’s own statutes. It is unclear who approved the revised policy or who was responsible for setting in motion moves to make the changes.",education
"With our exit from the European Union just days away, we should be saying a very firm and British goodbye. Yet for many in the UK, it seems that on the eve of departure it is more a case of au revoir. The number of people learning a language in Britain has risen twice as fast as the rest of the world in the last year, according to online learning platform Duolingo, and one of the fastest growing groups is those learning French. Thousands more are learning Spanish, German, Italian, or other EU languages – with some of them hoping to improve their language skills to a level where they qualify for citizenship of a European country. Maxine Brown, a 27-year-old second year economics student, has been learning Danish for the last six months with the intention of moving to Denmark to pursue a postgraduate degree and work in environmental projects. “I’m interested in the resource side of economics and Denmark is really leading the way,” she said. “So I started learning Danish in May. Very quickly I was able to start reading newspapers and I joined online forums to really immerse myself and started listening to the radio to pick up the tones and the sounds.” Since British citizens will no longer have the right to live and work in EU countries after 31 December, Brown will need to pay tuition fees in full and needs a residence permit which requires a grasp of Danish. “If you want citizenship in Denmark, you need to be resident there for nine years without breaks,” Brown said. “But they also have other routes, so you can get a job or go via education or invest. Just because we’re leaving the EU, that doesn’t deter me because it’s something I want to do.” The UK is now one of Duolingo’s top five countries by the total number of daily learners, according to the app’s UK general manager, Colin Watkins, with a rise in new learners of 132% on last year. “Events like Brexit and Covid plus cultural moments like the Olympics [in Japan] are driving the change,” he said. “Brits now want to be better citizens of the world when we travel, when we do business, when we meet people in the UK.” Watkins said many of the 15 million people who have signed up to Duolingo’s online courses are not aiming to become fluent but to gain a basic level of understanding. “As one of our first courses French was already very popular, so to see it make the top five shows new learners have chosen it because they want to travel there in the future, maybe want to do business, emigrate, or just pick up on what they learned in school.” Other language learning apps are seeing similar rises. Memrise saw a large increase in new users in March, and 70% of people using its platform are learning Spanish or French, while German, Italian and Japanese are also popular. Formal language learning in schools has declined substantially over the last 15 years, but there are some signs of encouragement. The British Council’s annual Language Trends survey showed a marked increase in children who took French or Spanish at GCSE in 2019, although A-level entries were still down. And despite the decline at schools, adults continue to value language highly, the British Council found. During the spring lockdown, 10% of adults in the UK began learning a foreign language or returned to one after a break. A third of those surveyed said that Spanish was the most important language for young people to learn, followed by French at 20% and Mandarin at 18%. ",education
"Guidance warning schools against using resources from organisations that have expressed a desire to end capitalism will be reviewed by the Department for Education (DfE) following the threat of legal action. The guidance, published in September, was criticised by teachers, MPs and human rights groups over the risk it could impinge on freedom of belief, speech and expression in the classroom. In a pre-action letter sent in October, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators (Care) and Black Educators Alliance (BEA) said the guidance would prevent teachers using material from groups including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, limiting anti-racism teaching. On Monday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, notified the group’s lawyers that “the wording of the guidance is being reviewed in light of issues which your clients have raised”. In the guidance issued for school leaders and teachers in England, the DfE categorised anti-capitalism as an “extreme political stance” and compared it with opposition to freedom of speech, antisemitism and endorsement of illegal activity. The guidance said schools should not “under any circumstances” work with or use material from groups that do not “condemn illegal activities done in their name or in support of their cause” or promote “victim narratives that are harmful to British society”. A letter sent to Williamson in early October by the law firm Bindmans on behalf of Care and BEA claimed the guidance failed to properly account for issues of discrimination, and that it was vague and poorly written. The groups launched a crowdfunding page to proceed with a judicial review if the department refused to withdraw the guidance. The announcement of a review was welcomed. “Within the process of evidence collection, we have heard from many students, teaching staff and parents of the impact of the guidance, which would see conversations on injustice and inequality outlawed from the classroom,” a spokesperson for Care said. Rachel Harger, of Bindmans, said: “We hope that given the obvious failures and shortcomings of the current guidance the secretary of state will accept that, as part of this review, a broad consultation with teachers, parents and trade unionists is not just desirable but entirely necessary. We will now stand by our clients as they anxiously await the outcome of this review.” A DfE spokesperson said: “We have provided schools with the materials that will give them the confidence to construct a curriculum that reflects diversity of views and backgrounds, including how to offer a balanced presentation of opposing views where political issues are brought to the attention of pupils. “We are clear that schools should not under any circumstances work with external agencies that take or promote extreme positions or use materials produced by such agencies and have set out a non-exclusive list of extreme political positions in the guidance. “We are reviewing wording of the guidance to explore where we can provide further clarity on these points.”",education
"My dad, Michael Richardson, a nationally prominent figure in the field of lifelong learning, has died at the age of 81. Mike began work within the education setting at Alfreton Hall Adult Community Education Centre run by Derby county council. He joined the Open University in 1970 and was based at Newcastle and then Manchester. After 21 years he was appointed pro-vice-chancellor of the OU, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1994. Throughout his time at the OU, Mike was hugely humbled by the stories of countless people who sacrificed so much to continue their learning as adults. In 1990 he was appointed the director of the Board of Extramural Studies at Cambridge University (now the Institute of Continuing Education), based at Madingley Hall, and the family moved to Cambridge where my parents perfected the art of punting on the Cam. At Madingley, Mike was instrumental in moving the continuing education programme into a recognised credit framework, raising the status of Cambridge’s provision. He oversaw the completion of a major building project to provide better facilities for residential learners. He was born in Aurangabad, Maharashtra State, in India, to Emery Richardson, a missionary and vicar, and Margaret (nee Elliott), a teacher and “vicar’s wife”, and had a sister, Ann. After attending Pocklington school in Yorkshire, he went into national service as an officer cadet in Cheshire. He studied theology at St John’s College, Cambridge, where, through his sister, he met Gillian Jones, who was at Girton College. They married in 1965. A highly regarded member of the wider academic community, Mike was a fellow of Wolfson from 1991 to 2003 and emeritus fellow from retirement. He was secretary of the Universities Association for Lifelong Learning (formerly the Universities Association for Continuing Education) from 1998 to 2002, a time when there were many challenges facing the adult education sector. He retired in 2003 and the following year he and Mum moved back to Corbridge, Northumberland, where they had lived from 1970 until circa 1978. There, Dad became a well-known member of the Rotary Club. He found the years following Mum’s death in 2015 very difficult. After a stroke in 2019 he was determined to live an independent life at home. The restrictions of the past months made him feel very isolated, but he remained in regular contact with his family and friends. He received a huge amount of practical and emotional support from the Corbridge community, which gave him care and companionship. Known for his integrity, tenacity and desire to make a change for good in people’s lives, Dad was a modest, approachable, generous gentleman who touched the lives of many people and inspired countless others.

"Schools should be allowed to remain closed for the first two weeks of next term, the UK’s biggest teaching union has said, as a leading scientist warned of early signs that a new Covid strain may infect children “slightly more effectively” than previous variants. The National Education Union (NEU) called for online lessons to replace in-person teaching for all but vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers in England’s schools, so that children can be tested. Prof Neil Ferguson, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said preliminary data hinted that the variant could more effectively infect children, though causality had not been established. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Ferguson, whose modelling led to the first UK lockdown, said: “I think what we’ll see in the next two weeks, while schools are still closed, is probably all the variants of the virus in circulation declining, but we’ll be tracking very carefully whether we can see differences in that rate of decline.” Prof Wendy Barclay, another Nervtag member, explained how the mutations on the variant’s spike protein – the part of the virus that allows it to infiltrate cells in the lungs, throat and nasal cavity by interacting with a receptor called ACE-2 – could explain the potential link in children. “The previous virus had a harder time finding ACE-2 and getting into cells, and therefore adults who have abundant ACE-2 in their nose and throat were easy targets and children were difficult to infect,” she said.  “The newer virus has an easier time doing all of that and therefore children are equally susceptible, perhaps, to this virus as adults … It’s not because the virus is specifically targeting them, but it’s just that it’s now less inhibited.” Many secondary pupils in England face a staggered return to class from 4 January to accommodate mass testing in an effort to address the high number of cases among children. The latest data from the Office of National Statistics showed that the Covid positivity rate in England was highest among school-aged children. Data on the new variant’s spread across all age groups suggests it has a growth rate of up to 71% higher than other strains. Based on modelling that incorporated genomic data and results of positive tests, scientists on Monday said they had “high confidence” that the variant appeared to be more transmissible, though causation is unclear. There is no evidence the variant makes Covid more severe or undermines the effectiveness of vaccines, though monitoring is ongoing. Scientists interviewed by the Guardian suggested it was too early to reach conclusions on the variant’s transmissibility in children, particularly given factors such as underlying community infection rates partly due to laxer attitudes to social distancing. “We’ve got to be really careful not to speculate because there’s already a lot of speculation about this particular variant – there’s circumstantial evidence that it’s more infectious but there’s still a lot of work to be done,” said Prof Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London. Dr Muge Cevik, a member of Nervtag, said: “I think it’s not unsurprising that … if the variant is more transmissible, you would expect more transmission across all age groups … We need to have much more contact-tracing data to understand the relative effects of transmission among the children, so I think the data to analyse this is limited.” Cevik added that it was easier to detect infections in schools because there was more of an appetite for testing compared with sectors where there were economic consequences if workplaces closed down. Closing schools should be the last measure taken, if at all, the scientists argued. “It’s easy to start to think of this variant as a different virus, but no, it’s the same virus. And it’s transmitted in the same way,” said Pillay, suggesting that the focus should be on supporting schools to operate safely. In an open letter to Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, the NEU said a two-week delay to in-person teaching should be used to begin vaccinating staff as well as NHS and care workers. Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the NEU, said local directors of public health should spearhead mass testing. “We believe that the government could support them via a national advertising campaign to find the staff and volunteers needed, as you did in finding the volunteers to help the NHS at an earlier stage,” they said. “We would hope that such a system could then test all children, at their school site, prior to a return to in-person teaching from 18 January.”",education
"My former colleague John Friend, who has died aged 89, was a biochemist at Hull University, where he was head of the plant biology department from 1969 until his retirement some 30 years later. He was also a keen advocate for Judaism in the Hull area, encouraging local people to gain a better understanding of the religion into which he was born and committed to promoting interfaith understanding. John was born in Liverpool to Richard Friend, a draper, and his wife, Lilian (nee Jonas). At Liverpool Collegiate school he gained his A-level equivalents when only 16, so had to wait two years before attending Liverpool University, where he achieved a first in biochemistry, followed by a PhD. He then moved to Cambridge University to study the effects of low temperatures on plant pigments that contribute to photosynthesis and which give many fruits and vegetables their distinctive colours. This work, important for food transport and storage, gained John another PhD. I met him when he was appointed as a lecturer in botany at the University of Hull in 1960: I attended his first lecture there as a new undergraduate. John soon became a senior lecturer and then, in 1969, professor and head of the botany (later renamed plant biology) department. At Hull he continued his earlier research, together with new studies of how crop plants resist infection by pathogens, and his wider activities included becoming a signatory to the 1972 Blueprint for Survival, an early environmental manifesto. He also served as dean of science, then pro vice-chancellor (science) of the university. Visits to other biochemists around the globe took him to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, leading to a renewed interest in the teachings of Judaism. Being liberal-minded and not uncritical of Israeli politics, John believed in tolerance and the need to foster intercultural understanding through collaboration. He therefore became the first chair of the Hull Academic Study Group on Israel and the Middle East, organising academic exchange visits. After he retired, John became active in the Hull and East Riding Interfaith group, welcoming schoolchildren and students to the Hull Reform Synagogue and patiently answering questions with his characteristic quiet enthusiasm. He also chaired the local Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education. John was a gentle, cultured and compassionate man with an infectious sense of humour and an acute appreciation of life’s absurdities. He was a generous friend to many, and a dedicated family man. He is survived by his wife, Carol (nee Loofe), a former student counsellor at the University of Hull, whom he married in 1956, and their three children, Mark, Jenny and Richard.",education
"After months of insisting A-level and GCSE exams in England would go ahead, the government confirmed this week they would be cancelled, with Northern Ireland also cancelling exams on Wednesday night. This follows the precedent set by Wales and Scotland, which made the announcement months ago. The Guardian spoke to four school students about their reaction. In Sheffield, 16-year-old James Childs said that while he wanted to sit his GCSEs, making students take them as normal would have been unfair. Since he had returned to school in September, he had been required to self-isolate three times, missing six weeks of in-person learning, whereas some students had not had to isolate at all. “I don’t think that being at home is the same as being at school, because you miss out on class discussions and the sharing of ideas, it’s not the same when it’s a Powerpoint and a worksheet,” he said. “Really, there’s no way exams could go ahead, because it wouldn’t be a level playing field. I know some kids who haven’t isolated once, and others who’ve had to isolate for every [coronavirus] case in our year group. It just wouldn’t be fair.” Childs felt frustrated about the government’s communication over exams. “From September, the government kept insisting they wouldn’t cancel exams, then with the announcement on Monday, they said that exams couldn’t go ahead but that there would be alternative arrangements,” he said. “But, you think, what is that alternative arrangement? You shouldn’t have done that until you’ve got a concrete plan.” Grace Leaman, who is studying A-levels in history, English literature and philosophy in Dover, said she would have preferred to sit her exams, as they were the most fair and accurate method of assessing students. “People tend not to work as well throughout the year,” Leaman, 18, said. “They aren’t as motivated, or they have other things to do like university applications. There’s a different mindset during the end-of-year exams, because you know that those exams will get you into uni.” Leaman felt the government had not truly understood the impact their handling of exams had had on students. “Last year, the issues with the algorithm [which under-marked many students], showed the government didn’t trust the opinions of teachers who had been teaching students throughout the year,” she said. “I understand the government have to deal with it somehow, but I don’t think they realised how heartbroken people were, and how anxious they’ve been through the pandemic to get the grades they deserve. “I do worry that the most disadvantaged students will miss out on fair grades,” she added, “because of their teachers underestimating their ability through centre-assessed grades, or another classist algorithm which forgets the humanity of a child and reduces them to a letter which does not represent their true ability.” For 19-year-old Omer, also from Sheffield, the news was deeply disappointing, and he worried it could have serious implications for his future career as hecould no longer resit an exam to achieve the grades he would need. “I was studying for my A-levels last year, but I didn’t get the grades I wanted to do nursing, so I thought I’d resit my A-level biology this year,” he said. “I had a mock exam coming up in a few weeks, but that got cancelled, so now they don’t have anything to use for my centre-assessed grades.” Omer said it felt like “another year has been wasted”. “I prepared for it [the exam] really, really well,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do now. I’ve got my grades from last year, but I wanted to improve them and do a course I really wanted to do. It’s really frustrating and stressful.” Max Hamilton, a 17-year-old student taking A-levels in English literature, history, and sociology in Cambridgeshire, described the cancellation of exams as “too little, too late”. “The lack of clarity given to students who are sitting exams in summer is honestly astounding,” he said. “Throughout all lockdowns, students have lacked effective communication with the government and have been treated almost as an afterthought. “The past two years have been extremely strenuous for students, due to uncertainty and having to adapt to remote learning both in lockdown and while self-isolating. It’s been very stressful. Even over the Christmas holidays, I haven’t been able to focus properly because of all the stress.” While Hamilton was concerned about the implications of personal opinion or bias in teacher-assessed grades, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds or people of colour, he was relieved exams would not be going ahead. “I’m thankful that the government has finally listened to reason and closed schools, which will hopefully prevent thousands of potential cases and deaths as a result of transmission between students and vulnerable people,” he said. “I’ll miss the opportunity to show my talent, but you can’t show your talent if you don’t know the content.”",education
"The week of chaos in England’s schools deepened on Wednesday after education secretary Gavin Williamson was unable to explain how students will be awarded exam grades this summer and threatened teachers with inspections. The confusion came as heads around the country reported primary schools being inundated with children despite the national lockdown, and urged parents to be honestabout whether they are really key workers and need the emergency provision. Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Williamson said it was “time to trust teachers, not algorithms”, and that school-based assessments would be used to award GCSE and A-level grades to avoid a repeat of last year’s exam disaster. But in the same breath, Williamson urged parents to report teachers they thought were failing to meet the government’s new targets for three to five hours of remote learning each day, and said inspectors from Ofsted would be called in to investigate their complaints. School leaders were left frustrated by the lack of support or detail in the statement over how to prepare staff and students for assessing A-level, GCSE and BTec grades, coming after Boris Johnson admitted schools could have to continue remote teaching beyond February. “It is frustrating that there is not an off-the-shelf plan B ready to go. We have repeatedly called on the government and the regulator to prepare such a plan in the event of exams being cancelled, and have repeatedly offered to work with them in doing so,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. “However, ministers have been so busy insisting that exams will take place that they have failed to ensure that there is a contingency system which can be immediately rolled out. This is, frankly, a dereliction of duty.” Schools across England yesterday reported a huge rise in demand for places for the children of key workers, with one primary in Manchester saying that the numbers attending had now risen from 30 pupils during the first lockdown in March to more than 200, out of 500 on its roll. The increase has been partly driven by new guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) widening the expansion of “critical workers” to include university staff and other professions, while the DfE has also allowed pupils without access to digital devices or adequate study space at home to choose to attend school. University employers in centres including Oxford, London and Nottingham have written to staff this week to highlight their children’s eligibility for school places, including among parents working from home. Among those encouraged to attend in-person are children classed as vulnerable by the government, with school intended as an important place of safety. Alternative provision and special needs schools are also remaining open. Williamson’s statement gave schools little hint of how they will be expected to assess grades, claiming that “the department and Ofqual had already worked up a range of contingency options”, but that “the details will need to be fine-tuned in consultation with Ofqual, the exam boards and teaching representatives”. Government sources say one option being considered would resemble the model being used by Wales, with school assessments “informed” by the sitting of formal assessments for core subjects such as maths and English.  In Wales, the assessments are to be produced and marked externally by the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) examination board. In answer to a question from an MP, Williamson did announce that Sats – national standardised tests taken by in years two and six at primary schools – would also be scrapped this year. That announcement caught school leaders by surprise, with some suggesting that Williamson had not intended to make it. The crush of pupils attending school in person has deepened the difficulties faced by teachers having to also provide remote instruction for those remaining at home. Williamson again surprised the profession by revealing a new mandatory requirement for “high quality” remote teaching of up to five hours a day depending on the age of the child. “If parents feel their child’s school is not providing suitable remote education they should first raise their concerns with the teacher or headteacher and, failing that, report the matter to Ofsted,” Williamson said. “Ofsted will inspect schools – of any grade – where it has serious concerns about the quality of remote education being provided.” But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the government was still failing to provide many schools with devices such as laptops to allow disadvantaged pupils to access remote learning, despite the pandemic being in its 10th month. “It is therefore nothing short of disgraceful that the government should choose today to start threatening schools about the quality of their remote learning offer,” Whiteman said.  “Schools are keeping going in the most extreme circumstances right now – support is needed to overcome the challenges they face, not threat or sanction. “The profession has predicted all the difficulties the government has failed to navigate schools through. I therefore appeal again to government to work alongside the profession constructively in place of threats and empty words.  “The announcements today do nothing to redress the damage the government has caused to children’s education.” Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, accused Williamson of leaving “chaos and confusion” in his wake, but the government’s press secretary Allegra Stratton insisted that Boris Johnson continues to support Williamson. “It’s a huge brief and the prime minister believes the education secretary is doing it to his utmost ability,” Stratton said. Asked whether the prime minister believes Williamson is the best person for the job, she replied: “Yes.”",education
"Pressure is mounting for universities in England to offer rent rebates and academic safety nets for students, as staff and students say they have been left in limbo while institutions await further instruction from the government after a last-minute change to the start of the spring term. The National Union of Students and the University and College Union, which represents staff, are urging universities to waive charges for the accommodation students are unable to use until face-to-face teaching resumes. For most students this is scheduled for when lockdown ends in mid-February, although the UCU, which tracked more than 50,000 Covid cases across campuses last term, is pressuring universities to remain online until Easter. Some universities have already committed to moving teaching online longer term. The London School of Economics (LSE) has informed students that all compulsory teaching, learning and assessments will be online for the remainder of the academic year. Halls of residence and some parts of the LSE campus will remain open, including limited access to the library. Its management said it hoped to provide voluntary in-person teaching from mid-February, depending on the progress of the pandemic. LSE’s director, Minouche Shafik, said: “We have made these decisions with a heavy heart … We appreciate that students and staff valued face-to-face teaching in Michaelmas term, which was successful due to us all working together. However, the safety of our community is paramount.” University College London has told its students to avoid returning to campus until the end of February, with studies online until at least 22 February. The University of York has moved all teaching online for the entire spring term, but specialist teaching in labs and performance spaces may go ahead in person later in the term if government guidance permits. Financial support for students is patchy across universities. Some, such as Newcastle, have said no students will pay rent for the halls it operates until they return to campus. Universities where there has been pressure from student activists withholding rent as part of a growing wave of rent strikes, including Bristol and Manchester, have introduced 30% discounts on rent until face-to-face teaching resumes. Other universities have no plans for rebates at present. Lancaster is instead offering some hardship bursaries, while Middlesex is considering requests on a case-by-case basis. Student Roost, which runs private halls across the UK, is also not offering rebates, although this is under review. The NUS is also asking universities to reinstate “no detriment” policies, which provide a safety net for students from achieving below the average of their earlier grades due to disruption of their education. This demand has been echoed by thousands of students at universities across the UK, including Nottingham, Edinburgh, UCL and Exeter, who have signed open letters. Many universities are awaiting government guidance before taking final decisions on the compensation and adjustments to offer their students. The Department for Education does not yet have a publication date for this and has not outlined what it will contain. This guidance will also not apply to the majority of students who live in private rented accommodation. A parliamentary petition asking that students in England be allowed to leave their accommodation contracts early due to Covid-19, which would replicate law in Scotland, has gained more than 50,000 signatures. Matthew Robinson, a third-year student at Liverpool who signed the petition, said the student-focused letting agency that runs his property contacted him by email after the government’s announcement. “They preemptively told us all they wouldn’t be giving rent rebates because the property was still ‘available for use’, which when we’re not allowed by law to return I find questionable,” he said. Students are also stepping up grassroots campaigns for fee discounts. A parliamentary petition asking that fees be reduced from £9,250 to £3,000 has gained nearly 350,000 signatures. On 5 January, the Open University trended on Twitter as students turned to social media to complain that their degrees were now more comparable with its online courses, which cost £6,192 annually. Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president, said: “As a result of [the government’s] incompetence students and the higher education sector are left scrambling for answers and guidance. Students urgently need the certainty that, having lost out on so much, they will now receive proper support on everything from housing to exams, to mental health.” Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said: “Yet again, ministers have failed to prioritise education, and the chaotic way Boris Johnson has told institutions to move online has left staff and students in limbo. “The government needs to let students learn online until at least the end of this term, allow university students to be released from accommodation contracts if they wish, and provide staff and students with the resources to make sure everyone can study remotely and gets sufficient mental health support. “The government must also underwrite the sector against any lost income and any extra costs created due to these last-minute changes.”",education

"Secondary schools in England are unlikely to fully reopen until after mid-January at the earliest, according to new plans being thrashed out within government that would also see school staff be given high priority for Covid vaccinations. According to government sources, ministers are torn between heeding its scientific advisers over the rapid spread of the new Covid variant, and warnings from the Department for Education that switching to remote learning for the whole of January would make it hard for schools and colleges to reopen again before Easter, jeopardising summer exams. The revised timetable being discussed would see only older students who are taking exams, such as A-levels and GCSEs, receiving remote teaching for the week from 4 January, effectively giving most secondary pupils an extra week’s holiday while schools and colleges gear up to carry out mass testing. For the week beginning 11 January, those taking exams, mainly years 11 and 13, would be allowed back in the classroom while others were taught remotely, followed by all year groups returning in person from 18 January. Primary schools are unlikely to be affected, and would return according to their normal timetable. Vulnerable secondary-aged children and children of key workers would be able to return to school from 4 January, regardless of year group. Boris Johnson is said to be considering the proposals and the final decision is likely to be announced on Wednesday alongside the tier review for England and more data on the national infection rate. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We haven’t had any contact from the government since Christmas about whether or not the spring term will go ahead as planned, and it has been intensely frustrating that there has been a swirl of speculation with no clarity and with less than a week before term begins. “We are expecting to speak with the government shortly and we will be pressing for schools and colleges to be given clear guidance as soon as possible.” The government is also likely to reveal that school staff, including teachers, would be moved into a higher priority group to receive Covid vaccinations, but still below NHS workers and the most vulnerable groups. “We would very much welcome any plans to prioritise school and college staff for Covid vaccinations because they are being asked to go into an environment which is inherently busy and crowded,” Barton said. “Vaccinations would give them extra reassurance, reduce the need for staff to self-isolate, and mean less disruption.” The new timetable effectively pushes back the government’s plans for a staggered start by a further week compared with the plans it announced before Christmas. The DfE will also recommit to regular mass testing of asymptomatic school staff and secondary school and college students. The government is expecting secondary schools and colleges to recruit and organise volunteers to conduct testing, while those unable to do so will require 10-days self-isolation for staff and students before returning to school. The government has promised headteachers the assistance of 1,500 military personnel to prepare for the mass testing regime already announced. But with nearly 4,000 secondary schools and colleges in England, in most cases the direct help will be limited to phone and video calls. The debates within Whitehall were given fresh urgency after advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that the rate of infections could spiral out of control unless schools are closed for the whole of January. The new timetable supported by the DfE is seen as treading a fine line between extended school closures, which would imperil the sitting of GCSEs and other exams in summer, and the demands to tackle the spread of infection. But concerns remain over how parents and teachers will react to minimal closures, with fears that both groups could vote with their feet and stay away while the virus remains unchecked. The prime minister’s spokesman said on Tuesday: “We’re still planning for a staggered opening of schools and we’re working to ensure testing is in place. “But as we’ve said throughout the pandemic, we obviously keep all measures under constant review.” Pressed on whether all parents could be assured there would be no changes to the timetable next week, the spokesman insisted the government was “planning for a staggered opening of schools” but reasserted that all measures were under review. Asked if there were any plans for education staff to be prioritised for the vaccine after teaching union leaders called for them to receive jabs alongside health workers, the spokesman said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had clearly set out the first phase of those who should receive the vaccine. “We’ve always been clear that we need to ensure that we provide the vaccine to those who are seen to be the most clinically vulnerable and that’s what we’re doing,” he added. Labour called on the government to publish in full the advice it had received from Sage, saying it was “completely unacceptable” that the scientific advice had only appeared in leaks to the media. “The government has lost control of the virus and children’s education is suffering as a result. It’s time for the prime minister to own his mistakes and be honest about whether students can return to schools and colleges in a week’s time,” said Kate Green, the shadow education secretary,",education
"More than half of university students (52%) have become more politicised as a result of the pandemic, a survey suggests, as grassroot rent strike groups continue to gain support from undergraduates over the festive period. The poll, conducted by the National Union of Students (NUS), also found that almost two-thirds (63%) of the 4,193 respondents did not believe the government was acting in their best interests. Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president, said ministers’ failings were “politicising a generation” and prompting students to withhold rent payments across the country as anger mounts over online teaching and residency conditions. “Whether it be the A-levels fiasco, the masses of student lockdowns or the financial exploitation students are facing, we are fed up and acutely aware that the problems arising are indicative of foundational flaws in our education system that this government has failed to reckon with,” she said. In the largest wave of university rent strikes in four decades, at least 20 institutions, including Oxford and Edinburgh, will see students withhold accommodation payments when they return in January. Many activists were galvanised by the success of University of Manchester rent strike campaigners, who were told last month all students would receive a 30% cut in rent – about £4m in total – for the first half of the academic year. The group, whose action culminated in 15 students occupying university building Owens Park, say students are increasingly disillusioned with the institution’s leadership. Hannah Virgo, one of its organisers, said: “The university’s handling of the pandemic has made it clear to students that their primary motivation is profit. I personally have definitely lost my respect for the Russell group. The overwhelming support we got as tower occupiers and as rent strikers show that this is felt across the student body.” “Over the Christmas holiday the rent strike movement is only growing. We are helping local activists to organise in campuses across the country, and are planning to rent strike in January to get more compensation for the second half of the academic year.” The NUS poll, which was carried out last month, also found 65% of students did not agree the government has adequately considered the difficulties that students may face. Hall lockdowns, the prospect of paying for empty rooms while at home and little face-to-face teaching times were some of the main reasons behind the growing frustration. A Department for Education spokesman said: “We understand this has been a very difficult time for students, which is why we have prioritised their education and wellbeing from the start of this pandemic, supporting universities to provide a blend of online and in-person learning in a Covid-secure way. “The government has recently announced up to £20m to help students most in need of support in these exceptional circumstances, in addition to work with the Office for Students to enable universities to draw upon existing funding of £256m to help those facing financial hardship. “We also worked closely with the Office for Students, providing up to £3m to fund the mental health platform, Student Space, which is designed to work alongside university and NHS services.”",education
"School leaders have demanded urgent clarity about the government’s flagship mass-testing strategy for schools after the UK’s medicines regulator said daily coronavirus testing should not be used as an alternative to self-isolation. Headteachers said they were alarmed after the Guardian revealed that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had not authorised the use of 30-minute lateral flow tests to allow students to remain in classrooms instead of sending whole “bubbles” home. The daily testing policy is at the heart of Boris Johnson’s £100bn “Operation Moonshot” strategy because it allows people who test negative to stay in school or work when they would otherwise have to self-isolate. However, the MHRA has expressed serious concerns about using the tests in this way and told the government on Tuesday it had not authorised them for this key purpose. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) claimed on Friday that the primary purpose of using rapid testing in schools was to find positive cases and that this did not require the MHRA’s approval, but that it was providing regulatory oversight. Ministers have repeatedly said the use of daily Covid-19 tests is critical to keeping children in education because it means those who test negative can remain in classrooms, instead of whole year groups having to self-isolate. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said last month: “Testing on this scale brings real benefits to education, it means more children, teachers and staff can stay in their classes in schools and colleges without the need to self-isolate.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “School leaders and staff are utterly tired of this endless confusion over lateral flow tests, alongside much else that has been landed on their plates during this crisis. “All they want is clarity about what is the right thing to do, and the reassurance that there is a sound scientific basis for what is proposed. What is obvious is that there are severe misgivings in many quarters about the use of lateral flow tests as an alternative to self-isolation for close contacts of positive cases. We call on the government to provide a clear and unequivocal statement on this matter.” The MHRA said on Friday that anyone who had been in close contact with a positive case who tests negative with a self-administered test should still self-isolate – undermining the core strategy to keep children in schools – but later said this did not apply to schools. The regulator said it was not required to authorise the daily tests used in schools because they were supervised by a trained person, usually a teacher. There was confusion and anger among headteachers, including those in secondary schools where daily testing was introduced last week. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said the government had “serious questions to answer” about its schools testing policy. “The suggestion that the MHRA have not approved these tests to be used as an alternative to self-isolation is alarming, as that is precisely what the government are suggesting schools should do as part of their testing strategy. The government also needs to urgently explain why it took such an approach if the MHRA approval was not in place,” he said. The use of the lateral flow tests, which take up to 30 minutes to produce a result, has divided experts. Some say they should be welcomed because they can quickly and cheaply identify infected people that would otherwise not have been identified. But others point to their low accuracy and say they risk doing more harm than good, especially when used in the way proposed by government, which is centred on keeping children in schools. The Labour MP Maria Eagle said she had written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to explain the “safety and lawfulness” of the daily testing policy, amid concerns about a sharp rise in cases at a Jaguar Land Rover site in Merseyside that has been carrying out rapid testing of workers. Prof Jon Deeks, a biostatistician of the University of Birmingham, said: “It’s clear that the regulator has agreed this is not a safe way of using these tests. We urgently need clarity from the government about what their mass-testing plans are for the future. It’s important for schools, teachers and children to know what the position is.” The government has spent at least £1.5bn on the lateral flow devices and they have been used by universities, care homes and hospitals. Ministers announced this week they would be distributed to all 317 local authorities in England. A senior MHRA official confirmed its position in an email seen by the Guardian on Friday. The official wrote on 29 December that its approval “ONLY allows for the test to be used to ‘find’ positive cases. MHRA HAVE NOT approved the test for use in a ‘test to enable’ scenario” – such as allowing those who test negative to remain in school or the workplace. The email added: “Any other use of the kit is outside of MHRA’s remit and at the manufacturer’s own risk. We are therefore unable to comment any further on this matter.” A Department for Education spokesman said: “Daily testing of close contacts as a replacement for self-isolation is only possible on test sites in secondary schools and colleges, where a trained member of staff oversees the testing. The MHRA themselves have made clear that they do not need to authorise this programme. “We continue to evaluate this programme to make sure it is delivering on its aim of keeping students in education while reducing transmission across the community.”",education
"The number of children starting school without basic skills such as being able to go to the toilet unaided, put on a coat or respond to questions is at record levels because of nursery closures, according to research. Experts say further closures could widen gaps in school readiness between children from rich and poor backgrounds. Research commissioned by Kindred2, a charitable foundation working to improve early education and child development, found that a record proportion of children were starting school without basic skills. Nearly half (46%) of children who started reception class in 2020 were not “school ready”, compared with 35% in 2019, a survey of more than 500 British primary schools found. Less time spent at nursery due to lockdown restrictions was the key reason for this decline, teachers said. Unlike primary schools, nurseries and childminders in England are now open to all children. There is mounting pressure on the government to introduce further restrictions to contain the pandemic, and a recent Observer poll found 61% of people were in favour of shutting nurseries. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has also flagged nurseries as an area where restrictions could be tightened.  Helen Dodd, a professor of child psychology at the University of Reading, said: “We need to accept that this year’s intake of children and next year’s – particularly if nurseries close – may be a bit behind where they would be otherwise. We need to give children the chance to, in their own time, get to where they need to be. And we also need to allow schools the space to give the children space.” Research interviews with 208 registered early years providers conducted by Ofsted highlighted lapses in children’s personal, social and emotional development as a result of the first national lockdown. “Many children were more anxious and had struggled when they first returned to the setting, finding it difficult to separate from their parents,” inspectors said. “Some children were less confident with others and slower to join in. Others returned using nappies, comforters and dummies at an older age than providers would usually expect.” However, not all children suffered equally, and those whose parents were available to spend quality time with them often thrived, Ofsted found. Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez, of Oxford Brookes University, who is leading a study of more than 500 families with nursery-aged children to better understand how lockdowns and social distancing affect their development, said: “A key purpose of nurseries is that they provide high-quality education and enriching activities which improve children’s cognitive and social-emotional outcomes.” Preliminary results of her research suggest that children whose parents were available to do enriching activities such as reading, arts and crafts or gardening with them during lockdown showed a growth in their vocabularies and cognitive skills associated with mental flexibility and self-control, which was less evident in those who spent less time doing such activities. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to fall into the latter category and also more had higher daily screen use. One reason may that they had less access to resources such as age-appropriate books and private gardens. “This pandemic is widening the deep inequalities that already exist in children’s early experiences and life chances,” Gonzalez-Gomez said.  If nurseries were to close now, such children could face an additional disadvantage, because getting outdoors to play games or investigate nature required access to warm, weatherproof clothing, which may be unaffordable for some, she said. Dodd has conducted extensive interviews with the parents of two- to four-year-olds to understand the impact of the pandemic on families’ mental health. “We found that children’s emotional problems stayed the same, and behaviour problems actually reduced very slightly, which is probably due to fewer tantrums about putting shoes on and getting out of the house in time in the mornings,” she said. However, 73% of parents reported feeling they were unable to fully meet the needs of both their work and their child, and 53% were very worried that they were not doing enough for their child. If nurseries do close, being conscious of what young children are most missing out on will be important, Dodd added. The biggest factor is social contact. Nurseries allow children to learn about friendships, sharing and collaborative play. So if they close then continuing to allow families to form a childcare bubble with another family will be important, said Dodd. Childcare bubbles also take some of the pressure off working parents, giving them some space to get work done and reducing stress. Although children may need time to catch up on missed play opportunities and develop the skills needed to succeed at school, Dodd is confident that most will do so eventually. “Children should be with other children. But also, children are resilient, so they probably will be OK.”",education
"After the government decided to announce a new lockdown in England and close schools to most pupils, parents have been juggling working and home schooling once more. From practical issues such as broadband and printing, to concerns surrounding mental health, four parents spoke about how they have been coping this last week. “Yesterday and today I mainly battled a migraine brought on by the sheer anxiety of trying to juggle a full time role with a child at home for the next six weeks at least,” said Esther Dusabe-Richards, a 39-year-old academic who lives in Leeds, and has twins, aged two, in nursery, and a five-year-old daughter in primary school. Dusabe-Richards said her school has asked parents to send in evidence of home working every three days, which she said was well-intentioned but came across as “punitive”. It is sending about 10 worksheets a day, although pupils don’t have to complete everything, and the school doesn’t offer online learning because of safeguarding policies. “When Gavin Williamson said kids needed three to five hours of home schooling each day, for parents of five-year-olds, it essentially means you have to teach them,” she said. “To expect that of parents is laughable, even if they aren’t working. We’re not trained as teachers.” “The rhetoric needs to be: we’re in a huge crisis, let’s forget about targets and support one another. I have an incredibly supportive line manager, but if I stop and think about everything I’ve got to do today, I would just keel over.” In London, Roger Mortimer, who owns a marketing company and his wife who works in publishing are working late into the evening to compensate for the time lost to teaching their five- and nine-year-old sons through the day. “It’s difficult, I’ve had Zoom calls with the kids wandering in as I talk to clients. I’ve definitely lost sales because of the kids, but it’s not their fault, I just have to have a massive sign on the door saying, ‘don’t come in’,” he said. “At the start of the day, my wife and I work out which calls we’ve got and whether they overlap, otherwise we just tag team.” Despite the difficulties, Mortimer said he felt better prepared for home schooling than he did during the first lockdown. “The first lockdown was a nightmare. We were pretty much left to figure it out ourselves, no Zoom classes, just weekly packs of schoolwork to complete that was never marked. I’m still amazed I still have a job and marriage,” he said. “This lockdown, admittedly still in the first week, seems much more organised. The days are structured and the boys respond to that so much better than the ad hoc chaos of the first lockdown. As parents we’re better prepared and have a better understanding of any gaps in our kids’ education.” For other parents, the expectations of online learning were impossible to meet. In the seven years recently unemployed mother, Victoria Pattinson, 38, has lived in her home in North Lincolnshire, she has tried several broadband providers but has always had poor quality, which has made online teaching almost impossible. The costs of ink cartridges for her printer were also becoming “utterly untenable”. Instead, Pattinson is teaching her twins, in year 1 at school, her own programme of reading, writing and maths in the mornings, with creative activities and supplementary themed work in the afternoon. She said the school have made “snippy” comments, requesting that the family attempt the work set by the school. “If I were to try and do the school set work, the stress levels in the house through battling the connection, formatting and printing issues would go through the roof. We’re stressed enough as it is without being expected to be PGCE level teachers to our children,” she said. Emma*, a 39-year-old mother of three primary school children in Yorkshire, has been forced to suspend her master’s degree as a result of home schooling demands, less than two months before she was due to complete it. “I’m wrestling with the schooling during the day and trying to work in the evenings, but I can’t concentrate with them around me and I start snapping. It’s not fair on them,” she said. “As long as I finish my dissertation by May, I can graduate this year, but I’ve got no certainty about when the children are going to go back. I’ve spent this week applying for two jobs which I had hoped to start in February after I finished my course, but I can’t work out how I can start a new job and finish a masters.”  “I have nothing left of myself to give this time. I feel like I’m stuck. I’ve paid money to do my masters, and I can’t get an income from it.”  As a result of the pressures of home schooling, and having to suspend her studies, Emma’s mental health is suffering. “My last resort is to call my GP, and say, please get the kids into school because I genuinely can’t cope,” she said. “They’re not registered as vulnerable kids, but I will get to a point where I can’t do this for a huge amount of time. If I could just have one school day, 6 hours a week, to catch my breath, it might save us.”",education
"Twice as many mothers as fathers say they will have to take time off with no pay due to school closures or a sick child, according to a survey, raising further fears that the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic is falling disproportionately on women’s shoulders. According to the survey, carried out by a group of women’s organisations across the UK including Women’s Budget Group and the Fawcett Society, 15% of mothers said they had to take unpaid time off work, compared with 8% of fathers, while 57% of fathers said they would be able to work from home during school closures, compared with 49% of mothers. “With England now in lockdown and strong restrictions in the devolved nations, parents of school-age children working from home will be struggling once more to combine lesson supervision with paid work,” said Dr Mary Ann Stephenson, the director of Women’s Budget Group. “Mothers are more at risk of having to take time off on no pay when schools close.” At the end of October, there were 1.19 million women furloughed, compared with 1.14 million men, with women making up over 51% of those on the job retention scheme. But the gender disparity was much greater for young women, who made up 57% of furloughed under-18s and 53% of furloughed 18-24-year-olds, according to Guardian analysis. Among women aged 24 and under there were 196,800 jobs furloughed, compared with 172,400 for men of the same age, a difference of around 14%. Initial HMRC analysis also appears to show that women were more likely to be let go after the furlough scheme ended, with 91% of previously furloughed men back on their original payroll as of August, compared with 89% of women. Overall, around 10% of those formerly on the furlough scheme were no longer working for their employer at the end of August. A recent report from the Young Women’s Trust found that 1.5 million young women had lost income since the pandemic, 69% who claimed benefits did so for the first time, and 750,000 had to go to work despite fears for their safety. “Young women on low pay were already struggling to get by before the pandemic hit and since then many lost earnings because of furlough, redundancy or because they had to juggle precarious and insecure work with caring responsibilities,” said Abi Shapiro, the interim chief executive of Young Women’s Trust. Gemma Hirst, 25, was furloughed in March from the retail job she had worked in for six years. The store she worked in did not reopen, and in June she was offered just four hours a week in a different store despite having worked as a supervisor previously. Not able to survive on the hours, she had to go on universal credit for the first time. “When it comes to it, actually, you’re just a number, they don’t care about you at all,” said Hirst. The figures have raised fears that young women are at particular risk of having their economic futures and mental health blighted. Recent research from Agenda, which campaigns for women and girls at risk, found a quarter of young women were suffering symptoms of depression or anxiety, three times the rate of young males, and one in five young women with severe money problems had self-harmed in the past year. It raised concerns that young BAME women were particularly at risk. “Our concern is that we are creating a future mental health epidemic among young women,” said Jess Southgate, CEO of Agenda. A May report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL Institute of Education revealed that mothers in England were more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, and were only able to do only one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by men. The new Survation survey of 1,308 parents in the UK with children aged 14 and under found that parents with an annual household income of £20,000 or below were nine times more likely to say their jobs were at risk because of school closures than parents with an annual household income of £40,000 or above – with 9% of low-income parents reporting this compared with 1% of those earning over £40,000. Twelve per cent of parents earning below £20,000 a year and 13% of parents earning between £20,000 and £40,000 a year said they would have to take time off on no pay if schools closed or their children had to self-isolate, compared with 7% of parents earning more than £40,000 annually. The TUC has asked companies to “do the right thing” and allow staff to furlough for childcare, as well as offering the right to flexible working and 10 days’ paid parental leave a year. “Without further action, many will have no choice but to cut their hours or take unpaid leave from work. This will lead to further hardship and will hit mums and single parents hardest,” said the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady. Felicia Willow, the Fawcett Society’s interim chief executive, said that there had been positive developments since the introduction of the job retention scheme such as the right to take furlough for childcare reasons, as well as the ability for furlough to be shared between parents but said the government needed to urgently put in place a rescue package for the childcare sector and carry out an equality impact assessment. “But women remain on the sidelines of the government’s coronavirus response,” she said. “We urge the government to put women at the centre of its decision-making.”",education
"With much of the focus in recent weeks on schools, UK university students have reported feeling forgotten by the government, with no rebates offered on tuition fees and calls growing for rent refunds as many students are asked not to return to campuses. As they prepare to begin the second term, five students speak about their concerns.  “Last week, Boris Johnson didn’t address us in the press conference announcing the national lockdown in England at all. It shows he doesn’t really have any care or concern, especially for our mental health,” says Sophie Sengupta, a 19-year-old first-year student at the University of Liverpool. “There’s a real emphasis on schoolchildren at the moment, and I understand it’s hard on everyone, but they aren’t away from their families. They get to go home to their mum and dad and have that support. When you’re at uni, you’re on your own.”  Like many students who contacted the Guardian via a callout, Sengupta says her mental health was at “the lowest it’s ever been” during the first term. “What I’m concerned about now, and a lot of my peers feel the same, is that we’ve all got exams coming up in January, and we’re all feeling broken and defeated,” she says. “Gavin Williamson cancelled A-levels and GCSEs, but there was no mention of our exams in a few weeks.” “My mental health has been very poor,” says Alex*, a University of Exeter psychology student. “I have had numerous friends express their own increasing difficulties with depression and anxiety.” Moreover, Alex is concerned by how difficult it has been to access wellbeing services. “The university says that they are easily accessible but in reality making contact is difficult,” she says. “On one occasion I did try to call the team for some support, but the phone line was shut with a message to call emergency services if you were having a crisis and if not to email them to book an appointment.” She says the university has said marking will not be relaxed. “We are in the middle of a mental health crisis and no one is talking about it seriously; no serious action is being taken,” she says. Reece Lawson, 19, a first-year international politics student at the University of Liverpool, decided to return to the city in late December. “There were restrictions at home [in Northern Ireland] and I wanted to make sure I’d be able to get back over,” he says.  He feels “a little disappointed” by his university experience so far but says he did not consider staying at home as his university has not yet offered rent rebates. “It would just mean paying money to not be here.” With part-time work scarce, Lawson is one of many university students whose financial situation is increasingly dire. “It’s almost impossible to find a job either in Belfast or Liverpool due to the closure of bars, restaurants and retailers. If I was to leave university, I’d just be sitting at home with nothing to do. I feel I have no alternative options,” he says. “Fingers crossed, this lockdown will end in February or March and I’ll be able to get a hospitality job then. I do feel like I’m missing out on the full uni experience but hopefully by second or third year things will be back to normal.” Emily* is not returning to university in Dundee, where she is in her second year, until the course of the pandemic “changes dramatically”. For her, the main difficulty has been divisions with her housemates over coronavirus regulations. She says one housemate has been breaking public health rules to make regular trips to nearby cities, attend parties and have visitors over. “When I once spoke to her about going to one of these parties, she didn’t see the problem, saying that she left before the police turned up,” she says. “She also had one of her friends spend the weekend at ours, which I first found out when I found a stranger in our kitchen.” Emily has found online learning frustrating. “I was spending all day sat at a tiny desk, then moving to my bed a hand width behind me. By the time I finished my work it was dark outside and I didn’t feel safe going out for a walk,” she says. “Working from home isn’t ideal: the wifi isn’t perfect, and my family will interrupt me. It’s also frustrating knowing I won’t be able to see my friends from uni,” she says. “But all in all, being at my uni house is not worth the stress.” Mary-Grace Oludoyi, who studies law at the LSE, has found the workload difficult to manage without in-person learning and normal social activities to balance her time. Reduced student numbers meant she shared a flat with just two people and she was unable to invite anyone over. “That was really hard for me,” she says. “The main difficulty of it all was trying to deal with your own issues at home, settling in to uni, coping with your mental health, and on top of that, a crazy workload that can drown you. The workload made the isolation worse because you’d get up to do work all day and not speak to anyone. “Even stuff like who I will live with in second year is difficult,” she adds. “Do I know anyone well enough? I’ve only met them about three times.” *Some names have been changed.",education
"Primary schools in England have reported a big increase in the number of pupils attending during the latest lockdown, leading to warnings it may increase the spread of Covid-19 and prolong the need for school closures. A survey of school leaders and classroom teachers revealed a sharp turnaround in the numbers of children attending school this week compared with those who attended in March 2020 during the first national lockdown. The survey by the Teacher Tapp app found that one in six primary schools in England reported that 30% or more of their normal roll was attending in person this week, far more than in the first week of the March lockdown. Nationally the figures would equate to more than 2,500 primary schools in England with a third or more of their pupils in their classrooms. More than 300 of those schools said at least half of all their pupils attended in person. The figures are the first evidence that parents have been sending their children to school in increasing numbers. Headteachers have complained about their schools “rammed” with pupils and of parents making implausible claims of being eligible “critical workers”. One headteacher reported that a parent whose job was a dog-walker claimed to qualify as a key worker because many of the dogs’ owners were NHS staff. Rebecca Allen, a professor of education at the University of Brighton and chief analyst at Teacher Tapp, said: “The much higher number of children attending primary schools each day during this lockdown will make it more difficult to reduce the rate of transmission. “This, in turn, may mean that schools will need to stay closed for longer, thus delaying the speed with which we can get other children back to school.” While schools are closed to most pupils during the lockdown, many children are still eligible to attend, including those classed as vulnerable by the government because of special needs or social support, and children whose parents work in critical sectors, such as food distribution or national infrastructure. But the government has also expanded its offer of in-person school places in England to children who lack digital devices for remote learning and to those without quiet spaces or workplaces in their homes. Earlier this week, the Department for Education made it clear to school leaders that they could not limit places for the children of key workers, and that one parent’s status was enough for eligibility. In the March lockdown, 72% of primary schools had fewer than 10% of their pupils attending. This year, only 17% of primaries had below 10% attendance. The results were drawn from teachers at 1,600 primary schools surveyed this week and compared with the results of a similar snapshot from teachers at 2,000 schools conducted on 23 March last year. The results came as the ONS released figures showing a rapid spread in Covid-19 infections among school-age children. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “If the government is serious about having more children at school during this lockdown it should reduce bubbles and groups sizes to minimise transmission risks. “However, with current staff already fully engaged in providing remote learning to the children at home, reducing bubble sizes will require more staff. The government should demonstrate its commitment to our young people by mobilising supply staff, many of them currently furloughed or even without pay, for this task.”",education
"The flawed advice to schools last May on how to grade students when exams were cancelled because of the pandemic has been withdrawn from the government’s website and the damage it did consigned to history. But out in the real world there is no such magic wand for thousands of students still seeking justice after their grades were wrongly reduced. One is Harry-James Brioche, who lost a hard-won degree apprenticeship with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) that would have paid his university fees for four years, plus a salary to cover his living costs, and work placements and the chance of a job on graduation. Another is Helen Prior*, whose teachers at her Oxfordshire school thought she would achieve AAB based on her end-of-term tests and mock exams, but who lost her place to study pharmacy when her grades were unaccountably reduced to BDD. They are just two of 1,500 teenagers whose families have joined a Facebook group to campaign for justice for students whose schools closely followed the guidance of the exams regulator Ofqual, which then used a computer algorithm that wrongly graded about 40% of A-level candidates. The affected students attended schools and colleges that followed the advice of bodies, including ASCL, the headteachers’ union, that to comply with Ofqual’s guidance, they needed to alter their teacher-assessed grades to bring them in line with what students had achieved over the previous three years. Ofqual feared that teacher-assessed grades alone would be too optimistic, and designed an algorithm that took a school’s historic results into account in order to avoid national grade inflation. But while some schools lowered their teachers’ assessments – often against their better judgment – to bring them in line with previous years before submitting them as Cags (centre assessment grades) to Ofqual, other schools did not alter grades when they submitted their Cags, and instead left Ofqual to number-crunch. In the end this meant that some students suffered even more because their school had already lowered their grades before submitting them. Wind forward to August 2020 and, when it emerged that Ofqual’s algorithm to standardise the grades had not worked, the government ordered that students be given the choice of accepting the grades they were awarded by Ofqual’s system or using their schools’ Cags instead. Prior, who was downgraded from AAB to ABC when her school submitted its Cags, was horrified to find her grades further reduced by Ofqual’s algorithm to BDD. She believes its algorithm failed to pick up that the school had been rapidly improving under a new headteacher, attracting stronger students to its sixth form. When the government announced in August that students could choose their Cags instead, hers went up to ABC – still short of the ABB she needed to study pharmacy. On Friday, launching a consultation, Williamson confirmed that teacher assessment will be the prime method of setting grades this year and proposed that results be published in early July, allowing more time for appeals. But students let down last year say a better system is needed where students themselves can appeal, not have to rely on their school. Dennis Sherwood, an independent assessment consultant who has worked with Ofqual, says: “Ofqual kept insisting last year that its system had to be fair – the word was used 14 times in one of its statements – yet unfairness to individual students is still not being acknowledged or resolved. Trusting teachers is a good thing, but last year has shown that advice given to them can be unclear and subject to change, so it’s very important that this year’s candidates have a fair and timely appeals system.”  Brioche’s school, St Ambrose College in Altrincham, Cheshire, appealed to the exam board OCR for his computer science grade to be increased from the A submitted by the school to the A* they had originally assessed, sending a copy of the form filled in by his teacher, an OCR examiner in the subject, saying he would get an A*. It argued that it had entered only five candidates for the subject, and Ofqual admitted in August that its standardisation historical method had broken down and did not work at all with cohorts of five or fewer. But although Brioche’s grade was therefore based on faulty data, the appeal to OCR failed. “The centre’s approach to determining Cags is consistent with Ofqual’s guidance,” it ruled – referring to the same guidance that has since been withdrawn by the Department for Education. Brioche’s school decided against appealing the B grade it had submitted for his physics A-level because the number of students sitting the subject was larger, making it harder to prove that the historic data was misleading. “I’m very grateful for the school’s support,” says Brioche.  OCR said it was following the advice of the Joint Council for Qualifications, which represents examining bodies, which had advised that the fact a school had taken account previous years’ grades when calculating its Cags was not grounds for appeal. St Ambrose’s headteacher, Dermot Rainey, said he did not think it appropriate to comment. Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, has called for candidates to be able to use their teacher assessed grades if higher than their Cags. Williamson, however, has refused, telling the Commons education select committee last September that he feared “every school would decide that it had been too strict on their centre assessment grades and that you would have every school submitting again”. Barton says many schools and colleges were placed in a very difficult position last year. “They worked extremely hard to apply Ofqual’s methodology, only to find that the algorithm then proved a disaster and had to be abandoned. They then faced irate parents who felt their children’s grades had been pulled down unfairly and Ofqual turned down our requests to open up an avenue of appeal. We also requested that the government commission an independent review of exactly what went wrong with last year’s system, but that didn’t happen either. “We will look closely at details of how the teacher assessment system announced by the education secretary will operate this year, but it is obviously imperative in the light of last year’s disaster that the guidance to schools and colleges, and the system for moderation and appeals, is clear, logical, and demonstrably fair.”  All this will come too late for Brioche, who was accepted on the same computer science degree – but without the PwC apprenticeship for which he had been selected from more than 900 applicants. A spokeswoman for PwC said more students than expected had met its entry requirements. “Across the four tech degree programmes we have there were 110 places available. Due to the unusual circumstances and changes in grades, that meant more students were eligible compared to a normal year, so we extended this to accept 132. Unfortunately, some candidates didn’t achieve grades in either scenario,” she said. Brioche says he lost his place through no fault of his own. “I feel cheated. I worked so hard to make sure all my marks were A or A* in all my subjects throughout the year and then the grades were taken away and all the safety nets have failed me. It’s too late to change what happened to me and many other students, and it’s hard for me to speak publicly about it, but I just don’t want to see more students suffer from the same mistakes this year,” he says. His mother, Catherine Brioche, says: “My son and others like him worked hard and have done everything asked of them, and now they have lost trust in the system that let them down so badly. They have been cruelly cast aside. It must not happen again this year.” *The student’s name has been changed at her request",education

"Once again, Marcus Rashford has scored against the government, after Boris Johnson was forced to admit at prime minister’s questions that food parcels being sent to England’s poorest families were “appalling” and “an insult”. Keir Starmer attacked the prime minister for trying to dodge the blame, pointing out that the stingy-looking packages – pictures of which had been shared by Rashford, and by furious parents, on social media – appeared to reflect government guidance. But Johnson’s abject apology, which followed a hastily arranged phone call with the footballer, did mark a change of approach from last year.  No 10 had initially sought to brush off Rashford’s calls for free school meals provision to continue throughout the 2020 summer break, before changing its mind and setting up a voucher scheme.  Then in the autumn, the government again resisted a holiday voucher scheme – one backbencher, Brendan Clarke-Smith, even warned against “nationalising children” – before ministers caved in. This time, the Department for Education had dropped its “food parcel first” guidance by Wednesday afternoon, allowing families to use vouchers if they prefer, once the scheme is set up. Conservative insiders say the children’s minister, Vicky Ford, was involved in pushing for a swift response on the issue. And Johnson’s language suggested the Downing Street machine has learned a tangle with Rashford only has one outcome. But some of Johnson’s backbench troops despair that No 10 continues to be outflanked by the footballer – something they see as part of a pattern of flat-footed political management. On a call with Boris Johnson’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, on Tuesday, backbench Conservative MPs complained that No 10 remained too slow at rebuttals – and too vulnerable to elephant traps set by Labour. Throughout the pandemic, Starmer has repeatedly stolen a march on Johnson by pushing for moves the government’s scientific advisers have demanded. In a pattern that has become wearily familiar, Johnson instinctively hits back, before giving way to the inevitable a few days or weeks later. The clearest recent example was the prime minister’s attack on Starmer on 16 December for wanting to “cancel Christmas”, delivered in a tone of injured indignation, before Johnson announced last-minute changes to the festive mixing rules three days later. This about-turn, and the more recent one on schools reopening, came more than a month after Stratton’s arrival and the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, who were often blamed for Johnson’s pugnacious style. There have been modest signs in recent weeks that the prime minister is picking fewer fights, and trying to restrain his irrepressible boosterism – urging caution about when the lockdown can be lifted, for example. But it is unclear as yet whether that is the result of a fresh approach to communications or the severity of the current phase of the pandemic. And no amount of fancy political footwork will help if the government is failing the public, in the way a slick campaign such as Rashford’s can relentlessly expose. Ultimately, the reason the government continues to be caught out over child food poverty is a more fundamental one: the fact that the threadbare social safety net means children are going hungry in the first place. Once housing costs are taken into account, the incomes of the poorest families were falling even before the pandemic hit. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says in its annual report on poverty on Wednesday, the squeeze on incomes was happening predominantly as the result of deliberate political decisions taken by Conservative governments to reduce the welfare bill – in particular, the 2016-20 benefits freeze. Rishi Sunak increased universal credit by £20 a week early in the pandemic, in an implicit admission that the payments had become too paltry to live on. The chancellor has not yet said whether that will remain in place from April, choosing instead in a recent Spectator interview to highlight the necessity of “hard choices” to tackle the deficit. With Rashford already on the warpath, extending the £20 a week increase looks all but inevitable; but the government will continue to remain vulnerable to the campaigning footballer’s attacks as long as there are parents in 21st-century Britain who cannot afford to feed their kids.",education
"Ministers are under pressure to overhaul the way in which free school meals are being provided to vulnerable children under the latest lockdown, after Marcus Rashford highlighted “woefully inadequate” food parcels estimated to be worth little more than £5. Food poverty campaigners, paediatricians and nutritionists called on the government to review its “food parcel first” approach to feeding disadvantaged families, after parents posted photographs on social media showing the apparently meagre contents of their food parcels. One was made up of a white loaf, a pack of sliced cheese, two potatoes, two carrots, two bananas, two mini Soreen bars, two tubes of Frubes, a tin of beans, a small bag of pasta and three apples. Commenting on the photograph, Bridget Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation said: “The variety of foods shown in this image is very limited, especially when it comes to fruit and vegetables and protein-rich foods. A balanced lunch for a child should provide some starchy foods, wholegrain where possible, at least one and ideally two or more portions of fruit and vegetables, some protein-rich foods like beans, eggs, fish or meat and some dairy foods or alternatives.” According to Twitter user Roadside Mum who posted the picture, the parcel was supposed to provide the equivalent of the two weeks’ worth of £15 free school meal vouchers provided to parents and carers in the first lockdown – or £30 worth of food. “I priced that like-for-like from Asda and it came to £5.22. Where’s the other £25,” she said. Chartwells, the school catering company that supplied the package, claimed the photograph showed five days of free lunches, not 10, and the charge for food, packing and distribution was £10.50 not £30, but added: “We are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.” A spokesperson said: “Our 10-day hampers typically include a wide variety of nutritious food items to support the provision of lunches for children.” The company announced late on Tuesday that it would be refunding the costs of any below-standard parcels, would contact schools to establish where any shortages may have occurred, and from next Monday would ensure food hampers reflect the additional £3.50 a week allocation per pupil receiving a food parcel at home. The children and families minister, Vicky Ford, said: “The photos being shared on social media today are completely unacceptable and do not reflect the high standard of free school meals we expect to be sent to children. “Chartwells has rightly apologised and admitted the parcel in question was not good enough. I met their managing director earlier today and he has assured me they have taken immediate action to stop further deliveries of poor-quality parcels. They will ensure schools affected are compensated and they will provide additional food to the eligible child in line with our increased funding.” Ford said the government will demand all caterers meet the standards set for high quality lunches, adding that they would set out further details on Wednesday. Footballer and campaigner Marcus Rashford, who forced the government into a U-turn on funding free school meals during the holidays, had earlier described the food parcels as unacceptable and demanded swift action, tweeting: “Something is going wrong and we need to fix it, quickly!” Department for Education (DfE) guidance issued last Friday actively encourages schools to provide parcels for children on free school meals. Although schools can also choose to issue food vouchers, the guidance says schools are “strongly encouraged” to adopt a “food parcel first approach”. Some schools have already opted out of providing parcels in favour of established local voucher schemes. Cllr Ed Davie, Lambeth council’s cabinet member for children and young people, said all 90 schools in the borough had chosen to keep the voucher system it adopted over the Christmas holidays, rather than use parcels. “We want families to have cash or vouchers because it is more dignified and affords them more choice in what food they buy,” Cllr Davie said. Labour has called for the government to restart the national food vouchers scheme, which operated during the first national lockdown. Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: “The images appearing online of woefully inadequate free school meal parcels are a disgrace. Where is the money going?” Other food parcel photos on social media included one posted by Lisa T, which included half a carrot, half a pepper and portions of food packed into small bank-style clear plastic bags. “It wasn’t nice, when you are already feeling at rock bottom to then be given this. But it was rectified very quickly by our school and for that I’m very grateful,” she tweeted.  Cook, food writer and anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe retweeted examples of hundreds of messages sent to her regarding the food parcels, using the hashtag #bringbackvouchers. Calling them “ill-thought through, meagre scraps” she compared the parcels with a voluminous spread of £20 worth of food bought at her local supermarket two months ago. “Have we had enough examples yet that they can’t say this is an isolated incident or do I need to keep going?!” she tweeted. There were calls for the system to be replaced by a “cash transfers” in which families were supported directly through payments made via child benefit or universal credit. Prof Greta Defeyter of Northumbria University, an expert in school food, said: “Cash first is the easiest and most effective route in ensuring families are supported with dignity, respect and freedom of choice.” The DfE guidance says there are “significant benefits” to offering food parcels, including “the confidence that a nutritious and varied range of food is being provided in line with guidance”. An added benefit, it says, is “the continuation of financial support to school caterers”. It says food parcel contents should be sufficient to “allow parents and carers to prepare simple and healthy lunches for their children across the week”.  A statement by LACA, the professional body for school meals providers, which helped draw up the DfE guidance, said: “[We are] disappointed to see the pictures of food parcels circulating on social media. They simply do not meet the standards.” ",education

"Members of the armed forces will be deployed to support coronavirus testing operations for thousands of school and college students in England, the government has announced. The Ministry of Defence said 1,500 military personnel would ensure testing systems were implemented by next Monday, when pupils are due to begin a staggered return for the new term. It said the majority of the personnel would form local response teams, providing support and phone advice to institutions needing guidance on the set up of testing facilities. Students will swab themselves in the vast majority of cases, under the supervision of a school staff member or volunteer trained for the role, while teachers are not expected to take a role in the testing process. The decision follows successful testing pilots conducted in schools in November and December. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said: “It is a true cross-government effort to make sure secondary schools and colleges have the support, guidance, materials and funding they need to offer rapid testing to their staff and students from the start of term. “I am grateful to the armed forces personnel, and all the school and college staff, leaders and volunteers working to put testing in place.” Any students who have been in contact with a positive case will be offered seven days of daily testing while teachers can have weekly Covid tests. However, at the end of the autumn term teaching unions described the testing scheme as “inoperable” and “undeliverable” and advised staff to refuse to work on the scheme over the Christmas break. A joint statement from all four major education unions, school governors and the Church of England, which runs about a quarter of the nation’s schools, accused the government of making a “chaotic and rushed” announcement on the final day of term. Year 11 and year 13 pupils who are preparing for their GCSE and A-levels are to be allowed to return to school next Monday along with those taking vocational qualifications that week, the children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters. Most secondary students will not be back in the classroom until 11 January and will be taught remotely. However, a split has emerged between ministers over whether the plans should go ahead after the government’s scientific advisers urged a delay to the start of the new term amid a surge in cases. The Department for Education has said the return to schools is being kept “under review”. Williamson is understood to be mounting a “rearguard action” against what one source described as “senior colleagues” who have been alarmed by advice that reopening schools will make it impossible to keep the R number below one. Williamson is expected to meet Downing Street officials to consider whether schools in tier 4 areas should remain closed until February.",education
"Music education in schools is facing an “unprecedented crisis” as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with singing, instrumental lessons, extracurricular activities and end-of-term concerts all badly hit, a new report says. There is “genuine cause for alarm” over the impact of the virus on music provision, says The Heart of the School is Missing report produced by the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM). “Beyond the intrinsic value of studying music for its own sake, there is a plethora of evidence that studying music builds cultural knowledge, creative skills and improves children’s health, wellbeing and wider educational attainment.” More than two-thirds (68%) of primary school teachers and more than a third (39%) of secondary school teachers reported a reduction in music provision as a direct result of the pandemic in a survey carried out by the ISM at the beginning of this academic year. Almost one in 10 primary and secondary schools are not teaching music as part of the curriculum at all. Some lessons “contained no practical music-making”, the report says. Singing has ended in more than a third (38%) of primary schools, and instrumental lessons have ceased in almost a quarter (23%). Extracurricular musical activities have been discontinued in nearly three-quarters (72%) of UK primaries and two-thirds (66%) of secondaries. Schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been hit harder than those in England. In addition, more than half (53%) of primaries and almost two-thirds (63%) of secondaries that normally hold a festive concert at the end of the first term of the academic year will not do so this year. “We cannot sing, and the children are hugely disappointed when they ask to sing and we tell them no,” one primary teacher told the ISM. Another said: “Due to staggered breaks/lunch and the need to constantly wash hands, the amount of time spent on music has been reduced.” A secondary teacher said: “Honestly, it’s impossible to state how devastating this will be in the long run for music as a subject. There is no provision at all for instrumental lessons, ensemble projects, bigger inclusive performances or even classroom ensemble work. This will, of course, harm students emotionally and academically.” The health and wellbeing of both children and music teachers had been affected by the changes to music provision, according to the report. “Music is central to the recovery curriculum, playing a vital role in schools helping their students to explore and express the varied emotions and challenges that they will have experienced during the pandemic, building stronger relationships and communities within schools and with families.” Almost all instrumental teachers (99%) reported that teaching had changed for them this year, with a third (35%) of primaries and just over a quarter (28%) of secondaries discontinuing instrumental lessons in person. One teacher told the ISM: “They [pupils] need instant feedback and guidance on their vocal pieces in order to build confidence and control in their voices and performance. It’s almost impossible to do this if they record and send it to me.” Deborah Annetts, the ISM’s chief executive, said: “We are disappointed but not surprised to discover that music provision is being reduced in our schools as a direct result of the pandemic, with opportunities for pupils to make and create music becoming severely limited both in and out of the classroom. “It is vital that every child can access a quality music education. Therefore there needs to be sustained and meaningful leadership across all levels of government, actively encouraging safe music teaching in schools and in the wider community. We need to see clear, timely and consistent guidance across all four nations for the rest of the 2020/21 academic year, and beyond, so that music education is not disrupted further.” The ISM surveyed more than 1,300 music teachers across the UK in September and early October this year.",education
"My mother, Sonia Hall, who has died aged 88, left her home in Sri Lanka in 1951 to study medicine in Britain, and lived in England for most of the rest of her life.  She was born in Colombo into the Bandaranaike family, which had held prominent positions in Sri Lankan politics and law. However, her father, Sammy Dias Bandaranaike, did not have a political life, and was an agricultural officer in the department of agriculture. Her Indo-Trinidadian mother, Esther (nee Ramkeesoon), was technically a housewife but in fact was formidable at running the Bandaranaike coconut and rubber estates that her husband had inherited. She was also the one who had the drive to get her three girls through school and into university. Sonia went to Bishops College boarding school in Colombo, and when the second world war broke out she and her two sisters continued their education in a temporary school 120 miles outside the capital, in Bandarawela. In 1951 she travelled to England to study medicine at Cambridge University, and after three years at Girton College and another three training at the Royal London hospital she graduated in 1957, after which she did one-year’s pre-registration as a houseman at the London hospital, specialising as a paediatrician. A brief return to Sri Lanka saw her practising paediatrics at Colombo Hospital, and it was there in 1959 that the then prime minister SWRD Bandaranaike was admitted after he was shot at his home. Sonia was his second cousin once removed, and was summoned to the ward where he was fighting for his life. “Do you think he’s going to survive?” his wife, Sirimavo, asked her. “I had absolutely no idea!” Sonia recounted to us. “What with the press of doctors and others all around him, I wasn’t even close enough to see him properly.” A short while after the assassination, Sirimavo led the Sri Lanka Freedom party to an election victory that made her the first female prime minister anywhere in the world. On Sonia’s return to England, in 1961 she married Digby Hall, a fellow doctor, and they moved to Edinburgh, by which time she had given up hospital work so that she could bring up their young family. Eventually, after a move to Woodbridge in Suffolk in 1969, she returned to medicine as a consultant haematologist and dermatologist at Ipswich hospital, staying there until she retired in 2006, aged 74. Sonia always enjoyed bright, inquisitive female company, and when she and her university contemporaries started one by one to reach 60 years of age, they hired cottages in the Cotswolds, Lake District and elsewhere, from which they would venture on walks as they swapped stories and explored the local area. When she couldn’t hook up with them, she treated her family members to trips to museums, exhibitions, lectures, concerts and the theatre, both at home and abroad. Digby died in 2009. She is survived by her four children, William, James, Mary and me.",education
"Vulnerable children expelled from mainstream schools are at risk of being “preyed upon” because of worryingly poor attendance at the specialist institutions tasked with teaching them, the chief inspector of schools in England has warned. Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, said that the vast majority of pupil referral units (PRUs) and other providers who accepted excluded children were able to turn around the life chances of their pupils. She said they should not be viewed as a passport to criminality, as they are sometimes portrayed. However, before the publication of Ofsted’s annual report this week, she warned that those educators had to do more to ensure that pupils were actually attending classes. The rate of truancy at many of the schools is raising concerns about what is happening to the children outside the classrooms about what is happening to the children outside the school gates, with growing evidence that vulnerable children are being targeted by “county lines” drug gangs. Ofsted’s analysis will show that in some PRUs and other “alternative provision” (AP) settings, pupils are only in class for a fraction of the week. The persistent absence rate is almost four times higher than in mainstream schools. The issue has been compounded by the Covid-19 outbreak, with estimates that only just over half of pupils are attending state-funded AP schools this term, compared with 78% attendance in mainstream secondaries. “Exclusion does not have to leave a young life on the scrapheap,” Spielman told the Observer. “Children who are permanently excluded deserve a good deal elsewhere that will help them overcome their challenges and give them a shot at a successful future. High quality AP and PRUs can and do turn young lives around. “But they cannot do what they do best if children aren’t in class. It is a sad fact that these children are often preyed upon. Getting children engaged and into the classroom is so important – for their safety and to help them make the right life choices.” She said that the reality of referral units and APs was often very different to the common perception that the institutions were steering children towards gangs and exploitation. She said more than 80% of registered state-funded providers were rated as good or better by Ofsted. Meanwhile there are also concerns about the levels of attendance at mainstream secondary schools. Teaching unions warned of a “collapse” in attendance after official figures showed that more than one in five pupils in England missed school two weeks ago. While attending classes for a few hours each week marks an improvement for some children who have been excluded from their previous school, Spielman said that expectations should be set higher for daily attendance at PRUs. She said the most successful settings for excluded pupils had shown impressive results. Harmonize Academy, an AP free school in Liverpool that works with children who have been excluded or are at risk of being excluded, improved pupils’ attendance by more than 20% on average when they joined – the equivalent of an extra day a week in school. Marie McConville, its principal, said that there was a common misconception about what excluded students could achieve. “As soon as you mention alternative provision, people think it’s just a little shed somewhere and the students doing the same thing every day, they’re not making any progress – that those students are certainly not attending and then getting involved with criminal activity and gangs,” she said. “It’s certainly not like that here. We offer many subjects and we’re in a nice school building. We have small classes with a maximum of nine per class, we have really outstanding teachers. Students are attending every day, achieving more qualifications than they would in mainstream education. “The attendance is really important here. I do agree with Amanda Spielman when she says attendance is crucial. We say to students that they need to be in school everyday in order to succeed. If a student is struggling to manage their anger, or dealing with suicidal thoughts or depression, or they have a lot of issues that they need to get through in order for them to be able to learn, they can see our clinical psychologist once a week. They get lots of additional support. We tell them that we are outstanding because they’re outstanding, and it may be the first time that they’ve had that recognition.”",education
"The government’s plan to test all students before they leave university was thrown into question on Sunday after the UK’s largest academic union raised “grave concerns” about the accuracy of the Covid-19 tests being used and warned that this week’s mass evacuation of students was a “recipe for chaos”. The University and College Union (UCU) also said that many students have already returned home without being tested and it expects some will decline to take the voluntary test, because they do not wish to self-isolate in their halls of residence. The union also stressed that not all universities have agreed to participate in the government’s mass asymptomatic testing scheme, which begins on Monday. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Saturday that only 130 higher education institutions in the UK - 79% - have expressed an interest in taking part in the testing scheme. It is understood that at least 35 institutions are either carrying out their own testing regime, or not testing students at all. The government is supplying universities with lateral flow tests, which can be self-administered by asymptomatic students and do not require laboratory processing, offering “rapid results within an hour”. However, these tests have been criticised by experts in the British Medical Journal as an “unevaluated, under designed and costly mess”, with particular concerns raised over infected people receiving false negative results. Government-backed assessments carried out by Public Health England’s Porton Down laboratory and the University of Oxford suggests the tests may miss as many as half of Covid-19 cases, depending on who is using them, and that they are unsuitable for a “test and release” strategy that will allow asymptomatic students to go home. The study found that the sensitivity of the test dropped from 79% to 58% when it was used by self-trained members of the public as opposed to laboratory scientists. In its guidance to students returning home, updated last Tuesday, the Department for Education admitted that the test would not detect all positive cases. “The flaws in government plans for mass testing are a recipe for chaos that risk spreading the virus – the very thing they are designed to prevent,” said Jo Grady, UCU general secretary. “We have grave concerns over how this programme will be carried out, particularly the risk of students being told – incorrectly – they do not have Covid, then relying on their test result to travel home and spend Christmas with vulnerable relatives. There are also questions to answer on whether staff responsible for administering the tests have received the medical training to evaluate them properly.” Students are being urged to take two tests, three days apart. All tests need to be completed by the end of term (9 December) and students who test positive will be expected to immediately self-isolate at their university accommodation for 10 days, along with contacts and members of their household. Those who test negative are being advised to return home “as soon as possible” after receiving their result: Exeter University, for example, is advising students to “aim to leave within 24 hours”. The student “travel window” – the period in which all students are being asked to travel home by the government – will run from 3 to 9 December, meaning that mass testing and the travel window will finish on the same day. UCU said many students do not yet know which days they will receive their tests, and that testing hundreds of thousands of people in such a small timeframe – while following social distancing rules – would be “extremely challenging”. ‘The government chose not to listen to us when we warned that the mass movement of students in September risked the nation’s safety, and it has ignored requests from its scientists, and UCU, to move learning online to help control the virus,” said Grady. “By choosing to continue with in-person learning until the last minute, ministers are gambling with the safety of staff, students and the nation, betting everything on an untested testing programme.” Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Over the past few weeks university staff across the UK have worked with the government at considerable pace to develop and roll out enhanced asymptomatic testing for students, as part of the next phase of pilots for the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in British history. As well as ensuring students can return home this Christmas, these pilots will enable vital lessons to be learned on the nationwide scaling up of asymptomatic testing that other industries and society as a whole will substantially benefit from.” A government spokesperson said: “We have set out tailored guidance to universities designed by public health professionals to enable students to return home for the Christmas holidays while minimising the risk of transmission. “The tests are safe, simple to use and do not require medically trained staff to administer them. Just like the tests available across our regional test sites, individuals will be asked to self-swab under guidance from trained staff.”",education
"Women who say they were raped and sexually harassed at the University of Warwick have accused the vice-chancellor, Stuart Croft, of failing to protect female students. Five women, including one who said she had been raped on campus, told the Guardian the university had not addressed the toxic culture exposed in 2018 when female students discovered they had been targeted by male peers in a “rape chat” group. Jane, not her real name, said she had been raped in March by a male flatmate who had previously denounced the behaviour of the students behind the sexually violent texts two years ago. The second-year student, who reported the assault to the police and the university, has since studied remotely because of concerns about her safety on campus. The 19-year-old, who wrote an open letter to the vice-chancellor about rape culture on campus, said he did not seem to recognise how prevalent sexual misconduct and assault were at the university. “He has a duty of care. So many students have to get mitigating circumstances or support to get them through the trauma of sexual assault, which has been having an impact on both my and fellow students’ degrees, which isn’t acceptable.” One first-year student said that when she submitted a report of sexual misconduct to the university “nothing was done to reprimand the assailant”. The 19-year-old added: “I was sharing a campus with a known assailant, and I still am, and there are likely plenty of others who go unreported. The university wasn’t able to give me any information, other than tell me that I could move if I felt uncomfortable. The rape culture at Warwick goes completely unaddressed by the student union and the university itself.” A petition calling on the university to address sexual violence has attracted more than 3,000 signatories. Its creator, the student Laila Baghdadi, said she wanted the university to know how many women felt endangered. “I’ve heard boys make rape jokes to their mates and even discussing how another boy was having sex with a girl and then took the condom off, and didn’t tell her until after,” she added. “They didn’t see anything wrong with that.” She and other female students want the university to introduce mandatory sexual consent workshops for all new students, hire more specialist support staff to help victims, and provide attack alarms and self-defence classes. Emilie Eisenberg, one of the organisers of a protest against sexual violence on campus last weekend that attracted hundreds of people, said she thought sexual violence was common on campus because perpetrators knew that some of the male students involved in the rape chat scandal of 2018 had been allowed to return to the university. She said this encouraged the belief that perpetrators could get away with assaults. “We’re not going to stop putting pressure on the university until they make some real change.” A Warwick confessions page on Instagram posted an open letter to the university and students’ union last week in which an anonymous student wrote: “I receive countless stories of girls being touched, raped and taken advantage of … I have both witnessed this many times and also been a victim of it since coming to the university. This cannot go on any longer.” Tasha Hardaker, vice-president of It Happens Here Warwick, a student society which supports survivors of sexual assault, said it received about 25 messages a month from female students who had experienced sexual harassment or assault. Hardaker said her drink had been spiked at a club on campus during freshers’ week last year and she had been found unconscious in a bathroom. She said she had been interviewed by security but they had not told her she could make a complaint. “They said they were investigating the incident but never got back to me,” she added. Warwick University said victims of sexual misconduct could make anonymous reports online or speak to an independent sexual violence adviser. A spokesman added: “We are horrified to hear of the incidents the survivors have raised. Where incidents do happen and are reported to us, we continue to take strong action against those who are found to have broken our policies. This may include their complete suspension or permanent expulsion from our university.”",education
"Graffiti demanding the resignation of the president of Imperial College London over bullying allegations has appeared on walls outside of her residence as the chair of the parliamentary education committee added his voice to calls for the release of a report into the claims. Unease has been growing among the student and the wider academic community after the university’s authorities refused to publish the findings of an investigation into “a dysfunctional culture and alleged bullying”, leading to further accusations of a cover-up. Allegations against Imperial’s “most senior staff” were followed by a disciplinary process involving some of the individuals who were subject to whistleblowing allegations, the university’s authorities said. While the content of the report compiled by Jane McNeill QC has not been made public, the disciplinary panel constituted by the university council has decided that the dismissal of Imperial’s president, Alice Gast, was not warranted. Apologies have been issued by Gast and Imperial’s chief financial officer, Muir Sanderson. The university has declined to say what they apologised for. Gast receives £554,000 a year in pay and benefits as Imperial’s president, a role she has likened to being its “chief executive”. The Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs of theeducation select committee, said the report should be published for transparency, “so that all those affected can be assured that proper action is being taken”. A university spokesperson for Sanderson said the CFO was “fully supportive of the changes that have been put in place as a result of this process, and … has offered full apologies to those people who were affected by his conduct”. Asked whether “conduct” was a reference to bullying, the spokesperson said: “We cannot clarify this as the report remains confidential.” One of the whistleblowers who gave evidence to the investigation said members of staff were still “living in fear” of Gast and Sanderson and felt “let down” by the university and its governing council. A spokesperson for Imperial said: “As the appointment of an independent QC and disciplinary panel in this case shows, we treat any reports of bullying with the utmost seriousness, and have processes in place to provide support and investigate any allegation thoroughly, whatever the seniority of those involved.” Student leaders at Imperial have expressed disappointment at the authorities for refusing to publish the findings in a redacted form to protect the identities of those who gave evidence. They were responding to a letter from John Allan, the council’s chair, and Prof Ian Walmsley, the university’s provost, which said the allegations “concerned a dysfunctional culture and alleged bullying of some staff members”. “Our policy is clear that zero tolerance means any complaints must not be ignored and will be thoroughly investigated. That’s exactly what happened,” the letter said. But a response from Abhijay Sood, the president of Imperial College’s student union, and other union trustees, said: “To us, zero tolerance implies severe consequences. At the most senior level, it is hard to imagine what this could entail other than removal from the organisation. “We are concerned that this dysfunction may now grow, as the perception of a light touch response might prejudice the ability of staff members to properly manage similar disciplinary cases when more junior staff members are accused of similar indiscretions.”",education
"Cambridge University’s vice-chancellor is being urged to re-invite the controversial Canadian professor Jordan Peterson to take up a fellowship in light of a vote allowing “tolerance” of differing views. An offer of a visiting fellowship for the self-styled “professor against political correctness” was rescinded last year after protests from faculty and students. The university’s policy now emphasises “tolerance” of differing views instead of being “respectful” of them. And another amendment, covering “platforming”, stresses that those invited to speak at the university “must not be stopped from doing so” as long as they remain within the law. The journalist Toby Young said he would be writing, as a director of the Free Speech Union, to Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, to ask for the invitation to Peterson to go ahead following Tope’s welcome of the vote this week as “an emphatic reaffirmation of free speech in our university”. A dozen members of the Free Speech Union were said by Young to have been among the academics on the university’s governing body, Regent House, who voted by an overwhelming majority (86.9%) in favour of the changes to the proposed freedom of speech policy. Initially the policy would have required Cambridge University staff, students and visitors to be “respectful” of differing views. This was overwhelmingly rejected in a vote by the university’s governing body. Though chalked up by some as victory for one side in ongoing “culture wars” around freedom of speech and identity, the issue is unlikely to be mirrored at other campuses due to the relative uniqueness of legislative powers at play at Cambridge and Oxford University. At other campuses, policies are largely top down. But Arif Ahmed, a reader in philosophy at Cambridge who led the move, said he believed it would now be less likely that people would try to have others “disinvited”. He said: “I hope it will also embolden people to invite others to events where they may have previously had concerns.” He cited the case of Selina Todd, an Oxford University professor whose invitation to speak at the Oxford International Women’s Festival was withdrawn. Todd said she was told by the event’s organisers that the decision was due to pressure from trans activists. “That would be the example of the kind of disinvitation that could not now happen, and I hope that societies would also be more comfortable about deciding to invite controversial speakers,” said Ahmed. He declined to comment on the issue around Peterson but said: “In general terms I think that showing a lack of respect through speech, writing or research for, say, religion, or climate change denial, should not be grounds for being disinvited.” Others at Cambridge have continued to offer a different view. Priyamvada Gopal, a professor of postcolonial studies, said: “A government-ordered regulation suppressing protest (under the guise of free speech) has been pushed through with enthusiasm by a large number of traditionalist (mostly) men.” Ted Tregear, a research fellow at Cambridge University who was previously branch secretary of a union for academic staff, said the policy had come about due to pressure from the Department for Education and Office of Students.While he did not support the original policy, he believed that the new wording “made it even worse” and had been used by some people to “to rehash a kind of moral panic about free speech”. “I am particularly disturbed personally by the notion that once you have invited someone then you can’t decide not to invite them,” he said, giving the hypothetical example of how conference organisers’ hands might be tied in cases where it emerged that an invited participant planned to use it as an exercise to air easily debunked, pseudo-scientific, racist positions. A spokesperson for the University and College Union (UCU), a union representing more than 120,000 academics and support staff, said: “Academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law is absolutely vital in any civilised society. “It is crucially important that our universities stand against any attempts to curb the freedom to challenge opinion and explore sensitive issues, including through protest.”",education
"An investigation into the free school meal voucher fiasco, which left many families without food during lockdown, has found the government signed contracts worth up to £425m with a company for which there was “limited evidence” of its capacity to deliver. The troubled scheme was set up in just 18 days and awarded to the French-owned company Edenred, despite the government’s own assessment that the company’s UK arm did not have the financial standing that would normally be required for the scale of contract, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO). The public spending watchdog said Edenred was appointed to run the scheme using an existing government framework contract, as it was already a supplier to a number of government departments, which meant there was no need for a lengthy tendering process. Within weeks, however, problems began to emerge, with schools across England complaining of problems in registering for the £15-per-child weekly vouchers. School staff worked into the night to try to log on to Edenred’s website and parents waited up to five days for their vouchers. At one point in April, the Edenred helpline was receiving almost 4,000 calls and nearly 9,000 emails a day from frustrated school staff and parents. At the height of the crisis, ministers were forced to intervene directly and Department for Education officials held daily calls with Edenred to monitor progress. One of the key problems identified in the NAO report was Edenred’s IT capacity, which was inadequate to meet the challenge of supplying vouchers to up to 1.4 million children who were eligible for free school meals. The report says performance improved following DfE intervention, with processing times for orders dropping from an average of five days in April to just hours in July, and waiting times to access the website falling from 42 minutes to virtually no wait over the same period. According to the report, Edenred issued 10.1m vouchers in total at a final cost to the DfE of £384m, significantly less than the original cost estimated at the start of the scheme. The report says the DfE “does not know whether Edenred made a profit” on the scheme, but while the government paid them the face value of the supermarket vouchers, Edenred was able to generate revenue by buying vouchers at a discount on their face value. Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said: “DfE chose an adapted off-the-shelf system to save time. But when it launched, families typically had to wait five days to get the vouchers they needed to buy food. “Edenred’s systems buckled under the pressure, and schools and families found it much too difficult to get in touch when things went wrong. DfE and Edenred eventually managed to turn things around – but too many parents had to wait too long to get the support they needed.” Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Problems at the start of the scheme led to a frustrating experience for many schools and families, but DfE and Edenred worked hard to get on top of these issues. Performance steadily improved as the scheme progressed.” Edenred said it had delivered a scheme of unique scale for the DfE, which the majority of parents said worked well and translated every pound of public money into vouchers. “The report is fair in its reflection of the challenges faced in the first four weeks,” a spokesperson said. “We welcome the recognition of the hard work and investment we put into solving those problems, resulting in improvements to a scheme which delivered for parents and schools in the final four months of the programme, when it saw the greatest demand.” The children and families minister, Vicky Ford, said: “The NAO has recognised the swift action we took so that eligible children could access this important provision while schools were partially closed, with £380m-worth of voucher codes having been redeemed into supermarket gift cards by the time the scheme ended.”",education
"Students have begun receiving their BTec grades, a week after the exam board Pearson withdrew some and delayed the publication of others to give itself time to recalculate scores in the week of the A-level results fiasco. About 200,000 people who had taken the level one and two vocational qualifications were told last week, just hours before results day, that they would not receive them on time. A further 250,000 level-three grades, which had already been awarded, were also reassessed. It came after an outcry over A-level and GCSE results led to the scrapping of an algorithm that had calculated pupils’ grades in lieu of exams. After the algorithm downgraded the results of many pupils from the estimates given by their teachers, while apparently favouring pupils from private schools, pupils held multiple protests with many calling for the resignation of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. In many cases, BTec level-three students had also been given lower grades than they had expected. Pearson subsequently said regrading was needed to “address concerns about unfairness in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and ensure no BTec student is disadvantaged”. BTec results will now be given on a rolling basis over the week, with the priority going to level-three results, which may be used for applying to university. Pupils will receive results for level one and two qualifications from Thursday. A Pearson spokesman said: “We know this has caused frustration and additional uncertainty for students and we are truly sorry. No grades will go down as part of this review.” Jenny Cameron, the director at Stagedoor Learning in Cheltenham, who teaches level-three BTec performing arts, said almost all of her students’ original results had been two grades lower than they should have been. “The students have been treated really shoddily ... it’s been two weeks of unnecessary stress and worry for my students, as well as me,” she told PA Media. “It was just bewildering what [Pearson] did ... it didn’t make sense at all.” Kieran Cody, a year 12 student at a technical college in north-east London, was given a U in mathematics for engineering and a near-pass in his other subjects. The 17-year-old had earlier received some of the highest mock exam grades in his class and his teachers said they expected him to earn a distinction and merits in his final grades. “It feels like I’ve been treated like crap,” he said. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said:“It is right that Pearson recognised the oncoming chaos and played their part in rectifying the situation, but students and their families will not forget this results season in a hurry. It was an entirely avoidable state of affairs, and the weaknesses of the system are now fully exposed. “Gavin Williamson must put things right for 2021 as a matter of urgency. There needs to be a reduction in content assessed in exams next summer, collaboration with the profession to develop a robust national system of moderated centre-assessed grades in case of further outbreaks of Covid-19, and a thorough independent review into assessment methods along the lines announced for Scotland.”",education
"Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland hoping to use BTec qualifications to win university places have been given a lifeline after an examination board performed its own U-turn to scrap the flawed system it had used to award grades. Pearson, which offers BTecs to 250,00 students, including around 100,000 sixth formers who take them as a vocational equivalent to A-levels, announced on Wednesday that it would now use internal assessments and marks to set the final results for each course, meaning many young people could be awarded higher grades. However, Pearson’s decision means its level 2 BTec – equivalent to GCSEs – will not now be given to pupils on Thursday, as it will also be replaced by centre-assessed internal grades, causing school leaders hurriedly to rip up and reprint results slips. “We will work urgently with you to reissue these grades and will update you as soon as we possibly can. We want to reassure students that no grades will go down as part of this review,” said Cindy Rampersaud, Pearson’s vice-president for BTecs. “We appreciate this will cause additional uncertainty for students and we are sorry about this. Our priority is to ensure fair outcomes for BTec students in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and that no BTec student is disadvantaged.” Kate Green, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said the delays in revising BTecs were “totally unacceptable”.  “Gavin Williamson and the Department for Education should have had a grip of this situation days ago. It’s appalling that thousands of young people should face further confusion and uncertainty because of the government’s incompetence,” Green said. “This repeated chaos is simply no way to run a country. The government must urgently set a clear deadline for every young person to receive their grades.” School leaders and teachers in England had complained that the algorithm used by Pearson penalised high-achieving students, and paradoxically made it more likely that they would be treated harshly in the external assessments that replaced exams. Several schools and teachers contacted the Guardian to say that because of the flaws, a substantial number of their pupils had received lower grades than their internal assessments had suggested and were in danger of missing out on university places. Plympton academy, in Plymouth, said one of its students taking an engineering BTec was awarded distinctions in all four internally assessed units. But Pearson gave the course’s single external unit a U or fail grade, and the student was awarded a U overall rather than the expected top mark of a starred distinction. While students taking A-levels this year had benefited from the U-turn by the exam regulator, Ofqual, which announced on Monday it was dropping calculated grades in favour of more generous school-assessed grades, those holding BTecs looked set to miss out. “Although we generally accepted centre assessment grades for internal units, we subsequently calculated the grades for the examined units using historical performance data with a view of maintaining overall outcomes over time. Our review will remove these calculated grades and apply consistency across teacher-assessed internal grades and examined grades that students were unable to sit,” Pearson said in a statement. Ofqual confirmed the decision, saying: “Pearson, which initially did not think there would need to be significant changes made, has now decided to revise its arrangements to ensure that students’ qualification-level results better reflect the unit-level results that students have already secured through internally-assessed units.” Meanwhile, the OCR exam board, which covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said that its Cambridge National results, which should have been published on Thursday along with GCSE results, would not be issued until next week.",education
"Tens of thousands of frantic school-leavers are still waiting to hear if they will be accepted at the university of their choice after receiving better A-level grades this week. But vice-chancellors are warning that taking large numbers of extra undergraduates would put students, staff and local communities at risk from coronavirus. Elite universities are racing to revise their social distancing plans, after the government U-turn led to 160,000 students having their A-level grades marked up. Some Russell Group universities say they took tens of thousands of calls in just two days this week, as students begged to be reconsidered for offers they had missed last Thursday. Ucas has confirmed that about 15,000 students rejected by their first-choice university last week now have the grades they need. The vast majority of these had chosen the most prestigious universities, which could be under most pressure to expand this year. Despite extra government funding for high-cost subjects, university chiefs are warning that ramping up numbers could be unsafe, and the capacity of lab-based subjects will be hardest to increase at short notice. Most institutions are nervous about publicly saying they cannot take more students, in case the government tries to blame them for the chaos. The head of one leading university says: “We were already full and already worried about managing social distancing before the U-turn. Right now we have no clue how many more students will want to come, but our worst-case scenario is having to accept thousands extra.” Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, says: “We can’t use all our buildings and rooms to full capacity. We are going to have to be pragmatic. The health and safety of our students and staff has to be uppermost in our minds.” The Independent Sage committee will publish a report on Covid and universities on Friday, which is expected to say that universities should be focusing on improving online learning rather than trying to get students back on campus. Vice-chancellors say organising “blended learning” within government guidelines, with lectures online but lab sessions and small seminars or workshops taught face-to-face, was challenging enough for the numbers they had been expecting before the A-levels fiasco. Some are now considering asking staff to work overtime to fit in more small-class teaching. But they admit the biggest headache may be getting students to obey distancing rules outside the classroom. One elite university head said they had already uncovered plans for a big student party, which will be closed down. Students at Cardiff University will be expected to sign up to a new behaviour pledge and other universities are planning new Covid clauses in their student contract, which will allow them to deter antisocial behaviour on and off campus, such as house parties. The vice-chancellor of another Russell Group university, which the registrar is insisting cannot safely take more students, says: “Students have been cooped up with parents. They are going to want to let their hair down and who can blame them? But we are looking at disciplinary procedures if they do things that could damage the health of the community.” Some universities, including Warwick, Sheffield, Cardiff and York, have confirmed students must wear masks in campus buildings, and at Southampton University students will have to wear them in their student kitchens too. Some leading institutions, including UCL, the University of York, the University of Southampton, and Queen Mary University of London, have confirmed they will accept all students who have met their offer grades, except in subjects with strict caps such as medicine. However, in many cases elite universities are planning to offer deferred places. Southampton has built four new teaching buildings to help with distancing, but Kieron Broadhead, the university’s executive director of student experience, says: “In a Covid-19 world the safety of our student and staff population is key, so this means that for some courses that offer will have to be for next year.” Russell Group universities say they have had legal advice suggesting that although an offer of a place is a legally binding contract, deferring it to next year should be acceptable. Nonetheless some remain anxious about the possibility of legal challenges from students. Sandy Lawrence, from Newquay in Cornwall, is furious that her 18-year-old son, James, has been deprived of his first-choice place. Despite achieving a starred distinction in his triple-science BTec he had not met his offer to study biosciences at Durham University because his biology A-level had been downgraded from a B to a D. Durham has now said there is unlikely to be a place until next year. She says: “We’d bought champagne and we should have been celebrating his triple-starred distinction, but he was devastated.” After spending results day trying to phone other Russell Group universities, James was offered a place at the University of Bristol. But his mum says: “He had set his heart on Durham. He’d even started making friends with other students on Zoom.” At Cardiff, Riordan has sympathy for this year’s school-leavers, but is determined not to take more students than he thinks safe. The university was about to close its admissions call centre when the U-turn was announced. “We were suddenly inundated with frantic calls,” he says. “It is not the applicants’ fault they have met the conditions a lot later, but on some courses there won’t be much we can do. There will have to be compromises such as offering deferred places for next year.”  Riordan is unapologetic about the need for student life to be very different from before to control the spread of coronavirus. “Many young students may feel they won’t be particularly affected if they get it, but we need to get across the burden this places on the health service, and the risk to others in the community who are vulnerable.” Cardiff, he adds, will be “absolutely clear” about the rules all students will be expected to follow. “We can watch out for parties in student houses and be clear that is not allowed, and we will respond to complaints and calls about behaviour. Mostly there has to be a lot of communication,” he says. Mike Merrifield, professor of astronomy at the University of Nottingham, says his department put in a “huge amount of work” calculating how many physics students they could safely take, with many extra lab sessions to keep them small. “We’ll take about 200 students, but maybe 10 or 15 more might now meet the requirements. Even that number would break the system as we’ve already pushed things such a long way,” he says. Levi Pay, a former director of student services who advises universities on the student experience, agrees. “Space on campus was already squeezed to within an inch of its life. Universities are planning on spaces holding 20-50% of their previous capacity. Increasing numbers by a few thousand would create a lot of pressure.” Universities are also braced for local lockdowns. In Birmingham, which could soon be on a “watchlist for intervention” after a significant rise in cases, Aston University says it is working closely with the city’s director of public health. Saskia Hansen, Aston’s deputy vice-chancellor, says although they will be running labs and intensive teaching sessions on campus, there will be a parallel online-only option for students who are shielding or who can’t get flights from abroad. This makes switching everybody online in the event of lockdown much easier. Aston is considering which areas it can expand while still keeping students safe. But Hansen adds: “We will be doing everything we can to contribute to Birmingham hopefully not getting new problems with Covid. We recognise the risks of asymptomatic younger people inadvertently spreading Covid into the wider community.”",education
"The algorithm used by the exams regulator Ofqual to determine A-level and GCSE grades in England following the cancellation of exams has been scrapped, prompting chaos and an urgent review by the UK’s national statistics regulator. The U-turn followed a series of warnings over its potential volatility and fairness. With schools closed and the pandemic gathering pace, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, warns the head of Ofqual the regulator “should ensure, as far as is possible, that qualification standards are maintained and the distribution of grades follows a similar profile to that in previous years”. In a letter to Sally Collier, Ofqual chief regulator, he says students should be issued with calculated results based on schools’ assessments of their ability in the relevant subjects, supplemented by other evidence. Ofqual begins to test a range of algorithms, simulating predictions of results for 2019 exams and comparing the outcomes to the actual results. Ofqual launches a consultation on the arrangements for awarding GCSEs, AS and A-levels, which draws responses from more than 1,000 schools plus unions, teaching bodies and employers. It publishes an analysis of responses, which includes the concern that “some arbitrary algorithm [is] making standardised adjustments”. Calls are made for transparency. One respondent says: “BAME – feedback from some local communities has noted that they are concerned that grade calculation will have a negative impact on their results.” When schools begin submitting teacher-assessed grades, flaws in the algorithm become evident, an adviser who reportedly helped develop the Ofqual software told the Daily Mail. There was “always an understanding there would be winners and losers … there was a very specific point when it became doomed,” the source reportedly said. Sir Jon Coles, a former director general at the Department for Education (DfE), writes to Williamson expressing concerns about the algorithm used by Ofqual. He warned it would be 75% accurate at best when applied to GCSE and A-level grading, according to the Times. Williamson holds a video conference with Coles to discuss the concerns but opts to press ahead. External advisers meanwhile sound warnings to Ofqual that the formula was “volatile” and risked producing erratic outcomes, the Guardian reveals. MPs on the education select committee raise concerns about the grading system in an interim report, warning that some pupils risked being “systematically disadvantaged by calculated grades”. It calls on Ofqual to publish details of the algorithm immediately, adding: “Ofqual should not be afraid of scrutiny or open debate over whether its model offers the fairest outcome for every pupil and provider.” But the exams body refuses, with Ofqual warning that publishing the model would help some schools to calculate awarded grades. Coles also calls on the schools minister, Nick Gibb, who holds a meeting with Ofqual and senior officials at the DfE, to examine the concerns raised. “He felt that the model as devised would disadvantage young people from poorer families and so we discussed that in great detail and I was reassured that it would not,” Gibb said on Thursday. Ofqual runs a summer symposium about the exam arrangements, as it comes under increasing pressure but continues to resist calls to publish the model it will rely on. However, it admits for the first time that it has tested 12 different approaches. Slide 17 of a slide pack used at the event states the statistical model it has selected is the “Direct Centre-level Performance (DCP) approach”. The algorithm is finalised, with the diktat issued by Williamson on 31 March understood to have been the overriding factor that led Ofqual to reject warnings from its external advisers. The failure of the approach becomes apparent when A-level grades are announced, with teachers in England having 39% of their assessments downgraded. A U-turn by Scottish authorities has already taken place. While Ofqual has yet to publish the actual algorithm, it publishes the rationale in a “Annex E” addition to a document first published on 7 July: “Requirements for the calculation of results in summer 2020.”",education
"Prof Pat Thomson, known for her award-winning work on creativity, the arts and education, has quietly been on a darker mission: for the past six years behind the scenes she has been collecting reports of what she calls corruption in the school system. Academy sponsors siphoning off money from school budgets, teachers fiddling test results and heads claiming unlawful bonuses are not just a case of a few bad apples, she claims. Instead, says the professor of education at the University of Nottingham, such dishonesty and greed are evidence of the unethical system in which schools work. Her 3,800 examples of bad practice, mainly from England but also from other countries where market forces have been injected into public services, tell a story of nepotism, fraud and cheating. In England, they also highlight structural “reform”, with its waste of money on free schools that never open, the horrendous ongoing costs of successive private finance initiatives (PFIs), and the way schools are pitched against each other for survival. But the source lies at the heart of governments that have allowed spin and perception to replace decisions for the public good, she says. She has written a book on her findings, explaining how what she regards as corrupt practices are built into the system through competition, market forces and wasteful procurement. Although most people work ethically within this corrupted system, the book provides ample opportunities of the less honest furthering their own or their school’s interests if they think they can get away with it. She gives the example of the boss of an academy telling teachers to cheat in tests, and the widespread off-rolling of students to improve schools’ results. What the country needs is an independent public commission to start the conversation about what we think a school system should be doing and how best to educate young people for the future, instead of focusing on fiddling with school types and the curriculum, she argues. “Money urgently needed in schools has been spent on tinkering with the system, structural change that doesn’t alter what happens in the classroom between students and their teachers,” she says. A prolific researcher, journal author and enthusiastic blogger, Thomson usually visited schools with successful teaching and learning but felt unable to ignore the disastrous events she saw across the wider system, such as the bullying of staff by heads buckling under pressure to improve results at any cost. Included in her hit list of bad practices are failed government initiatives that deprive schools of badly needed cash. Malmesbury school in Wiltshire, for example, has to pay £40 a month for “managing” a canteen bench bought by PFI, on top of installation costs. With 13 years of the contract still to run, it works out at £6,240 just for its “management”. Thomson lays the blame at the top of government. “We have been living with this culture of spin and deceit for a long time,” she says. “I’ve continued to collect examples and now have many more than 3,800 – one of my three clips last week was a decision by the Office for Statistics Regulation to uphold a complaint that Boris Johnson was misusing statistics on child poverty.” Johnson said there were 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than in 2010, a claim found to have no factual basis. “If the prime minister manipulates statistics and the Department for Education is being told off several times for not using statistics appropriately, then you can see right at the top is a culture that says it is acceptable to massage the figures and do what you can get away with,” she says. Unless policy agendas are framed by a commitment to the public good and structured and regulated accordingly, there will be corrupt behaviour and practices, she warns. So does that excuse the head who gave a contract to his mother’s firm or the academy trust that claimed hundreds of thousands of pounds for school repairs it didn’t carry out? No, but it’s important to look at the root causes, she says. Raising money for buildings and repair through PFI, with its expensive ongoing costs borne by schools, and bringing market forces into education through contracting out resources and services once provided by democratically elected bodies, have created opportunities for fraud, she says. She is most worried about England but she sees the same disreputable practices eating into education systems in countries such as the US and Australia, where she was born and worked as a teacher and head before moving into academia at the University of South Australia. The pressure on schools in England surprised her when she moved to the University of Nottingham in 2003. “I was shocked when I arrived by the punitive regime of inspection,” she says. “In my very first class, which was a master’s class of mostly headteachers, one introduced herself saying ‘Hello, I’m a failed headteacher’. It upset me that someone should take on that as their identity.  “Then I started to see waste of money, not at school level, but higher up with people spending a lot on schools that never opened, while those that were open were having to cope with the most appalling buildings,” she says. Critical though she is of the Conservative government, she acknowledges waste was rife under Labour too. For example, the Blair government’s early academies cost on average £3m over budget, with the shortfall covered by the government, not sponsors, according to the National Audit Office. She regards the scandalous costs of PFI as corruption, citing the new school in Liverpool built with private finance that failed to attract enough pupils and closed, but continued to cost £12,000 a day, with Liverpool council facing a £25m bill to buy itself out of the PFI contract. A teacher tells her how “management” of a new sink has cost the school £88 a year for the past 14 years. With nine years left on the PFI contact, that one sink will have cost £2,024. Despite Thomson’s concern, she is not calling for academy status to be abolished or Ofsted scrapped. What the country needs is government to be “re-moralised” and the civil service reorganised so that public resources are used in the interest of all. “The call is now even more urgent to a world living with the aftermath of Covid-19,” she says. “The private has been elevated over the public good. We need to think now about how we might do things differently, how government might forge a new contract with the public to organise the nation in the best interests of all of us. A commission could bring together everyone in education to foster a renewed sense of solidarity and trust.” But can 3,800 examples and one book turn the tide? “I don’t imagine this book is going to do a lot by itself but it could get people talking. I hope it will inform debates about what might be done now to help save teachers and students from a school system bruised from decades of political pet policies and projects,” she says.

"Sheffield University has halted proposals to cut salaries and promotions for staff due to financial concerns related to coronavirus after the institution found that more students planned to go there than expected, boosted by the government lifting its cap on intake numbers. In an email to staff, the human resources department said that a recently launched consultation on cost reductions would be closed. They said the pandemic had not “put students off going” and the government lifting the cap on how many people they could accept meant their intake could be higher. They noted that other cost-saving measures had also helped, including voluntary redundancies resulting in “£12m in staff salary savings for 2020-21”. The measures that were being proposed included pay freezes, pausing incremental pay progression, cancelling or deferring promotions and a reduction in pay. The University of Sheffield branch of the University and College Union said in July that any planned changes would be premature. In a tweet, it said: “Uni management has told staff that if an agreement is not reached in the 90-day consultation, they may unilaterally impose any/all of the above changes to terms & conditions via dismissal & re-engagement.” This means in effect that staff would be dismissed and rehired under new terms and different contracts. On hearing news of the end of the consultation, the union said: “The university has withdrawn its s188 notice and the threat of dismissal and re-engagement that was hanging over staff has been removed. We’re pleased to see this but remain disappointed at what was always a premature and unnecessary move by our employers.” The university had praised the lifting of the government cap on student numbers, saying it meant it could accept more students who met the terms of their original offer. But Mark Pendleton, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies, said: “We cannot accept significant increases in student numbers. It is unsustainable and dangerous in terms of F2F [face-to-face] teaching, bad for student experience, terrible for staff workload and stress, and potentially devastating for the sector.” The university said the changes that prompted its new course were: “Firstly, the furore surrounding the A-level results and university places has shown that the pandemic has not put students off going to university and has actually demonstrated an increased demand. “Secondly, the government’s decision to change how A-level results are awarded, and the subsequent lifting of the cap on student numbers, also means that we can accept more students who meet the terms of their original offer. In light of this, there is also the potential for further government support and our university continues to push for this.” In its email, the university said since launching the consultation it had reduced spending on many non-staff areas, improving its financial position. “Over the past few months, colleagues have worked tirelessly to put us in the best possible position for this coming academic year and beyond. As a result of these collective efforts and changes, it is now our view that such an extreme adverse financial situation is less likely to arise. We have also put in place additional steps to mitigate significant reductions in our income,” the email read. The university has been approached for comment.",education
"This time last week, Gavin Williamson was sticking to his guns. The algorithm had worked. There would be no U-turns. Within 48 hours – hours that had been excruciatingly painful for tens of thousands of disappointed students, their parents, teachers and universities – Williamson had changed tack. The algorithm hadn’t worked, he had ordered a U-turn – and was apologising to all the young people who had suffered as a result. In politics, about-turns don’t come much bigger than this. But if Williamson had thought his considerable embarrassment would end there, he was wrong – again. His explanation that he had only become aware of the scale of the problems “over the Saturday and Sunday” is under intense scrutiny – it now appears both he and his department were warned at least four times in July and August that the algorithm-based system for calculating A-level and GCSE grades in England was seriously flawed. So how did this blow up in his face? The roots of the crisis date back to March, at the height of the pandemic. While countries such as Germany went ahead and held school exams despite the coronavirus, the nations of Britain did not, each deciding to award grades by algorithm. On 31 March, Williamson hurriedly issued an instruction to the exam regulator, Ofqual, insisting “the distribution of grades follows a similar profile to that in previous years”. Few paid much attention. In the months that followed the main issue was how to reopen schools, with Williamson focusing on fighting with teachers’ unions over the issue. But as the pandemic eased, the worries about the exam system began to mount. Early in July, the education select committee complained the approach meant there were “potential risks of bias” affecting disadvantaged groups. That same month a worried former senior official, Sir Jon Coles, approached the schools minister, Nick Gibb. Privately, Coles warned him “it would disadvantage particularly children from poorer backgrounds” – and would only be 75% accurate. Huy Duong, a former medical statistician, with a son facing exam results of his own, calculated – presciently – that 39% of A* to D grades would be lower than teacher assessments. The findings led to a front page story in the Guardian, six days before the England’s A-level results were due. “It should not have taken a genius to work out that any model that was only 60% or 75% accurate would have led to too many individual injustices,” says Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service. “Was there any algorithm that could have done the job ministers were looking for?” There were other warning signs, and they were flashing red. Scotland was embroiled in its own exam storm. On 4 August, the Scottish Qualifications Authority downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended results – 124,000 – on the basis of its own algorithm. A deluge of complaints followed. Poorer pupils had been hardest hit in Scotland, but journalists were reassured that England would be different and that the algorithm about to be unleashed on thousands of young people was better designed. It turned out not to be the case. The Scottish model could not survive contact with political reality. The SNP education secretary, John Swinney, scrapped all the downgrades a week after they were announced, and allowed pupils to receive higher teacher assessed grades. “It’s deeply regrettable we got this wrong,” Swinney said. The English A-level results were far more dramatic than anybody expected. While 39.1% of the 700,000 teacher assessments submitted were downgraded, it was Ofqual’s insistence on benchmarking results against the prior three years’ attainment in the same subject in that school that cause the most serious problems. Yet, small classes, of the type favoured in private schools, were curiously exempt. That helped fee-paying schools record 4.7 percentage points more A or A* grades. For comprehensives the figure was 2 points, below the overall 2.3 average in England. Downgrades for some students were dramatic – with schools reporting some pupils unexpectedly receiving a U. One of the causes was that the algorithm decided that poor grades in the past meant somebody had to be marked down sharply again. Protests were immediate and stories of upset and frustrated students dominated the media. On Monday, the day of the climbdown, a spirited group marched on the Department for Education with handmade placards, chanting “fuck the algorithm”. Sam Freedman, a former adviser to Michael Gove at the DfE, said ministers had few good choices when the pandemic struck, but added: “Why couldn’t schools have seen the grades days or weeks in advance for verification, so they could say ‘this looks out of whack’?” Instead, such were the suspicions about teacher assessment, schools were told the day before just as if tens of thousands of exam papers had been marked. There was no safety valve in the system to protect students, and even ministers. As the crisis hit, Williamson became erratic. On the Saturday after the results were out, he told the Times “this is it”, there would be “No U-turn, no change”. Protests grew, and a complete U-turn was announced on Monday afternoon, where teacher assessments could replace algorithm-based grades. “Over the weekend it became apparent,” Williamson belatedly said “there were real concerns about what … [grades] a large number of students were getting”. It was accompanied by a picture of Williamson, a former chief whip, sitting at his desk with a riding whip and a red book at the front. “It was there when I arrived, so I made sure it got in the picture,” the photographer, Stefan Rousseau, said. The unsubtle message was not lost on anybody, coming from a figure who was once Theresa May’s key enforcer before she sacked him and he switched to help run Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign. The current prime minister, on holiday in Scotland, has already shown himself to be a reluctant sacker, and Williamson appears insulated for now. But few in Westminster believe the education secretary can survive much longer if there are problems with schools reopening in September. Meanwhile, for a government that won dozens of working class seats from Labour at the election, it was politically damaging. A former Tory aide who worked in government before the election said: “Why have Dominic Cummings if he or people close to him don’t raise the alarm in situations like this?” Duong too is sure Williamson should have stopped the process in its tracks. “If a software failure causes a train crash, the boss can’t say, ‘I only saw the lines of code after the crash’. He should have known that in testing it failed 25% of the time and scrapped that software.”",education
"Over a quarter (27%) of university students were unable to access online learning during the Covid-19 lockdown, according to new research which suggests that disabled students and those from poorer backgrounds were worst affected. The survey, which was carried out in July by the National Union of Students (NUS), found that disruptions to studies arose from a lack of IT equipment and software, insufficient course materials, and poor internet connections. Of the 4,178 respondents, 18% said they lacked the support necessary to deal with Covid-19, such as counselling or financial help. Disabled students and those with caring responsibilities were more likely to have not received this support. The survey called for more help with students’ mental health and wellbeing, as well as more targeted, personalised teaching. Among the students who have struggled with the shift to online learning is Aqsa Rabbani, a third-year midwifery student at Middlesex University. “I found remote learning quite hard,” she said. “I feel like there was a lack of communication from the university and there wasn’t much support online. My classmates would often have technical difficulties and it was hard to get used to. The government could have supplied more grants or reduced fees this year, especially for healthcare students like myself who have been working on placement throughout coronavirus.” The NUS figures come after a similar poll published last week by the Office for Students (OfS), which highlighted the impact of digital poverty on students. Over half of respondents said they lacked access to online course materials during the pandemic. Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students, said: “These findings chime with our own research which shows that a significant number of students were impacted by digital poverty during lockdown. Since the beginning of the pandemic, universities have been working hard to deliver high-quality education in extremely difficult circumstances. But as the new term starts, universities must ensure their digital offering is accessible for all and that no students are left behind, particularly the most disadvantaged.” Last week, Barber announced a review of digital teaching and learning in English higher education to address the problem. “We want to know about what worked during the pandemic, what didn’t, and opportunities for the future. We cannot risk students being left behind in the rush for online innovation,” he said. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice president for higher education, said: “It’s evident from our research that the demand for academic support by students is going to go up even more than we’ve already seen during the pandemic, with many already turning to their students’ unions which have also been hit hard financially by Covid-19.” As a new term begins this month, over half (56%) of the students surveyed by the NUS also said they were concerned about contracting the virus on university campuses. In a recent interview with the Guardian, NUS president Larissa Kennedy said she was worried about a lack of consistency in universities’ safety measures. “[Universities are] committing to in-person teaching, which they haven’t necessarily thought through from a safety perspective because they’re in competition with other institutions,” she said. “Immunocompromised students and disabled students are once again being erased from the conversation, and of course their staff counterparts.”",education

"As many children in England go back to school for the first time in months, we talked to parents around the country about their expectations, anxieties, and how they hope to navigate their way through the new normal in the age of the pandemic. There were a few tears, one or two lips being bitten nervously and some of the younger children clutched firmly on to their parents’ hands as they were marched up to the school gates. But most of the 840 pupils returning to Bishop Road primary school after their very extended break had a spring in their step. In their bright purple jumpers and cardigans, they greeted friends they had not seen for months joyfully; they excitedly began to tell teachers about their adventures in lockdown; some demanded parents take a picture to record the occasion. Then they started to get used to the differences – the one-way routes, the hand-washing regimes, the subtle changes to playtime. “It’s great to see them back,” said Jon Martin, who was dropping off Bowen, six, and Nia, nine. “My daughter barely slept last night, she couldn’t wait to get back in. My son didn’t grumble as we got out of the door so that’s a win too. “Trying to do home learning has been really hard and they’ve missed out on the social side. We’re all desperate to get back to some sort of normal.” Sara Kelly-Smith, a single parent, was escorting Mia, seven, back to school. “It’s been a bit of a nightmare,” said Kelly-Smith, who has been trying to juggle her beauty business with childcare. “There’s only so many bike rides you can do.” Most were happy with the safety regime the school had put in place, with only a handful turning up in masks. “I’m sure they’ll do it well,” said Kate Macleod, who was dropping off her seven-year-old daughter, Jessie. “More than anything, I don’t want their lives, their education, their futures to be affected any more than they have to be. They’ve missed learning, friends, socialisation.” It felt familiar – but there were differences. Pupils and parents faced a web of lines and arrows painted on to playgrounds to follow to make sure they got to the right place at the right time. Day one involved a staggered drop-off. Years one, three and five were asked to arrive from 8.30 – 8.45am, years two, four and six from 9.15-9.30am. If sibling drop-off times differed adults needed to go through the process twice. To help, the school had posted a series of videos online explaining the procedures. The school made it clear all children were expected to attend unless they were self-isolating because of coronavirus symptoms or a positive test result, or if they had been advised not to attend by a health professional because of an underlying condition. Pupils were remaining with their class throughout the day and were not mixing with other classes for break or lunch. Events such as assemblies will happen remotely. The school followed government guidance in not requiring staff or children to wear face coverings. But it says any person choosing to wear a mask at school will not be prevented from doing so. There were new desk layouts, “enhanced” cleaning and, where it was safe, windows and doors were kept open to increase ventilation. It helped that day one turned out to be bright and warm. In corridors, a “keep to the left” rule has been introduced, with clear markings on the floor. Pupils were asked to bring in packed lunches and snacks. Children who are eligible for free school meals and were previously receiving vouchers are being provided with a packed lunch. There will be up to three classes on a playground at any one time but each class will be allocated their own playground space. Children will be encouraged to avoid games that involve substantial physical contact and are not allowed to bring in equipment such as footballs and table tennis bats. Nor were they allowed to bring pencil cases, toys, balls or games. They were also not to bring in sweets, cakes or other items on their birthdays. Joe Emissah, the deputy head, said the school was delighted to be welcoming pupils back. “We are fantastically pleased that we are all going to be back in school doing the things that we love – sharing stories, reading books, hearing about all the things everybody’s been getting up to and getting started with our learning.” Most pupils and their adults seemed to be coping with the rule changes admirably. Robert Jones, who walked Arthur, five, up to the school gates, said his son was excited to meet up with his classmates. “We’re glad everyone is getting on with it,” he said. Mohammed Ibrahim, who dropped off Mayadea, six, said: “It’s been almost five months – we really need to go back. Of course, we’re still concerned about coronavirus but we’ve got to do our best to stay safe and get on with it.” SM Though many schools in the North of England had taken an inset day on Tuesday, all pupils were welcomed back at staggered times by Chesham primary school in Bury, Greater Manchester. Despite initial concerns over safety, most parents at the school’s gates were keen to see their children off into their new social bubbles. “I think we were getting to the stage of them needing something else – they’re excited to get back,” said Kristie Harkness, who was waiting with her daughters Kenzie, eight, and Harper, four. Throughout the lockdown, Harkness and her husband, Brett, had been trying to teach the girls at home – although Brett clarified that he “wouldn’t call it homeschooling” and that much of it had involved creating things like Egyptian tombs out of cardboard. The family were ready to get back to normal – with Kenzie aching to see her best friend, Emma, and Harper wanting to get stuck in with painting. For Kelly Ralph, a retail worker, and Rebecca Dewhurst, a social worker, school offered some much-needed routine for their children following the summer holidays. “They’re not apprehensive about going into school,” said Ralph, who has two children: Noah, four, and Gracie, 10. “I think we’ve managed to keep some of that normality in our house because I’ve been at work the whole time – so it doesn’t feel that different.” Dewhurst added that she felt the government’s changing policies on schools reopening had been confusing. “No one knows what the impact of it will be until after it’s happened so how can they really know it’s safe.” Still, she had instructed her sons, Bartle, four, and Starson, six, on how to keep as safe as possible at school. “I’ve been very vocal about Covid and its implications for people and society with them. They know how to socially distance, they know all about hand washing.”  But for parents in the high-risk category for developing severe Covid symptoms, the decision to send their children back was something of a catch-22. “I’ve put [my son’s] mental health first and decided to send him back to school because he needs some normality. But I’m extremely apprehensive,” said Zoe Bailey. Bailey, who has Crohn’s disease, arthritis and asthma, has been shielding since March. The thought of Alfi, six, passing Covid on to her is something that frightens them both. “He’s become so anxious that he shouts at people in the street for not wearing masks and tells them to get away from me,” said Bailey, adding that there was little advice from the government over high-risk parents sending children to school. “To go from telling [shielders] not to go outside, it’s a scary place, to on 31 July saying we could just go about life as usual – you feel very unsupported,” she said. But the school had instilled some confidence where the government had not, Bailey felt. In the event of a child or staff member having suspected Covid symptoms, Alfi will be allowed to learn at home again. “There’s a digital learning plan set up for him already,” she added. AW At the entrance of Charles Dickens primary school in Southwark, Angel McCall was the only parent who wore a face mask. As she cradled her nine-year-old son’s head in her latex-gloved hands, she admitted that she found sending him back “very, very nerve-racking”. “I see there are not many people wearing masks, either,” she said. “So I’m thinking: am I the only one? Are we not worrying any more?” Her son was not wearing a mask but he admitted he was nervous too. “All I can tell him is be sensible and wash his hands and don’t touch anything,” McCall said, but she added that she did not think it would be easy for children to observe physical distancing rules. “He hasn’t seen any of his friends since March,” McCall said, explaining that she had kept him at home and not mixed with other families since the government-mandated lockdown began. Close by stood Ifeanyi Kamalu, waiting with his seven-year-old daughter for her turn to enter school – his four-year-old had already gone in. He had mixed feelings about returning his children to school. “As much as I know that the coronavirus is still out there, they have been out of school for about six months so I kind of feel that they should be back at school to continue learning – as much as all of us are scared of the virus,” he said. Kamalu was sceptical about the ability of the school to contain any outbreak. “I know that parents are bringing children from various homes … what if those kids have it? You have a huge window for passing the virus around. Here they are not necessarily observing the 2-metre rules or the face coverings. “I wish I could homeschool them, but I haven’t got the resources.” Not all parents were anxious. “It’s good to be back, let’s just say,” Tatjana Pisarski said. She was reassured by the school’s efforts to institute a regime of hygiene and precautions to keep pupils safe. “The school sent a little video to show what to expect inside, what we can’t see from the outside, all the washing basins and routines … it sounds really good.” High on the fence, a sign informed parents of the staggered times in which their children would be allowed inside: reception and year six first, at 8.15am, followed at 15 minute intervals by pupils from years four and five. “Follow the lines; join the queue; please keep your distance,” a sign instructed. As Marina Harrington queued to hand her son over to staff she said: “I can’t wait … Freedom; work; life.” Then, peering at her son, who had screwed up his face and stepped away, she added: “I love him dearly …” Harrington’s husband, Mark, cut in: “I love him enough to let him go, I think that’s the thing.” Marina Harrington said life with three children at home had been stressful. She explained she and her husband had been waking at 5am each day – before their children – to get in a couple of hours of work, then taking on homeschooling responsibilities when their children got up. Asked if they were concerned that their son had fallen behind in his studies during lockdown, Mark Harrington laughed: “He’s nine … that’s people who worry too much.” DG",education
"Is it too late to apply for student finance? No – but you’d better get a move on! You can apply for student finance up to nine months after you start your course but your application could take up to six weeks to process.  How will I receive my student loan? Your maintenance loan is paid at the start of every term into your student bank account. This doesn’t include extra funds you might get from your university if you’re eligible for further financial support. What costs do I need to consider? First up, rent and essential bills. These are all-inclusive (ie one fixed rate) in most student halls, as well as some student houses and private accommodation blocks. Otherwise, you and your housemates will need to organise payments for broadband, gas and electricity, water, streaming services, and a TV license if you want to watch the BBC (yes, even on catch-up.) To give you an idea of costs, Save the Student reckons the typical student will pay £32 a month for their essential bills, though you might pay less by going without a TV or streaming and using less water/energy (ie taking showers instead of baths). And don’t forget your personal bills, like mobile contracts and subscriptions. You may also have travel and course expenses on top of your day-to-day costs. Plus, I strongly recommend student insurance for things like laptops, as well as antivirus software and a hard drive to back up your work. Do I need to pay tax? If you get a part-time job, you’ll have to pay income tax if you typically earn more than £1,042 a month and national insurance if you earn more than £183. Your employer will deduct this from your wages through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). If you make money online you keep the first £1,000 as your trading allowance but beyond that, you’ll need to contact HMRC. You don’t have to pay council tax in a pure student house, but you may need to apply for an exemption. How do I organise the bills? Inform your suppliers you’ve moved in ASAP. Provide them with accurate readings of your meters so you don’t overpay for estimated readings. Once you get a handle on usage/needs, switch to better broadband and energy deals through a comparison website. Opt for shorter contracts if you’ll only be in the house for nine months and pay by monthly direct debit rather than annually – it’s simpler and cheaper. Work out how much each housemate owes and nail down a system for paying up. This could mean paying into a joint account or using a bill-splitting app like Splitwise. Only share accounts with housemates who will always pay on time to avoid damaging your credit rating. How do I make my student loan last? One word: budgeting. Figure out how much your rent, bills and contracts cost each month and subtract that from your maintenance loan. Transfer that amount into another bank account (it’s a doddle to open one these days) as soon as you receive your loan. If possible, leave an extra £100 in there for unexpected expenses or an expensive period like Christmas. Split the remaining loan into a weekly or even daily sum. Then bingo! You know much you have left to spend. Also, consider opening another account for any non-essential spending with a digital-first bank like Monzo or Starling. They offer budgeting tools and instant alerts when you use their debit cards so you know where your money is going. How can I save money? Get an NUS card and see if you can get a student discount with every retailer you use. Also check out discount schemes offered by StudentBeans, UniDays, Totum, and Young Scot in Scotland. Go second-hand wherever possible. Cook your own meals using non-perishable goods like beans, lentils, tinned fish and veggies, and passata. Invest in a tupperware box and prep your own lunch before going to campus. Maybe invest in a coffee pot and flask too: Chilly’s offers a 10% discount through UniDays. What if I struggle financially? Firstly, speak to the money advice service within your university: they will point you towards hardship funds and bursaries. You may also qualify for universal credit if you’re on a low income. If you have to borrow extra, your interest-free overdraft is better than expensive credit cards or loans. But you’ll have to pay it back within a few years of graduating to avoid being charged, so don’t go crazy. Try not to exceed the interest-free zone or at the very least, speak to your bank if you fear you might. Finally, don’t be afraid to get help from a debt charity like Stepchange: it’s free, they’re on your side and they’ll help you turn things around.",education
"Teaching unions have told parents to ignore letters circulating on social media that threaten legal action against schools requiring pupils to wear face masks or use hand sanitiser. Lawyers say the threats contained in the letters are baseless, and that the latest government guidance gives schools the power to require masks to be worn when appropriate. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are aware of template letters being circulated on social media for parents to send to schools objecting to any requirement for pupils to wear face coverings. “We do not think the tone of these letters is helpful and we would encourage parents who are concerned about policies on face coverings to discuss the matter with their school.” Laura Berman, a partner at the law firm Stone King, said she and her colleagues were contacted by around 10 state schools in England with copies of letters on Thursday that used very similar wording. “They are quite threatening letters, and they contain statements that who knows whether they are true, so schools are desperately trying to do the right thing and want to know how best to respond,” said Berman, who described some of the claims as “ridiculous”. One of the notices sent by a parent, and seen by Stone King, states: The letter goes on to make a false claim about the effects of wearing a mask. Some of the notices raise fears over the treatment of children displaying coronavirus symptoms, stating: Another section claims the parent did not allow their child to use the school’s hand sanitiser and would supply their own: Berman said it was unlikely that schools would object if pupils supplied their own sanitiser, or used soap and water. McCulloch said: “In areas where local restrictions apply, government guidance is that face coverings should be worn in communal areas in secondary schools. The guidance otherwise gives flexibility to secondary schools over whether to require face coverings in communal areas according to their context, such as the extent to which the layout of the school entails staff and students mixing in close proximity as they move around. “Where face coverings are required this will be because the school has assessed that this will help to mitigate the risk of transmission of coronavirus in communal areas. “We would ask that parents respect and support the policies of their school.” Berman said her advice to schools was that they had “clear discretion” over mask-wearing policies for pupils and staff. “Schools absolutely have that discretion. If they decide to implement it, if they decide that’s right for their community, then they can impose that policy,” Berman said. While the government’s policy states that no child should be excluded for not wearing a mask, Berman said she would advise schools to make face covering rules part of a school’s behaviour and health and safety policies. “Our advice would be to tie that policy into their behaviour policy so that if it is not adhered to then any breach of the policy can be sanctioned in the normal way. Schools will have to make adjustment to the policies for those who might have difficulty wearing a mask,” Berman said. On Friday the JCB Academy, a secondary school in north Staffordshire, became the first school in England to close owing to a confirmed Covid-19 case since the start of the new school year. The Department for Education and the Cabinet Office are said to have been aware of the misinformation circulating on social media, and the government’s rebuttal unit has been challenging posts on Facebook and other outlets.A DfE spokesperson said: “In local lockdown areas, children in year 7 and above should wear face coverings in communal spaces and corridors. Outside of local lockdown areas face coverings won’t be necessary in schools, though schools will have the flexibility to introduce this if they believe it is right in their specific circumstances. Face coverings should not be required in the classroom as they hinder communication and pupils’ education.”",education
"I wake at 4am, two hours before my alarm is due to go off, with sneezing fits and stomach cramps – cramps are one of my symptoms of anxiety.  Today is an inset day, typically an opportunity to get all the teachers together. This year, because of Covid, we are spread out around the building in small, socially distanced groups. Even instructions to discuss are now “with a socially distanced colleague”. However, I have strong doubts about whether the social distancing is going to work. On a holiday trip to Longleat, I learned that 2 metres is the same length as a fully grown zebra. Looking around, there doesn’t appear to be a zebra between us anywhere. Where’s a tape measure (or a zebra) when you need one? There is a noticeable absence of face coverings. We’ve been told staff and students can wear them if they want to. It means we have to buy our own masks. I choose to wear one but feel self-conscious as I’m one of the only ones to do so, so it ends up scrunched in a plastic bag in my trouser pocket. Some multi-academy trusts are providing all students with branded, colour-coded masks and staff with visors and masks. In my school, while we may not reach that gold PPE standard, we are certainly not the worst. I have heard horror stories of teachers coming back from shielding only to be publicly shamed by their heads for wearing a mask. I had expected the inset day to be dominated by talk of Covid, but it remains the elephant in the room. Questions seem to hang in the air unanswered, like a bad smell. The truth is, we just won’t know what things will be like until the students are back tomorrow. And if today is anything to go by, it will seem as if Covid had never happened. Today, I wake up to the sound of a text on my phone. It is the results of the Covid-19 test I had taken on bank holiday Monday. It is negative, which gives me momentary relief from the anxiety knotted in my stomach. At least I won’t be the next “super-spreader”. Today school is open only for the new starters. Staff stand around waiting to funnel the arrivals through reception and into the hall, with no temperature checks. It isn’t long before they are packed in like sardines, ready to hear the headteacher’s welcome address. In my head, I start a game of “Spot the face mask” but give up because there are so few. With all the conflicting messages and government U-turns, it has often felt like playing a board game in which the rules are made up on the spot. The fact that the students are in year “bubbles” offers me little comfort. While the bubbles at a primary school could be up to 60 students, secondary bubbles can be five times as many. Increasingly, I worry that this particular bubble is about to burst. Throughout the day, unmasked adults lead groups of unmasked children around the school grounds without socially distancing from them at all. The scenes shock me in the same way as when I look back at archive footage of music concerts. My alarm clock wakes me at 6am. We all rise as one, as each of us is back at school or work today, for what feels like the first time in forever. Like many working parents across the country, I owe a mountain of gratitude to all the staff running school breakfast clubs. Both my children are going today. The staff there are rightfully vigilant about children sanitising their hands as they come in. My youngest is caught off guard. “Hand sanitiser, please!”. He has his water bottle in one hand and his packed lunch in the other, his face contorting as he puzzles through his dilemma. His bottom lip wobbles, then he sticks his water bottle under his armpit, threads his other hand through the handle of his lunchbox, and sanitises like it’s going out of fashion. This makes me think about my own school. It is easy to bemoan the absence of adequate PPE, but are the schools that enforce strict safety rules in danger of scaring the life out of young people? All schools are walking a tightrope between keeping everyone safe and everyone sane. I don’t understand why we can’t achieve both. I hear one parent, wearing a mask, ask a teacher about the rules and I’m frightened by the response. “I doubt whether many people will be wearing them tomorrow and the ones that do will probably feel a bit silly.” We are supposed to be modelling how to be good citizens in a time of Covid, but I do not see a single student wiping down their desk or washing their hands in the numerous outdoor wash basins that have been installed. The vigilance we were all told to employ seems to have gone awol. And in the absence of vigilance, it won’t be long before the Covidiots have moved into town to hold an illegal rave on our sports field. When I get home, one of my parent WhatsApp groups has almost 100 messages on it, with parents desperately wanting to chat about how the first day went. Most of the posts are about what the children ate (or didn’t eat) in the absence of cooked meals. Malt loaf bars appear to be the healthy snack food of choice. Today is the last day of the first week back, and the day when all our students return to school, or face being fined for unauthorised absence. This strikes me as particularly harsh for any student with a family member undergoing chemo or those living with elderly relatives. As someone who suffers from bouts of anxiety, I’m not convinced that the threat of a hefty fine would be that effective while I’m in the throes of a panic attack. But the threat seems to have worked. The trickle of students over the last couple of days has turned into a torrent arriving eagerly at the school gates. I feel nervous as the sound of the students approaching the building builds to a crescendo: not nervous for me, but for the many friends and colleagues who have come out of shielding to be guinea pigs in the next part of this social experiment. A few more teachers are wearing masks but the students mostly seem blasé. One year 11 student seems more eager to show me a video of himself “stacking it” on his bicycle than to talk about Covid. We haven’t even seen the back of it but young people seem bored with coronavirus. It has become the Brexit of 2020. I broach the subject with one of my classes. One student tells me she hasn’t been able to complete an assignment because she has been working in a hospital over the summer. “What was that like?” I ask her. “Yeah. You know. People died. It was sad. It is what it is.” Some identifying details have been changed.",education
"It has been a summer of painstaking preparations for headteachers charged with drawing up plans covering everything from new behavioural rules to “Covid-secure” measures before millions of pupils in England return to the classroom full-time next week. Many schools will look different, with spray-painted stencils marking out 2-metre distancing outside, duct tape arrows signalling one-way systems in corridors, forward-facing furniture and desks with clip-on screens so teachers can get closer to younger pupils. What else does the new normal involve for schoolchildren? Many schools will stagger arrival and leaving times and lunchtimes to reduce crowding, resulting in shorter days for some and longer days for others. One mother of three said her four-year-old would have 90 minutes less school time a day.  School populations and building sizes are also constraining the use of the bubbles designed to restrict Covid-19 outbreaks. Instead of keeping small groups separate so a limited number of children have to self-isolate in the event of an outbreak, bubbles may be hundreds-strong.  At Exeter Road community primary school in Devon, which has around 200 children in its main building and 30 to 50 on a nursery roll, building work has put a third of space available out of action. “If you were going to have pure bubbles then surely each one would have toilet facilities of its own, so we are going to have four fairly large bubbles as a result and we’ll be trying to keep them separate, with staggered entry times,” said the headteacher, Paul Gosling. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, implied this week that parents should avoid lingering at school gates, saying they should drop their children off and “get on with the tasks of the day”. With some canteens off-limits and plans for some classes to eat lunch in the rooms they will be spending much or all of the day in, some schools will use apps to enable children to order their meals. Among schools trialling the app is Hampton High in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames, where the headteacher, Rebecca Poole, says enormous changes have been made. “We’ll be operating a food delivery service from the canteen as we can’t have large numbers of children eating together at the moment, and that’s where the app from our catering company comes in,” she said. Payment would normally be made via fingerprint recognition, but this has been replaced by lanyards. Schools such as Birchwood High in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, have installed outdoor decking under a shelter so that children can eat outside. The principal, Chris Ingate, said: “We have a big indoor cafeteria, but we wanted to make provision for eating outside. It’ll be a bit like going to Costa, you’ll go in and then out, but we’ll have to see how things are in the winter months.” Headteachers pause or take a deep breath when asked the million-dollar question: are you clear on what you’re supposed to do in the event of an outbreak? “It’s not entirely clear what will happen if there is an outbreak, but it’s not for want of trying,” said Ruth Davies, the head of Waunarlwydd primary in Swansea and the national president of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT). Schools have procedures in place for what to do immediately in terms of the isolation of pupils or staff, but whether an entire school or just a bubble would be sent home remains to be seen. Poole said: “Once we’ve isolated the person, made the phone call home and recommended they get tested, it’s somewhat unclear. My view is that test and trace will pick it up and we’ll be advised, but all I can say is that we’ll just have to deploy our professional judgment.” Plans are being made at her school for teachers quarantined at home to stream lessons into the classroom if needs be. With confidence in the government’s track-and-trace scheme at a low ebb, some schools have drawn up rudimentary forms to detail who shared rooms with whom. They include High Tunstall College of Science in Hartlepool, where the head, Mark Trilling said: “I think in reality if someone does come down then in our case the entire bubble of 30 would go into self-isolation. It is a bit confusing and there is no real guidance, but we would draw on our own professional judgment and take advice from the local authority.” Only 7% of school leaders were confident in the government’s test-and-trace scheme, according to an NAHT poll of nearly 4,000 school leaders. Only 18% were confident in the arrangements for a lockdown in their area. Poole and other school leaders say no one can tell when schools might be able to start thinking about relaxing some measures, but she predicts it won’t be for another nine months. “There’s a bit of concern about timetabling, but we will stick with what we’re doing because what children and parents need is clarity,” she said. “We won’t change anything until at least January, and I think we will have to go until at least March.” Davies voiced concerns about staffing, and said the coming six months could be hardest as winter takes its toll. “As soon as we have any semblance of a symptom then that person will be off, and if one or more members of staff go then there will be pressure. A steady stream of supply teachers just won’t be available.” Gosling said he feared a chaotic autumn term with teachers and pupils being sent home in large numbers and a lack of political leadership. Ingate said his main concerns were students who had fallen behind over the last few months, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as the “whole unpredictability” of Covid-19 and the potential for a second wave. “What happens? We’d take would advice from our local authority and health bodies, but I have an instinct that it would probably play out in terms of an increased incident rate in the area rather than the school being the centre. If rates went up, we’d see it,” he said.",education
"Scenes of overflowing lecture halls, with impassioned professors inspiring students, are a staple of any university-based drama. But for many students choosing the institution where they want to study in September 2021, they may be a thing of the past. Following the coronavirus pandemic, from September lecture theatres are more likely to be used as spaces where socially distanced seminars can be held. Increasingly, lectures – or at least the content contained within them – are being moved online. Some students are worried about the number of contact hours – a loose term referring to the amount of time spent with tutors through lectures, seminars and tutorials – they will get this year, while students looking ahead to September 2021 could be forgiven for feeling apprehensive. “When students go back, teaching and learning will undoubtedly be different,” says Allison Littlejohn, director of University College London’s knowledge lab. “There will definitely be less face-to-face teaching in the next semester, and more blended learning.” A Times Higher Education snapshot survey found this year that most institutions were hoping to offer a mixture of face-to-face and online teaching. Asked if she thinks the class of 2020-21 will experience the same scenario, Littlejohn pauses. “The truth is, I don’t know,” she says. “If universities find that students like a mix of methods, they may switch to having more online learning. I do think there will be more online and blended learning going forward.” But it could mean that the students of 2021-22 can expect – in some ways – a much richer experience. According to Littlejohn, a good blended course will include a clear structure, access to resources such as short videos and – most importantly – activities to help students learn specific concepts and test understanding. According to the Higher Education Policy Institute’s (Hepi) 2020 survey of student experiences, the contact hours students can expect varies significantly from course to course. Veterinary students see the highest number of hours, and communications and media students the fewest. But despite strikes and the pandemic, this year students still reported more timetabled contact hours, in smaller class sizes. Many students have already seen much of their learning move online, but that hasn’t necessarily led to a reduction in contact hours. Katie Adamson, a 19-year-old second-year law student, was among the Cambridge student body that learned all lectures would be online until at least summer 2021. Having the lecture content readily available before supervised group work has proved useful, and it’s not the only bonus, Adamson says. “We get to stay in bed longer and not risk missing our lectures because of it,” she jokes. She has been told to expect the same contact hours when she returns, and while lectures will be online, “supervisions” – or classes – will continue in small, socially distanced groups. “I’m really grateful for that,” she says. “The most important part of our academic experience will continue as much as possible.” Real interaction, as long as it’s safe, is crucial to good learning, says Littlejohn. “There has to be the opportunity to forge connections,” she explains. “Going for coffee with friends after a lecture is often as informative as the lecture. Not only do you learn about the subject, but you learn to be with people who are quite different to those you knew before.” Online learning portals can also use learning analytics to track whether students are keeping up, while predictive modelling can flag if a student is likely to drop out and alert tutors that they may need to provide more support. “Academically, it can be very difficult for students to be noticed in large settings. In a lecture hall with hundreds of others, it’s impossible really to know if they are understanding,” says Littlejohn. Imogen Dear, a second-year criminology and sociology student at the University of Surrey, has been told to expect eight to nine hours of lectures and seminars per week with bite-size videos, key reading and activities. “Our lecturers will be able to see if we’re viewing the videos, reading and activities, and I presume if we’re not taking part in online learning, we’ll have a one-to-one meeting with our personal tutor,” she says. “I’m not worried about the blended learning, or them tracking my work – it actually motivates me.” According to Helen Higson, provost and deputy vice-chancellor at Aston University, students would do better to focus on quality of contact, rather than quantity. “Lots of research shows that it isn’t contact hours but class size that makes the difference,” she says. In 2015 the government lifted a cap on university places in England, allowing institutions to recruit as many students as they wanted, which in some instances led to large class sizes and “a more passive learning experience”. “Universities have had a bad press over the past few years, and in a way justifiably, because we didn’t look at our core purpose,” she says. “Our core purpose is transforming lives, and we’ve been forced to do that.” But will 2020-21 students be at a disadvantage if, as some experts warn, too many students defer their university place this year? Overcrowding is already a problem in some places: earlier this year students at prestigious universities were being turned away from lectures and told to watch classes online or in overflow rooms. Rachel Hewitt, director of policy and advocacy at Hepi, thinks those fears are largely unfounded. A demographic dip means there are fewer 18-year-olds this year fighting for places, with numbers only expected to return to pre-2016 levels after the 2020-21 cohort. The uncertainty of coronavirus may make this September’s students think twice about postponing, she says. “When there are no options for travelling and less part-time work available, it may be we don’t see such high numbers taking a year out.” She advises would-be students to look beyond contact hours and class sizes and find out about support structures, availability of tutors, information about how prospective universities will support students into a job, and employability data. “Students really have to look at the bigger picture,” she says. There could be benefits from the coronavirus pandemic for the 2021 intake, too. The rapid changes have forced universities to be creative, and overhaul their online offerings, says Ian Dunn, provost of Coventry University. “I see it as a huge opportunity to do things differently,” he says. At Coventry, academics work hand-in-hand with learning designers to “create a story and bring a richness of resources” to online courses, almost turning learning into a game, he adds. “It’s not a set of powerpoint slides, or someone doing an hour’s lecture into a video camera. Good online resources might include an introductory two-minute video, then maybe links to resources, maybe a quiz.” Eva Terziyski, a second-year history and Russian student at the University of Bristol, says her key advice to newbies is not to fixate on what the university provides, but to make sure you are mentally prepared to self-motivate. “It’s not like school, where you’re going to get shouted at if you miss a class,” she says. “You’re paying to be there, so really your success is your responsibility.”",education
"It is the latest in a long line of government U-turns in recent months, but how will Downing Street’s policy shift on face masks affect children going back to schools in England next month? After a cabinet minister claimed on Tuesday morning that the policy was not under review, the government revised its guidance on face coverings for staff and children in secondary schools in England. In areas of the country with high levels of Covid-19, defined as “areas of national government intervention”, such as lockdown areas including Greater Manchester, children in year 7 and above and adults are being advised to wear face coverings in schools “when moving around, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing is difficult”. The guidance states “it will not usually be necessary” to wear masks in classrooms, where protective measures mean the risks are lower. The new policy falls under the category of guidance rather than “mandatory activity”, the government says. It adds that “any legal exemptions that apply to the wearing of face coverings in shops and on public transport also apply to this new advice”. Asked what would happen to anyone who does not follow the guidance on masks, a Department for Education spokesman said: “The wellbeing of all children, young people and staff should be the central focus when preparing for the reopening of schools at a local level. No one should be excluded from education on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering. As would be usual, if there are any concerns about a child or young person behaving or acting in a way which doesn’t align with school policy or procedure, their behaviour or actions should be discussed with them to resolve those concerns.” The government is not saying face coverings are necessary in secondary schools outside of local lockdown areas, but says it is giving heads discretion over whether to apply the guidance. “Schools and colleges will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, if they believe that it is right in their particular circumstances,” the guidance states. It gives examples of why school leaders might decide to recommend face coverings for pupils and staff, such as because the layout of the school makes social distancing difficult. On Monday the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said the evidence on whether or not children over 12 should wear masks in schools was “not strong”. However, the new guidance references the World Health Organization’s updated position – also endorsed by Unicef, the UN children’s agency – on 21 August which said: “Children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.” The government had also come under pressure from unions including the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents more than 19,000 senior staff, over the issue. Downing Street’s policy shift was announced hours after Scotland’s education secretary said on Tuesday that all Scottish secondary school pupils over the age of 12 should wear face coverings in communal areas including corridors from Monday. On dedicated school transport, all children aged five and over should cover their faces, the Scottish government also said. Northern Ireland has said it is making a similar move. On Wednesday, following a review, the Welsh government announced it was recommending face masks be worn in schools by those aged over 11 in areas where social distancing cannot be maintained, as well as on school buses. Not quite. The government’s latest policy about-turn has prompted criticism from its own backbenches, with the senior Tory MP Huw Merriman urging Downing Street to “get a grip”. In a stinging attack, he told the BBC on Wednesday: “The worry is that if we’re saying it’s unsafe in the corridors, the next thing it’ll be unsafe in the classroom, and that will really prove an impediment on people’s learning. And, quite frankly, as a Conservative MP that came into politics to try to help people’s life chances through school, I am sick and tired of the way that we are treating our young people. I feel it’s an absolute disgrace and I really feel the government needs to get a grip and just be certain, get on with it and inspire confidence rather than just completely changing its mind.”",education
"More than 300,000 students in England will be required to wear face coverings when schools reopen next week – although thousands of pupils could be told within days that they are no longer mandatory. There was confusion among MPs after Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announced in an 11th-hour U-turn that secondary school pupils in lockdown areas would be required to wear face masks in communal spaces from next week. The government was also accused on Wednesday of providing “completely inadequate” support to schools in England after it emerged that they would receive just 10 Covid testing kits each before the start of term next week. The kits were part of the government’s attempts to reassure anxious parents and staff but were immediately criticised by teaching unions. The rule requiring face masks applies to about 330,000 pupils at more than 300 secondary schools in Greater Manchester, parts of Lancashire, West Yorkshire and Leicester. However, some areas including Stockport are expected to have restrictions eased within days, meaning the mandatory face mask rule would no longer apply. There are nearly 15,000 pupils in the town’s 14 state-funded secondary schools. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, will announce which areas can be removed from the restrictions after his weekly “gold command” meeting with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, and the Joint Biosecurity Centre on Thursday. Decisions taken at this meeting are usually announced on Friday, which would leave only one working day before most schools reopen on Tuesday. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said he would write to Hancock on Wednesday to ask for Stockport and Bolton to be removed from the restrictions after a consistent drop in the infection rate in the towns. The Labour MP Lucy Powell said: “Speaking as the MP for Manchester Central, urgent clarity is needed from the government about which areas the face mask rules cover because headteachers and parents need this clarification.” Stockport has the lowest infection rate in Greater Manchester. Nav Mishra, Labour MP for Stockport, said he was “cautious but not against” the restrictions being lifted but was concerned that the infection rate would rise when schools return next week. On face masks, he added: “The level of ambiguity and lack of information [from central government] is just not acceptable.” The leader of Bolton council has also called for the town to be removed from the restrictions after its infection rate fell to 12.9 cases per 100,000 people, the lowest level for a month. More than 19,000 secondary school pupils will be required to wear a face covering when schools return next week but that could change within days if restrictions are lifted. William Wragg, the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove in Stockport, said there was cross-party consensus in Stockport that the borough should be freed from lockdown restrictions. He accepted there would be issues with cross-border confusion, with Stockport bordering Manchester and Tameside – where leaders accept that rates remain too high to lift the restrictions. “Obviously the restrictions apply to where you are a resident as opposed to where you are going. There is no perfect system, it is always going to be possible to take issue with any aspect of it,” he said. If Stockport comes out of lockdown, Wragg said it “would be up to the discretion of the headteachers” at the town’s schools how to deal with masks. Some Stockport schools have children from Manchester and Tameside. “It’s very difficult to issue guidance for every individual scenario,” he said. Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, whose constituency straddles Stockport and Tameside, said: “I have a concern that half of my constituency is in one borough, half is in the other. There is a seamless continuation of urbanisation between the two.” One street, Thornley Lane North, is in three boroughs, said Gwynne, and it was “bonkers” that people living in the Stockport section would have more freedom than other residents, he said.

"The educationist Sir Ken Robinson, proponent of the encouragement of creativity among children, who has died aged 70 of cancer, was largely ignored by politicians of both main parties as he insisted that the policy of successive UK governments, that literacy and numeracy should predominate, was a false priority. As he told interviewers: “That’s like saying let’s make the cake and if it’s all right we’ll put the eggs in.” Reputedly one lesson can change the course of a pupil’s career – Robinson became an exemplar of the much rarer idea that one speech can change a teacher’s whole trajectory. It was an off-the-cuff, 19-minute address without notes entitled Do Schools Kill Creativity? at a TED (technology, entertainment and design) educational conference in California in 2006 that propelled him to something approaching worldwide celebrity within and beyond education. His wry and witty extempore style, honed in Liverpool, was characteristically engaging. Subsequently posted on YouTube, the talk has reputedly been viewed by 380 million people in 160 countries and has influenced schools around the world. In that speech, and at other less noticed conferences and less well attended seminars over many years, Robinson argued that children do not grow into artistic creativity but are educated out of it by school systems that prioritise academic achievement and conformity instead of liberating imagination and initiative. He told the audience in 2006: “I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new concept of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way we strip-mined the earth for a particular commodity. We have to rethink the fundamental principles in which we are educating our children.” Understandably, this was much more enticing to the education profession than it was to government ministers, but it was based not on a single speech but Robinson’s whole career in academic education, which culminated in a professorship at Warwick University (1989-2001), before he became a senior adviser to the J Paul Getty Trust in Los Angeles. If the argument was that individual creativity was stifled by the system, it was less easy to discern how that might be recreated within a state education with its emphasis on attainment targets and examination results. The Blair government at least invited him to chair an inquiry in 1997, which produced a report, All Our Futures, but then largely ignored it; while Michael Gove as education secretary and his special adviser Dominic Cummings chose snide derision to dismiss the establishment “blob” of which they felt he was clearly a part. Robinson himself said in an interview with the Independent in 2018: “If I didn’t piss somebody off I’d probably be doing something wrong, but I don’t set out to do it.” He told Kirsty Young on Desert Island Discs in 2013 that schools should have discretion to develop creativity: “Don’t treat children as the same or over-programme them, they find their talents by trying things out.”  But Robinson admitted on the programme that he had benefited from an academic education system and insisted he was not opposed to a national curriculum, but just wanted one with different priorities and parity of esteem between core subjects and artistic ones such as dance. The fifth of seven children of Ethel (nee Allen) and James Robinson, he was born in an impoverished household in Liverpool, close to Everton’s Goodison Park football ground. His father worked at various jobs, including running a pub and as a docker, and was left paraplegic after his back was broken in a dockside accident when Ken was nine. He himself spent eight months in hospital after being diagnosed with polio at the age of four, thereafter walking with a limp, ending any chance of playing for the local club, though his brother Neil did so. Instead, Robinson’s parents encouraged him academically. He was initially educated at a special school for children with disabilities but passed the 11-plus and attended Liverpool Collegiate school, proceeding to study for a Bachelor of Education degree at Bretton Hall College, west Yorkshire, founded by the educationist Alec Clegg, which specialised in the arts. It had a formative effect on his career and he went on to complete a doctorate in drama and theatre in education at London University. His subsequent career focused on the arts in education, working on a schools’ council project which became his first book, Learning Through Drama (1977), and running courses for teachers. In the early 1980s he was lead researcher and author of the Arts in Schools project for the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and after that became the director of the Arts in Schools project, which in turn helped to shape the national curriculum after the 1988 Baker Act. He founded and chaired Artswork, the national youth arts development agency and founded and co-edited Arts Express magazine, before joining the staff at Warwick. The invitation to join the Getty Trust in California came in early January 2001: “It was cold and wet – what would you do? We went as fast as we could.” Robinson was the author of several more books, including Out of Our Minds: Learning to Be Creative (2001), Finding Your Element (2014) and Creative Schools (2015). He was knighted in 2003. Robinson’s success at the TED conference, where he spoke three times over a number of years, propelled him into a different financial and celebrity league. His friend and agent Brendan Barns said: “What really set Ken apart from other speakers and educationists was his ability instantly to create rapport with his audiences. He made everyone feel he was talking to them personally.” Robinson met Marie-Therese Watts, known as Terry, while giving a course in Liverpool in 1977. They married in 1982 and had two children, James and Kate. The couple returned to live in London last year to be near Kate and her baby daughter, Adeline. Terry and their children survive him.",education
"Covid-19 infections and outbreaks were “uncommon” in English schools after they reopened in June, according to a Public Health England report. A study released by the health agency on Sunday found there were 67 individual cases, four “co-primary” cases and 30 outbreaks of Covid-19 in schools during June. Co-primary cases were defined as two or more confirmed cases with a common epidemiological link diagnosed at the same time, while outbreaks were defined as two or more epidemiologically linked cases where subsequent cases were diagnosed within 14 days. The 67 single cases were made up of 30 students and 37 staff. A total of 121 cases were linked to the outbreaks – 30 in children and 91 in staff. More than a million children attended school in the month. No children were admitted to hospital. One teacher was admitted to intensive care for respiratory support. Over the same period, 25,470 cases were recorded in England overall, PHE said. Its report said: “Staff members need to be more vigilant for exposure outside the school setting to protect themselves, their families and the educational settings.” It said there was a strong correlation between the regional incidence of Covid-19 and the number of outbreaks in educational settings, which “emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission”. The potential for spread means school closures may be necessary as part of lockdown in regions with increasing community transmission, but these “should probably be considered only in extremis”, it added. The analysis, conducted by researchers from St George’s University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found children were more likely to acquire the virus at home rather than at school. “What we found essentially was that there was a very low risk [of transmission] among children and staff at the time,” Dr Shamez Ladhani, one of the report’s authors, told Sky News. “But you have to understand that these were circumstances where we had just come out of the lockdown and there were very small school numbers that were open at the time with very small classes.” He said most children who got Covid got it at home, often from parents who were key workers, and “most of the infection and transmission in schools is driven by staff”. The UK’s chief medical officers have said children are more at risk of long-term harm if they do not attend school than if they return to the classroom despite coronavirus. In a joint statement, the advisers said children had an “exceptionally low risk of dying” from Covid-19.",education
"Unions have reacted angrily to claims that coronavirus is more likely to be spread by teachers than pupils, warning that everyone has a responsibility to try to avoid bringing Covid-19 into school and transmitting it to others. It follows a report by Public Health England (PHE) which found that though Covid-19 outbreaks were “uncommon” in English schools after they reopened in June, the virus was more likely to be spread by staff than pupils. While children rarely suffer seriously from the effects of Covid, there has been considerable focus on how much they spread the virus. The majority of cases identified in the report, however, were linked to outbreaks among staff, who were warned to be “more vigilant” regarding exposure outside school. Responding to the report, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “Everyone in school, whether staff member or pupil, has a responsibility and important role to play in ensuring they follow the mitigation measures and do all they can to avoid bringing Covid into the school or to transmitting it to others.” He went on: “It is essential that appropriate measures are in place to minimise the risk of Covid-19 being transmitted between children, young people and between adults in schools. Effective social distancing measures, cleaning, infection control measures and good hygiene practices are essential in reducing the risks. “As with any workplace, school employers must also focus their attention on the controls needed to minimise the virus being spread amongst staff.” Roach also said that some staff were still waiting to be told about safety arrangements for their return to school next week. “Whilst staff should be fully consulted and informed about the risk control measures that should be in place, there are many schools that have not yet confirmed what arrangements will be in place for next week.” The news came as teachers in Northern Ireland registered their discomfort at the prospect of returning to school, with three-quarters of those who responded to a union survey saying that they did not believe it was safe to do so. With schools in Northern Ireland beginning to return on Monday, 77% of NASUWT respondents said that they did not feel their school was ready. A further 61% said they had not been consulted by their school or college. During the pandemic health workers have been hailed as heroes but teachers have attracted criticism from some parts of the media. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, paid tribute to teachers’ professionalism. “We are asking teachers to do something really unique which is to go in to schools where social distancing is very difficult and to spend hours a day with hundreds of children. “The fact that the vast majority of teachers want to go back shows their dedication and professionalism. It’s very easy for government or PHE to undermine the profession either directly or by insinuation, but this is the worst time to do it.” The NEU said schools and colleges were doing all they could to ensure buildings were as Covid secure as possible, but the union was concerned there was still no plan B in the even of further outbreaks and the test and trace system was not sufficiently reliable.",education
"For Christian Jones, who has just finished a master’s in broadcast journalism at City University of London, the rapid shift to online learning due to Covid-19 came as a bit of a shock. “I spent the first week not setting alarms,” he says. “It’s easy to end up going to bed late and waking up really late. Then you don’t get anything done.” Students in the UK have been prevented from entering lecture theatres since late March, and so have had to quickly adjust to studying online. According to the latest government guidance, students in England could be confined to their halls of residence in the new term, so it’s expected that blended learning – a mix of online and face-to-face teaching – will continue.  “Universities will do as much as possible on campus, however the reality is that most large-scale group teaching and learning activities are going to happen online,” Neil Morris, dean of digital education at the University of Leeds, says. “Students need to be prepared for that.” But there’s no need to panic, according to Dr Damon Miller from the Open University. “Generally people are nervous at the beginning, but don’t worry – you won’t be left to it on your own.” Before you get going, you’ll want to consider the equipment you’ll need. It’ll help to have a laptop with a decent screen or stand. Check whether you can get a student discount, and whether your university offers a laptop loan service. Next, set out a study space so you can work without distractions. “Make sure your work area is not your recreation area,” says Matt Huxley, a lecturer at Staffordshire University London. “It might just be going to sit in the kitchen or on the sofa, but it’s about the psychological impact [of having a separate space].” This also helps limit distractions “so you’re not watching TV as well as studying”, adds Huxley. If your university puts on digital skills workshops, Morris recommends that you attend them. “I would strongly advise students to engage really thoughtfully with the IT induction that’s being offered and with the digital skills training,” he says. Once you’ve got the basics down, ensure you have the right online etiquette. “That’s being aware of your surroundings and how you present yourself virtually,” Huxley explains. Make sure your microphone is muted and that you’re not sitting with the window behind you so other people can’t see you. “You should also wear clothes,” Huxley says. “You’d be surprised, I’ve seen people in bed without their T-shirts on before.” The usual study techniques still apply. It’s good to consider what type of learner you are – perhaps you’re a visual learner and should make use of any extra reading materials given out. Or maybe you’re an inquisitive learner and like to ask questions, in which case you can use tutorial time for further discussion. It’s also good to keep a pen and paper with you and note down any questions that come up, Huxley says. Students like Jones say one of the main things they’ve learned is the importance of keeping to a structure. “If you have a scheduled lecture on Zoom, it’s good to do it in that slot,” says Maisie Marston, who has just graduated from a politics degree at Cardiff University. “Then you keep to a structure and can ask questions, which makes it feel more like you’re at uni.” Studying can be tiring, whether it’s online or in person, so don’t try and fit too much in. “The main thing is to plan your time and take breaks,” Miller says. Marston agrees. “It’s worthwhile to grab a coffee or sit outside, to have a change of scenery,” she says. Online learning doesn’t have to be anti-social. For example, you could study alongside people you live with. Marston says studying with her girlfriend helped to keep her motivated. “It’s nice to study with someone else, so you can stay focused and make lots of tea for each other,” she says. You can also meet new people and connect online, Miller says. “Social media is a good way of keeping in touch. Even if you’re sitting alone on your laptop, you are not alone, there’s a massive support network there,” he says. If you’re struggling, ask for help and your university should support you. “Things go wrong, computers crash, people get ill. What [students] shouldn’t do is shy away and hide and not contact the university. That’s the worst thing they can do,” says Miller. “We’ve got a dedicated student support team, so ask for help.”",education
"A-level students who were downgraded by the controversial government algorithm are relieved after universities confirmed their places for this year. “I could not believe what I had read,” said Leah Glenday, of the message she received on Friday confirming her place at Girton College, Cambridge, after the anxiety of a week believing her dreams had been dashed. The first pupil from her school to be offered a place at Cambridge, and said to be the first looked-after child from the London borough of Haringey to receive an Oxbridge offer, Glenday said she was still in a dreamlike state and had not processed the fact she would form part of Girton’s class of 2020. “I ran over to my foster mum and started crying,” she said, remembering the moment she received the email confirming her place. “I couldn’t stop crying or talk, so I just showed her the phone. I had accepted the fact I wasn’t going there. That’s why I just cried because I had nothing else to say.” Glenday said she would not believe what had happened until she was at Cambridge on her first day. She hoped her story could serve as inspiration to other fostered children. “Children who have gone through a challenging upbringing can see themselves as unlucky, but they need to realise it can serve to their advantage,” she said. “It initiates your driving passion to pursue a certain cause and sticks us out from the crowd.” Glenday has plans to become a family law barrister, after her foster parents had to go to court to ensure her younger siblings could join Glenday and her sister in their home. She said: “During my GCSEs, when I found out I had a little brother and sister who were going to be adopted and I couldn’t ever see them, I was traumatised. “My foster parents went to court to bring them into my placement. If it wasn’t for the barrister saying I should write letters for her to read out in court, my family might not have been able to come together. So I just want to give back and help keep other families together.” Despite Gavin Williamson’s U-turn on Monday, thousands of children’s futures remain in the balance as universities – who had already allocated places on the basis of the grades calculated with the algorithm – assess whether they have extra space. Despite the joy of Glenday and others, some have been forced to defer for a year, while the status of some remains unknown. For Nina Bunting-Mitcham, who attended a state college in Peterborough, and received DDD under the now-ditched system despite scoring As and Bs in her mock exams, the past week was traumatising but ended in huge relief after the Royal Veterinary College accepted her to study veterinary medicine after the government’s volte-face. “I tried not to lose hope but it was hard,” she said. “Veterinary medicine was the only thing I wanted to do in life. I love animals more than people, to be honest.” Bunting-Mitcham, 18, told the schools minister, Nick Gibb, on live radio last Friday that he had ruined her life and, despite the change in policy – which came after he had spoken to teachers at her school about the algorithmic disparity – she remains bruised by the affair. “No government should put people through that trauma, it’s affected thousands of students’ confidence and self-belief,” she said. “I don’t think anybody in this age range will be voting for them after this. They’ve shown their incompetence once and for all.” It remains unclear whether she must undertake a foundation year before her five-year course.",education
"My father, Chris Rice, who has died aged 80 of amyloidosis, was an inspiring lecturer in human resource management at Nottingham Trent University for almost 30 years. Born in Bristol, Chris was the only child of Norman Rice, a clerk, and his wife, Doris (nee Maunder), who later worked in the box office at Bristol Hippodrome. After passing the 11-plus, Chris went to Bristol grammar school, then Southampton University, where he studied engineering and enjoyed playing rugby and jazz. There, he met Maureen Bishop, who later became a social worker, and they married in 1963. After finishing his course, Chris changed direction to train in human resources at Glasgow School of Management Studies (1962-63). He then worked as a personnel manager at Salters, West Bromwich, and at the Oxford University Press paper mill. Deciding to apply for a lecturing post at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University) in 1970, without formal teaching qualifications, was a brave move, but it paid off. In teaching, Chris found his vocation. He was a committed, approachable and engaging lecturer, whose smile lit up the room. He enjoyed taking the floor and making students laugh with his genuinely funny stories. He often taught mature, part-time students on release from their day jobs looking to gain the professional qualifications needed to move ahead with their careers. As a teenager, I distinctly remember ex-students recognising Chris when we were out as a family in Nottingham. They would rush up with joy and excitement, shake his hand and embrace him. It was clear what a difference he made to people’s lives. He gained an MPhil from the University of Nottingham in 1980 and wrote a valuable textbook, Consumer Behaviour – Behavioural Aspects of Marketing (1993, republished in 1997 as Understanding Customers) – but students were always at the heart of his work. A great enthusiast, Chris had many passions – he loved music, especially jazz and classical, and was an amazing cook who spent hours in the kitchen. He walked the Pennine Way with my sister, Emma, and I as teenagers, ran the London marathon and enjoyed watching sport. He had fun travelling with Maureen and loved Italy best of all. He was warm, funny and sociable. In 1999, Chris retired from his senior lecturer post and after a few years my parents moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Living near to us gave them more time with their beloved granddaughters. Chris followed my sister, Emma’s career from actor to theatre director with great pride. Chris is survived by Maureen, Emma and me, and by three granddaughters.",education
"My husband, James Dunn, who has died aged 80, was emeritus Lightfoot professor of divinity at Durham University. Internationally known as a New Testament scholar and writer, Jimmy was an active church member and above all a family man. He could teach, supervise and write with authority on almost every aspect of the New Testament, and this range and versatility made him one of the best known and most influential British New Testament scholars of his generation. He was a prolific writer – 50 books in 50 years, many of which remain key texts for theological studies around the world. The youngest of four sons, Jimmy was born in Birmingham to Scottish parents, David Dunn, a salesman for an engineering company, and his wife, Nancy (nee Orr). The death of his father left his mother to return to Scotland alone when Jimmy was 10 months old and raise four boys alone, during the second world war; a struggle with sacrifice and many hardships. He was educated at Hutchesons boys’ grammar school in Glasgow where, through the Scripture Union, Jimmy came to the faith that marked his life. After seven years’ study at Glasgow University, he left with degrees in economics (MA Hons) and divinity (BD), and a wife; he and I had known each other since schooldays, and we married in 1963. Then he undertook PhD studies at Cambridge University in 1965. There his eyes were opened to so many larger worlds, confirmed by two years as chaplain to overseas students in Edinburgh, before he rejoined academia at Nottingham and, in 1982, as professor of divinity, at Durham, where he remained until his retirement in 2003. His writing in New Testament and Pauline studies enhanced his reputation, culminating in three large volumes (2003-15), entitled Christianity in the Making. His work was recognised by his presidency of Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas and with a fellowship of the British Academy. It was always his desire and intention to encourage and educate all members of the Christian church to learn more of their faith. This he did by the clarity and simplicity with which he could impart the findings of his rigorous research. His enthusiasm for his subject, the depth of his faith, the warmth of his personality and the “call me Jimmy” greetingwon the hearts of many. But it was his family that was the bedrock from which all else flowed. Almost every book he wrote acknowledged the immense debt he felt that he owed to me, to our three children, Catrina, David and Fiona, and seven grandchildren. However, that “debt” was amply repaid by the concern for and interest in all our lives, by the fun and games he so enjoyed, in the pride he took in our various achievements and his love demonstrated in so many ways.",education
"Name: Hamlet. Age: 30. Appearance: Ready to take arms. Against what? A sea of troubles. And by opposing end them? That’s the idea. But what trouble, exactly? Orthographic irregularities. Sorry? Spelling trouble. I must say, I don’t remember this part at all. To end once and for all the maddening inconsistencies that make it so hard for our children to write English. I remember the ghost at the beginning and the bit where he holds up a skull. That’s the play. The play’s the thing. This is the campaign run by the English Spelling Society (ESS) to overhaul the written language. They have enlisted Hamlet’s help. They know he’s not real, right? More specifically, they have enlisted the opening lines of Hamlet’s most famous soliloquy to offer a comparison of six competing revised spelling schemes. To be or not to be, that is the question? Yes, or “Too be or not too be, that is the qestshen” in something called Rich-Spel-long. There are plenty of people who spell like that already. There’s the rub: poor spelling can mark someone out as ignorant or ill-informed. I know – it’s very handy and saves time. In the coming months, the ESS will hold an online session of the International English Spelling Congress to vote for the best scheme of the six. How long has this campaign been going on? Since 1908. They haven’t got very far, have they? Not yet. George Bernard Shaw was a supporter, and he used revised spellings in printed versions of his plays, but that’s about the extent of it. Anyway, I’m sure there’s a reason English is spelled the way it is. There are lots of reasons: the mix of French and Anglo-Saxon words; early, non-English printers making it up as they went along. The result is an illogical system, threw and through. Illogical, yes, but is there any harm in it? The ESS reckons it takes English-speaking children twice as long to learn to read and write as those who speak other languages. Oh well, as long as they get there in the end, as Hamlet said. He never said that. Do say: “Too sleep, perchans too dreem, ie, thairz the rub.” Don’t say: “Actually, in this instance it may be nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”",education
"As schools in England and Wales get set to reopen amid continued controversy over safe conditions, attention has focused on potential evidence of coronavirus transmission in the classroom and on the experiences of other countries. Research on the ability of children of different ages to catch and transmit the virus is contradictory, and differences in education systems and social conventions make comparisons difficult. One complicating factor is what epidemiologists call contact matrices: the degree to which different age groups mix, particularly within extended multigenerational families, which can vary from society to society and from group to group within a society. Countries have taken different approaches but some of the questions are broadly familiar. Should all children and staff be required to wear masks, or only some age groups? Should children be tested for the virus? How should social distancing be managed in the classroom and playground? And finally, should schools be reopening at all? With a recent sharp resurgence in virus cases, France has issued some of the most detailed guidelines for when schools reopen. Children in secondary schools will have to wear face coverings at all times when in school and in the playground, the education minister said on Thursday, as France reported a record number of daily coronavirus cases since the easing of restrictions. This is a change from recommendations in July that face coverings for older children would only be necessary where 1-metre social distancing could not be managed, and is a response to concerns from teaching unions about rising infections as the summer has gone on. While there were class size restrictions when French schools first reopened, in the new term there will be no size limits and the 1-metre social rule is advised but is not mandatory. Poland plans to reopen schools next week for the first time since mid-March despite reaching a record high number of daily registered coronavirus infections late last week.  It has said it will not mandate mask wearing for children in the classroom. However, it has said individual principals can decide to impose face coverings in school halls and locker rooms. Unlike in some other countries, no temperature checks at the school gates will be introduced. With one of the world’s highest per capita death rates from Covid-19 during the pandemic, Belgium has looked closely at the issue of masks in the classroom. When schools reopen on 1 September all children aged 12 and above and teachers will be required to wear masks, following an announcement by the prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, last week. “The goal is to avoid a second wave,” she told a news conference. “We see today that the situation is stabilising and improving. It is very important that children go to school.” Germany has drawn attention in recent days because of the experience of Berlin where, after reopening in the last fortnight, several dozen schools have had to close because of infections. Officials say most infections in Berlin involve only one teacher or student, and suggest that the transmission occurred outside the school. Berlin has responded by closing schools for very brief periods to allow contact tracing. “So far, these are isolated cases and not outbreaks,” Valerie Kirchberger, a paediatrician and coordinator of Berlin’s testing strategy, led by Charité hospital, told local media. Unlike in countries where education is organised on a national level, German schools are run regionally. While some German states have made face coverings mandatory at all times in schools, in others they are compulsory only in hallways and playgrounds. More generally, schools across the country have tried to manage the risk of infection by keeping classes separate. Regarded as one of the world’s most intensive education systems, South Korea struggled with reopening, delaying restarting schools multiple times and then phasing in different age groups. While a resurgence of infections in the country forced schools to close again, they have resorted to numerous tactics to keep operating, including attendance on alternate days and temperature checks. One of the first western countries to reopen its schools, in April, Denmark separated younger children into “micro-groups” of 12 known as “protective bubbles”. With school starting times staggered and desks 2 metres apart, masks were not deemed necessary. However, Denmark had relatively low infection numbers in the wider population, the result of quick and effective early suppression of the kind advocated by the British public health expert Devi Sridhar, who has emphasised that suppressing community transmission is ultimately what will make schools safe. As of 18 May, children aged 12-16 had returned to secondary schools following similar rules. Israel has emerged as one of the major cautionary tales. Having managed its initial outbreak relatively successfully, it reopened its schools in May, initially sending a limited number of classes children back in small “capsules” to minimise the risk of transmission. In a surprise move, however, the government then announced that all grades could return and lifted restrictions on class sizes. The reopening contributed to a resurgence of the virus, with tens of thousands of pupils later sent into quarantine as their classmates tested positive. Underlining the differing considerations in different parts of the world, Kenya’s schools will not reopen until at least January. As David Lagakos and Emilie Yam wrote in a piece for the World Economic Forum’s website, “low-income countries face a very different set of circumstances from high-income countries – for example, a higher proportion of households that include both children and elderly people … and the urgency of maintaining the livelihoods of working-age adults to prevent hunger and poverty.” With a school year running from January to November, officials have relied on the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to run school programmes via the radio, TV and internet since students stopped going to classes in March.",education
"Teaching unions have expressed their frustration at the introduction of last-minute guidance on the reopening of secondary schools in England, which says schools in local lockdown areas should introduce a rota system to limit attendance and compulsory face masks in communal areas. The guidance, issued on Friday ahead of English schools reopening for the start of the new academic year next week, is intended to limit the amount of contact between staff and students in schools, and provide enough time at home for symptoms to become apparent. Initially, the new guidance had said that if a single case of coronavirus was confirmed, every pupil in the affected person’s year group or “bubble” might have to quarantine for two weeks. However, this passage was removed by the Department for Education shortly after publication on Friday night. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the changes to school attendance were an “absolute last resort”, and only for a “worst-case scenario”. “We hope that we won’t have to implement the guidance set out today,” he said. However, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the timing of the introduction of the new guidance was “unfair” to headteachers and school leaders. “School leaders have been asking all summer for information about what they should do in the event of local restrictions in their area,” she told Sky News. “And [it’s] really unfair, I think, to heads, that [the guidelines] are sent out late on a Friday night, at the start of a bank holiday, days before the first day of the new school term. “Heads are going to feel under a lot of pressure now, over this weekend, to start looking at these, thinking about how they will implement them in their schools, whether they will have to make any changes to arrangements they’ve already put in place.” Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, where some boroughs are still under local lockdown restrictions, said the guidance was “fairly clear, but it was very late”. “It came out at 7.30pm on the Friday before a bank holiday,” he told BBC Breakfast. “Why is the government doing this again, putting out guidance so late so that headteachers don’t have time to prepare?” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that school leaders felt a “weary, resigned sense of inevitability” at the timing of the new guidelines. Asked how teachers would feel about the situation, he said: “Here we are again, right at the last minute with something that we have been accused of expressing treachery in asking for – where’s the plan B in case of local lockdown – at last it has arrived.” Echoing this, Paul Whiteman, the leader of the NAHT union, said headteachers had been asking for a contingency plan for what would happen in the case of an outbreak for weeks. He described the timing of the guidance as “reprehensible”. “It was obvious weeks ago that lockdown advice was necessary,” he said. “The government’s decision to publish this at 9pm on the Friday of the bank holiday weekend before most schools are due to return is nothing short of reprehensible and demonstrates a complete lack of regard for the wellbeing of school leaders and their teams. “Keeping schools open has to be the priority, but you don’t need a crystal ball to see that there will almost inevitably be some disruption in some areas in the coming weeks,” he added, saying that “another late-night publication is fairly typical of what we’ve become used to”. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the advice should have been available “months ago”. She said: “It is simply unacceptable that this guidance was altered immediately on what is a key issue for schools – what to do when pupils are found to have Covid. As it stands currently there is still no clarity on what should happen in a school where there is an outbreak. This does not build confidence in government’s competence to keep schools safe when it scores such an own goal.”  Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, the Teachers’ Union, was the latest union official to criticise the last minute announcement. “We have been saying for some time that schools need clarity on these important issues and that it is the responsibility of the government to provide that clarity,” he said. Roach also called on the government to provide extra funding for schools to employ surplus staff in the case that schools were affected by local lockdown measures, saying there needed to be greater recognition of the impact of local restrictions on teachers and staff. “The availability of staff where there is a local lockdown or outbreak may mean that schools have to limit provision if they cannot be staffed safely,” he said. “The government now needs to confirm that schools will have the additional resources they need to deliver an effective remote learning offer to all pupils as well as funding for additional staff that will be necessary to maintain continuity of provision in the event of local disruption.” Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee, acknowledged that the late-hour release of the guidance was “incredibly difficult” for teachers. While Halfon said he did not know why the government decided to release the information so close to the reopening of schools, he said it was “better that it’s there”. Asked about the removal of a paragraph shortly after the guidance was released, Halfon said: “Clearly these things shouldn’t happen and mistakes obviously have been made, and been rectified, but the important thing is that the guidance is right.”",education
"Next year’s GCSE and A-level exams should be sat later in the summer to give pupils valuable time to catch up, according to a proposal by Labour that is likely to be backed by influential Tory MPs and school leaders. Before the new academic year begins for most schools this week, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said the two sets of exams should be pushed back by at least a month and begin in June rather than May. “Pupils across the country who have missed out on vital teaching time will have a mountain to climb to prepare for May exams unless the government steps in,” Green said. “Ministers had warning after warning about problems with this year’s exam results, but allowed it to descend into a fiasco. This is too important for Boris Johnson to leave until the last minute. Pupils heading back to school need clarity and certainty about the year ahead.” Labour’s intervention highlights another sore spot between the Department for Education and Ofqual, the exam regulator for England. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has supported the idea of delaying 2021’s A-levels and GCSEs, telling parliament in July that he was consulting with Ofqual “about how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn and really flourish”. But in a consultation document issued several weeks later Ofqual made no commitment to delaying exams, merely saying it would “work with the DfE, exam boards, regulators in Wales and Northern Ireland, and groups representing schools, colleges and higher education to consider the best approach, and we will confirm our decisions as soon as possible”. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education committee, has also come out in favour of delaying exams. Halfon said Ofqual needs to make up its mind by October whether exams will go ahead or even be replaced again by assessments, to avoid a repeat of this year’s turmoil. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said Labour’s proposal was worthy of consideration. “A delay is not without its problems. A consequential delay to the publication of results will put pressure on higher education providers such as universities and colleges as well as employers. All this will need to be dealt with. “It is not just about timing. It is obvious that learning could be severely disrupted throughout the year and no one can say with certainty that we will be able to run exams in the normal way in 2021,” said Whiteman. A DfE spokesperson said: “We recognise that students due to take exams next summer will have experienced disruption to their education, which is why we prioritised bringing year 10 and year 12 pupils back to school last term. “Exams will go ahead next year, and we have been working closely with the sector, Ofqual and exam boards to consider our approach.” The call for delay came as schools hurry to prepare their buildings and timetables for the new year, as well as organising extra tutoring to help pupils catch up. Schools also have only a few days to decide if pupils are to be entered for the special exam series for October and November that has been organised for those unhappy with their assessments this summer. Some pupils taking BTec vocational qualifications reported that they had still not received their grades despite a promise by Pearson, the exam board, that they would all be delivered by the end of last week. Many teachers have been sceptical of efforts to restrict the spread of Covid-19 within their schools. Some 86% who responded to a poll hosted by the TES in July said they thought minimising contact between pupils would not be achievable when schools reopen.",education
"My mother, Wendy Sturgess, who has died aged 87, initially qualified and worked as a librarian but taught English as a foreign language for most of her career. Latterly, she was active in the University of the Third Age (U3A), teaching Italian to students and running a local poetry group in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. She was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire, to Winifred (nee Clarke) and Ormond Harris, and grew up there with her sister, Joan. Her father had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the first world war; this made it difficult for him to find employment on his release and he worked as a ledger clerk in a travel agency and then as a bookseller. Wendy’s early life was affected by the loss of her mother, a civil servant, who died two weeks after giving birth to her without ever leaving hospital; she and her sister were brought up by female relatives. She attended St Albans high school for girls and then worked in public libraries for a decade after studying librarianship at Brighton Technical College. In 1960 she travelled to Italy, where she met Silvio Ruis. They married in 1961, in Barnet, north London, before returning to live in Udine, north-east Italy, where Wendy taught English at various schools in the locality, before starting her own language school there. Having separated from Silvio, Wendy returned to the UK in 1970 with me and my brother, Peter, and settled in Barnet, where she continued to teach both privately and in colleges, and was a school librarian for a period at the Queens’ school in Bushey. Following my parents’ divorce, my mother married Peter Sturgess, a maths teacher, in 1978, but they separated in 1984 (and he died in 1989). Active in her local community, Wendy founded a thriving social group, “Barnet 30+”, before moving to Kingston, south-west London, in 1980. In 1984, she started her own successful teacher supply agency, providing tutors in all subjects, and worked full-time in the business. She retired from full-time work in 1993 and moved to Somerset, where she was active in her local Humanist group, took up various art projects and began collecting automaton toys, amassing a collection of kinetic art. She also spent more time on creative projects and produced her own decoupage pictures, some which she sold at local art fairs. Wendy left Somerset in 2007 and settled in Knaphill, where she became a stalwart of her local U3A group, holding regular Italian conversation classes and poetry readings at her home, whilst expanding her collection of automatons, to the delight of her grandchildren. In her later years, with reduced mobility, she found it harder to get around but managed to continue to teach regardless and was planning lessons as well as hosting sessions on Zoom. Her long letters (she wrote many) will not be forgotten by friends, while her students remember an innovative, charming and exceptional teacher. Wendy is survived by me and Peter, her grandchildren, Oliver, Zoe, Sam, Luca and Darcey, and her sister Joan.",education
"Starting university is, for most people, equal parts exciting and daunting. There are flatmates to meet, coursemates to bond with, new interests to explore and chaotic nights out to be had. But for students starting university next week, they have another emotion to add to the mix: uncertainty. Hannah Tytko is starting a nutrition and dietetics course at the University of Surrey next week, and is unsure what to expect. “I’m going to be living in a flat with essentially six strangers so they’ll be seven of us in total. Luckily there are Facebook group chats so you can start to get a grasp of who you’re going to be living with. But I suppose under the new guidelines you’re stuck with these people,” she says. Just days before the new term starts at most universities, the government has ushered in new rules aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19. Among these is the “rule of six”, preventing groups of over six from socialising together. While educational institutions are exempt, the rules still apply to “private gatherings” among students. Tytko speculates that the rule could mean her flat of seven will be unable to socialise together. Published on the same day, last minute guidance from the Department for Education warns that university campuses may be subject to local lockdowns that could see students confined to their halls of residence in the event of coronavirus outbreaks, along with restrictions on face-to-face teaching and socialising – though they encourage “Covid-secure” mingling. The contradictory messages from government have left students feeling that there is a gulf between what they were promised in the summer and the reality this autumn, warns Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students. “Students are incredibly worried that the government hasn’t considered their needs during this pandemic,” she says. “[The guidance] has come incredibly late, particularly since lots of students have already started moving. We’ve been asking for months for clear guidance on how students form new households safely. I feel as though students have been lied to for months about what’s possible and what’s safe.” Many students are worried about the toll the restrictions could take on their mental health. “Halls for the most part are quite small, so they’re perfect to cater for a ‘drop in, drop out’ lifestyle,” says Tytko. “If you start to limit this, there’s potential for issues to arise.” Moni Serneabat Ungar, who is entering her third year of a film and TV studies degree at the University of Glasgow, agrees. “If this had happened [in my first year], it could have been quite dangerous because I was really unhappy in my flat, and staying with my grandparents for a weekend was very important to me,” she says.  Jasmin Ly, a third-year chemistry student at Nottingham University, is concerned that Covid-19 could still easily spread on campus, even with the new measures. “If each person attends tutorials in groups of six, or someone plays a sport or leads a society in person, then the network of people involved is huge,” she says. Meanwhile, universities are cancelling or shifting online their induction activities in response to the new guidance. While universities with large, leafy campuses such as Surrey are able to host some events outdoors, others are finding ways to socially distance events, for instance through silent discos and cinema trips. Others, such as the University of Sunderland, are trying to recreate the experience online, including through immersive digital campus replicas – some of which resemble life simulation video games such as The Sims. Freshers was typically an opportunity for new starters to sign up to university societies, but some will struggle because of the new rules. Lauren Shireff, who edits the Oxford Student, says the newspaper will not be printed because opening the building is considered a “low priority” for the university. And Mary Jones, secretary of the squash and racketball club for Leeds University, wonders how she will recruit new paying members without taster sessions this year. The new guidance will also affect how classes are delivered. While students were originally promised “blended” learning – combining online lectures with in-person seminars – some universities moving more in favour of online. An initial survey of 500 students by the Hype Collective marketing agency following the announcement suggested that 60% of students now think their degree will offer worse value than they had expected. This is a concern for Gurpal Sahota, who is about to start a politics course at Cardiff University. “I knew that social distancing and online learning was always going to be a part of university when I arrived in September. However, the recent increase in cases has made me question what I’m going to get for my money if we have to move to full online learning or, if like in the US we get sent home due to rises in cases,” he says. “My university has given us very little information as to any socialising and the restrictions that will be in place.” Universities are conscious of the need to honour their promises to students over the summer. The vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, Philip Plowden, says he will achieve this by halving campus capacity to ensure face-to-face teaching can be socially distanced. “We gave them a pledge that the majority of their teaching this year would be delivered on campus and face-to-face, and the latest guidance from the government does not change this commitment,” he says. But at Surrey, Tytko says she’s seen a change in plans for how courses will be delivered. “Especially over the last few days there’s been a trend to move a lot more activities online, and that might be a worry,” she says. Martin Paul Eve, a professor at Birkbeck University who is leading on its shift to online learning, thinks that universities should have followed his institution’s example and planned for high quality online learning to ensure a consistent message for their students and protect the health of staff. “Most staff had a really uncertain summer, where there’s been pressure from institutional management to offer face to face teaching even while the medical advice has predicted a catastrophic wave of reinfection in the autumn,” he says. Despite the confusion, some students are relieved that their safety is now the priority. “The new government guidance makes me feel safer about going back to university,” says Stephi Bourliakas, who will study physics with astrophysics at Exeter University. “Living with family who are vulnerable and shielding during the holidays, I’m most worried about the spike in cases that will inevitably be caused by students from across the country returning to university. I hope this new rule will limit that.”",education
"Schools in England face an autumn of paralysis due to difficulties in obtaining coronavirus tests, headteachers have warned, with education “grinding to a halt” when staff and students are forced to stay home following a suspected case. Thousands of school leaders have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, warning of “partial rolling closures” of schools and disruption to pupils’ catch-up studies, because of serious staff shortages just days into the new term. Headteachers told the Guardian that staff were in some cases unable to find any test slots available for days or were offered tests at sites more than 100 miles away. When they do get a test, it can take days for results to come through. School leaders’ unions reported receiving calls from at least 400 members who had suspected cases in their schools, after just one week of full school reopenings in England. “Yesterday I had three staff off as someone in their household has symptoms. None of them have been able to get a test,” said one primary school headteacher in Southampton last week. “One did get a test booked in Portsmouth, arrived there to be turned away as they had no tests left. It is a nightmare. “In order to run my school I need to be able to get staff tested quickly and back to work as soon as possible if the test is negative. We will grind to a halt if the availability of tests does not improve rapidly.” The head of a rural primary school in Sussex said the shortage of tests “is the single issue which will derail the reopening and likely our budget too”. “A high proportion of my staff are also parents of school-aged children. As soon as one of them has any likely symptoms I’ll be losing staff,” he said, adding that five of his pupils were off with suspected Covid-19 symptoms and had been unable to obtain tests. “The increased supply costs will be a budgetary Armageddon and any plan to try to achieve stability and continuity for a very keen bunch of returning children will be next to impossible to achieve.” A teacher at a school near Torquay was offered a drive-in test in Cardiff, one in Southampton was offered a test 170 miles away in Telford, and another in Swansea was told to go to Aberdeen airport. Meanwhile two secondary schools in the north of England were each forced to send an entire year group home because of suspected Covid cases. The Worth Less? lobbying group, which represents thousands of headteachers across 75 local authorities in England, wrote to Williamson warning that the threat of partial rolling closures because of serious staff shortages is significant”. The letter went on: “Many pupils, who have lost far too much learning time already and are just months away from crucial A-level, GCSE and Sats exams are missing having specialist teachers in front of them.” Teaching unions urged the government to put more resources into giving school staff priority access to tests. The National Education Union called for mass testing for schools and colleges in areas with high levels of community transmission. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said it had received more than 200 calls from members seeking help dealing with suspected cases, with most of those involving lack of access to tests. The Association of School and College Leaders said it had seen similar numbers before the end of last week and reported “uncomfortable conversations” between schools and parents, frustrated by the testing system. Paul Whiteman, the NAHT’s general secretary, said: “The obvious failure of the Covid-19 testing infrastructure puts the sustainable reopening of schools at serious risk and also means that pupils could be missing out on education unnecessarily.” A government spokesperson said: “Testing capacity is the highest it has ever been, but we are seeing a significant demand for tests. It is vital that children and school staff only get a test if they develop coronavirus symptoms. “If a positive case is confirmed in a school, swift action is being taken to ask those who have been in close contact to self-isolate, and Public Health England’s local health protection teams continue to support and advise schools in this situation. “Children who are self-isolating will receive remote education. We will continue to work with schools to ensure all appropriate steps are taken to keep pupils and staff safe.” But Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government needed to do more. “Heads have told me they find it extremely frustrating that they have made their schools ‘Covid secure’ but then find out it has been undone by the lack of tests.”",education
"Thousands of students, parents and teachers are celebrating after the government made a spectacular U-turn on this year’s A-Level results, reverting to teacher-assessed grades. While the decision to abandon the exams regulator Ofqual’s controversial grades decided by algorithm, which led to 40% of predicted results being downgraded, has been greeted with widespread relief, it also poses major new challenges for students and universities. We want to hear from students who missed out on their first choice university due to the results they received last Thursday. Have you now been able to secure a place at your first choice university because your results have been upgraded due to the U-turn? Has your first offer university offered you a place but for next year because your course is full? Or do you plan to stick with your second choice or another offer made through clearing?  We also want to hear from students who have yet to secure a place. Have you yet to receive your teacher assessed grades, or are you contesting them? How will an enforced gap year pose difficulties for you? If you have got a place have you been offered accommodation by your university, or do you now face a scramble to arrange this yourself? We would also like to hear from you if your university offer has been affected because the teacher-assessed grades are lower than those you received from Ofqual last week.

"With the coronavirus crisis ballooning and schools across England closing, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announces there will be no exams this year and that exam boards will ask teachers to submit their assessments for the grade they believe a student would have received. Controls would ensure that “this year’s students do not face a systematic disadvantage as a consequence of these extraordinary circumstance”, he adds. Pupils taking GCSEs and A-levels will have their grades awarded by a combination of teacher assessment, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, the exam regulator for England announces. Ofqual begins to lay out details of the new system, though experts have already started to caution that relying on teacher assessments is likely to penalise students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Sounding the alarm about the potential for bias in predicted results, MPs on the House of Commons education select committee call on Ofqual to examine whether groups such as black, Asian and minority ethnic pupils or those with special needs “have been systematically disadvantaged” by the way the exam grades will be awarded, with “well-heeled and sharp-elbowed” families most likely to benefit. There is uproar in Scotland as its exams authority rejects nearly 124,000 grade recommendations from teachers – a quarter of the total. Unlike in Scotland, individual English pupils are barred from appealing against their results on academic grounds. Ofqual partially climbs down and allows schools to appeal on a limited number of technical grounds, for example if they switched from single-sex to co-educational or experienced a “monumental event” such as a flood or fire. The Guardian reveals that 39% of teachers’ A-level result recommendations are set to be downgraded in England, according to analysis of the algorithm and data used by Ofqual. Those most at risk appear to be students on the border between B and C or C and D grades, and those from comprehensive schools with significant variations in attainment over the three previous years. Following days of protests by pupils, teachers and opposition parties, the Scottish government reinstates all downgraded exam results and apologises to the 76,000 pupils affected. Later that evening, ministers in London make an 11th-hour bid to stave off a growing revolt over the emerging fiasco, granting pupils in England the right to use mock exam results if they are unhappy with their grades – though this is quickly condemned by critics as further disadvantaging state school pupils or those whose mocks were cancelled in the spring. Teenagers receive their A-level results. Those awarded A or A* increase to an all-time high in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with 27.9% securing the top grades this year – but pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are hit hardest by the standardisation process, with analysis showing they were most likely to have the grades proposed by their teachers overruled. Headteachers react with dismay and anger. As bitterly disappointed students take to the streets and calls are issued for Williamson to quit, researchers tell the Guardian that disadvantaged GSCE students could suffer even more than the A-level group when their results come out a week later, with 2 million teacher assessments downgraded. Hours after Ofqual publishes its criteria for mock exam results to be considered as the basis of an appeal, the body dramatically suspends its guidance. It says in a brief statement on its website that the policy iss “being reviewed” by its board and that further information will be released “in due course”. The government is blindsided. Anger turns to Boris Johnson, who is beginning a holiday in Scotland, while Lord Baker, a former Tory education secretary and the architect of GCSEs, calls for them to be delayed. All A-level and GCSE results in England will be based on teacher-assessed grades, the government confirms in a spectacular U-turn. Earlier in the day, devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland had announced that assessments would apply to students there. Announcing details of the move, Ofqual’s chairman, Roger Taylor, says that the body wanted to say sorry and that the decision has been taken to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible. The about-face comes after Penny Mordaunt becomes the first serving UK minister to publicly express concern about the debacle. Dozens of Tory MPs also voice discontent. ",education
"Up to 25,000 teachers in England may already have been forced out of the classroom and into self-isolation at home amid a national shortage of Covid tests just a fortnight after schools reopened, research suggests. With some schools reporting up to a fifth of their teaching staff off and unable to get a test, unions warned the crisis was spinning out of control and jeopardising plans for a full return to education, bringing the risk of “lockdown by default”. One academy trust leader said that 740 state schools in England were either partially or wholly closed with Covid-related issues, meaning tens of thousands of pupils are stuck at home, with their parents unable to go to work. Some private schools, meanwhile, are paying £120 to test symptomatic students and teachers after many were unable to secure tests locally. “If schools can afford to take the hit, private companies don’t have any problems providing tests,” said one Guildford private school teacher. State schools are fast using up the 10 testing kits supplied by government at the start of term – regardless of the school’s size – as teachers and pupils with suspected Covid struggle to book tests. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson admitted to MPs that the testing system “has huge problems”, as new figures showed nearly 4,000 UK cases in the last 24 hours – the highest daily total since early May. The government responded to the growing schools crisis by setting up a hotline from Thursday for heads to call for advice and report cases after being told that staff were waiting hours or even days to hear back from local public health teams. Headteachers representing more than 16,000 pupils in Gateshead in north-east England, which is on the government’s watchlist due to its high infection rate, said the lack of Covid testing would “break” some schools and that their plan for returning children to classrooms had “collapsed” due to the crisis.A letter to MPs from the Gateshead Association of Primary Head Teachers, which represents 67 schools, cited “significant problems” with staff and children unable to get a test and those that did were taking “far too long” to get a result.Mustafaa Malik, chair of the association and head of Harlow Green primary school in Gateshead, said a fifth of his teaching staff were isolating as well as a “double figures” number of its 400 pupils. He said there were considerable absences across the town, where the infection rate is nearly three times the England average.“It’s just unsustainable,” he said. “The parents can feel the anxiety growing. It’s taken a lot of convincing them that it’s safe but we’re starting to get a buildup of fear in some communities.”  The cost of paying supply teachers to fill staff absences would break some school budgets and whole year groups would have to be sent home because heads could not afford to pay for their teaching, Malik added. A survey of 6,700 teachers in England by the Teacher Tapp app found that 4% were isolating away from school for Covid-related reasons on Tuesday. That would equate to around 25,000 teachers nationally, with primary teachers more likely to be isolating, as were those teaching in the Midlands or the north-west of England. Rebecca Allen, professor of education at the University of Brighton and chief analyst for Teacher Tapp – an app that conducts anonymous daily surveys of teachers and school leaders, said the results suggested the autumn and winter cold season was going to play havoc with staff numbers. “We shouldn’t overlook the fact that more than 7 million children are in school with more learning taking place than during lockdown. But the government needs to add teachers to its priority list for tests, and it needs to find a way to help schools pay for the cost of hiring supply teachers to fill in for those isolating. “Otherwise a lot of schools without surpluses will have no choice but to close after having spent their budgets on supply teachers.” The Guardian understands that more than 30 schools in Oldham, one of England’s worst-hit areas, have had to send at least one year group home due to a Covid case. In wider Greater Manchester, more than 110 schools have reported at least one coronavirus case, with the figure rising daily.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said the lack of testing and schools was “causing real distress” for families and teachers. “It needs to be fixed and fixed urgently,” he said. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Charitable Trust which runs 52 schools across England, many in deprived areas, said 1,200 children in two primaries and six secondary schools within the chain were currently at home self-isolating. A single confirmed case in one Bristol secondary school resulted in 187 pupils in the same protective bubble being sent home. In some cases multiple year groups had been sent into self-isolation following guidance from local public health authorities. “All of it is tragic,” said Chalke, who was among those school leaders pushing for an early return to classes after lockdown. “We were told this morning that 740 schools across England are either partly or wholly shut. We are frustrated. All of it could have been avoided. If Boris [Johnson] said it’s our moral duty to get back to school, it’s a moral duty to come up with a plan to keep schools open.” Heads and school governors wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday imploring him to take personal charge of the crisis in Covid testing. The National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the National Governance Association leapfrogged the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to tell Johnson they felt compelled to express “mounting concern”. The ASCL’s general secretary, Geoff Barton, said: “This will feel I think like lockdown by default – it will be more frustrating for parents because you can’t predict whether it is going to happen.” Announcing the new hotline for schools, Williamson said: “The number of confirmed cases in schools remains low but to protect schools it is important headteachers continue to have access to timely support and advice. This new dedicated advice line will help schools, colleges or early years settings to implement the most appropriate public health measures, once a case is confirmed.”",education
"The number of pupils in England who are studying remotely from home rather than in school has more than doubled in the space of a week, according to data shared exclusively with the Guardian. Last week 12,000 pupils accessed lessons remotely as the new term got under way, but the number rose to 25,000 this week, according to the Oak National Academy, the online school set up by the government to support pupils in lockdown. The sharp increase so early in the new term will ring alarm bells in government, as growing numbers of pupils and teachers are sent home to self-isolate amid a shortage of Covid-19 tests nationwide, and union leaders warn of a “lockdown by default”. In the first few days of the new school year alone, 2,000 schools accessed the Oak website and downloaded 20,000 resources to support pupils’ remote teaching, and isolating children confined to their homes accessed half a million online lessons. Some secondary schools have already had to send multiple year groups home following advice from local public health authorities, while other schools are reporting that up to a fifth of their pupils are self-isolating at home, hindering their education and preventing some parents from working. “We are really pleased with our site, but there is no substitute for being in a classroom with a teacher,” said Matt Hood, principal at the Oak academy and an independent adviser at the Department for Education. With up to 25,000 teachers in England already forced out of the classroom and into self-isolation, Hood warned that some schools could have to close if teachers failed to get swift Covid-19 tests that would enable them to return to the classroom, resulting in even more children dependent on remote learning. “If we can’t get adults back into schools as quickly as possible, it becomes at some point unsafe for the school to open,” said Hood. “The worst-case scenario is that we start to see schools close.” The Oak principal said teachers faced an even greater challenge this term than during lockdown, when almost all children’s learning had to be done from home. This term, teachers are having to teach simultaneously in two different settings to cater for pupils at home and those in the classroom. And he raised concerns about the impact of the “digital divide” between students who have a laptop or tablet to access remote learning and those without, should home schooling continue to play a significant part in the school timetable. “We have to be confident kids at home have a device that works and the necessary data. There’s no point having all these remote lessons if children don’t have the device to access them.” The government’s announcement in April of a £100m scheme to provide free laptops and 4G wireless routers for vulnerable pupils with social workers, care leavers and disadvantaged year 10s was welcomed, but roll-out was slow and critics said the scheme was not nearly ambitious enough. “This term is long and it’s hard,” said Hood. “Schools are doing a remarkable job under the circumstances. We are trying to do everything we can to help, but we’ve still got problems with the digital divide.” Ministers have promised to extend and expand the offer this term. Oak National Academy was set up in April as the pandemic took hold across Europe and schools were closed, to provide free online lessons and resources for pupils aged four to 16. In June it was awarded £4.34m to prepare for the next academic year, as part of the government’s contingency planning should schools remain closed. Stephen Eastman, head teacher of Marine Park first school, in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, is among those school leaders already using Oak material. He said a fifth of his pupils were working at home. “We did not envisage we would be at this position quite as quickly as this,” he said. He said said several classes in his school were at home, as well as a small number of individual pupils from different classes who either have symptoms, or have family members with symptoms and awaiting tests. “It’s just the uncertainty of where we are going next with this,” he said. “It feels a bit fluid in so many ways. We are having to be very flexible and reactive. All your plans have to be rethought. It’s really, really challenging.”",education
"While out on his bike for lockdown exercise in the lanes around his Cambridgeshire home, my friend John Hunter was involved in a collision with a car and died at the scene. He was 87. John was an inspiring art teacher, at secondary schools in Carshalton, south London, then Manchester and, from the 1970s until retirement, as head of art at Great Cornard upper school (now Thomas Gainsborough school) in Sudbury, Suffolk. His teaching combined variety, insight and encouragement, with an enthusiasm for modernism and an emphasis on traditional craft skills. His ever-youthful appearance and brilliant sense of humour made him the most popular and respected of teachers. While teaching full time, he became chief examiner in art for the London exam board. This included marking, visiting and moderating for schools in Italy and the Middle East, and marking for some schools in Africa who still took O-levels. He continued this work for around 15 years after his retirement from teaching in 1989. In his own work, he held firm to the solid grounding he received as a student at Hornsey College of Art in the 1950s. As well as painting landscapes and urban views in a variety of media, he was an outstanding printmaker, cutting in lino and wood. His large-scale, colourful prints, produced in his immaculately tidy studio at home, follow in a tradition including Edward Bawden. Born in Winchmore Hill, north London, John was the only child of Ernest – originally a wood carver, then a tobacconist – and his wife Dorothy (nee Colville). He was a keen boy scout with the 173rd North London Group, remaining in touch with a close group of friends from those times. Until the 1990s, with some of them well into their 70s, they went every year on a weekend camping trip (the “boozeree”). For many years, John and my father, John Liddell, would perform as the Onzellos, a knockabout comedy act in the Group Gang Show, much to the bafflement of younger cubs and scouts. John was a lifelong Spurs fan. As a boy he would take the bus from home to the match at White Hart Lane, sometimes seeing the Spurs players on the same bus, with their kit in a duffel bag. John married a fellow Hornsey student, Wendy Edwards, and they had a son, Joe, in 1967. Wendy died of breast cancer shortly afterwards. Times were difficult, but through his love of New Orleans jazz in 1989 John met Jill Morrison. They moved to Cambridgeshire and lived happily ever after, finally marrying in 2005. Together they danced, travelled widely – finding a particular love of the more remote Greek islands – and returned to their immaculate cottage to grow enormous flowers and vegetables, and try to get letters published in the Guardian. Jill survives him, as do Joe and two grandsons, Otto and Edgar.",education
"Record numbers of young people in the UK are starting a university course this autumn, with many anxious to escape a collapsing employment market. But as students embark on a very different university experience, vice-chancellors are worried that many may not last the year. Universities are reporting unprecedented pressure on their student hardship funds, after the abrupt loss of thousands of part-time student jobs in bars, restaurants and shops as a result of the pandemic. They fear students will be much less able to cope with the demands of their course if they are preoccupied with serious worries about paying for food or rent. Meanwhile, experts are warning that this year’s freshers have “lost the discipline of learning”, having spent months at home with no A-level exams to revise for. They predict many will struggle to adapt to independent university study, especially as many classes will be online. They may be “digital natives”, but they are not used to online learning. The head of one leading research university said that most prestigious universities had been factoring a rise in dropouts into their recruitment numbers. The vice-chancellor of another university, in the elite Russell Group, said some students who had been given a place would not have met their offer requirements in an ordinary year, but had done so with teacher-assessed A-level grades. “We know they will struggle. I’m expecting that we may have a high dropout rate and that worries me. For an individual, the impact of dropping out can be far worse than not getting in in the first place.” Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says university bosses are right to be worried about dropout rates, which will be bad for both students and university finances. “To be frank, the university experience won’t be as good because so much has to be different, from how they are taught to how they socialise,” he says.  Many institutions are already facing an uncertain future. “If you lose a first year you don’t just lose their £9,250 fees for the year – you lose nearly £28,000 over the three years of their degree,” Hillman says. At Kingston University, staff have been contributing out of their own pockets to an emergency campaign to help poorer students. Forty per cent of the university’s students are from households with an income of £25,000 or less a year, and the vast majority work to support themselves through their degrees. For them, the sudden loss of part-time jobs has been a disaster, and during lockdown Kingston paid out £900,000 to help. Jenni Woods, head of access, participation and inclusion at Kingston, says: “It was really important that we alleviated that financial pressure for students, because in the midst of this crisis they also had exams looming. It is hard to focus on studying when you don’t know how you will pay your rent or pay for food.” Woods says that while some students will have been supported by their families during lockdown, “for many of our students that just wasn’t an option as their families were struggling financially too”.  Melissa Hariz, who graduated from her film-making course at Kingston this summer, was given a hardship grant to help pay her rent. Like most students, she had a student loan for her living costs, but this still left her £1,500 short on her rent. Hariz had been relying on a job making fundraising calls for the university, but when much of the campus closed during lockdown, she was left with no way to pay her bills. “I have some anxiety already and not having enough money in my final year heightened that,” she says. “It was such an overwhelming feeling to have so much pressure coming from all different angles.” Hariz’s story is being repeated across the country. At the University of the West of England, in Bristol, bosses are thinking hard about diverting money, earmarked for widening participation, to their student hardship fund after a big increase in requests for help. Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor, says: “We are saying please come and talk to us early. When financial problems escalate, that’s when mental health starts to suffer.” Michelle Morgan, a former academic who advises universities on the student experience, fears many new students will find it difficult to adapt to online learning, and says existing students may be less engaged after months studying in their bedrooms at home. “There is this assumption that young people today are digital natives who won’t struggle with some teaching being online. That might be the case with social media but it’s definitely not with learning,” she says. Morgan is concerned that many freshers won’t cope with the huge transition from lockdown to university. “You’ve got students starting university this year who in the last seven months have lost the discipline of learning and time management. They knew they didn’t have A-level exams so they have been winding down,” she says. Many universities have invested in sophisticated data analytics to track their students online, not only monitoring whether they are watching lectures and using the electronic library, but also how long they spend looking at particular pages. At UWE, for instance, West says if a student’s online study patterns change it will trigger an alert and a coach will contact them to check if they need help. But Prof Jacqueline Stevenson, director of the centre for lifelong learning at Leeds University, says: “It’s obvious if someone doesn’t turn up to a physical tutorial, but it can be much harder to tell if a student is engaging online.” Her centre has a team of “student advocates” for the first term to help check students are managing their course. The centre delivers nursing apprenticeships and Stevenson is conscious that nursing students may need extra support. “Some have been dealing with very difficult work challenges during the pandemic, as well as being parents or carers.” Hillman says the dropout rate will depend on how good universities are at supporting their students. “You can stem it if your students have a sense of belonging and if you catch problems early,” he says. However, Stevenson thinks that for some students, taking a break from their course will be the best thing, rather than a catastrophe. “Dropping out can be a pejorative term and is caught up with the idea of failure. But if someone makes a sensible decision to leave, and may come back later to finish their course, that should be celebrated. A student can carry that feeling of failure with them for a very long time.”",education
"Disadvantaged students in England improved their results at GCSE this summer, narrowing the attainment gap with their peers, according to an analysis. After summer exams were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were fears that disadvantaged students could lose out from results based on teacher assessments because of the risk of bias. Research by FFT Education Datalab found no evidence that the attainment gap had widened. Instead, it identified a slight narrowing of the gap at the crucial grade 4 or above threshold, equivalent to the bottom of an old C grade. The 4 grade at GCSE is considered crucial because it allows pupils to go on to further study or training. Those who do not gain a 4 in English and maths must retake the exams while they remain in post-16 education. Based on analysis of this year’s results at 1,200 secondary schools, researchers found that 56% of disadvantaged pupils achieved a grade 4 or above in English and maths at GCSE, compared with 78% of non-disadvantaged pupils. Although at 22 percentage points, the attainment gap remains vast, it is an improvement on last year, when the comparable figures were 46% and 72%, a gap of 26 percentage points. Philip Nye, a researcher at FFT Education Datalab, said: “After the chaos of this summer’s results season, the news that the disadvantage gap does not seem to have widened comes as a relief. “The gap remains worryingly large – but many of us feared that disadvantaged pupils might have lost out with the cancellation of GCSE exams and the move to an alternative awarding approach. That does not seem to have happened. “All efforts should now be made to support disadvantaged pupils who will take their GCSEs in 2021 to ensure that the attainment gap does not widen next year.” There was an outcry among teachers and pupils after an algorithm designed by the exams regulator Ofqual to standardise results across England caused the widespread downgrading of centre-assessed grades (Cags) at A-level. The government performed a dramatic U-turn, scrapping the algorithm and allowing Cags, set by teachers and schools, to be used instead to award grades for both A-levels and GCSEs. Figures published by Ofqual at the start of summer showed its algorithm would probably have caused a slight widening in the attainment gap in GCSE results between pupils who were on free school meals and those who were not.",education
"As universities struggle to contain student parties, and with coronavirus outbreaks already confirmed at several campuses, many academics are afraid of face-to-face teaching. But some say managers are bullying them to return and, fearing redundancy, they feel unable to refuse. In the past few days the universities of Glasgow and Liverpool have both announced significant Covid outbreaks, and other universities, including St Andrews, Edinburgh Napier, Bath, Oxford Brookes, Aberdeen and Stirling are grappling with confirmed cases. Vicky Blake, president of the University and College Union (UCU), says: “Staff are getting in touch with me at their wits’ end. It’s a horrible thing to be told people are terrified.” Universities insist the safety of staff, students and local residents is their priority. But the union says it is being deluged with pleas for help from staff on precarious contracts who feel unable to refuse to teach face-to-face, but are deeply fearful about the risks. “We are operating in the context of redundancy announcements. It makes it feel very difficult to put your head above the parapet,” Blake says. One academic at a Russell Group university, who asked not to be named, said her university had dismissed her concerns about infecting her partner, who has type 1 diabetes and is therefore at an increased risk from coronavirus. “We live in a shared studio apartment with no room to quarantine,” she says. “I reported this, along with my own concerns about being BAME, but my head of department has told me I don’t understand the science and the classroom is the safest place to be.” The academic says that “under pressure” she has been teaching students in a seminar room with no windows, but wearing a mask and changing and showering immediately afterwards. “I am on a casual teaching-only contract and it’s obvious if I refuse to do this I will risk damaging my career or losing my job,” she says. Like many other academics in the arts and humanities, she believes she can teach her subject just as well online, and says she has attracted exciting external speakers to take part in digital seminars who probably would not participate in person. At Northumbria University, an academic whose partner nearly died after they both contracted coronavirus in March has circulated an angry letter to colleagues, saying the pressure to come back on to campus “to deliver teaching that could be delivered online” was “shameful”. The letter describes the partner’s illness, including a week spent almost totally alone in intensive care, “in the hope that sharing this experience might bring home the gravity of what a second wave might cause”. Dr Adam Hansen, senior lecturer in English at Northumbria and chair of its UCU branch, says universities’ risk assessments should take into account any clinically vulnerable people academics are living with or supporting. “Our view is that any assessment of what happens in a university at the moment should start with two questions: does this activity have to happen on campus, and does this individual have to do it?” A spokesperson for the university says: “The health and safety of our staff and students is always our first priority. Where colleagues are working on campus we have taken mitigating actions in line with government guidance to make the working environment safe.” In many universities, much of the in-person teaching will fall to younger members of staff on casual contracts. A young PhD student at the University of St Andrews, who does not want to be named in case it affects his career, says that in his department PhD students teach 82% of the first- and second-year seminars that will now be face-to-face. “We’ve basically been told, if you want one of these tutor groups the teaching will be in person,” he says. “For me there is a dignity issue here. No one is even asking if we are OK with this.” He makes £81.75 a week (which includes holiday pay) teaching three undergraduate seminars, putting him below the £120 a week necessary to claim statutory sick pay if he contracts the virus. “Many PhD students like me won’t be entitled to sick pay if we get ill,” he says. “Long Covid is what really worries me. I’m at a precarious point in my career. I’m due to submit my PhD dissertation in a few months and I don’t have the time or the money to be ill for a long period.” Moreover, he is not convinced that teaching face-to-face will work with the current safety restrictions. “I am being asked to run small group discussions in a big lecture theatre at a 2 metre distance with masks on and with some students watching simultaneously online. I’m at a loss as to how to lead an effective class like that. Will we even hear each other with masks on?” A spokeswoman for St Andrews says: “We’ve heard and sympathise with [the] concerns and are bringing in an addition to current policy to ensure that flexible workers are covered for pay they might miss if they fall ill. PhD students also have access to our student support funds.” As for concerns about the quality of teaching, the spokeswoman says: “We’ve been running in-person teaching on a limited basis for two weeks already, and the feedback from both staff and students so far has been exceptionally positive.” At Cambridge University, the local UCU branch is concerned that with 45% of undergraduate tutorials or “supervisions” conducted by graduate students, postdoctoral students and freelancers, young casual workers will “be left to bear the costs of face-to-face teaching in a global pandemic”. It says most are far too worried about their careers to risk speaking out about safety. A university spokesperson says: “We accept this is a worrying time. No member of staff will be compelled to attend face-to-face supervisions if they have concerns about their health and wellbeing.” Those at the top of the profession aren’t necessarily finding it easy to refuse to teach either. One well-reputed professor at an elite university says he struggled to prove that he shouldn’t be teaching because of the danger of putting his elderly father at risk. “My university has a policy that if you have medical evidence or you fit one of the high-risk categories you won’t have to teach. I’m knocking 60, but I don’t fit any of these categories. Yet I am in a bubble with my father in his mid-80s and I am the only person he sees.” In the end, the professor went to see his doctor because of his anxieties about being forced to teach students in person and catching public transport to get to university. She wrote a letter saying he needed to be allowed to teach online, which the university accepted. “The university headline is that no one will be compelled. But if you can’t produce hard evidence of your risk, I don’t know what you do,” he says. “This feels like a dishonest approach and I know some heads of school are bullying people into it. It’s only senior people like me who can say sod it and take them on, knowing they can’t promote you any further anyway.”  A spokesperson for the vice-chancellors’ group, Universities UK, said: “Universities should be considering the needs of staff and students on an individual basis. There is a careful balancing of the risk of any potential future national or local lockdowns and ensuring that young people – who have faced incredible disruption during the pandemic – can continue with their education.” UUK has produced guidance for universities in ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of students, staff, visitors and the wider community.",education
"Black working-class young people in England are being unfairly excluded and criminalised by a “two-tier education system”, a thinktank has said. An Institute of Race Relations (IRR) report focusing on London says government responses to inner-city youth rebellions and moral panics over serious youth violence and knife crime have led to black pupils disproportionately being sent to pupil referral units (PRU) and alternative provision (AP). Young black Caribbean boys are nearly four times more likely to receive a permanent school exclusion and twice as likely to receive a fixed-period exclusion than the school population as a whole, making them the most excluded group apart from Gypsy and Traveller children. Warning of a “PRU-to-prison” pipeline, the IRR report notes that 89% of children in detention in 2017-18 reported having been excluded from school, according to the HM chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales. The report’s author, Jessica Perera, an IRR researcher, said: “Amidst the Black Lives Matter protests, we have seen increased demands to decolonise the curriculum. At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed a system which fails working-class students. “This paper reminds us that those who have been continually failed are found in PRUs and AP and that their segregation is a damning indictment of a planned education malaise, which has been designed and deployed on a specific section of society with a history of resistance and rebellion.” Reviewing education policies over the last four decades, Perera says police officers placed in schools and other surveillance methods lead to working-class multiracial youth living on estates in London being framed as “suspects”. She argues that black working-class boys have been let down by the “monocultural” national curriculum, which replaced attempts – particularly in the capital – at progressive multicultural education. Last month the government turned down calls for a review to add more black, Asian and ethnic minority history to the national curriculum. With the expansion of academies, which are more likely to permanently exclude pupils, and alternative provision, Perera questions whether rising exclusions are “about removing a section of the urban multiracial working class which poses a threat to incoming gentrifying students” The result, she says, is a “two-tier state education system: academies for the aspirational and pupil referral units for the defiant and apathetic.” A government spokesperson said: “We know some groups of children are more likely to be excluded than others, and we expect teachers to look at how to address underlying causes of disruptive behaviour in order to avoid excluding where possible, while also keeping schools safe and disciplined for all. “The school curriculum is already broad and ambitious, teaching pupils about different cultures with significant historic figures from black and ethnic minority communities, underpinned by the need for mutual respect and understanding.”",education
"UK universities are on course to recruit record numbers of international students during the global pandemic, defying predictions of financial disaster, the latest admissions figures reveal. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said UK universities enjoyed a 9% increase in the number of undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU starting their studies this autumn, rising to a new record total of 44,300. The increase marks a remarkable turnaround from earlier this year, when vice-chancellors feared there would be a collapse in international student numbers and warned that a sector-wide financial crisis was likely to follow. Universities redoubled their efforts to recruit students from overseas, and may have been helped by negative sentiment towards the US, where the virus remains unchecked in parts of the country, and while potential rivals in New Zealand and Australia remain closed to international students. Ucas’s figures usually include fewer than half of the more than 100,000 international undergraduates coming to the UK, with the remainder and postgraduates applying directly to individual universities rather than through the admissions service. Admissions officers have also been celebrating record numbers of first-year students coming from disadvantaged areas in the UK, with 22.5% of students from areas with the lowest educational attainment now continuing on into higher education. The overall proportion of the UK’s 18-year-olds entering higher education will reach 36%, itself a new record. That will also come as a relief to many in higher education, after the bungled efforts to assess entry grades using statistical models to replace exams. In most cases the grades were replaced with school assessments, meaning more students are likely to have met entry requirements. “Overall demand for higher education has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, and there are currently a record 515,650 students with a confirmed place, up 4% on last year,” Ucas said, noting that the increase followed three years of falling enrolments. But the figures also show a drop in acceptances from new EU undergraduates, down 2% compared with 2019-20, to just under 30,000. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: “The data clearly tell a very positive story. It was always clear that domestic demand would be up, despite the reduction in 18-year olds, because the alternatives to more education are so poor this year. “It was also always likely that EU numbers would be down, given the Brexit uncertainties and shenanigans. No one predicted such a big increase in non-EU international students and we have to wait to see if they will all actually arrive and then stay the course. “But it is a great testament to the underlying strength of our higher education sector, as well as a reflection of the improved migration regime and rising geopolitical tensions between China and the US, that so many people still want to come and study at our fantastic institutions.” Fears that a significant proportion of students would defer entry because of campus restrictions on socialising have not been borne out: the figures showed only a slight uptick in the proportion of deferrals, 5.7% compared with 5.4% in 2019. Separately, the Student Loans Company said it had processed and distributed more than £1bn in maintenance loans to 414,877 students by this week, marking its biggest single payment date.",education
"The founder of a leading education campaign to get black British history embedded in the national curriculum in England has expressed frustration at the government’s inaction, despite the growing clamour for change among young people. Lavinya Stennett, who launched the Black Curriculum in January, said it was taking “way too long” and expressed concern that new government guidance on “extreme” political teachings in the classroom could hamper progress further. She said the global Black Lives Matter protests, which followed the killing of George Floyd, had been a huge catalyst for change. Her campaign has been inundated with requests for training and support from students and teachers, inspired by global events, who want change in their own classroom. However, despite earlier interest from the Department for Education and promises of a meeting, she is yet to see ministers to discuss curriculum reform and there is no date in the diary. This week, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators and Black Educators Alliance threatened the government with legal action over new guidance that tells schools not to use resources from organisations that have expressed a desire to end capitalism. In a pre-action letter, they warned the guidance would prevent teachers from using material from groups including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, limiting anti-racism teaching. “They’re not making it easier,” Stennett said. “I’m very confident there will be real change. There’s a lot more young people who have entered the conversation. There’s a lot more young people who have put it at the top of their agenda. It will happen. But it’s just when?” Her campaign wants it to be mandatory for pupils in England, from key stage 1 in primary through to key stage 4, when students take their GCSEs, to learn about black British history throughout the year, rather than just in Black History Month. “Black British history is not merely a theme for October,” its mission statement says, “but started hundreds of years before Windrush and predates European colonial enslavement. Our work aims to address and overcome these limitations by seeking to provide a contextual, globalised history that roots the Black British experience in histories of movement and migration, 365 days a year.” As Black Lives Matter protests gathered momentum around the world and the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities became apparent, hopes were high that the government would be forced to tackle racism, including racial bias in the curriculum. Though Covid has meant moving the group’s work online as opposed to its usual programme of face-to-face workshops, the Black Curriculum has become significantly more high-profile and now counts Marks & Spencer as a sponsor, as big-name corporations seek to ally themselves with organisations fighting racism. Stennett’s team have worked with more than 1,000 teachers and school leaders across the country this year, as well as UCL’s Institute of Education, and Teach First, which trains teachers to work in schools in disadvantaged areas. On Friday the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced a partnership between London schools and the Black Curriculum. In June, Stennett and other campaigners wrote an open letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, demanding change. “Thousands of us, the British voting public, are grief-stricken and concerned about the existing status quo in the UK, which disregards the lives and contributions of Black British people,” the letter stated. “Despite numerous calls over the years to reform the national curriculum to incorporate Black histories, these requests have been denied. Learning Black history should not be a choice but should be mandatory. Our curriculum should not be reinforcing the message that a sizeable part of the British population are not valued.” In July, however, the schools minister Nick Gibb said there were no plans for a review of the curriculum. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said ministers were tone-deaf on the issue. “I’m very frustrated,” said Stennett. “People want to see change. It’s taking way too long.” After a huge surge in interest, Stennett is concerned the momentum of the past few months should not be lost. “People have a sudden interest and it fades away. That’s a worry I have, with sudden things like that. It’s about sustaining it now.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Schools play a crucial role in helping young people understand the world around them and their place within it. “The knowledge-rich curriculum in our schools already offers pupils the opportunity to learn about significant figures from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and the contributions they have made to the country’s history, as well as helping them learn about our shared history with countries from across the world.”",education
"Campaigners have threatened the government with legal action over new guidance that tells schools not to use resources from organisations that have expressed a desire to end capitalism. In a pre-action letter, the Coalition of Anti-Racist Educators (Care) and Black Educators Alliance (BEA) said the guidance would prevent teachers from using material from groups including Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion, limiting anti-racism teaching. In guidance issued last week for school leaders and teachers in England, the Department for Education (DfE) categorised anti-capitalism as an “extreme political stance” and equated it with opposition to freedom of speech, antisemitism and endorsement of illegal activity. The guidance also states that schools should not “under any circumstances” work with or use material from groups that do not “condemn illegal activities done in their name or in support of their cause” or promote “victim narratives that are harmful to British society”. Care and BEA said the guidance would prevent young people from engaging with teaching about racism, discouraging the use of material produced by Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion, the charity Inquest “or another campaigning organisation that seeks to draw attention to the disproportionate impact of state violence (including against Black men).” The letter says that as it is unclear what “victim narratives” means, schools could be discouraged from using resources produced by organisations that campaign for rights for minority groups. The groups have began to fundraise to proceed with a judicial review if the department refuses to withdraw the guidance. Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP for Streatham, said: “I support this legal challenge. Freedom of speech and an educated population are two fundamental pillars of democracy. We cannot move forward as a society without respecting them both. “These guidelines are a deeply worrying erosion of these two principles by an authoritarian Conservative government that has lost all credibility among the young.” A spokesperson for Care said: “This guidance will have a chilling effect in the classrooms. Our schools are filled with inquisitive young people and we should be doing everything necessary to ensure they are given all the tools and information to have rich discussions on topics such as inequality. “This guidance prevents that by restricting access to materials and no-platforming organisations that don’t curry favour with the government.” Rachel Harger, a solicitor at Bindmans, said: “The guidance, which was published without consultation or warning, is a clear statement of the secretary of state’s own political preferences and the ban on the use of teaching materials related to leftwing or political groups is clearly unlawful, serious and far-reaching. “The guidance constitutes an assault on the common law right to freedom of speech, freedom of religious belief, and has a disproportionate impact on protected groups such as the black and trans community.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our new relationships, sex and health education (RHSE) guidance is clear that schools should not work with agencies that take extreme positions. Schools should already be aware of their duty to political impartiality, as set out under the Education Act 1996. “We would still expect subjects to be discussed in a balanced way as part of a school’s wider curriculum where relevant.  “More widely, our guidance is designed to give schools the confidence to construct a curriculum that reflects diversity of views and backgrounds, whilst fostering all pupils’ respect for others, understanding of healthy relationships, and ability to look after their own wellbeing.”",education
"A secondary school headteacher has denied that a member of staff was suspended because she was a Christian who raised concerns about teaching young children about LGBTQ+ relationships, an tribunal has heard. Kristie Higgs, 44, was dismissed for gross misconduct by Farmor’s school in Fairford, Gloucestershire, last year after sharing and commenting on social media posts about relationship education. The posts raised concerns about plans to teach the No Outsiders programme at her son’s Church of England school. A tribunal in Bristol has heard that Higgs, a pastoral assistant at Farmor’s, was suspended by headteacher Matthew Evans and, following a disciplinary process, was sacked. The Christian Legal Centre is supporting Higgs, who argues her sacking breached her freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Evans told the employment tribunal his priority after receiving the complaint was to uphold “confidence” in the school. He said: “It was not because of the beliefs. These posts have been shared and apparently endorsed and my concern was that might lead to a loss of confidence in the school.” Earlier, Higgs said: “They had already made up their mind when Mr Evans started his investigation. People have a different belief system than I do. It doesn’t make me wrong.” Barrister Debbie Grennan, representing the school, asked Higgs whether a man who underwent gender reassignment surgery and had obtained a gender recognition certificate was a woman. “They are still male,” Higgs replied. “In this land I accept they have got their certificate. That’s who they say they are but God is who made them. “God’s law says they cannot change their gender, the law says they can. This does not mean you have to accept it. It doesn’t mean I hate them, or they are not my friends.” The tribunal continues.",education
"The number of schools in England badly affected by Covid-19 cases among students and staff has quadrupled in the space of a week, and the number of pupils absent rose by 50%, according to estimates released by the Department for Education. The DfE’s figures revealed that 4% of state schools were classed as “not fully open” last week because of Covid-19, compared with 1% of schools seven days before, including cases where entire year groups had been sent home. Around 20 schools were closed outright for Covid-related reasons. Nine hundred schools were affected, in a week during which many headteachers and parents complained they were unable to access coronavirus tests, forcing those showing symptoms to be kept away from the classroom and self-isolate. Including independent schools at a similar rate would bring the figure for England close to 1,000 schools. The DfE defines schools as “fully open” if they are able to provide face-to-face teaching for all pupils on roll for the whole school day and they have not asked a group of pupils to self-isolate. A further 2% of settings were not fully open but the reasons were not classed as Covid-related. The DfE noted that 99.9% of state schools were open, and that the majority of schools that were closing were doing so only for some pupils, such as classes or year group bubbles in close contact with a suspected case. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “As we would expect, this data shows a small number of pupils are self-isolating in line with public health advice, and schools, colleges and early years settings across the country continue to work tremendously hard to ensure protective measures are in place to reduce the risks of transmission.” The figures, based on a survey of three-quarters of England’s state schools, showed that more than one in eight pupils were absent last Thursday, rising to one in seven in secondary schools, meaning that more than a million children were out of school. Typically fewer than 5% of pupils are absent, according to a different dataset, which suggests 600,000 may have been absent for coronavirus-related issues. The number of pupils in school nationally also fell compared with the previous week, which had been the first full week for almost all schools to be open after the summer holidays. Just 87% of pupils were recorded as attending, compared with 88% the previous week. But even in schools classed as “fully open” by the DfE, the overall attendance rate fell from 90% on 15 September, to 88% on 22 September. Special schools and alternative provision such as pupil referral units appear to have been hit hardest by absences, although both tend to have higher absence rates than mainstream schools. The DfE estimated that independent schools had attendance rates of 91%. State secondary schools recorded attendances of 86%, meaning that more than 500,000 pupils were absent. It highlights the struggle that schools face in preparing their year 11 and year 13 pupils for 2021’s GCSE, BTec and A-level exams, with most having already missed more than a term of their courses last year. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It is clear from the latest statistics that the government is failing in its duty to reduce the infection rate and to provide pupils and teachers with tests in a timely fashion. This is eroding trust among parents, and it will be an uphill struggle for it to be regained.” Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that her son, who is in the middle of GCSEs, had missed months of school and had been sent home this week to isolate, adding: “What the hell is the government going to do for kids like him and his classmates?” Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, is still to announce the dates for next year’s exams, after suggestions by Williamson that they could be delayed by two or three weeks. Ofqual’s leaders have said the organisation is working on contingency plans, including online exams, in the event of Covid-19 outbreaks or lockdowns further disrupting schools and students. The Scottish government is considering scrapping in-person exams for National 5s – a qualification equivalent to GCSEs – and instead awarding results using school assessments.",education
"Sixth former Amy Fielding*, with her dreams of becoming a lawyer and her hard work for her A-levels, has the air of a determined young woman at the pinnacle of a successful school career. Yet only two years ago, her teachers say, Amy was a “challenging tearaway” doing all the things that in many schools would lead to permanent exclusion. But Amy’s school, George Green’s in Tower Hamlets, didn’t exclude her. Its leadership team, determined to bring down exclusions rates, committed themselves to keeping her in school. She has benefited from a radically different approach to managing behaviour, based on understanding pupils’ personal circumstances and helping them to overcome the impact of traumatic experiences in early life, or outside school, that may be affecting their behaviour – such as abuse, neglect, domestic violence and family breakdown. It is the polar opposite from some of the prevailing wisdom of the past decade, by which high-profile schools celebrate the virtues of a “zero tolerance” or no-excuses discipline policy, sometimes linked to a seemingly cruel school culture and high numbers of exclusions. In recent years details have leaked out of very successful schools using approaches that reduced children to tears, with some students, according to England’s children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, spending days in isolation booths. One Norfolk academy advised teachers to provide buckets for ill pupils to vomit in during lessons rather than leave the classroom – although it has since backtracked. George Green’s deputy head, Aidan McQuaid, came to the school knowing exclusions were too high and determined to address the problem through a supportive, rather than punitive, approach. Exclusion rates have since fallen, and pupils such as Amy given a second chance. And the sort of trauma-informed practice used at Amy’s school is a growing in popularity, as exclusion rates across the country remain stubbornly high and the impact of the Covid lockdown on pupils becomes clearer. “Amy is a bright girl with aspirations, but she was putting herself in a vulnerable position because of her home life and significant safeguarding concerns,” says McQuaid. “We helped her understand that we weren’t going to give up on her, and explained what she could do differently by addressing the behaviour in a way she understood. We were in her corner and we refused to be another key support figure in her life to let her down. “We have unwavering high expectations, and behaviour at George Green’s school is excellent. Each young person is different and may have super-challenging circumstances in their lives, so we need to find a balance. Some of these young people haven’t got the skills to manage behaviour because their brains haven’t developed in that way. Why are we punishing them for something they can’t control? Why would you exclude someone to effectively send them back to the place where they are most vulnerable and increase their risk of harm? That does not make sense.” For Amy, switching to a different track was only possible because of her teachers’ confidence that keeping her in school would work. “I had a lot of stuff going on at home and outside of school which meant I found it hard to concentrate and didn’t care about school,” she says. “Support from teachers helped me to understand that, and I am so proud of myself that I didn’t get kicked out. I wouldn’t have been able to do that without my teachers.” The method has attracted cynics, with accusations on social media that it is wishy washy and weak on poorly behaved pupils.  Dave Whitaker, director of learning at the Wellspring academy trust, has got used to the criticism. He is a longstanding practitioner of what he calls a “relational” approach to behaviour – “We batter them with kindness,” as he explains it. He believes the record of the trust’s 25 schools, mostly in areas of high deprivation, speaks for itself. All are good or outstanding and have never had any permanent exclusions. “We are very rigorous, have high standards and this work isn’t easy.” His trust includes mainstream primary, secondary, alternative provision and specialist SEMH schools (for children with social, emotional and mental health needs). “What I call the behaviourist approach [zero tolerance and rewards and sanctions] only looks at behaviour, rather than deeper causes. We chucked it out the window 10 years ago and began to look at underlying emotions, rather than symptoms. Kindness, restorative practice and strong relationships underpin the culture of everything we do.” Wellspring heads are evangelical about the benefits of the trauma-informed approach. One, Jason Thurley, says his school, the Beacon academy in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, is the opposite of a “comply or die school”. “We are giving children a second chance and we are oversubscribed and popular with parents, who have written at length to Ofsted to say how much they appreciate that. In areas of high deprivation, zero tolerance and high exclusions are not going to improve that community, which is what schools should be doing.” A colleague, Ann Marie Oliver, associate principal of a specialist SEMH school, Springwell Leeds, describes the impact of the method on children who have had the sort of adverse childhood experiences trauma-informed practice is designed to tackle. “Young people with physical disabilities are easy to see and understand. When young people have suffered from trauma and inconsistent care at a young age, they have strong emotional needs that are not so obvious to the eye. They don’t trust adults well because their needs have not met by the caregiver. For them, life is like being in shark-infested waters. We can’t see anything, but the smallest trigger could see their bodies go into crisis and automatic fight-or-flight mode. “We had one young man who had been in 10 different foster homes over the last two years and lived in constant crisis, experiencing permanent rejection. Our response was ‘we are here for you, we are not going to reject you, we are going to keep you safe’.” And this work appears to be in more demand than ever. Trauma Informed Schools UK, which offers teacher training in the method, is working with 3500 schools, including every school in Cornwall, and more than 20,000 teachers took part in its online “return to school” training after lockdown. Dr Margot Sunderland, co-director, says many heads are reporting a rise in the number of children whose behaviour has been affected by lockdown, possibly with a violent or depressed parent. “People are hungry for a different vision of how to support these children. There is a growing awareness that this is a social justice issue. The evidence is very clear that without help in schools to address their unmet emotional needs, children who have adverse childhood experiences, including living in poverty, are more likely to develop long-term mental and physical health problems and/or get involved in crime. Until we start to address the emotional needs of traumatised children, little will change in society.” Tackling these types of traumatic childhood experiences is a key strand of NHS Scotland’s work, and an Adverse Childhood Experiences hub has worked with more than 60% of schools in Wales. Some universities are including trauma-informed practice in their teacher training and the Department for Education’s recent guidance on mental health and behaviour for schools in England includes TISUK as a possible resource. But headteachers such as Thurley believe a profound rebalancing of schools’ performance measures to value inclusion as well as results is needed. “Many heads are pressured to prioritise results over pupil wellbeing, which inevitably leads to exclusions to remove challenging pupils. Secondary schools need to put children and relationships first and data second,” he says. Kiran Gill, founder of The Difference, which provides specialist mental health and trauma-informed practice training for senior leaders, such as McQuaid, believes a culture shift away from the no-excuses approach may be on the way. “It’s clear that heads, trusts and local authorities want a systemic and solutions-focused response to pupils’ vulnerability and experience of trauma that goes beyond whack-a-mole policies which lead the students who need school most getting more and more marginalised,” she says. “It’s early days, but increasing numbers of schools are curious about the neuroscience that’s been applied in mental health services. If we see more schools using interventions that improve pupil outcomes, reduce absenteeism and exclusion, I hope we will see that reflected in the narrative and accountability from Ofsted and the Department for Education.” * Not her real name",education
"A ban on residential school trips risks an “economic, social and cultural disaster” and the loss of 15,000 UK jobs unless it is lifted by spring, ministers are being warned. A generation of children risk missing out on often life-changing benefits of visits unless there are changes to Covid-19 restrictions that have left outdoor education centres dormant since March, according to companies, schools and parents. Some of Britain’s poorest pupils – including those from city communities – are among those who stand to lose most. The school travel sector has been closed by since March and wants a change to continued advice preventing overnight educational visits. “It is a bitter pill to swallow keeping our sites closed while we see hotels, boarding schools and hostels delivering the same overnight experiences unabated,” said Jim Whittaker, the chair of the Association of Heads of Outdoors Centres and a member of the trade body UK Outdoors. PGL, a specialist school travel company that is one of the biggest in the sector, has already announced 670 redundancies. In a letter to Johnson on Monday, UK Outdoors said “an existential threat” loomed over the sector, which ranges from the small independents and local authority providers to larger international organisations. It told the prime minister that nearly 3,000 jobs had already been lost and many outdoor education facilities had permanently closed after losing £500m of revenue. Without change before the spring term, half of outdoor education capacity will be lost permanently alongside more than 10,000 jobs, it added. Andy Robinson, the chief executive of Institute for Outdoor Learning, said: “Every child’s first trip away from home is such an important and formative experience. The government has to act to protect the industry and ensure its reopening in time for the spring term or face an economic, social and cultural disaster.” The calls are backed by headteachers and parents, while a petition calling on the Department for Education to immediately allow overnight education trips for schools has attracted more than 10,000 signatures. Residential trips were described as “essential for children’s emotional and educational development” by the deputy head of John Rankin schools in Berkshire, which sends 90 year 5 pupils every autumn term to a centre with sites in Dorset and south Wales, while 90 year 6 pupils go to Rhos in north Wales for a week in January. “I don’t understand why it’s OK for a plane full of 300 people to travel to Zante on holiday, yet the government has told us that our year 5s and 6s, already in a school bubble, can’t go away for five days,” added Matt Percy, the school’s deputy head. Lenka Uhlarova, whose daughter Bea has Down’s syndrome, spoke about how the trips with other John Rankin pupils had helped her, adding: “She was able to take risks and overcome some of her fears. She learned about history in a practical way in a beautiful setting, but most of all Bea developed her independence skills, team building and confidence.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Since the start of term, schools have been able to run non-residential trips. We keep our guidance on both residential and non-residential trips under review, in line with Public Health England advice.”",education
"Dancing, drinking and flirting at wild parties will be firmly off the student timetable this term – even for those tempted to attend an illegal event. Universities are paying for “Covid marshals” to break up mass gatherings and stop undergraduates flouting pandemic rules. In Newcastle, police will carry out “high visibility” patrols in student hubs every night until Christmas, with the city’s two main universities picking up the bill. Newcastle and Northumbria universities said they would provide the additional funding as part of their Operation Oak community initiative, which already costs £125,000 a year. Police will be present in places with high student numbers such as Jesmond, a suburb in the north of Newcastle known for its lively party scene. Officers were called to the area several times during lockdown following reports of student gatherings. As term begins and 28,000 Newcastle university students descend on campus, 2 million people in the north-east have been placed under local lockdown and banned from mixing in private homes and gardens. Joe Molander, a third-year at Newcastle, said that while he thought patrols were important, local authorities were “itching for a fight with students”. “I think they see us as loud, heavy-drinking nuisances. Police patrols might be an excuse for the police to harass students,” he said. “I think the university should make the guidelines clearer. I can support police patrols if they’re there to assist, and not to bully.” Students in Manchester will also see “community night-time support patrols” in busy areas in the south of the city. The patrols, paid for by Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan universities, will be carried out by security contractor Mitie and will report antisocial behaviour and breaches of social distancing to the relevant authorities. Manchester university said the patrols started on 14 September and would take place every night between 10pm and 6am for the first two weeks of term. They would then be active every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday during term time. Tom Simms, a first-year at Manchester university who moved into halls last week, said that he had already been moved on by a security guard who was wearing university uniform. “There were only four of us, we heard some people sitting outside chatting so we went outside and joined them,” he said. “Slowly the group got bigger and marshals came round and said ‘look, guys, you’re going to have to break it up’.” Simms said he was worried students would be forced inside, which would be worse for the spread of the virus: “The rule of six doesn’t really seem fair when you’re outside. Not having loads of people mixing in the same flat makes sense but sitting outside quite far apart seems pretty safe.” The plans for student patrols are similar to those recently floated by Boris Johnson for “Covid marshals” to enforce rules in city centres. Hundreds of thousands of students will return to campus next week, and universities have brought forward several measures to stop the virus from spreading. Most in-person freshers events have been cancelled, and lectures will be held online with minimal face-to-face teaching. Undergraduates have even been warned they could be kicked out if they do not follow the rules. Some universities are also rolling out on-campus testing. Leicester will be among the institutions screening potentially asymptomatic students and staff to try to prevent the spread of the virus. Cambridge has also pledged to test 15,000 students every week. In the latest guidance, universities were urged by the government not to send students back to their family homes in the event of an outbreak, and told that in such cases, students should remain where they are, to “reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through travel”.",education
"More than four out of five schools in England have pupils stuck at home because they cannot get access to Covid-19 tests, according to a survey of headteachers. Meanwhile it emerged that Eton, where the prime minister studied, had used a private provider to test all of its staff and students as they returned to school in September.  The National Association of Head Teachers said the government had “failed schools and children” after receiving reports from more than 700 of its members that 82% had pupils absent because of a lack of testing, and 86% had pupils at home waiting for their results. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT, said: “We are hearing the same thing repeatedly from our members across the country – chaos is being caused by the inability of staff and families to successfully get tested when they display symptoms. “This means schools are struggling with staffing, have children missing school, and ultimately that children’s education is being needlessly disrupted.” Nearly half of the headteachers contacted said they had staff off seeking a test, and 60% had staff waiting for test results to come back. More than one in six school leaders said they had had a confirmed case of Covid-19 infection among their pupils since the start of term this month. Whiteman said: “It is in no way unpredictable or surprising that the demand for Covid-19 tests would spike when schools reopened more widely this term. And yet the system is in chaos. The government has failed schools and children.” Asked about its private tests, Eton said it had acted on the advice of health professionals. In a statement, the Berkshire fee-paying school said: “Eton took the decision to test all pupils and staff for Covid-19 on their return to school, having carefully assessed the risks of transmission within our specific boarding context. In deciding to test, Eton has been determined not to put additional pressure on the NHS. Therefore, a contract has been taken out with a private provider and the school is covering all costs.” To relieve pressure on the testing programme, members of the government’s Sage group of scientific advisers have recommended that a national two-week lockdown could be imposed in October to coincide with schools’ half-term holidays, according to a report in the Financial Times. “As schools will be closed for one week at half-term, adding an extra week to that will have limited impact on education,” one of Sage’s members said. After protests from schools, the Department for Education has set up a response hotline for headteachers to call in the event of outbreaks rather than relying on Public Health England’s local teams. The DfE has also announced it will provide extra home-testing kits for schools after heads complained the initial supply of 10 kits was inadequate. Schools can now order 10 tests for every 1,000 pupils on roll, but only three weeks after their previous order was accepted. On Thursday, Dido Harding, the head of the NHS’s test and trace programme, told MPs: “I don’t think anybody was expecting to see the really sizeable increase” in the demand for testing after pupils returned after the summer holidays. School leaders say they were repeatedly assured by the government that testing would be in place for schools reopening, as a key safety requirement to enable children and teachers to return. A coalition of school leaders – including the NAHT, the Association of School and College Leaders and the national school governors’ association – wrote to Boris Johnson this week, imploring him to take personal responsibility for the lack of testing and slow results hampering schools. A government spokesperson said official statistics showed 99.9% of schools were open with the vast majority of pupils attending. “Where staff or children have symptoms of Covid-19, testing capacity is the highest it has ever been, and we are working to provide further priority access for teachers. “Schools only need to identify close contacts and ask them to self-isolate if and when a case is confirmed from a positive test result,” the spokesperson said.",education
"My friend and colleague Peter Puloy-Wey, who has died aged 82, was a painter of landscapes full of soaring skies in the tradition of Turner, and a lecturer at St Albans School of Art and Craft who pioneered the professional development of arts therapists. We were colleagues at St Albans from 1973 to 1992, together involved in developing the postgraduate master’s degrees in art therapy and dramatherapy. The success of these courses was significant in establishing the arts therapies as registered professions in the NHS (1999). Peter’s role was central to the work, being responsible for the practical studio and media core of the training. His skill lay in facilitating an open and secure environment in which students could take risks to create personal and often emotional work. Many students reported how they rediscovered their creativity in his workshops. It was fundamental to the course philosophy that art therapists in their work with patients should be in touch with their personal creative process. It was at the college that Peter met Monika Puloy, an art historian, whom he married in 1974. Peter’s own painting developed fresh energy from their relationship and summer visits to Monika’s home in the Austrian Alps. Inspired by the vast skies, swirling mist and thermals of the mountains, his spontaneous use of watercolour produced a range of colourful work full of movement and space. Born in Hackney, east London, Peter was the son of Jack Wey, an engraver for gold and silversmiths, and Catherine (nee McIver). His early years were affected by asthma and tuberculosis. The family moved to Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and he attended Norton Road school, one of the first designed around a quadrangle to allow open-air teaching and let light and air in. Peter studied painting at St Albans, his early work being influenced by Norman Adams, who taught there. He returned to the school in the 1960s as a fine art lecturer on the foundation course and was appointed to the arts therapy department as a full-time lecturer in 1974, rising to senior lecturer. When the art school merged with the University of Hertfordshire in 1992, Peter continued lecturing on the fine art course until his retirement in the mid-90s. Peter’s paintings were included in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition as well as other group shows. I shared a joint exhibition with him, titled Landscape and Marks, in the Margaret Harvey gallery at the college in 1981, and the following year in Cambridge. When Monika developed early Alzheimer’s disease in the late 90s, Peter’s care for her over many years was inspiring. Using his skills as a teacher he joined with her in singing and dancing groups, and encouraged her to use an instant camera, responding to moments of recognition in their home. These images became the Christmas cards they sent out. Monika died in 2017. After a period of grieving Peter began painting again. He is survived by his brother, Jack, a niece, Susan, and two nephews, Stephen and Paul.",education
"The world-renowned Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies has been accused of forcing out a bisexual employee whose lifestyle did not comply with the views of its major funders including Saudi Arabia. Dr Kevin Fogg, who is in a same-sex partnership, will give evidence to an employment tribunal on Monday that his career has been wrecked by “continuous and ongoing indirect sexual orientation discrimination” at the institution. The centre said it completely rejects Fogg’s “wild allegations”. Fogg’s claims, it said in a statement, “have no basis in fact.” It added: “Contrary to his current complaints, Dr Fogg has been treated very well by the centre.” In his witness statement, which the Guardian has seen, Fogg will claim that the centre’s director, Dr Farhan Ahmad Nizami, harboured the “long intention”of dismissing him and that he had been discriminated against on the grounds of age and sexual orientation. Fogg will tell the Tribunal on Monday: “The centre has a culture of antagonism and intolerance towards non-heterosexual lifestyles, as I came to understand through interactions over my six years of employment.” Fogg will say that the centre, which largely relies on funding from donors, imposes the conservative values of its trustees and donors on its staff. “The key donors ... include many states in which homosexuality is punishable under law, in some cases including by capital punishment under law,” Fogg will state. “Many of these states are also represented on the centre’s board of trustees, the supreme decision-making body of the centre’s governance, where they direct all decisions including oversight of personnel decisions.” Fogg describes incidents, including Nizami personally ordering books on women’s leadership in Islam, and sexuality studies in Islamic societies, be removed from display in the centre library. The centre denies the charges. In its statement, it said: “In 2018, after an extensive process of review of his work, Dr Fogg’s request for a yet further period at the centre was declined. It was only after, and it would seem as a result of, the centre turning down his request for a second extension that he has made this allegation of indirect sexual orientation discrimination.” Fogg will tell the tribunal: “The centre’s decision to dismiss me damaged my career and earning prospects irreparably [and] has had a significant and adverse impact on my mental health. In the two years since my dismissal, I have had significant trouble sleeping, difficulties with eating and episodes of depression - both because of my treatment at the hands of the centre and because of the subsequent uncertainties of extended unemployment.” Fogg, who now works as an administrator, will say: “I believe it is unlikely that I will ever in the future be employed in the field for which I trained.”",education
"MondayMy colleagues and I set foot on campus for the first time since March. We had to schedule a time to visit as it’s still too dangerous for too many people to be present. This gives us an hour to understand how things work in our “Covid-secure” campus, just days before students start returning. Most of us are pretty nervous about visiting the campus for personal reasons (children at home, ageing parents, partners who work for the NHS). Reports of the role universities are playing in new cases worry us, too. Several colleagues had something that swept through our overcrowded offices in February and early March which many of us now think was coronavirus. Members of staff and students’ families have died from the virus. We have been assured by the university’s management that all is in place for face-to-face teaching: everything deep cleaned, numerous hand sanitiser stations, social distancing in classrooms, masks required in shared areas, one-way systems. But that’s not the reality. The carpets and walls in many classrooms look dirty. Our offices are just as we left them – grotty tea cups and all. It looks like a ghost town. There are only a few hand sanitiser stations scattered throughout the building.  The shields in some classrooms look very DIY; one protective shield in a seminar room might actually be a clear shower curtain. We’re supposed to teach students whose desks are way too close to us behind a makeshift plastic sheet. In another, screens separating desks are made of some kind of painted plywood. Students sitting there wouldn’t be able to see their lecturer. The university is telling students that, although obligatory in hallways and communal areas, masks will not be required in classrooms. We’re in classrooms for hours at a time, often working at close proximity to students. The university has told us to buy our own face shields if we want them. The only thing that has been fully completed is the placement of signs everywhere declaring that the building is Covid-secure, as if saying it makes it true. Trying to figure out the route to my classrooms, I follow the new one-way system arrows only to run into a “do not enter” sign. I stare at the red circle, confused as to my next move. How will hundreds of students manage this?  TuesdayI host a Zoom Q&A for returning students. Many are deciding to stay at home and continue their classes remotely. Quite a few think cities aren’t safe, or that Britain isn’t taking this seriously enough. Some have doubts about the university’s readiness. I agree with them, but am supposed to pretend that all is well.  Most of my students are not party animals, contrary to what you see in media coverage. They are taking this seriously, and have deep concerns. In March, several of them nervously asked me to start teaching online since Covid was spreading through the halls of residence and they needed to go home to their families. As a result, I went online before the government and the university required us to do so. If the UK had locked down that same week, tens of thousands of people might not have died. The current musings from scientists about doing too little, too late this time around fill me with an eerie deja vu. Suddenly, the government has announced new precautions, including the rule of six. All of our timetables will have to change, and smaller groups will mean we have to teach the same class multiple times. No one has spoken to us about workload. Several of my colleagues are starting to have anxiety issues. Again. The semester hasn’t even started and I’m exhausted. Again. Wednesday One of my students asks if we can chat on the phone. Normally students stop seeing me in June, but not this year. We’ve been having to provide a lot more support, which we’re not trained for. All summer, students have asked me an academic question then quickly shifted to talking about their loneliness, financial worries, family dysfunction in close quarters, anxiety, depression and fears about the future. I am not a counsellor, but I do what I can. The student I’m talking to has already lost several family members to the virus. She’s calling because she can’t afford a better internet connection and computer. She’s worried that it’s affecting her studies. I tell her that she can now come to campus to use the computers. She goes silent. I ask her what’s wrong. She’s embarrassed to say that she’s afraid to come to campus, because she doesn’t want to start another Covid cycle in her family. She asks whether people will be wearing masks. I tell her that I require it in my classroom, but the university only expects it in hallways. That brings a derisive: “Hmmph”. She asks if the university will be checking temperatures when students arrive. I tell her no. She laughs and says: “Well I’ll bring my temperature gun and we’ll make a game of it.” ThursdayOur approach to freshers’ week is a mix of online and offline activities. There’s more emphasis on freshers being on campus for induction and teaching so they can have the “university experience”. My colleagues and I have noticed the management team’s obsession with this idea. They think that by offering a lot of face-to-face teaching we were able to be more competitive with universities which were more conservative about opening their campuses. Given the new government guidance, our students’ union’s freshers’ plans are cancelled. We only just averted a hundred-person BBQ with drinking games, a networking event at a popular bar venue, a foam party at a nightclub, and a karaoke night by about 24 hours. Though we all feel bad that young people don’t get to have all the fun we did at uni, my colleagues and I weren’t excited about being face-to-face with people who had attended a string of parties.  FridayOther universities have locked their students down in halls of residence, and the return of students to university areas seems to be causing outbreaks. Is anyone actually surprised? Another worrying headline: scientists think universities should only have a third of their students on campus. We have more than two-thirds of our student body returning, so we may have a lot of work to redo timetables. Today we were all supposed to attend an induction event for freshers on campus, but only half of us are here. A few of my colleagues objected, citing the government’s latest directive about doing everything you can from home. I came to avoid the inevitable hassle of getting penalised for complaining. Many of my colleagues who have raised health and safety issues have been given extra work or had their teaching preparation efforts weirdly scrutinised.  I have to take public transport at rush hour to attend. It is crowded in spite of the government’s new instructions. When I arrive, the students are bored with the endless PowerPoint presentations.At the end, I hear one saying to agreement from some others: “Glad I risked my life for that. They should have done all this online.” I see another group of students who have followed the one-way arrows and made it to the end of the hallway where I had found myself trapped on Monday. “How do we get out of here?” they shout. I am not sure how to answer.",education

"Glasgow University is to refund one month’s rent to students in halls of residence as compensation after hundreds were forced to self-isolate following an outbreak of coronavirus. Students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time, have been told they cannot visit their families, and are banned from going to pubs and restaurants over the weekend, after 124 new infections were reported at the university on Thursday. Following criticism of the lack of support given to those isolating, the university said it would refund rent, make a £50 food payment to students and initiate more drop-ins from student support staff. The number of food parcels for those self-isolating will also increase, along with cleaning materials, bedding and towels. A test centre was established at the Murano Street halls of residence, which houses more than 1,000 students. The return of students to campuses across Scotland – where the academic year starts earlier than in much of the UK – has seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, leading to the Scottish government and Universities Scotland to request students not to socialise in hospitality venues this weekend. Outbreaks have hit 23 universities across the UK, forcing thousands of students into self-isolation. In Manchester, 1,700 students are being placed in quarantine for a fortnight at halls of residence at Birley and All Saints Park, in a joint move by the local authority, the university and Public Health England. Glasgow University principal Prof Anton Muscatelli said: “I hear the concerns of our students in residences and I appreciate how difficult this situation is for them. From today, we are rolling out significant extra support measures so they can more easily access food, health and wellbeing and other supplies. “We are offering everyone in our residences, regardless of whether they are isolating or not, a one-month rent refund to compensate for the disruption they are facing, and any financial hardship they may have encountered.” He thanked those who were in self-isolation for “playing their part”, adding: “Our living support team are also stepping up efforts to proactively contact students, check on their wellbeing and offer support. “To make sure everyone has access to hot and fresh food, we will work with providers to install mobile catering units and give £50 to each student for food and supplies. This isn’t the start of academic life we would wish for anyone.” Earlier this week, some students criticised the university for bringing them back, given that so much learning has already moved online. Lucy Owens, a student living in the Murano complex and who has coronavirus, told BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “What are we paying for? I could do everything I am doing from my house, so why have they sent us here? … “Putting 2,000 students into such a confined area, something like this was bound to happen.” On Friday, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, apologised to students for the start of their academic year, but supported universities to take action against those breaking the rules “as a last resort”. The union representing academics and staff has called for face-to-face teaching at universities to be halted until the government fixes test-and-trace failures and curbs the spread of the virus.",education
"Students at Oxford University specialising in the study of China are being asked to submit some papers anonymously to protect them from the possibility of retribution under the sweeping new security law introduced three months ago in Hong Kong. The anonymity ruling is to be applied in classes, and group tutorials are to be replaced by one-to-ones. Students are also to be warned it will be viewed as a disciplinary offence if they tape classes or share them with outside groups. The Hong Kong security law was imposed on 30 June by Beijing after more than a year of pro-democracy protests, and had an immediately corrosive impact on political freedoms in the territory. Its provisions also give the Chinese government powers to arrest individuals who are not Hong Kong residents, for actions or comments made outside the territory. The powerful extraterritorial powers claimed in the law have led to fears for those studying in the UK, in particular for those with personal and family connections to Hong Kong and mainland China. Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, is to hold talks with Chinese scholars to discuss the national security law early next month. A group of academics are also expected to advance a draft code of conduct this week for how universities should deal students from authoritarian states. The number of Chinese students in UK higher education has grown by more than a third in the past four years and is now above 120,000. In 2018-19, 35% of all non-EU students were from China. Numbers are due to rise again this year, but the full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is not yet known. Overseas students are a valuable source of income for the UK university sector since they often pay two to three times as much in fees as UK students. Patricia Thornton, associate professor of Chinese politics at Oxford University, said: “The entire spirit of the tutorial, which rests on collective critical inquiry, rises or falls on the ability of the institution to guarantee free speech, freedom of expression and academic freedom for all. “But how to do this in the wake of China’s new national security law for Hong Kong, which invites self-censorship with its lack of red lines and generous extraterritorial provision? How does one protect academic freedom when China claims the right to intervene everywhere?” She said: “I have decided not to alter the content of my teaching. However, like my colleagues in the US, I am mindful of my duty of care for my students, many of whom are not UK citizens. My students will be submitting and presenting work anonymously in order to afford some extra protection.” Her students will be asked to read anonymised papers in weekly classes, and small group tutorials will be replaced by one-on-one lessons. “This means my lectures, reading lists and tutorial essay questions will remain largely the same, but the students will be asked to present the anonymised work of one of their peers in classes.” She said advice is being issued that if classes are delivered online, there must be no attempt to record the content or share the material with anyone outside the group. Claiming “we are all Hong Kongers”, she pointed out the extraterritorial provision arguably makes deportation a possibility. The decision in Oxford follows similar moves by elite US colleges. At Princeton University students in a Chinese politics class will use codes instead of names on their work, and Harvard Business School may excuse students from discussing politically sensitive topics if they are worried about the risks, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Lord Patten, the former British governor of Hong Kong and a fierce critic of the Chinese communist party, said: “Students that come from China to work in our universities come from universities where there are cameras in classes and there are paid informants and narks to tell them what is going on. We have to be very very careful that does not leak into our universities. “Hong Kong represents all those values that China is nervous about – whether it is free speech, a recognition of the universality of human rights, the determination to provide an education that is open.” Eva Pils, professor of law at King’s College London, said: “There is a great deal of concern about the new national security legislation in Hong Kong and its impact on freedom of expression. The offences newly introduced by this law are worded vaguely, leading to the fear that any criticism of the government could be treated as a criminal offence. There is also concern about the institutions set up to implement the law. There is also the risk that an individual’s case can be transferred to the mainland where the legal process is deeply flawed. “If you are a student or scholar visiting, for example, the UK from Hong Kong or planning to visit Hong Kong and you work on issues perceived as politically sensitive in Hong Kong then you have some reason to be worried that your work might get you into trouble, and that is what is happening. The effect can be stifling and oppressive, also in the classroom.” The British Association for Chinese Studies has warned universities the response to the security law “cannot be for teachers to err on the side of caution in their teaching content or for certain China-related modules to be dropped from the syllabus because they prove too challenging to deliver safely.”",education
"Teachers should not tell children that they might be a different gender based on their personality or the clothes they want to wear, new guidance from the Department for Education states. The guidance, published on Thursday, notes teachers in England must not “reinforce harmful stereotypes” and resources used to discuss topics involving gender and biological sex should be “age-appropriate and evidence based”. The guidance says: “We are aware that topics involving gender and biological sex can be complex and sensitive matters to navigate.” It follows the government’s decision to drop plans to allow people to officially change gender without a medical diagnosis, a move that was criticised by LGBT charities. The government will instead cut the cost of applying for a gender recognition certificate. Schools have also been discouraged from working with organisations that produce materials suggesting “non-conformity to gender stereotypes should be seen as synonymous with having a different gender identity”. While teachers should not suggest to children who do not comply with gender stereotypes that either their personality or their body is in need of changing, teachers should be supportive of needs of individual students, the guidance added. In a statement the charity Mermaid, which supports transgender children, said: “It isn’t for any adult to tell a child or young person what their gender identity is. In fact, all too often we see the damage done when grown ups try to force children and young people to be something they’re not.” Shereen Benjamin, a senior lecturer in primary education at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This clarification from the DfE is welcome and helpful. It is crucial that gender stereotyping is addressed in schools and discussed in age-appropriate ways with children and young people: it is also crucial that young people questioning their gender identities are supported and listened to without judgment. Suggesting to children that it is possible to be born in the wrong body is misleading, regressive and potentially very harmful, and it is good that the DfE has clarified that this should not be done.” Benjamin also welcomed the DfE’s advice that schools exercise care and caution in working with external lobby groups, and was critical of the some of the resources recommended by groups such as Stonewall. She called for Scotland to follow suit with similar guidance.  The campaign group Transgender Trend, which describes itself as a group of parents, professionals and academics, concerned about the rising number of children being diagnosed as transgender, tweeted the guidelines and said: “This is what we have been calling for. We are very glad to see this guidance issued by the Department for Education.” The organisation Safe Schools Alliance said the guidance was “vindication of years of campaigning from” from groups like theirs. Mo Wiltshire, the director of education and youth at the LGBT charity Stonewall, said: “While the introduction of statutory relationships and sex education in England’s schools is a big step forward, we’re concerned the UK government’s new guidance for the subject falls short in equipping teachers to deliver high-quality and timely LGBT-inclusive education. We’re particularly concerned by some of the confusing wording on teaching about trans identities, which only tells teachers what they shouldn’t teach about, rather than what they should.” She added: “Stonewall has always been clear that teachers shouldn’t make assumptions about whether a child is trans because they don’t conform to gender stereotypes, in the same way that we have always advised that teachers should not make assumptions about a child’s sexual orientation.”",education
"Some schools are planning to increase their class sizes to up to 60 pupils so that they can continue to offer students an education this term, as fears grow of a looming teacher shortage. Headteachers are worried that a significant number of staff will need to self-isolate for long periods this winter as they struggle to gain access to tests for Covid-19, and that schools will soon run out of money to pay for cover from supply teachers. Vic Goddard, co-principal at Passmores Academy in Harlow and star of the Channel 4 series Educating Essex, has already set up his school hall like an exam hall so that a “masterclass” of up to 60 pupils could be taught inside by one teacher plus one or two support staff, if needed. “I can’t see us getting through this half-term without there being some major doubling up or tripling up of classes,” he said. A recent survey by the National Association of Head Teachers found that 45% of schools have teachers who are currently unable to attend because they are awaiting a coronavirus test, and spokesman James Bowen warned it would not be surprising if schools suffered from “a shortage of supply teachers” as winter begins. Yet, despite the “abject failure of the testing system” and corresponding increase in staff absences, he said schools were receiving no financial support from the government to pay for the extra supply teachers they needed, leaving many schools to try to cover absences “internally”. “Many [school] budgets simply won’t stretch to meet these supply costs,” he said. Louise Atkinson, vice-president of the National Education Union, said a few schools had already had to shut because of a shortage of staff, and it was “inevitable” that more would need to close as virus cases continued to rise. “The current situation is unsustainable,” she said. Currently, around 8% of Goddard’s staff are absent from school awaiting test results, and it is taking about five days for each teacher who develops symptoms (or lives with someone else who is symptomatic) to be tested and cleared for a return. He said he “cannot afford” to bring in supply teachers and was therefore planning “contingencies on contingencies on contingencies” to keep children in school. “My worry is that staff absences are only going to accumulate,” he said. “It won’t take much – in certain subjects, it won’t take much at all – for us to have nobody within the school who can teach that subject or even cover and deliver the lessons.” One science teacher at a north London school taught back-to-back triple lessons to a class of 60 children in his school hall last week after a colleague called in sick with a temperature. “I’m fairly confident this will happen again,” he wrote on Twitter, and offered his tips to other teachers facing the same situation, such as speaking loudly from his diaphragm and using a “massive” projector screen. He expects that teaching a class that size “sadly, will have to remain an option” at his school: combining his class with his colleague’s in this way had “saved 60 kids from having to stare at a textbook for three lessons straight”. At another school, Southend High School for Boys, the headteacher, Robin Bevan, is feeling “deeply worried” about the second wave of infections. Last week, two of his teachers stayed off school to isolate. If there is an escalation in the number of positive cases, he fears “10 or more teachers” may have to self-isolate at a time. “Sustaining high-quality education at that point becomes almost impossible. Supply teachers are hard to find, and our annual budget for cover would disappear in weeks.” Last Friday, the Association of School and College Leaders warned the “catch-up funding” – given to schools to provide pupils with extra support after five months off in lockdown – would be “wiped out” by Covid safety measures and the cost of supply cover for teachers in self-isolation. “Many schools will be reliant upon supply teachers to provide cover when permanent staff have to self-isolate in line with Covid safety guidance. The biggest concern we are picking up is the costs involved, which can be very significant. We are pressing the government to reimburse these and other substantial costs incurred in implementing Covid safety measures because school budgets cannot take this hit,” said the general secretary, Geoff Barton. A spokesperson for the DfE did not comment on the prospect of class sizes of up to 60, but said that they “recognise that schools will have had to take measures to become covid-secure, as part of their hugely successful work to get the vast majority of children back to the classroom for the autumn term”.",education
"My father, Phil O’Keefe, who has died aged 71, was an academic geographer whose work over 40 years focused on people’s vulnerability to disasters and their impact on the natural world.  Among other projects, Phil undertook large-scale satellite mapping of sub-Saharan Africa, assisted in the first democratic South African elections, and led an evaluation of humanitarian assistance in Kosovo during the conflict of the late 1990s. He also wrote 30 books and more than 200 academic articles. Phil was born and grew up in North Shields, Northumberland, the oldest of five children. His mother, Joan (nee Hennessey), was a nurse and his father, Jack, a miner who later worked in customs on the Tyne. He attended Ushaw college, a seminary, from the age of 11, with the intention of becoming a priest. However, life got in the way. He studied philosophy at Durham University for a year from 1967, before transferring to Newcastle University to study geography, graduating in 1971. In 1974 he became a research fellow at Bradford University and in 1976 he co-authored an article in Nature magazine, Taking the Naturalness out of Natural Disasters, which set the context for his working life. It advocated taking into account the views and perspectives of ordinary people, especially the most vulnerable, in any discussion on sustainability, resilience and adaptation.  After leaving Bradford University in 1976 he worked as an associate professor for four years at Clark University in Massachusetts, during which time he also got a PhD from Soas University of London. Then for five years from 1980 he was a senior research fellow at the Beijer Institute at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Returning to Britain , he took up a senior lectureship at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University), where he remained until his retirement, as a professor, in 2015. There he was instrumental in creating an MSc in disaster management and sustainable development, which has now seen more than 350 students graduate. Phil lived a full life outside of academia, serving for 12 years as a Labour councillor on North Tyneside council, representing the Chirton and Camperdown wards. He was also a driving force in creating a vibrant community and live music scene around the Low Lights Tavern in North Shields. He bought an old sea captain’s house overlooking the mouth of the Tyne, and as our family home it became a place to stay for friends and family from all over the world – as well as “party central” for a growing family and their many friends. He met Di Jelley, a doctor, in Manchester in the mid-1970s and they married in 1982. Di survives him, as do their four children, Mark, Jack, Jessie and me, his sister and two brothers.",education
"Assistant headteacher, Western primary school, Grimsby At the height of the pandemic, Zane Powles was hailed as a superhero for delivering packed lunches, potatoes and tins of baked beans to all the children at his primary school who qualified for free school meals. But for him, it was simply a matter of “doing the right thing”; visiting his pupils, knowing they were “all safe” and had enough to eat also gave him the solace he often needed during lockdown. Each day, the 48-year-old got up at the crack of dawn to butter baps and pack up paper bags, before setting off on a seven mile circuit to visit 110 families, carrying approximately 50kg (110lbs) of food in rucksacks and a bin bag. In total, despite suffering from a knee injury, he walked more than 500 miles and delivered around 7,500 lunches to the children living in some of Grimsby’s toughest estates. Still, the attention he received took him by surprise – even now, he struggles to talk about it without getting upset. “When the media first got involved, and people started making nice comments, I found it overwhelming,” the former soldier says, his voice trembling with emotion. “I’d get back to school and just cry.” Children began putting up posters in their windows and chalking the walls and roads of his route, thanking him for being “a legend”. At the end of the summer term, hundreds of people lined up outside his school to applaud him as he returned from his day’s deliveries. “I went round the corner and the whole school was there. The kids had made banners and they were singing and their parents were there… and that was just the best thing ever. Oh man,” he breaks off, “I’m getting emotional again.” He was once a free-school-dinners kid himself, he confesses, and knows first hand what it means to grow up in “quite tough circumstances” on a council estate with little money. His father died when he was a baby and, he says, “lots of things happened after that which weren’t great… I think, because I’ve lived through that, I want to make the lives of our kids better than my life was.” In September, he and his pupils returned to Western primary school, where he is responsible for pastoral care and behaviour. “The head calls me ‘Captain Covid’ because I’m the one who’s put the systems in place and is making sure we’re following the guidance as closely as we can,” he says, adding that the new routines and restrictions are “challenging” and limit the educational support the school can offer, particularly to those with special educational needs. But on the plus side, now, he has a closer relationship with the parents he needs to talk to. “They call me by my first name and the connection is so much tighter. I can joke with them. They realise I am there for them, that I’ll do whatever I can to support them and their kids.” Every playtime, now, the children he helped to feed will crowd around him and try to cuddle him en masse. “They’re certainly more affectionate, even though they know they shouldn’t be, because of Covid.” He has also been honoured by his local council for his efforts supporting his community and recently gave a presentation to the taskforce that footballer Marcus Rashford set up to tackle child food poverty. But his primary focus is on the health and wellbeing of his own pupils. “Six more months of restrictions will be extremely tough on the children,” he says. “My biggest worry is their mental health. It’s already taken a battering.” As for his own mental health, he is aware he has his demons and says: “I relax by doing exercise and being active. If I hadn’t done all that walking, if I’d had to sit at home and not go out, I really would not have been able to cope.” If his school’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged pupils – “our kids” he calls them – had not needed his help, “I’d be in a bad place now. I know that.” French and year 6 teacher, Dalmarnock primary school, Glasgow When James Innes, AKA the “Joe Wicks for French”, made the decision to share videos of his French lessons online over lockdown, he had no idea that he would return to his school a YouTube sensation. Innes, formerly a general classroom teacher, has now been given the responsibility of teaching French to every pupil at his school after his entertaining homemade videos – featuring silly voices to make learning new vocabulary fun – went viral. “I knew that with schools shutting down French would be one of the subjects that would potentially be dropped by the wayside, yet French offers a lot of creative possibilities for remote teaching,” he says. “I recognised that actually it would be really easy to learn a little bit of French if there was an engaging format, with humour, which was accessible to learners of all ages.” Now that face-to-face teaching has resumed in Scotland, it mostly feels like things are back to normal at school, he says. However, it is a different situation outside of school: new restrictions preventing the mixing of households have recently been imposed in Scotland. “It’s funny… I can’t go round to anybody’s house, but I can go into many different classes at school and teach them.” He’s now using the videos he made during lockdown in his lessons as a springboard for conversations, games and activities in the classroom. “It’s wonderful to actually be able to see the kids enjoying French; when you’re teaching it online with just a camera to look at, it’s not nearly as rewarding.” He is hopeful that schools will be the last places to close if another lockdown is imposed. “It’s hugely beneficial to children’s health and wellbeing to be back.” Early years teacher, Fishergate primary school, York Sarah Wilson, a 43-year-old primary school teacher in York, is trying to run 100 marathons by the time she is 50 and has already done 34, so deciding to run 18 miles in a single day, in order to visit 66 of her pupils during lockdown, didn’t seem like a big deal to her. “I probably run about 100 miles a month normally, so an 18-mile run wasn’t a huge distance for me.” It took her about seven hours, slower than normal because of all the time she spent chatting with the nursery and reception children she visited. “They were so excited and they’d made loads of posters and banners, which was really unexpected and gave me a massive boost.” As well as supportive messages such as “Go, Mrs Wilson, go!”, a couple of kids even put declarations of love for their teacher on their posters, which, Wilson says, is “always nice”. Other children gave her gifts of little sweets to keep her going. “It brought us, as a school community, together.” Her efforts also raised more than £1,000 for national food bank charity the Trussell Trust. Now that she and her pupils have returned to Fishergate primary school in York, she is organising a run they too can take part in, inside their social bubbles. Each child will run a mile by doing “laps on the school field” and raise money for a local food bank. Despite finding it impossible to socially distance from the young children she teaches – “you do get sneezed on and licked” – she is glad to be back in the classroom and takes comfort from the extra cleaning and hand-washing routines that the school has put in place. But these extra cleaners and extra supplies cost money and another six months of Covid restrictions are going to have a big financial impact on schools. “School funding is tight. The additional costs should be funded [by the government], otherwise schools will need to make additional cuts.”",education
"Rishi Sunak made quite a splash with the suggestion that musicians should retrain. Did the chancellor really say that? It was a little bit more circuitous, but close enough to justify an outpouring of rage. The rumour is that Sunak will be the leader next time the Conservatives present themselves to the country (having first cycled through Michael Gove, after Boris Johnson decides he has had enough). Sunak and his party should reflect on the fact that his moments of modest popularity are only when he is hosing money at people like a broken cash machine. Musicians, meanwhile, were full of new career ideas: they would retrain as someone with rich parents; they would retrain as large outsourcing companies with no expertise in the arena of public health, and 10m quid would surely follow, which, hey, a few of them could share. On Tuesday, 400 of them made a heartrending point about their predicament by playing Holst’s Mars in Parliament Square. It was peerlessly beautiful. I could have cycled to see it live in 10 minutes, but, instead, I watched it on Twitter, and the realisation that I don’t deserve them made me love musicians even more. Anyway, a large number of people – perhaps they were musicians, or maybe they were benighted employees of the hospitality industry, or they could have been mischief-makers – were driven to the government’s own careers advice service. Oh, my. You thought things were bad when you were a teenager, and the careers adviser told you to become a florist or a vet. You haven’t seen anything. After a number of asinine questions, mainly roundabout ways of asking whether you are an extrovert or an introvert, your answers flash up. I have a ton of options; almost all of them involve a rapid response to something, so I definitely missed or failed honestly to answer the question: “What are you like in a rapid response situation?” I have an anti-evolutionary panic reflex that makes me close my eyes. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve been in A&E, explaining why I didn’t see whichever bone it was getting broken, because I chose that moment to block all light getting in to my face, while screaming: “No!” Training to be a paramedic would probably not be the right career choice for me, and besides, judging by the number of other people to whom it was also suggested, I think it will be somewhat oversubscribed. Apparently, I would also be perfect for the armed forces, though you have to wonder what they would want with a middle-aged pacifist. The only suggestion that wasn’t public sector was “field worker for an aid agency”, and of all the hurdles my mind instantly erected (wait, I can’t go to Haiti: I’m the only person in the house who knows which pants are whose), the most compelling was: who is going to take an aid agent from the UK? We’re hopelessly Covid-infected and on the brink of our own societal breakdown; it would be like importing sparklers to a bush fire. It is only funny when you are not looking for a job. When you are, it is insulting. One minute they are suggesting you retrain for an industry that is itself on its knees (hospitality), the next that you might be able to skill yourself up to be an engineer. The underpinning assumptions are all so wild: that you can live without an income for four years, or have enough savings for a second degree, or you can move a limitless number of miles. But underneath all these suggestions, which are so banal at the level of the individual – ah well, you’re in fashion, nobody’s buying anything; have you thought of retraining as a prison officer? – there is this generalised, catastrophic lack of seriousness. Is that the plan, for all those industries made impossible by the virus, that the people working in them just drift away and take their chances? How does that sit with a V-shaped recovery? How does it sit with an any-letter shaped recovery? Whenever a government tells you to “upskill”, it usually feels like the bit at the end of the evening, when you’ve been made redundant and your friend is trying to cheer you up with suggestions, and they are all stupid because she is drunk, but at least she means well, and you’re getting to talk about yourself. Yet right now, with this hectoring, pompous percussion, one is left with the impression of a government that sees its people as so many meat-units, who can be parcelled from one sector to another, and when that doesn’t work for some glaringly obvious reason that never occurred to ministers, oh well, what’s a free market for, if not to make everyone’s job their own responsibility? They never suggest “become an MP”, you’ll notice. It ought to be because they have concluded it is not a real job, having done it so badly. More likely, it is because they don’t want to go head to head at the next election against a musician; we would vote ourselves an orchestra.",education
"There has been a surge in the number of UK children registering for free school meals, with an estimated 1 million pupils recently signing up for the first time, according to food poverty campaigners. Analysis by the Food Foundation thinktank, released as part of footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to end child food poverty, estimates that as many as 900,000 more children have sought free school meals, on top of the 1.4 million who were already claiming, as the Covid-19 crisis plays havoc with family incomes. Campaigners urged ministers to prevent a growing food insecurity crisis for millions of children by widening eligibility for free lunches to all children up to the age of 16 whose families were claiming universal credit or other benefits. The Manchester United and England footballer Rashford, who was this weekend awarded an MBE for services to vulnerable children, said: “The numbers recorded here just reinforce the need for urgency in stabilising households … we must act now to protect the next generation and the most vulnerable across the UK.” Analysis by LGA Labour reveals that more than 450,000 pupils face spending half-term under increased lockdown restrictions but without free school meals. Most of those children are concentrated in the north of England and the Midlands. “All across the country, millions have lost their jobs or been furloughed, businesses are going under and everyone is finding things hard – eight out of 10 families feel worse off thanks to the pandemic. The economy is in dire straits and new restrictions will make it even harder to make ends meet,” LGA Labour’s deputy leader, councillor Michael Payne said. Rashford urged the government to extend its £15 a week holiday food voucher scheme for children on free school meals over half-term. The period coincides with the end of the existing job retention scheme ends, raising the prospect of a fresh wave of unemployment. In June, Rashford forced a government U-turn on the provision of food vouchers to families on low incomes over the summer holidays after he published an open letter calling on Boris Johnson to reverse plans to drop the scheme, a demand initially rejected by No 10. The Food Foundation analysis showed even where they were eligible for free school meals, many children were missing out on a hot lunch – the key meal of the day for children in poverty. This was because Covid-19 measures meant some school canteens had not yet become fully operational. Of more than 1,000 UK school-age children surveyed by the foundation in September, only 45% said their canteens were running as usual and 8% reported their canteens were closed. One in 10 said most pupils had been asked to bring a packed lunch, while 21% said canteens were only serving a small number of pupils. The deepening impact of the economic crisis was illustrated by a big increase in registrations from families that did not normally claim free school meals, typically where the main earners had been in relatively high-paying administrative and supervisory roles, the foundation added. Several local authorities and schools contacted by the Guardian confirmed there had been an increase in free school meal registrations. Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, the headteacher at Anderton Park primary in Birmingham, said the proportion of her pupils claiming free school lunches had risen from 35% to 47% in September. She said some struggling families were unable to claim free school meals because they were ineligible for social security benefits. Others had suffered big cuts in household income but would still not meet the threshold for school lunch support. “School meals are £45 a month for one child. It’s a lot of money,” she added. Eligibility for free school meals is restricted to children in households where parents claim out of work benefits, including some on universal credit. The latest official figures showed 1.4 million children in England were on free school meals in 2018-19. Blackpool council said there had been a 21% increase in free school meal registrations since March. Suffolk county council has reported a 15% rise over the same period. Hammersmith and Fulham council in London, which has been piloting universal free lunches in two of its secondary schools, also reported an increase. The Department for Education said it was anticipating a rise in free school meal registrations. The next set of official figures is not published until December. A government spokesperson said: “We have taken substantial action to make sure children and their families do not go hungry during this pandemic.” This included extending free school meals support to those eligible when schools were partially closed during lockdown, temporarily increasing universal credit by £20 a week, funding councils to provide emergency food assistance to families, and allocating £63m to councils for families in hardship. Widening access for free school meals was a key recommendation of the government-commissioned National Food Plan published in July. It said 1.5 million more seven to 16-year-olds in England in households claiming universal credit should get free school lunches, at a cost of £670m a year.",education
"University students are being recruited to mark some GCSE and A-level papers this summer, the Guardian has learned. AQA, the UK’s largest provider of academic qualifications, is inviting “postgraduates and undergraduates who have completed their first year of studies” in theology, philosophy and economics to undergo assessments in January and February, as part of a new pilot scheme. “Those who are successful will have the opportunity to join our community of examiners,” the job advertisements state. The students are being recruited “with the view to marking ... exams in the summer of 2021”. Two adverts have appeared on the King’s College London careers and vacancy website, under the headings “GCSE religious studies examiner” and “A-level economics examiner”. One says: “We are seeking theology, religion and philosophy experts to mark our GCSE exams ... If successful, you will be able to mark the Christianity paper from our GCSE [religious studies] specification.” The other advert reveals AQA is looking for “economics experts” to mark “either paper 1 or paper 2” of its A-level economics exam. All of these papers include long-form essay questions. The GCSE Christianity paper can determine half of a candidate’s religious studies GCSE grade while each A-level economics paper is usually worth a third of an A-level. “I would be concerned about the lack of experience of these young people in this marking experiment at any time,” said Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. “But this year, when our students are going to need fairness in their exams more than any other, because of the difficulties of the pandemic, I don’t think this is the right year to carry out this experiment.” He added: “We’re talking about religious studies and economics, where there could be more questions of judgment than on some other papers. It really doesn’t seem sensible.” Helen Webb, AQA’s resourcing and talent manager, said the board was doing a “very small and very controlled pilot as we look to expand our pool of expert examiners in certain subjects”. There are some subjects and topics, she said, where it is “always a challenge to recruit enough good examiners. So we have to be open-minded if we want students to get their results on time and all our marking to be high quality.” She said the pilot would “probably involve around 50 people” out of its 30,000-plus examiners. “They’ll receive training and have to pass two different tests before they’re allowed to do any real marking – and anyone allowed to mark real student answers will be constantly monitored in real time, to make sure they’re doing it well. If not, they’ll be stopped.” It is not yet clear what proportion of AQA’s 10m exam scripts the examiners in the pilot will be asked to mark. An experienced AQA economics examiner, who has been teaching economics A-level for 15 years, told the Guardian that AQA usually started off new economics markers with 100 scripts each. AQA said the focus of its pilot would be on graduates and postgraduates, but it is also “interested in assessing some undergraduates as well to see how they perform”. The exam board has used PhD and PGCE students (postgraduates who are training to be teachers) in the past and claims their marking has been “as good as that of new examiners who are qualified teachers”. Research carried out by AQA and the University of Bristol in 2010 found that overall, undergraduates could mark part-scripts as accurately – but not as consistently – as existing GCSE English examiners, although there were some undergraduates who marked as well as the best examiners. AQA revealed that “for some time now” it has been using newly qualified teachers and PGCE students as markers in some subjects. It also said university students would only be approved to mark the types of questions that they have shown they can mark well. “While the vast majority of our examiners will always be experienced teachers, that doesn’t mean that no one else can ever be suitable for the job,” said Webb. “For some types of questions in some qualifications, being good at following a mark scheme – combined with some knowledge of the subject – is enough.” Ben Wood, chair of the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education (NATRE), said he thought pupils sitting the AQA religious studies GCSE in the summer may feel “concerned” and “worried” about the idea of an undergraduate marking their Christianity papers. “You do need to know what you’re talking about to mark this. You need to know some of the intricacies of Christian theology, particularly.” He teaches the course himself and said experienced teachers who mark the paper understand how the course fits together, and how GCSE students might pull information from one area of the syllabus and use it appropriately in another area. “Being a humanity subject, it’s also not as simple as providing mark schemes and checking exam scripts against that,” he said.  Wood said the current cohort of GCSE and A-level state school students had been enormously disadvantaged by the pandemic and some had missed a huge amount of teaching time. “The thought of them potentially having somebody marking their paper who’s not well qualified to do that – it feels to me like we’re adding potentially more disadvantage on to more disadvantage. And they deserve better.” An economics A-level teacher who works as a “team lead” examiner for AQA and wished to remain anonymous, said he was worried it might be possible for wrongly marked scripts to slip through AQA’s “strict” quality control system: “There are checks in place and they are good – but you don’t check every single bit of marking.” An AQA spokesperson said this marker did not have knowledge of the pilot’s tests or monitoring processes and was jumping to the wrong conclusions. Joe Kinnaird, a religious studies GCSE teacher and AQA examiner, said even if university students passed all of AQA’s standardisation and quality control tests, he does not think they will be capable of marking exams well. “Ultimately, I think you have to be a classroom teacher. It actually undermines the teaching profession to assume that people who are not qualified teachers are able to mark exam papers.” Sarah Hannafin, a policy adviser at the National Association of Head Teachers, said when young people took an exam, their expectation was that markers were “experienced, serious teachers”.  With confidence already “quite rocky”, due to what happened with the exams last summer, she thinks it is vital young people and their parents feel they can rely on the exam-marking process. “I’d go so far as to say I think it would be a mistake for them [AQA] to go ahead with it.” Ofqual, the exams regulator, said exam boards must ensure markers were competent. “What matters most is that markers are conscientious and follow the exam board’s mark schemes,” a spokesperson said. “Students can ask for the marking of their paper to be reviewed if they believe an error has been made.” In response to the criticisms, a spokesperson for AQA said the pilot would in no way disadvantage this year’s students or affect the accuracy of their results.",education
"Headteachers are calling for the government to allow secondary schools to move all teaching online for pupils undergoing mass coronavirus testing in London, Kent and Essex. The National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) and the Association of College Leaders have written a joint letter to education minister Gavin Williamson, urging him to shut the doors of secondary schools and colleges whose pupils are being tested this week and to roll out the mass testing of students to other high infection areas in England. The unions say the move would reduce the danger of infection transmission by these pupils in classrooms and on public transport, while avoiding a logistical nightmare for teachers and further disruption to children’s education. “We can’t simply ask already overburdened school staff to administer these tests, because it will just stop the education effort in schools,” said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman. The Observer also understands that the government is considering mass testing of primary school children. The Department for Education said it would not be commenting on this matter: “It hasn’t been confirmed and therefore is speculation.” Last week, the government began using its emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act to threaten legal action against headteachers in England who wanted to switch to remote learning this week. Any schools that were planning to move most of their teaching online during the last week of term, to ensure none of their pupils would have to self-isolate on Christmas Day, are being ordered to remain open. One headteacher in Hertfordshire was sent an official letter from the schools minister, Nick Gibb, warning him that the government was prepared to deploy its new powers under the act to ensure his secondary school remained open for all pupils until Friday. The school, Presdales in Ware, was planning to teach the majority of its pupils remotely for the last week of term, while continuing to provide socially distanced, face-to-face lessons for vulnerable pupils and any other students who wished to come into school. Only about 25 pupils were expected to come in, so they could all sit two metres apart in class. “We’ve had nearly 50 [positive] cases since September and a significant outbreak in one year group,” said the headteacher, Matthew Warren. “There is no chance, in the last week of term, that we’re not going to have any cases.” On Tuesday last week, 170 staff and children – including half the English department – were off school, self isolating. Warren said teachers are now “dreading” having to call parents, particularly of younger pupils, to tell them their child would have to avoid all contact with anybody else on Christmas Day. Warren had been keen to ensure his pupils did not have to endure this separation during the festive season. “For mental health, hearts and minds, we felt it wasn’t fair – and parents supported us overwhelmingly.” Last Wednesday, the day before the school planned to close, Gibb wrote a letter to Warren, stating he was “minded to direct” the board of trustees to keep the school gates open and had the power to do this under schedule 17 of the Coronavirus Act. Refusal to comply would have allowed the Department for Education to first direct the board of trustees and then seek an injunction requiring the school to provide face-to-face lessons, according to Warren’s legal advice. “We can’t defend that – it’s not a good use of public funds, which we’re desperate for,” he said. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full time and it was vital children remained in school until the end of term.",education
"As the Christmas holidays approach, many schools are grappling with low attendance rates and staff shortages as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

"Mass Covid-19 testing should be implemented in schools across England, teachers’ leaders have said, amid fury in the north at the speed at which testing has been rolled out in new hotspots in London and the south-east. Testing should also be extended to primaries, according to the largest education union, which along with others is calling for the closure of schools and a switch to remote learning before the Christmas break. “We predict that when this testing happens many children will have to be sent home on public health advice. This will lead in practice to a chaotic closure in the last week of term,” said Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union. He said new Office for National Statistics figures showing coronavirus cases were rising again in secondary and primary schools “should be very worrying to the government – especially in the run-up to Christmas”. Secondary school children in years 7 to 11 have the highest rate of any of the demographic groups, with more than 2% having the virus. Questions are also being asked about the selection criteria for hotspots where mobile testing is being carried out in secondary schools and among college students in parts of north-east London, Essex and Kent after a list of the areas was published on Friday by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Schools hardest hit by infections included the Norton Knatchbull School in Ashford, where all its pupils began studying at home from Friday until the end of term on 18 December because of absences among staff. Only the children of key workers and vulnerable children were to come in. Eight out of nine secondary schools in Basildon were also expected to close on Friday night, a week earlier than due, Essex county council’s cabinet member for health told the BBC. But some boroughs with higher numbers of cases are not listed in the rollout and there was particular anger in the north of England, which has been left to cope without similar mass testing despite rates that got so high that as many as a quarter of all children in Hull were off school last month. The Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Jonathan Reynolds, said schools in his area were “livid” and he expected a bid for testing to be successful. Kate Hollern, the Labour MP for Blackburn, said it was “utter rubbish” for the government to suggest that testing was available to schools outside London and the south-west. In response to the DHSC claim that tier 3 local authorities can apply for tests, Hollern tweeted: Jo Platt, the former MP for Leigh in Greater Manchester, also in tier 3 tweeted: Henri Murison, the director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership thinktank, said “northern schools have faced the brunt of Covid-19 infections in recent months” but noted only Liverpool has benefited from an extensive programme of mass testing for secondary schools. He expected mass testing to be offered in the north in areas of high infection. Asked by the Guardian why schools in the north of England were not offered mass testing last month, the DHSC appeared to confirm that while schools in London – currently in tier 2 – and the south-east were being offered tests automatically, tier 3 schools in the north and elsewhere had to apply. A spokesperson said: “The evidence shows us there is a clear rise in cases in secondary school age children in these areas and we must act to target these rates – about one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and will be spreading it without realising it.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), also questioned why the government had not chosen to end in-person teaching on the last week of term. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said on Friday the plans to mass test secondary school and college students had the objective of keeping them in education and ensuring schools were safe. “As a government we are doing everything we can first of all to prioritise kids remaining in schools, and the vast majority of children remain in schools,” he told BBC Breakfast. In Wales, secondary schools and colleges will move to online learning from Monday following advice from the Welsh chief medical officer that the public health situation in the country was “deteriorating”.",education
"The disruption caused by the coronavirus allows for a “radical” rethink of England’s school system, according to a group of Conservative MPs who advocate scrapping GCSEs, delaying the start of formal education and introducing longer school days. A paper from the One Nation caucus of centrist Conservative MPs is the latest assault on GCSEs, arguing that England is unusual in making teenagers sit two sets of high-stakes exams within the space of three years, and that this is partly responsible for high levels of stress and unhappiness among pupils. Flick Drummond, the MP for Meon Valley and one of the authors of the report, said: “It seemed to us that the Covid outbreak was a good opportunity to take another look at the education system and see what we could do differently, and do something radical.” Drummond said that sitting GCSEs at the age of 16 no longer made sense. “Now that children stay at school until the age of 18, why on earth should they take these exams at 16?” The paper argues that preparation for GCSE exams means that pupils miss a large chunk of valuable learning because of the time taken up with mock exams and revision, followed by the exams themselves. “That’s almost six months out of a whole year spent preparing for exams,” said Drummond. She said she was particularly concerned by the impact of exams on mental health, citing a report backed by the Children’s Society in August that ranked England 36th out of 45 countries in Europe and North America for wellbeing. Instead, the new report says, the exams should be replaced by a baccalaureate, which would cover several years’ study and would allow children more time from the age of 15 to settle on the subjects they wanted to study in the sixth form for A-levels or vocational qualifications such as T-levels and apprenticeships, and to explore potential careers in a structured way. GCSEs have also come under attack from a coalition of state and independent school leaders, who are launching a group called Rethinking Assessments to campaign for alternatives. The One Nation group is said to be supported by about 100 Conservative MPs, more than a third of the parliamentary party, and is chaired by the former Cabinet Office minister Damien Green. Drummond said she wanted to bring the issues in the paper to the attention of her colleagues in government. “I’m hoping that it will be taken seriously and discussed. Particularly in the light of Covid, we’ve got an opportunity to look at other countries and ask if what we are doing is working for us and for young people.” Drummond also says that the school timetable should be revisited to bring it into line with modern life, including a change to the way holidays are distributed, and lengthening the school day to 5pm to allow children to do more extracurricular activities or receive further support. “It could mean that disadvantaged children could get more of the same enrichment opportunities as those from better-off homes. Often now schools finish at 3pm or 3.30pm and then what can they do?” Drummond said. The report’s other recommendations include a delay in the age for compulsory schooling, to age six, which is more in line with other European countries. In the paper’s section on early years education, Cherilyn Mackrory, the MP for Truro and Falmouth, says there should be targeted help for families with young children. The paper also says that because many children are not “school-ready” at age four, when reception classes open, delaying the start of formal schooling would be appropriate.",education
"Parents are suffering “sleepless nights” trying to choose secondary schools for their children without setting foot in buildings or meeting teachers face to face. Following new government guidance that now recommends schools consider alternatives to face-to-face open events, many schools are only offering online talks and virtual school tours to parents, who must get their school place applications in by the end of this month. In a bid to woo parents and simultaneously outshine other local schools, some state schools have spent more than £5,000 on professionally made promotional videos this term. These often include drone footage of their grounds and story-boarded, scripted interactions between pupils. Others, with smaller budgets, are relying on films made by students and a pre-recorded presentation from the headteacher. But some heads are still allowing parents to tour the school building – usually when it is empty – in small, socially distanced groups, gaining an edge over the local competition. The new government guidance, issued to the National Association of Head Teachers after heads begged for clarity, does allow this, subject to “risk assessments” and “control measures” being put in place. “Schools are not on an even playing field any more – they’re all doing something different,” said Rachael Dines, whose 11-year-old son Kaden will start secondary school next year. He is trying to decide between four state schools near their home town of Worthing, West Sussex. So far they have only been allowed to visit one school in person, on a 45-minute “express”, masked tour. “We were in very small groups of six and there were no students present.” She struggles to compare this experience with the online tours and promotional videos put forward by other schools on her shortlist. “Videos can be edited: if there was something they didn’t want to show us, they wouldn’t put that in the video.” Ideally, she wants her son, who loves art, to be able to see the artwork produced by students at each school and imagine himself as a new starter inside the school building. Having been on one tour, she says, “I think all schools could have managed a tour of some kind, with careful restrictions in place.”  In Bexley, south-east London, Michelle Jackson is having sleepless nights trying to weigh up the pros and cons of nine state secondary schools for her 10-year-old daughter Annalie solely using online films and web talks. “Schools are doing their best – and it’s a really difficult time for them,” she says. “But as lovely as the videos are, it’s not the same as walking around a school. You can’t get a feel for it. You can’t get a sense of what the children and the building are like.” While some videos are “snazzy”, “professional” and have “very nicely edited footage”, others look as if they were shot on a mobile phone. “I’m more interested in what they’re saying. But if it does look more polished, I suppose it does give a better impression of the school.” At MCN Productions, which makes promotional videos for state schools, “demand has gone through the roof” since the end of last term. “We must have done 15 schools since then,” said director Mike Carter, adding that schools typically spend up to £5,000 or “even more” to get a high-quality “open day” video. “Schools [are] quite prepared to spend that amount if they feel they’re getting what they need.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Schools should consider how best to run events, such as parents’ evenings and open days, based on their own risk assessment and the system of controls they have in place. Schools have the flexibility to offer alternative options to face-to-face meetings, such as virtual events.”",education
"The Department for Education broke the law in its mishandling of the national database containing details of every school pupil in England, the Information Commissioner’s Office has concluded in a highly critical report. The report marks the second time in less than a year that the DfE has been publicly rebuked by the privacy watchdog for failing to adhere to data protection laws. After an investigation triggered by complaints from groups including Liberty, the ICO found that the DfE had failed to comply with sections of the general data protection regulation (GDPR). It said there was “no clear picture of what data is held by the DfE” and that its handling of millions of pupil records “could result in multiple data breaches”. “The audit found that data protection was not being prioritised and this had severely impacted the DfE’s ability to comply with the UK’s data protection laws,” the ICO said. The audit lists more than 130 recommendations for the DfE to improve its data safeguarding, with 32 classed as urgent and 57 as high priority by the watchdog. Sam Grant, the policy and campaigns manager of Liberty, said: “This report displays a shocking failure of privacy protections, which is dangerous for our rights. “The type of data collected by the DfE can reveal a huge amount of sensitive personal information about us, and often about children and young people. The government has routinely misused this data to enforce cruel and oppressive policies like the hostile environment. This cavalier attitude to our personal information puts people, including the most marginalised, at risk.” According to the ICO, the DfE had “no formal proactive oversight of any function of information governance, including data protection, records management, risk management, data sharing and information security” at the time of the audit in February. Access to the national pupil database (NPD) has become highly controversial after it was revealed that in 2015 the department agreed to share details with the Home Office to “create a hostile environment for those who seek to benefit from the abuse of immigration control”. In November 2019 the ICO also criticised the DfE for sharing children’s personal data with the Home Office and for failing to properly comply with data protection laws. In its latest report the ICO found that only 12 out of 400 applications for access to the NPD had been turned down, “due to an approach which is designed to find a legal gateway to ‘fit’ the application rather than an assessment of the application against a set of robust measures”, it stated. The report also criticises the DfE for blurred lines of responsibility and poor internal decisionmaking, noting that there was “some confusion” over roles within the DfE and its agencies. In response, the DfE said it accepted the ICO’s recommendations in full. “Since the ICO completed its audit, we’ve taken a number of steps to address the findings and recommendations, including a review of all processes for the use of personal data and significantly increasing the number of staff dedicated to the effective management of it,” a DfE spokesperson said. “As well as welcoming these moves, the ICO has recognised the stringent processes we have in place to make sure children and young people’s personal data is secure.” The ICO noted that the DfE “showed a willingness to learn from and address the issues identified”. But it warned that it would take further action if the DfE failed to make changes.",education

"Oxford University student Ellie Cassidy will never forget how unprepared and ill at ease she felt before her interview to study geography at Oxford two years ago. “I was terrified. I remember walking in, my heart racing, thinking in my head: turn it off, turn it off. I thought that I had to turn off my scouse accent, or they wouldn’t be able to understand me.” She was conscious that no one from her Liverpool state school had managed to get into Oxbridge for years. “My school really wanted to help me. They tried their best, but they had no clue about how I should write my personal statement or how the interview worked.” As a result, she was left to face the intimidating selection process alone, struggling with impostor syndrome. “There was nothing out there that supported me. I couldn’t find any information about the sort of questions I’d be asked or the structure of the interview, or even help around the personal statement.” Now, Cassidy is on a mission to demystify the Oxbridge application process for other students who, like her, have little or no support from their state schools. Like more than 2,000 other Oxford and Cambridge undergraduates, she is freely sharing her “insider” knowledge about how to get into Oxbridge online, via a new student-led project called InsideUni. “There’s so much mythology that surrounds the interview process. Unless you’ve someone on the inside tell you what it’s really like, you’ve got all these ideas that are very off-putting and can make you very nervous,” says the project’s founder Tommy Gale, who recently graduated from Cambridge. He started InsideUni two years ago after realising many of the private school students he met at Cambridge were “not even that clever”, but had received help with the application process from teachers, family contacts and peers. Meanwhile, more capable state school students he knew either failed to get in or were put off applying. “When I saw the massively different levels of preparation people had, it just felt really unfair.” With help from nearly 2,000 Oxbridge student contributors, InsideUni has created free, detailed online guides offering insider tips about each Oxbridge course and how to successfully apply. It also hosts Q&A virtual events which shed light on life at Oxbridge and the application process, with applicants who have a disability, or are from a BAME or low-income background, offered extra support. Most importantly, the website has published students’ real-life accounts of their admissions interviews at the different colleges and for each subject. This includes not only the kinds of questions they were asked by interviewers and the students’ good and bad responses, but also how they prepared and what they wish they had known beforehand. All the content published meets editorial guidelines developed with Oxbridge admissions tutors. Along with students who went to state schools, many former private school pupils have contributed to the project, Gale says. “It’s nice because we want to know what they’re being told – and they are sharing their knowledge with people who can’t afford to pay for it.” He and Cassidy think the need for digital outreach programmes like Inside Uni has grown during the pandemic, as the advantages of attending a private school became more stark, with pupils benefiting from more online schooling compared to their peers at state schools. Their views are shared by the founder of another free, student-led access programme, Team Upside, which also moved online during the pandemic. Sulaiman Iqbal, a Cambridge University student who grew up on a west London council estate, set up Team Upside just over a year ago to help get people from disadvantaged backgrounds into Oxbridge and other Russell Group universities. “Growing up, I saw so many young people with enormous amounts of potential and talent – but a lot of them were unable to realise that, because they lacked opportunities and guidance.” Currently, any young person who contacts the organisation’s helpdesk with an education or career-related question will receive free, one-to-one advice from members of the team, who are all from BAME backgrounds and attend top Russell Group universities. They also receive a weekly newsletter with useful educational resources and a video interview series that reveals how students from BAME or disadvantaged backgrounds at top universities wrote their personal statements. “We want to provide nuance to what an Oxbridge student looks like, and where they come from. I think honest, transparent representation is key to demystifying people’s perceptions of Oxbridge and other spaces that are quite privileged and seem somewhat exclusive to a lot of people,” Iqbal says. With the help of Int2_Law, a social initiative run by law students at Cambridge and the London School of Economics, Team Upside is running an Oxbridge mock interview day later this month for state school pupils with interviews coming up.  Like Gale and Cassidy, Iqbal does not think there is anything inherently wrong with the Oxbridge admissions process, including the interview. “Although it can be nerve-racking and involve a lot of stress, the benefit of the interview is that it provides the university with the opportunity to have a conversation with the candidate and contextualise their grades. It’s important for fellows to realise when a student has to overcome a lot of challenges and barriers to get where they are today,.” However, he thinks Oxbridge should offer its own mock interviews to state students, particularly from less privileged backgrounds, rather than relying on organisations like Team Upside. “We think it’s unfair that some students who go to really top schools are provided with so much more support and guidance than other students, when every student deserves an equal opportunity to succeed. It’s really just about levelling the playing field.” UniRiseOffers a free online course on how to write the “perfect” personal statement, based on advice from 20 Russell Group admissions stutors.

"Concerns have been raised about government plans for mass Covid-19 testing of students before Christmas, with agreement yet to be reached with universities and one warning it would be impossible to test every student. With the clock ticking down to a designated six-day “travel window” which students will be asked to use, ongoing talks between civil servants and vice-chancellors are trying to hammer out issues such as whether independent testing already in place at universities can be aligned with the plan. The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, also sought to downplay concerns raised by experts about the reliability of the plan’s self-administered lateral flow tests (LFT), and the short period of time in which testing will take place. Her department is still unable to provide the number of tests that will be available but said it is expected that they will be available for those who want one. Details also emerged of how Wales and Scotland might fit into plans announced in London on Tuesday by the Department for Education for a mass exodus to take place, on staggered departure dates set by universities, from 3 December to 9 December after England’s four-week lockdown. The Scottish government’s higher education minister, Richard Lochhead, told the Holyrood parliament on Wednesday that students would be offered two rapid tests, five days apart, with those testing negative on both occasions able to travel home. Those who test positive will have a more sensitive ‘PCR’ test, used in the main coronavirus testing programme, to confirm the result. Student infection rates were declining, said Lochhead, and in the last week students contributed to only 2% of the national total. The Welsh education minister emphasised that university students would not be forced to take new rapid coronavirus tests before returning home for Christmas but would be offered the chance to “make a positive choice” in taking up the offer of a test 24 hours before they plan to leave towns and cities. Swansea University, which will end in-person teaching on 4 December, said it hoped to take part and had been told tests would be ready to use as early as 30 November. But Andrew Rhodes, chief operating officer, warned it would be “impossible” to test every student. He said students would have to be tested twice with a three-day gap between the first and second test and “in practice, it would be impossible to test all students before they travel home given the very tight timescales”. Among others seeking clarity from the government were the National Union of Students, which sought assurances on support for students remaining on campus, and Unison, which called for details of how staff would be trained to carry out the tests. “The whole testing process must be risk-assessed and properly supervised if it’s to be effective,” said Unison senior national education officer, Ruth Levin. “Many students will need repeat testing if their results are inconclusive. Sufficient funding must be in place for universities so this programme can be carried out safely.” Caution was also advised by experts about the potential reach of LFTs. The self-administered tests, which can deliver a result in as little as 30 minutes, are rapid but do not necessarily detect as many infected people as the PCR testing used at NHS sites, warned Dr Ellen Brooks Pollock, a lecturer in infectious disease modelling at the University of Bristol, who has led research into Covid-19 among students. “We saw high rates of infection in university students at the beginning of term and that number has fallen but we can’t really disentangle testing behaviour with true infection rate,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It’s because the majority of students don’t have the typical Covid symptoms so there could potentially be high rates of undisclosed infections, which obviously poses a risk to their parents and grandparents but also to seeding infections in new areas.” Prof Jacqui Ramagge, an executive dean for science at Durham University who has been overseeing a pilot project there for rapid Covid-19 testing, added that the danger of failing to pick up students who could become infectious later could be mitigated by taking a number of tests over a few days. However, Donelan said the lateral flow rapid test was “highly reliable”.  The plan envisages a week of testing between 30 November and 6 December, ending a few days after the lockdown in England is due to finish. Donelan confirmed that students would be going back to campus after Christmas. Talks around each part of the UK are continuing between government officials and universities, which have been seeking assurances on funding and protections from being sued before committing to the plans. Donelan added: “Our target will be for those universities that have had higher infection rates or areas that have higher R rates, also areas that have higher percentages of more vulnerable [people] such as BAME, but fundamental to this plan is that the four weeks of national restrictions mean that the risk these students pose is now much reduced, so that unlocks the opportunity to then go home and feel a lot safer in doing so.”",education
"For Jen Smith, the autumn term started, as always, with the prospect of managing the delicate process of her children’s school attendance. Both autistic, they were in mainstream classes until two years ago; now in specialist provision, they still faced deep-seated anxiety about school. “My son’s anxiety began when he needed a disabled toilet key at school, but in the time it took to get one he felt he couldn’t go to the toilet and that is when the anxiety started building,” she says. There were screaming and meltdowns on the way to school, she says, then more on the way home after he felt ashamed that he had been unable go in. “I was trying every which way to help, then realised I had to stop coercing because it was damaging him,” she says. “But you are left in an empty place. I felt I could drop dead of stress at one point just because I couldn’t resolve the situation.” Smith is one of thousands of parents of “school refusers”, children with mental health barriers about attending school. Their difficulties are compounded by Ofsted rules requiring schools to meet certain attendance levels to be rated “good” or “outstanding”, with parents threatened with fines and prosecutions if their children don’t attend. The most recent government figures suggest that there are about 770,000 persistent absentees in England. In 2018-19, 60,000 of these young people were missing more than half their schooling, up from 39,000 three years earlier. Typically, this type of anxiety starts around transition to secondary school, but for some children it is in primary school. One parent, Anna Allen, from Essex, said her 10-year-old son’s problems began when he was moved into a different class from his friends, and he started talking about the pressure of schoolwork and not feeling safe in class. With the school, she is now helping him manage a more flexible day, with the option to stay at home if his anxiety is too great. “When his anxiety is really bad, he will wake up in the morning, go into a panic attack and start retching and hyperventilating. Since we have changed our approach, allowing him to not even think about going into school when he feels like that, things have improved,” she says. “But it teeters on a knife-edge. It only needs one adult to make him feel pressured and it will tip back other way. Initially, the school deflected responsibility and implied poor parenting, but they are now listening and understand this anxiety is real.”  Allen is taking a year’s leave from her job as a speech and language therapist to support her son’s education at home if necessary, but says loss of learning takes second place to his wellbeing. “He will not learn unless his mind is happy and relaxed. I am speaking out because I want to represent more than our family, and to make the education system more understanding rather than a machine that treats children as numbers instead of human beings.” Smith and Allen are involved with two lobbying and support groups, Square Peg, which advocates for children who don’t fit in to the conventional schooling model, and Not Fine in School, which has a closed Facebook group of 13,000 parents. Campaigners believe their numbers are growing because of increased pressure on school performance and cuts to support services. Ellie Costello is one of those finding it difficult to access these services for her child. “My son’s reports always said he was a good, polite boy. He was compliant in school and struggling with underlying undiagnosed chronic illness,” she says. “In the end, because he was challenged and pushed so much to attend, his mental health crashed. “If he were an adult, it would be categorised as a nervous breakdown. The pressure on all of us has been unbelievable. Between concern for my son’s wellbeing, the pressure on our marriage, the school sending threatening letters and apologising for doing it, I would go home and fall on my knees through the stress and the shame I was failing him as a parent. “We were clinging on the cliff edge for so long. At the point I let go and said I won’t force him into school, the systems finally got going and we started to access some help. When your child is in a state of emotional collapse, is so traumatised due to their needs being unrecognised, you are so far away from that child being able to learn, nothing else matters. You don’t give an iota about missing learning.” And the Covid pandemic may have raised the stakes even further. Since most schools reopened fully in September, attendance has become a proxy for the success of what the prime minister, Boris Johnson, calls the nation’s moral duty to get children back into the classroom, with government guidance urging prosecution of parents whose children don’t attend. A new report from Ofsted last week showed that, in half the schools inspectors visited, some children had been removed altogether because of fears about the virus. Not Fine in School has had nearly 1,000 new members join since the start of term, 687 in September alone. The campaigners believe that urging the prosecution of parents whose children are persistently absent could be counterproductive. They say the first lockdown provided respite for children such as theirs, giving them the opportunity to work from home without fear of their parents being prosecuted. Polly Sweeney, who has been working with parents on a legal challenge to the existing categorisation of absent children, said: “At the moment our attendance code is either authorised or unauthorised. If unauthorised, my experience is that parents are punished with no proper analysis of the underlying reasons, and children may spend significant periods out of school without alternative education provision being arranged.” One possible solution, she says, could be a special attendance code, which would bring support rather than punishment, for children with recognised mental or emotional barriers to school attendance. “It is a concern that parents may be off-rolling children right now because they don’t want to face punishments, but are not receiving the support needed. That is a very vulnerable group of children. Home schooling works well for many children, but there may be other families who need the ongoing support of statutory services. Covid is really shining a light on these issues and offering an opportunity to question whether the system is working.” Friday, 20 November, is Unicef World Children’s Day, and Square Peg will be launching a new collaboration with School Differently, another campaigning organisation. According to Fran Morgan, founder of Square Peg, one objective will be to find examples of good practice that may help school leaders manage attendance policy more compassionately. But might recent Covid-related advances in digital education point to a new way forward? Ofsted noted last week that Covid absences were obliging schools to continue developing remote learning. Karine George is a former headteacher, supporter of Square Peg, and consultant at Educate, based at University College London, which is looking at new ways of using technology in schools. She says: “Headteachers are under huge pressure from competing demands. Time needed to build relationships with parents and children has been eroded. Even if you know there is a problem and a child can’t come into school, you have your attendance target to meet. “Covid has taught us that education can happen in a multitude of ways. For some people, going to school is really useful. But others can learn better without the school environment. We should not waste this crisis, but instead think more about all the educational mechanisms through which we can meet all children’s needs for their learning and their socialising.”",education
"The Guardian spoke to four university students about the impact the pandemic has had on their mental health. Bella Brown, 20, a first year history of art student at UCL, has struggled with mental health problems including anxiety and depression for many years, but said the pandemic had exacerbated these. “When I moved to London, it was really hard to meet new people,” she said. “My housemates have been going into university three days a week, but I only have an hour-and-a-half in person, so I was just so lonely.” This was made worse when she was forced to self-isolate after testing positive for coronavirus last week. However, after reaching out to university support services, she is now due to begin wellbeing workshops. Brown said she found the shift to remote learning “overwhelming”. “I enrolled late, and got missed off the Microsoft Teams group for one of my classes,” she said. “When I asked about it, my department told me I’d missed eight weeks of classes and threatened to make me drop the module, but it was totally a miscommunication.” Nirmal Sunny, 20, an international student from India, is in his second year of a computer science degree at the University of Bedfordshire and feeling stressed after he was erroneously sanctioned for not paying his fees, a month before they were due. “The sanction came out of the blue, but at the time one of my units disappeared. I have lost access to classes and lectures and am supposed to submit an assignment in two days. I can no longer access the online portal. I’ve been emailing everyone I know at the university for two weeks, but nobody is responding – I just get out of office emails.” Sunny fears that he will have to repeat the year. He was going to see his family in southern India in August, but called the trip off because of the pandemic and will spend the Christmas holiday in his flat. “I don’t know who to contact. All my friends are taking different units this year, and I haven’t been on campus in eight months or so. If people are ill with coronavirus and on leave, surely somebody needs to cover for them? I’m confused and worried. I feel the university is being very irresponsible. I’m going to pay my fees, but I don’t feel valued here.” Regan, a 22-year-old student at a university in the Midlands, said she had found it difficult to cope with stress and anxiety during the pandemic. “Having no social interaction because of lockdown has made me more scared to go out and has worsened my anxiety,” she said. “I had become a more confident person at uni, but this year I’ve gone straight back to how I was before.” Regan also said that while many of her teachers had been “lovely”, others didn’t seem to understand the strain on students’ mental health. “I think sometimes they forget we’re human and also struggling,” she said. When she tried to access university counselling services online, the slots were booked up until October 2021. After sending a series of emails, she managed to get an appointment, but worries others wouldn’t be so proactive and would lose out. “The workload is extremely stressful, and moving to a new place is intimidating,” she said. “To have university all online makes it even harder.” Lakshya Jain, 21, is a final year maths student at the University of Edinburgh and concerned that she might infect family when she returns home. “I was tested on 7 December and it came back negative, but I still may get Covid in the next 14 days before I go home, where I live with my 76-year-old grandma and my dad who has been shielding since March. There is no point in the university offering a test so far away from people’s departure date. I don’t know anybody leaving before 18 December – a lot can change in two weeks.” Jain is also worried about the reliability of the tests. “These are lateral flow rapid tests where you get the results in 30 mins, and the university has said that anyone who tests positive needs to go get a proper test in an NHS test centre, so you wonder whether these are any good.” Despite her concerns, she feels she has no other option but to take the risk of travelling home. “For my mental health and wellbeing I think staying in Edinburgh is not a good idea either. I love my university, but they underestimated how isolated students would be. I just need a break from Edinburgh and from being an adult.”",education
"Some teachers are being told to disable the government’s Covid test-and-trace system while in school and to disregard notifications in order to reduce the number of staff required to self-isolate, a union has claimed. The NASUWT said it had received numerous reports from concerned teachers across England, including one case where the instruction was based on advice provided by the local public health team. There continues to be widespread disruption in classrooms, with staff shortages forcing some schools forced to close as pupils and teachers test positive for Covid and many others have to self-isolate after coming into contact with them. The NASUWT’s general secretary, Dr Patrick Roach, has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, expressing his concern about any instructions to teachers to pause the app, warning that it could lead to increased transmission of the virus. He has called on the government to issue immediate clarification to all schools and public health teams. Under current government guidance, staff are told they can pause the app when their phone is in a locker, when they are fully protected behind Perspex or are wearing medical-grade PPE. The NASUWT claims heads are asking staff to disable the app the whole time they are in school. One email from a public health official at Wirral council said: “Given that we now have a well-established local system for contact-tracing of school-notified cases, we are recommending that you advise any staff/pupils that have downloaded the NHS Covid-19 app to pause the contact-tracing function of that app while they are on the school premises.” It has previously been reported that teachers in Aberdeen were told to switch off the contact-tracing function while in schools. A letter seen by BBC Scotland asked staff to switch off the software, saying the app did not take into account mitigations that were in place. Roach said: “The government rightly states that the NHS test-and-trace app is a key part of the UK’s Covid-19 response. Instructions for the use of the app clearly state it should switched on at all times in schools unless the phone is in a locker. “It beggars belief that some schools are disregarding such clear instructions and it is deeply worrying that local public health teams appear to be giving similar advice. Even more concerning is that some teachers are being told to disregard app notifications to self-isolate, apparently in order to reduce the numbers of staff and pupils self-isolating. “Schools and authorities overriding advice are putting at risk the safety and the lives of teachers and pupils and risking much larger outbreaks. Ministers must act swiftly and with clarity to ensure that schools are following the correct guidance at all times and teachers have the app switched on in schools.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment. A Wirral council spokesperson said: “The advice given was based on a well-established national approach to minimising the potential for false notifications of close contact with a case. Wirral schools have a very effective local process for contact-tracing when cases are notified on their premises and the advice issued to headteachers clearly states that the contact-tracing toggle on the app should be turned back on as soon as they leave the school setting.” Meanwhile, local authorities are concerned that the pandemic is fuelling a rise in the number of parents choosing to take their child out of school to home-educate. According to the Local Government Association (LGA), there have been increases of up to 200% in the number of home-education registrations in some areas this term, compared with last year. The increase is thought to be linked to health fears and increasing numbers of pupils having to stay out of school and self-isolate. The LGA has called on the government to introduce its proposed new duty on councils to maintain a register of children not in school, and a new duty on parents to provide information if their child is not attending a mainstream school. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The NHS Covid-19 app is a key tool in our pandemic response, working to break the chain of transmission as quickly as possible to stop the spread of the virus and protect our loved ones. It’s crucial that people self-isolate when instructed to do so by the app.   “The more people who download it, the better it works and we encourage people to keep the contact tracing functionality switched on for as much of the time as possible.”",education
"When Shabaaz arrived in the UK from Afghanistan he was 13; a child in a strange country. “I was alone and I had no one to help me,” he says. Despite that, he had high hopes: he dreamed of going to university to study business. But there was a problem: social workers who assessed Shabaaz – not his real name – decided he was 16. And that, they said, meant he was too old to go to school and to study for GCSEs. “I was asking them to put me in a college or something like that, but they were saying they needed to sort out my age first,” he says. “They didn’t give me any education.” Five years on, the local authority has accepted he was much younger than it thought, and has granted him financial support as a care-leaver. He has had some tuition at college, but at 19 is too old to go to school, making university a distant dream. He takes part in sport – he enjoys boxing – but he needs to improve his maths and English, and his options are limited. “I talked to my tutor. He said, you have to have GCSEs and you are already 19, so who’s going to pay for you?’ I’m really stuck now,” he says. Charities and lawyers say the situation is not uncommon. Government guidance published last year says young people should be treated as the age they claim they are until any age assessment is completed. Despite that, observers say, too many still miss out on school, college and university. Young people in England must legally be in education or training until they are 18, and asylum seekers under 18 are cared for by local authorities as looked-after children. Those thought to be over 16 usually go to college, rather than school, and the courses on offer are often based around language learning followed by vocational courses, rather than on a broader curriculum. Shabaaz is now watching his contemporaries moving on: “There was a guy who was with me, he’s now in university. He was my best friend, he’s my age. I’m thinking that if I’d been there in school with him, I would be in university now too.” The problem affects older arrivals as well. The new Home Office guidance says those who say they are under 18 should be treated as children unless there is compelling documentary evidence to the contrary, or their physical appearance and demeanour strongly suggest they are over 25. But in some cases, the judgments made are wildly different from what young people are saying. When Bwar – also not his real name – arrived from Iran 18 months ago, he did not know anything about the UK: “I didn’t know even the name of the country that I was in,” he says. He was taken to a police station, where he was asked a lot of questions – including his age. Bwar, who is Kurdish, said he was 17. Initially he was placed in foster care and in a language course at college. But then he was told he had to face a three-day age assessment in which he answered questions about every aspect of his life, his culture, his family. The outcome was a shock. “On the last day they said: ‘This is the result: you are 28.’ I didn’t know what to say. I laughed. I said, ‘Really? I am 28? This is a joke, isn’t it?’ They weren’t laughing.” The assessment in effect put an end to Bwar’s education. “My social worker went to see the head of my college, and they agreed that I was not good to be in the same class. I had to be moved to an adult class.” Because Bwar would not accept a move into adult education classes, he stopped attending. “I still have so many friends in that class, and they still ask me why I stopped going.” In Iran, Bwar had attended school until age nine, but was discriminated against because he was Kurdish. He still had high hopes for the future, though: his sister, who still lives in Iran, is an engineer. “In my city so many people were entrepreneurs,” he says. “I felt inspired by that, and so I wanted to study business and finance.” There are signs he is giving up: “The Home Office said I had to move to a different town, and since then I haven’t even tried to enrol in college. I’m so tired,” he says. The British Red Cross is helping both Bwar and Shabaaz, writing letters of support for their cases. Kalyani McCarthy, the national project manager for Surviving to Thriving, a Red Cross programme that has helped 160 unaccompanied young asylum seekers and refugees this year, says the programme often comes across this. “What’s particularly disruptive is an age assessment takes a significant time, and in the interim the local authority won’t try and support that young person to access education,” she says. The situation, while complicated, could be handled better, she says: “There are concerns around safeguarding, not wanting to put older people in classes with children, but that can be really detrimental for young people who are going through these stressful experiences. It affects their mental health, they get so upset and don’t understand why someone would not believe them: ‘Why would I lie?’” Simple measures could help, she adds: ensuring young people understand the age assessment processes they are going through, for instance, and letting them choose an “appropriate adult” to support them at meetings. “From our experience the majority of young people are genuine and don’t have any knowledge of what it means if they are younger,” she says. “I think awareness has increased, but local authorities should only be completing these assessments when there’s a genuine and significant reason to doubt, and not just because a young person doesn’t have documents, which is very common.” Edward Taylor, a solicitor at Osbornes Law, has represented many young asylum seekers in age disputes. “The definition of a child is that they are under 18, and local authorities by law need to treat children in accordance with their claimed age until the age assessment is complete,” he says. “We deal with a lot of clients who are 16 or 17, and it’s easier for them to start college than to go to school. But if they are 14 or 15, they will often be put into college and not into school; there’s no drive to get them into school and to treat them in accordance with their claimed age.” Taylor has come across cases where age assessments have been found to be wildly inaccurate: in one case a boy assessed as age 23 by the local authority, was later accepted as having been 17. The process took a year and by then he was over 18. “He would have been able to go to college if his age had been assessed correctly. Instead, he was moved from pillar to post between the local authority and Home Office, which really took its toll on him and prevented the education provision he so desperately needed.” Taylor has witnessed another serious problem, too: children being held at a reception centre in Kent are receiving no formal education, he says. He recently received a freedom of information response from the county, where young people can spend six months or more in the Millbank reception centre before being dispersed. It confirms that the only education available there is informal language support supplied by a local charity. “Millbank reception centre takes many of the new arrivals who are going to be age disputed,” says Taylor. “They shouldn’t be placed at Millbank, because it clearly isn’t adequate to meet their needs, and deprives the right to appropriate education provision.”  Kent county council said in a statement that the Millbank centre had been overwhelmed by unprecedented numbers of arrivals this year, along with the collapse of a national dispersal scheme, and so unaccompanied youngsters were spending far longer there than normal while their ages were being assessed – in some cases more than six months. A spokesperson said: “If entered into Kent county council’s care, these young people will be moved into appropriate housing and will then begin to learn English to enable them to move forward into education and eventually be equipped to sit exams in the UK.” The Home Office said it was exploring with local authorities how to improve the handling of age assessments and disputes. “We are fixing our broken asylum system to make it firm and fair,” its statement said. “Our age assessment process seeks to balance the need to ensure that children are given the support they need, while preventing adults passing themselves off as children.” Meanwhile, the future for Shabaaz and Bwar remains uncertain. Both are still waiting to hear whether they can stay in the UK. Bwar has found a solicitor who is helping him to challenge his local authority’s age assessment through legal action. But the process has taken a deeper toll: “It isn’t just about going to university and stuff, it’s so personal,” Bwar says. “If I am 28, then who am I really? Did I sleep for 10 years? I’m not 28, I’m 18 and I really want to prove it.” Fran Abrams is the co-author, with Joanna McIntyre, of Refugee Education, which will be published by Routledge on 27 November.",education
"Universities fined students more than £170,000 for breaching coronavirus safety rules in the first weeks of the new academic year, a Guardian analysis has found, as students told of struggling to make friends without flouting restrictions. Twenty-eight institutions fined students for breaking university, local and national Covid rules, including on household mixing, mandatory face coverings and social distancing, according to responses from 105 universities to freedom of information (FoI) requests. University of Nottingham students paid more than one-third of the total amount, with 91 fined a total of £58,865 up to 12 November – more than the amount levied on its student population by police. The university said the individual fines it issued were up to £1,500. The fines handed down to 1,898 students amounted to £170,915. Most universities only disclosed fines levied in the first two to three weeks of term. Some said the money would be paid into their student hardship fund. The findings reveal wide variations in the penalties imposed on students by different universities as well as in the support provided to those self-isolating or seeking psychological help during the pandemic. Fifty-three universities said they disciplined and cautioned a total of 5,122 students. Nottingham came top, with 672 students sanctioned and a further 21 cases pending, followed by Leeds Beckett (403), Oxford Brookes (340), Manchester University (334) and Aberdeen (215). Aberdeen University disclosed the second highest value of fines – £32,250 by 24 November. The university did not disclose how many students this figure covered but said it had imposed fines of £17,750 on 140 students by 15 October. Most fines were £125 but a small number of repeat offenders were told to pay £250, it added. Oxford Brookes imposed the highest number of Covid-related fines – 326, totalling £18,950. Leeds University imposed 343 fines but said it could not extrapolate how many were for breaches of Covid regulations, and did not disclose their value. St Andrews University imposed fines totalling £13,240 on 193 students. The figures do not include fines separately imposed by police. Nottingham said police had issued 91 fines to its students, totalling £28,000. In October, four Nottingham Trent students were fined £10,000 each by the police after more than 30 people were found in their house. A university spokesman said it was working with officers to investigate another student house party earlier this week, and had begun disciplinary proceedings. Emily, 20, a first-year student at St Andrews University, which warned students they must “follow all safety guidelines to the letter”, said she had broken the Covid restrictions because “otherwise it would have been physically impossible to make friends”. She added: “I have received two £60 fines from the university and two strikes on my non-academic register, meaning I can no longer do things such as apply for a year abroad. I think it’s outrageous that these strikes will stay on my record for my entire university life. “The halls and town are crawling with wardens and security ready to shut down anything immediately. It’s like a police state. A friend was fined for not wearing a mask properly. This whole experience is incredibly isolating.” Liz, 18, a first-year student at Newcastle University, was fined £100 by the police for having drinks with friends from her home town in their student house. She said: “I’d been feeling really down and thought this would make me feel better. It wasn’t a party but the music was fairly loud. I didn’t appeal because I thought feeling lonely wouldn’t stand up very well as a defence. I’ve not made any new friends. I’m stuck in my tiny bedroom all day. I would have deferred if I knew it was going to be like this.” Some of the universities that levied the largest fines also had the longest waiting times for students to see a counsellor. St Andrews University said the average waiting time to see a counsellor was five weeks. Manchester Metropolitan University, which issued 156 fines totalling £7,800, disclosed the largest number of students waiting for counselling (280), followed by Northumbria University (81). Most universities said they were providing online and telephone counselling, with some also laying on buddy services. Many are providing deliveries of food and toiletries – some for free. Larissa Kennedy, the president of the National Union of Students, said: “It is absolutely unacceptable that universities have felt it necessary to issue obscene fines and harsh punishments. [They] should be providing care packages with food, household products, wellbeing materials and general necessities at no extra cost.” Newcastle University said it was “acutely aware” that the pandemic had limited students’ ability to make friends. A spokeswoman added that students had access to a helpline and 24/7 mental health support and could pair up with a student or staff buddy. A St Andrews University spokesman said: “It’s grossly false and disingenuous to claim the only way to make friends is to break the rules. Support for our students remains our paramount concern.” The University of Nottingham said it supported police fines against the minority of students who broke the rules, which were reinforced by its own disciplinary action, fines and other sanctions. A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education institutions, said universities had encouraged responsible student behaviour through agreements or pledges. But he added: “Universities are taking Covid safety measures and government guidance very seriously and students will have been informed of the consequences of breaking these rules.”",education
"Students have been left reeling after the UK’s biggest funder of PhDs announced that thousands of researchers will not be given extra time or funding to complete their degrees. UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) supports around 22,000 students at any one time – up to a quarter of all doctoral students in the UK – with an annual budget of around £400m. Thousands have now been told they must find a way to finish their research on time, causing distress among students who spoke to the Guardian. “This is a new layer of uncertainty on top of the uncertainty we have all been living with during the pandemic,” said Aline Cerqueira, a marine biologist. “I am concerned that if I do not get an extension, I might not be able to conclude my research analysis and thesis writing. “With two children depending on me and a mortgage to pay, unfunded extensions would also represent a real challenge to my family, with possible detrimental effects to our financial stability and mental health.” Alex Kirby-Reynolds, 30, who has been doing a PhD on the impact of Brexit on people’s lives, alongside some teaching to keep out of debt, said he would be unable to work without a funding extension. “I already had a lot of anxiety around this as it is difficult to complete a PhD in the time we are usually funded,” he said. “Obviously the announcement of likely not receiving additional funding has only increased this stress. This anxiety makes working on challenging reading, writing, and other kind of work more difficult. “My only possible solution would be that I could move to a part-time PhD and find some other kind of employment that would allow me to complete my project.” Doctoral students also raised concerns about being unable to collect data within a shorter timeframe, and how missing out on opportunities to publish papers and attend conferences could make them less competitive in the academic jobs market. UKRI, which brings together seven research councils including the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said it knew that many research projects had been disrupted by lockdown and social distancing, and it might take time for access to resources and labs and for field work to return to normal. It said: “We are therefore advising all students funded by UKRI, including those on grants from any of the seven research councils, to speak to their supervisors about how to adjust their project to complete a doctoral-level qualification within their funded period.” It says it provided an extra £44m for extensions in April and £19m more in the past week, meaning extra financial support had been made available for up to 12,000 students most affected by the pandemic, such as those in their final year, disabled students and those with caring responsibilities. But thousands will receive no extra support, instead being told to readjust their work to meet their original deadline. In a 30-page report on the issue, UKRI concluded: “New and early-stage UKRI doctoral students must modify projects with the support of their supervisors and grant holders to ensure they can be completed within their funded period.” Dr Marc Reichow, a lecturer in geochemistry at the University of Leicester, tweeted his dismay at the news. “How to adjust? Are you asking to cut down to make it fit into the new time frame? Students had no access to research facilities! I am not impressed by this news. This adds another level of stress to all! Thanks for that,” he wrote. Alexander Joseph Currie, a PhD student investigating Aspergillus fumigatus immune responses in cystic fibrosis, has begun a petition urging UKRI to extend an extra six months of support to all PhD students.  Prof Rory Duncan, the UKRI’s director of talent and skills, said the new guidance was based on consultations with students, university leaders, grant holders and others. “We know that students and supervisors have made huge efforts already to adapt. We are advising doctoral students who have not yet done so, to speak to their supervisor to adjust their projects and ensure they can complete them within their funding period. We know how hard this will be for students who are dedicated and passionate about their work,” he said.",education
"The market for student rentals is as active as ever, regardless of Covid restrictions on campuses. “It may be more difficult for students this year but it’s busier than we would have thought,” says Martin Blakey, chief executive at the student housing charity Unipol. “Students are really determined to have as close as possible to a traditional uni experience, and are planning their future as they normally would.” But finding a flatmate in a pandemic isn’t easy. Drama student Daisy Widdess*, who found a flat last week, says she is one of the lucky ones. “A lot of people have absolutely no idea who they’re going to live with. We haven’t had the chance to meet many people and the friends we have made don’t know each other. It’s a whole palaver.” If you are feeling worried about who to live with or how to find a house, here’s what to do next. There may be pressure to find student accommodation early, but don’t be rushed by letting agents. “It’s a myth that if you don’t do it in the first few months you won’t get a place,” says third-year University of Warwick student, Darcey Edkins. “There will always be landlords and apartments that will take you.” This year, there is more reason to be cautious. Many students have fallen behind on their rent, been trapped in tenancies they no longer need when teaching has moved online, and often had to spend increasing amounts of time in poor-quality housing. As a result, the National Union of Students (NUS) says students should be especially careful when signing up to new tenancies, ensuring they are not trapped into paying rent for a property they may not use for the whole duration of the contract. In previous years, you could have met future housemates on nights out or through societies. This year, however, many are leaning towards living with people from their accommodation. If this doesn’t work for you, don’t be afraid to branch out and find others. “Don’t rush into it if the people are not right for you,” says Edkins. Blakey says they are seeing a rise in students getting a room in a house full of strangers. “It is not uncommon for houses to look for extra people to fill the rooms,” he says. Consider partnering up with one person and joining others in a search. Social media can be a good tool for finding housemates. You can reach out to students from your course and look into connecting with like-minded people in student groups on Facebook.  Students’ unions often run speed dating type socials for flatmates and many of these have moved online. At Bristol University, for instance, there are virtual “find a flatmate” events that cover topics such as size, location and budget. At Royal Holloway, University of London, there is an advice centre that specialises in matching people with other households. If you haven’t seen anything advertised, contact your students’ union. Most viewings are taking place online, but try to visit the property if you can. If you do an online viewing, make sure you are shown every aspect of the property, especially the ceiling of the bathroom to check for any damp or mould. Take a walk to the area and see if you like the feel of it. Bristol University’s student living officer, Ruth Day, says her top tip is to ask the current tenants what they think of the house and the landlord. Widdess says this worked for her: “The first house we saw looked so nice online, but I managed to speak to one of the girls, and she said the wifi was awful and the plumbing was like something from the 18th century.” Be wary, though – some landlords are struggling to fill rooms, so they are now incentivising their tenants to find people for them. “We’ve been offered £20 each from our landlord,” says Edkins. Social media is another common way for people to vent about the problems they’ve had with particular landlords and agents. If you’re feeling too rushed, consider purpose-built student accommodation or returning to halls where possible. Rooms tend to be filled much later in the academic year and if you’re struggling to find flatmates this may be a good option, as you will all be thrown in together and you will meet more people. *name has been changed",education
"One day at school, Jack* was accosted by his teacher while he was putting his coat on and getting ready to leave the classroom. “Leave it there,” she insisted in front of his classmates. “We donated you that. Your mum didn’t have enough money to buy you a coat.” When he argued back – his mum, a successful public sector employee, had bought the coat for him before term – he was given detention for a week. The same teacher referred him for an ADHD diagnosis without telling his parents. Sarah*, his mother, has worked in educational special needs, and questioned the teacher’s decision. She learned the diagnosis stemmed from a high score on a maths test, which had been deemed suspicious “considering his background”. Throughout his school career, 12-year-old Jack has had to get used to micro-aggressions such as these. “That behaviour is quite constant,” says Sarah. “Would she have done that with another child, or is it because he’s a Traveller?” Jack’s experience is not unique. In a recent report from the Traveller Movement, two-thirds of Irish Travellers said they been bullied by teachers, with one in five saying this made them leave school. This is one of the many reasons why just 3-4% of pupils from Traveller, Gypsy or Roma (GRT) backgrounds attend university compared with 43% of their peers, according to Kings College London research. The numbers are thought to be getting worse rather than better, although this is difficult to measure given so many GRT students conceal their identities for fear of racism. Another barrier is cultural. Some GRT pupils’ parents experienced patchy schooling themselves, and don’t always value education or struggle to support their children with schoolwork. Jack is lucky because although Sarah didn’t attend school growing up, she had the opportunity to go to college, where she received distinctions across the board. “The issue now is that he’s starting secondary school, and most Traveller boys don’t go. They normally go out to work with their dad,” she says. “He feels a bit torn. They’re saying ‘we’re old enough, we don’t have to’, and I’m saying ‘actually, you’re really bright, you do really well, you enjoy it’.” So when Sarah spotted an Instagram post offering free online tutoring for pupils from GRT backgrounds during coronavirus, she leapt at the chance. Within weeks, she noticed a transformation. “It’s the attitude towards education that’s changed.” The project is part of Rom Belong, a pioneering programme run by King’s College London and the Traveller Movement. It aims to help more bright GRT pupils like Jack get into university, and support them when they arrive. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, most of its work had to be suspended, leading the team to worry that these hard to reach communities could drift even further away from education. But they rapidly rolled out online tutoring and discovered it to be even more effective than face-to-face. The project funds free Amazon Fire tablets and dongles for families since they are twice as likely to face digital poverty as their peers. Some tutors even started teaching their students over WhatsApp. “It’s working amazingly – the kids are less embarrassed when it’s online,” says Chrissie Browne, Gypsy, Roma and Traveller lead at King’s College London’s department for widening participation. “And their families don’t have to change their lives. If you’ve got a living situation in poverty, parents don’t want people to come in.” Many GRT pupils experience low expectations and racist bullying from teachers and fellow students, so receiving personalised attention from a tutor is invaluable. “The most important thing is to have an experience where someone in education sees them as an individual with their own interests and skills, and to focus on what makes them special, not just as part of a group,” says Meredith Moore, one of the tutors. She thinks her pupil’s experience of travelling has made her adaptable, open-minded and equipped with good social skills.Outreach work with the GRT community has to start young, as many disengage with education early. That’s why although most university access work focuses on teenagers, the tutoring project is open to children of all ages. “If you look at the evidence, GRT kids are already behind by primary school, by secondary they’re in pupil referral units. They’re behind their peers by two to three years, so to just work with 16 and 17 year-olds is shutting the gate after the horse has bolted,” says Browne. Browne is a Traveller, and experienced a difficult journey through the education system. She didn’t enjoy school, then returned to education in her late 20s, ending up with a BSc in nutrition and dietetics from King’s. “As a Traveller, going to uni is a scary thing. I didn’t feel like I fitted in. Even though on the outside I look like any other white girl, inside I felt different to everyone else,” she says. Her views are echoed by Chelsea McDonagh, an Irish Traveller working on the project, who is also a campaigner and researcher for the Traveller Movement. “When you don’t see people from your background at uni it can make it feel as though it isn’t a place for someone like you,” she says, but adds that “especially more recently, universities are doing a lot more outreach work and that’s a really positive step.” She thinks one of the main benefits of the tutoring project is the way it tackles the root cause of underrepresentation at university: lower attainment at school. “Not all parents are able to support with home learning, so if schools aren’t bridging some of that gap that can contribute to young people falling behind,” she says. But while grassroots projects can make a difference to a handful of pupils, ultimately meaningful change is the government’s responsibility, McDonagh says. She thinks policy isn’t “going anywhere near as far as it should”, highlighting how few GRT students have benefited from the free laptops drive during the pandemic. She thinks there is an urgent need for more targeted initiatives focused on the GRT community. “There are schools which are trying but if young people are behind their peers, the schools need access to additional funding to get them up to speed,” she says. “Honestly even if [the government] did the bare minimum we’d probably clap, because there’s been so little.”",education
"The head of a prestigious Oxford college has stepped aside in the latest twist in a long-running battle over his position. The Very Rev Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church, voluntarily withdrew from all his duties after a new, unspecified complaint was made against him. It is understood not to be related to earlier complaints. His allies said Percy, who is head of both the college and the cathedral, had stepped aside because of “intolerable pressure” over more than two years. One said: “Martyn and the college have agreed not to comment on the present situation. Martyn has not resigned and is confident that he will return to his duties in the new year.” Percy was suspended as dean in 2018 after he was accused of behaviour of an “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature” – the wording of the college’s statutes under which a dean can be removed. The dean’s supporters claimed that a small group within the governing body was determined to remove him from his post because of his efforts to modernise the way the 474-year-old college was run. Percy’s detractors insisted the acrimonious dispute originated in the dean’s attempts to secure a pay rise. The college hired Sir Andrew Smith, a retired high court judge, to chair an internal tribunal on the dispute. Smith dismissed the complaints against Percy and ordered his reinstatement. The dispute has cost the college, a charitable body, at least £2m in legal fees. The college is also thought to have lost millions in cancelled bequests and donations. In June the Charity Commission said: “The very protracted and public dispute between the college’s governing body and its dean is damaging to the reputation of the charity, and affecting its ability to govern itself.” Two months later the Church of England exonerated Percy after investigating claims that he had failed to deal properly with sexual abuse allegations. Percy is taking the college to an employment tribunal. The case is due to be heard next year. A statement from Christ Church sent this week to staff and students at the college and cathedral school, and to the cathedral congregation, said: “The dean of Christ Church, the Very Rev Martyn Percy, has voluntarily withdrawn with immediate effect from all duties and pastoral responsibilities in his role as dean of the college and cathedral. “Christ Church will not be commenting further whilst necessary inquiries are under way. The Charity Commission and relevant Church of England authorities are being kept fully informed.” The C of E said the bishop of Oxford had agreed that Percy would step back from office while a complaint was properly considered. The dean’s allies have said Percy is the victim of a witch-hunt by a governing body that acts like a “medieval fiefdom”. Christ Church was founded by Henry VIII in 1546. It is the alma mater of 13 prime ministers, 10 chancellors of the exchequer and 17 archbishops. Among its former students are King Edward VII, Lewis Carroll and WH Auden. It is one of Oxford’s richest colleges, with funds of more than £500m.",education
"Angel Gabriel calling Mary on Zoom to tell her that she’s expecting the baby Jesus. A trip to the countryside and some furloughed shepherds. As the unfamiliar becomes familiar amid the pandemic, the nativity is no different – with schools across the country getting creative in their depictions of the traditional play. “We didn’t want it to look like a filmed stage show, or a bit ‘naff’. We wanted it to be as realistic as possible,” said Jo Goode, headteacher of Grasmere Primary School in Cumbria. Unable to hold the traditional play in church due to Covid-19 restrictions, the school took 70 schoolchildren to the Lake District countryside, in their local area, to shoot the 20-minute film. In a revamped script, the play follows Mary and Joseph living in an inner city urban area. Fearing the repercussions of the pandemic they decide to run away to the countryside, rather than the usual trek across the desert. It also features cameo appearances from the local community, including Wordsworth Trust, and the Langdale Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team. “It has been really quite cathartic for [the pupils], because it’s given them an opportunity to talk through how everybody’s behaved during lockdown,” Goode said. The film will be broadcast to local hospitals within the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay on Christmas Eve. “It was lovely because it sort of became the Christmas story itself. Our plan was to make a little thing for our community, and the community ended up thoroughly involving themselves in it.” Other schools have taken a different approach to their nativity. Pupils at Glascote Academy, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, have learned sign language to Christmas songs to accompany their Christmas play. The government guidance says that kids can sing in classrooms, but only if they’re very well ventilated and if the kids are a metre apart, says Charlotte Anderson, a music teacher at the school. “I can’t think of a school in the country where they can sit like that. Classrooms are tiny, aren’t they?” Anderson appointed every class their own sign language song to learn, and the classes recorded the songs together with others in their respective year bubble in the school hall. “They’ve enjoyed learning the sign language for the songs,” Anderson said. “It’s something that will stick with them for a long time because they’ve had to practise it so much. But they would definitely much prefer a normal Christmas play. “It is a shame, especially for my year six group. It’s their last Christmas in the school. They’re gutted because they would perform the big parts in the Christmas productions, but this is the best we can do.” Like many schools across the UK, Bramley Park academy, in Leeds, has had to adapt to using virtual technology to help record its nativity. Carrie Green, executive principal of the school, said they used Google classrooms for “a different twist on the virtual nativity, just to make sure they’re all still involved.” The script has been adapted, too. “Angel Gabriel has a Zoom call with Mary to tell her that she’s expecting the baby Jesus. The shepherds have been furloughed. Mary and Joseph have to scan a QR code when they arrive at the inn, and the kings take hand sanitiser and a golden face mask to the baby Jesus.” Green reflected that she found singing into her laptop while the children joined in around the school to be “one of the weirdest thing I’ve ever done in my life”. But, she added, “the kids have absolutely loved it. This is a really special time of year, and it’s so important that we’re still doing this”.  This article was amended on 11 December 2020 to clarify that Bramley Park academy is in Leeds, not Bradford. ",education
"A far-reaching overhaul of the university admissions system, which would mean places being offered on the basis of grades rather than predictions, could open up a “devolution divide” without an agreement with the devolved nations, Ucas has said. Pressure has been growing for a shift from the current system under which sixth formers in England apply to university in January using grades predicted by their teachers, before sitting A-levels in late spring and accepting university offers in June. Following a review, Ucas, the universities admissions service, has now drawn up two proposals, both of which advocate post-qualifications admissions. The first keeps applications ahead of results day in August, with offers based on actual results. The second proposes moving the whole applications process beyond results day and pushing back university start dates until January. It is likely to be less popular with the sector and government because it would put the UK system out of synch with the rest of the world. John Cope, the director of strategy, policy and public affairs at Ucas, said the aim was to make the system fairer for disadvantaged students. However, he said: “In the case of both options, working with the devolved nations will be essential or else a devolution divide will open up, with nothing stopping Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish universities walking away from Ucas and all the benefits that a UK admissions shared service brings.” “This would be terrible for students, creating four fragmented and out-of-sync systems. We also need to recognise the pressure placed on universities and colleges by both options, with less time for interviews and other assessments, which is especially relevant to the arts, medicine or nursing,” he added, writing in the Times. The Ucas proposals are the latest in a long line of attempts to move England to a post-qualification admissions system dating back to 2006, but on each occasion the status quo has remained after opposition from universities and school leaders. Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, and the higher education watchdog in England, the Office for Students, have also been conducting their own reviews into admissions, which will be published soon. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said reform was long overdue. “Teachers work diligently to predict grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. And in recent years universities have overused unconditional offers as a way of getting bums on seats, which demotivates students in their A-levels, and can lead to them choosing a course which doesn’t suit them.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We remain committed to delivering on our manifesto pledge to improve the admissions system. We are exploring options that will ensure it is as fair and transparent as possible, and works for every student.”",education
"When in 1970 my friend Tony Knight, who has died aged 93, became headteacher of the Church of England middle school in Newport on the Isle of Wight, the school had not even been built. But once he got there he nursed it into being, constantly seeking ways to improve its systems and to create a happy and buzzing community on the island. He was also keen to bring into the staffroom people whose experience went beyond the usual routes into teaching. Tony was born in Wantage in Oxfordshire (but then in Berkshire) to Norah (nee Carpenter) and her husband, Joseph, who both worked at King Alfred’s school in the town – Norah running the boarding house of which Joseph was housemaster. Naturally Tony attended the school, and after leaving aged 17 in 1944 he was accepted into the army and sent to Burma with the Royal Corps of Signals. On demob in 1949 he read English at Oxford, where he met a young nurse, Hilary Scott, in 1950, and two years later they married. After a first job as a store management trainee with Anglo Iranian Oil, Tony turned to teaching English at schools in Boston, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Exeter. Then, in 1963, with their young family, he and Hilary left for Switzerland to become houseparents at the Pestalozzi Children’s Village in Trogen, set up in 1946 to provide a home for children from various nations who had found themselves in difficult circumstances, and to nurture ambassadors of peace for the future. I worked there as a volunteer, and I saw how they threw themselves into their roles as teachers, substitute parents, internationalist community-makers and UK representatives. When it was their turn to lead the weekly assembly with a contribution from their native culture, Tony (self-effacing and donnish in appearance) entertained and startled the village as a pantomime dame. He also carried out his regular snow-shovelling duties with scientific precision. He and Hilary left Switzerland after six years in 1969, and Tony spent the next year studying education at Oxford University. This led, in 1970, to his headteacher appointment on the Isle of Wight. While working in Newport, Tony was a lay canon of Portsmouth Cathedral. Once he retired from the school in 1984 he taught English as a foreign language and, while Hilary continued to work, also cared for his mother-in-law, Evelyn Siarey.

"We’d like to hear from first year students in the UK who have decided to leave university. The coronavirus pandemic has caused increased disruption and hardship for many students around the UK as studies went online and students were forced to self-isolate. But for first year students, starting out at university can be daunting at the best of times, and having to cope with the measures brought about by the pandemic has made the experience that much more challenging. If you’re in your first year and have decided to leave university, we’d like to hear from you and find out your reasons why. We’re also interested in those who have deferred until next year or have decided to go to another university, perhaps one closer to your home.

"Parents are being forced to deregister their children from school and home-educate or else face fines and prosecution for non-attendance after keeping them out of class because of concerns about Covid-19. Some cases involve clinically vulnerable or extremely vulnerable family members who are worried about a child bringing Covid home. One father in North Yorkshire who suffers from severe asthma told the Guardian: “We are devastated. We’ve not chosen to home-school. We’ve been forced to home-school.” This week the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 335 councils in England, reported a sharp rise in the number of children being taken out of school and registered for home education since the start of the autumn term, with some councils seeing increases of up to 200%. Ofsted said that of 380 schools it visited between 29 September and 23 October, almost half had had pupils taken off roll to be electively home educated.. Some parents who contacted the Guardian said they enjoyed teaching their children during the first lockdown and had made a positive choice to home-educate on a permanent basis. A number had children with special educational needs who had struggled without the right support in school. “Lockdown gave us the opportunity to try home education, and we found it was the right thing for us,” said one mother from Yorkshire who has chosen to home-educate her youngest daughter, who has an autism diagnosis. Others feel forced into a corner. They would like their children to remain on roll and continue remote learning until Covid cases have gone down and they feel safe to return to class, but they have been told they have to attend school full-time or leave. One mother in Greater Manchester, where infection rates have been high, said: “While I have been threatened with fines, prosecution and unlawful off-rolling by the headteacher at my children’s school, in other schools parents have been supported fully in their temporary remote learning.” Dr Ambily Banerjee, a scientist from Slough, Berkshire, who works for a vaccine manufacturer, has been educating her 15-year-old daughter at home since March, to protect her clinically vulnerable mother who lives with them. She has not yet deregistered her daughter, but the school has now referred her case to the local authority. “We are BAME and at increased risk, but this is being ignored,” she said. “We should have a choice and not be mandated by the government to send our children to school in a pandemic. We are forced into a corner. It’s an absolutely cruel situation.” Jason Neilson, from Croydon, has educated his 13-year-old son at home since he developed a cough at the start of term and had to self-isolate. He is worried about poor ventilation and lack of masks in classrooms. “The school accused me of being paranoid and referred me to the local authority,” he said. “I have not been fined yet. But it has been made very clear that I could be.” Matt Dunkley, the corporate director for education and young people’s services in Kent, said elective home education was becoming more popular across England prior to the pandemic. “However, nothing could have prepared local authorities for the surge of notifications [of children being taken off roll] that came through in September 2020,” he said. Kent received 596 notifications of children being deregistered from school in September, compared with 235 the year before. In October there were 210 notifications, compared with 131 in October 2019. “It is difficult to pinpoint a specific reason,” said Dunkley. “There will be parents who found the experience of home-educating their children through lockdown extremely fulfilling and beneficial to their child. There will be those who have concerns for their health and members of extended families and intend to home educate as a temporary measure until they are assured that they are no longer at risk from the pandemic. There will also be those who having spent time at home away from routine and structure, are unable or unwilling to return to school.” Without any legislation in place to allow local authorities access to a child in their home environment to ensure they are in receipt of an education, Dunkley said many children could be left with no education at all. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The government made school attendance mandatory from the beginning of the autumn term and specifically told schools to record attendance and follow-up absence. So they do not have a great deal of latitude in being able to grant extended periods of absence.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We understand that some parents may be nervous about sending their children to school.  “However, we have already strengthened the protective measures in place in schools during the national measures to make them as safe as possible for children and staff.  “This approach balances the clear evidence of harm caused to children by not attending school, with the need to protect those at greatest risk from the virus. Any parents who are still concerned are encouraged to engage with their school.” ",education
"The University of Birmingham has become the first higher education institution to lower entry requirements for next year in recognition of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on A-level students. The bar for the majority of undergraduate degree programmes at the prestigious Russell Group university is being reduced by one grade. In a move likely to place pressure on other universities to follow suit, it linked the move directly to supporting sixth-form students due to sit their exams next summer. Degree programmes that are not included are medicine, dentistry and dental hygiene, nursing, physiotherapy, and social work, where there is external regulation, as well as the university’s foundation year and degree apprenticeship programmes. “We recognise the need to adapt our admissions approach for this year given the extraordinary disruption affecting these students and their schools and the fact that many are likely to experience more than a year of interrupted learning by the time they sit their exams next summer,” said the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Sir David Eastwood. “We have considered what we can do as a university to recognise and reward potential, mitigate some of the educational challenges as result of Covid, and reduce some of the pressure on students and teachers at this challenging time. Providing greater flexibility in our admissions for 2021 entry is one such area.” He said he hoped reducing the entry requirements would “alleviate anxieties”. The move was welcomed by Dr Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, but he said third level institutions also needed to work to lower grades for disadvantaged students, who had felt the brunt of a disproportionate impact from the pandemic. “Even though the pandemic will have a higher impact on school pupils up and down the country, it appears that grades will actually be similar, if not better than previous years,” he said. While universities were trying to improve social mobility, he said they were competing for the same students, and moves such as Birmingham’s had to be seen in that context. “There is a marketplace here and I suspect that most institutions will have similar strategies. So you can see there is a competitive advantage of lowering grades.” The University of Birmingham has said the initiative also applies to its “contextual offer-making” – where institutions take into account factors that can restrict a student’s achievement at school.",education
"Children in the poorest areas of England are missing the most schooling, research suggests, and attendance levels are at their lowest in regions with high Covid-19 infection rates. Attendance levels at secondary schools in Knowsley, Merseyside, were as low as 61%, and rates were also less than 70% in other local authority areas in the north-west and in Yorkshire and the Humber. The signs of strain on school rolls came as Unison warned that Covid-19 could be spreading via lower-paid non-teaching staff such as caterers and cleaners who cannot afford to self-isolate at home. The union is compiling a list of contractors who will not grant full sick pay if employees get Covid or need to go into isolation. “We already know of several large contractors denying staff full sick pay, and they each have contracts with hundreds of schools,” said Jon Richards, the head of education at Unison. The Scottish government on Friday issued advice that older school pupils should wear face coverings in classrooms in areas that are in level 3 or 4 of Scotland’s lockdown system. The strongest official advice on masks yet to be issued in any part of the UK will apply to young people across central Scotland including Glasgow and Edinburgh, where tier 3 comes into force on Monday. Scotland’s education secretary, John Swinney, said pupils had already complied “magnificently” with masks guidance, and individual schools would take steps to support any pupils who were unable to afford the items or had medical conditions that prevented their use. “We do not want to see young people excluded from school because of issues they have wearing face coverings,” he added. A co-author of the English schools research said high infection rates and the inadequacy of the coronavirus testing regime meant that “a lot of schooling” was being missed despite Boris Johnson’s pledge to make the return to class a national priority. Government figures report that 86% of children attended school on 22 October, but the research by the University of Bristol and FFT Education Datalab suggests the national statistics hide strong regional and local variation. Since their analysis was based on local authority averages, the researchers said attendance in some schools could have been below 50%. “As we see again and again, the pandemic is exacerbating inequalities and reducing still further the chances of levelling up,” said Simon Burgess, a professor of economics at the University of Bristol. The researchers drew on statistics released in answer to a parliamentary question, and outlined their findings in a blog in which they warned that the biggest hit to future life chances was being felt by those in the most challenging circumstances. However, they also found there was not necessarily a correlation between attendance and poverty in some areas such as London and the West Midlands. “It definitely shows that somehow, either because of what local government is doing, or perhaps something to do with the place or how the virus is acting, it does not have to be the case that really high poverty rates mean you should end up with low attendance,” Burgess said. A Department for Education spokesperson said more than 99% of schools have been open every week since term began. “Schools are putting remote education in place for pupils self-isolating and our £1bn Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time including the £350m national tutoring programme for disadvantaged students.”",education
"The government has accused universities in England of ignoring antisemitism and ordered them to adopt an international definition before the end of the year or risk having funding cut off. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said in a letter to vice-chancellors that it was “frankly disturbing” that so many universities had failed to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism. “The repugnant belief that antisemitism is somehow a less serious or more acceptable form of racism has taken insidious hold in some parts of British society, and I am quite clear that universities must play their part in rooting out this attitude and demonstrating that antisemitism is abhorrent,” Williamson said. He noted that some universities had made progress. “However, there remain too many disturbing incidents of antisemitism on campus, from both students and staff, and a lack of willingness by too many universities to confront this.” A freedom of information request by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) found that only 29 out of 133 universities had adopted the IHRA definition, and 80 said they had no current plans to do so.  Universities have objected to adopting the definition on the principle of academic autonomy, and in other cases because of conflicts with freedom of speech requirements, which are also strongly backed by Williamson’s government. A spokesperson for the UJS said Williamson’s letter was “a strong stand by the UK government against antisemitism and discrimination faced by Jewish students”. Williamson said the Office for Students, the higher education regulator for England, could be asked to take regulatory action including suspending “funding streams” if universities failed to adopt the IHRA definition by the end of December. “If I have not seen the overwhelming majority of institutions adopting the definition by Christmas then I will act,” Williamson wrote. A spokesperson for Universities UK, which represents the sector, said: “We recommend universities do all they can to tackle antisemitism, including considering the IHRA definition, whilst also recognising their duty to promote freedom of speech within the law. “UUK has set up a taskforce to consider what can be done to address all forms of harassment, violence and hate crime on campus, including on the basis of religion. We are in regular contact with Jewish community leaders and student groups to ensure that universities are supported to do all they can to tackle antisemitism.” Williamson’s intervention comes at a difficult time for many universities struggling to cope with hundreds of students and staff infected with Covid-19, as well as preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU and its impact on recruitment and funding. “When future historians look at the Covid-19 period, there will be complete mystification at what the Department for Education took to be a priority in the middle of the crisis,” said one university official.",education
"In August, A-level students joined forces to voice their anger on social media at the algorithm that failed to give them fair grades, helping force a government U-turn in favour of teacher-estimated results. Now, some of those same students are stuck in lockdowns at halls of residences at universities across the country, studying online and restricted to socialising with their households – and they’re angry again. “Students were mobilised by the A-level U-turn. Now they’ve come on to campus, they’re thinking: ‘I’m sitting in my room watching a screen, which I could have done at home, why am I paying this money?’. There’s growing political awareness that enough is enough,” says Sabrina Shah, co-president of the School of Oriental and African Studies students’ union. Shah says the students she speaks to are angry about the way some campus lockdowns are being policed by private security, the paltry food parcels they’ve been receiving from ill-prepared institutions, and a widespread feeling that they were enticed on to campus to shore up university finances despite the risks posed to their physical and mental health. There’s also a growing suspicion among students that they’re being kept in halls to discourage them from dropping out before December, when universities secure their tuition fee payments from the government, she says. As a result, grassroots activist groups are springing up online at campuses across the UK to coordinate actions. Students at several universities, including Warwick, Bristol and Glasgow, are running rent strikes involving hundreds of students. Others at universities including Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool have organised groups under the name Students Before Profit to campaign for better conditions for students locked down in halls. “People think the university’s abandoned them,” says Laura Verdasco, a third-year psychology and neuroscience student at the University of Glasgow who’s been speaking to students to inform Students Before Profit’s work. “It’s their first year and the situation doesn’t seem to be getting much better, and it’s proven hard to talk to the university.” This grassroots activism complements a nationwide campaign launched by the National Union of Students (NUS) last month, called Students Deserve Better. The campaign aims to uphold students’ legal rights, including challenging rules that treat them differently to the wider population, safeguarding their finances and ensuring universities prioritise their safety. The NUS is also partnering with rent strike groups to provide activism training. “The only exciting thing about this moment that otherwise feels really bleak is that we’ve seen an upsurge in the number of localised, grassroots student movements,” says NUS president Larissa Kennedy. “We’re finding ways to support that work.” Despite some students and staff testifying to tension on campuses, they are increasingly joining forces to share their worries about the health risks of face to face teaching and to hold university leaders and the government to account. Shah has been speaking alongside staff members in rallies run by trade unions and grassroots activist networks. “Academics are on the side of the students,” she says. “I think the cross-union work is scaring the government and institutions. It means we’re more powerful.” Demands from the groups vary, but typically they ask for more testing; for all teaching be moved online until it is safe to meet face to face; for proper investment in quality remote teaching, including pausing redundancy plans and supplying disadvantaged students with equipment; for students to be released from their accommodation contracts, so they can go home; and – crucially – for the government to bail out any universities which struggle financially as a result. There is tension in the movement over whether students should receive refunds: while various petitions and student groups such as Refund Us Now are asking for discounts on their education, some believe that this consumer behaviour plays into the marketised higher education system, and see it as a distraction from the broader call to abolish tuition fees. The challenge staff and students are facing is how to make their voices heard when they can’t meet in person or organise protests. Instead, they’re turning to online networks to galvanise their movement. One staff-led group, UCU Solidarity, sprang up in response to the wave of redundancy announcements at the beginning of the pandemic as a way to support official action by the University and College Union (UCU). “When we’re working from home we’re atomised from our usual communities, so you have to build solidarity and organise and be seen and heard,” says Bee Hughes, one of UCU Solidarity’s informal organisers and a lecturer and UCU branch officer. “We’re trying to raise awareness, create community and form a grassroots movement.” UCU Solidarity recently organised a day of action in which staff and students came together to express their concerns. Events included socially distanced protests from students in Manchester, Glasgow, Soas and Brighton; online rallies; talks from MPs including Liverpool Riverside’s Kim Johnson; Twitter storms voicing complaints from angry staff and students at Ulster; and workshops on issues such as intellectual property for online learning. This activism has dovetailed with union branches across the country confronting their leaders after learning that the government’s scientific advisers had called for teaching to move online at the start of the academic year. “It’s quite a drop in the stomach feeling how bad things actually are,” says Vicky Blake, UCU president. “It’s a real moment of reckoning across the sector. There needs to be some leadership that goes beyond offering a few Pot Noodles to some students to make things better.” Blake thinks the union’s work has been given added power by staff and students’ grassroots activism and the networks they’ve developed to share experiences and offer support. She sees this as a distinctive feature of social organising online. “We’re learning from each other, across trade union and activist movements, how to do something positive that helps bring people together,” she says. “It’s quite an organic thing, and I think it shows how bad the situation is that people have been moved to organise in this way. But it also shows that there’s some hope.”",education
"Student leaders and experts have questioned the government’s plans for a pre-Christmas university lockdown, arguing it would breach students’ legal rights and come too late to prevent further outbreaks. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, will meet university leaders to discuss how the government aims to meet Boris Johnson’s pledge that all students who wished to could go home at Christmas to be with their families. The meeting comes as the University of Durham became the sixth university in England with more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases since the start of term. Durham revealed it had recorded more than 960 confirmed cases in the last seven days. The government’s Christmas proposals, as revealed in the Guardian, would require universities in England to end in-person teaching on 8 December and switch to online tuition, with students expected to stay on campus until 22 December. The proposals were called “unworkable” by the University and College Union, while the National Union of Students (NUS) president, Larissa Kennedy, doubted that the government’s legal powers allowed it to confine students to campus. “We are questioning whether there’s legal precedents to do this and treat students differently than the rest of the population,” Kennedy said in an interview with LBC. “Students just aren’t the homogenous group that the government seems to think they are. There are students of all ages, students with parents and carers, and what would this mean for students with jobs that they can’t do remotely? It just doesn’t feel like this has been thought through.” Kennedy said the government’s decision to ignore advice from its Sage committee of experts – which advised that universities should teach online where possible, to reduce transmission – meant it needed to come up with a workable exit plan. Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, an epidemic modeller at the University of Bristol who is on the government’s scientific pandemic influenza group, said a two-week lockdown with online-only teaching before Christmas may be too late. “Our analysis suggests that reducing face-to-face teaching to essential teaching only does have the impact of slowing down the rate of spread and preventing more disseminated outbreaks,” Brooks-Pollock told the BBC. “However, it needs to happen early on in the outbreak, because if infection is already widespread then having this quiet period at the end of term is unlikely to prevent outbreaks within halls of residence. “Two weeks might be enough for students living in smaller households, living with two or three other people, but in these halls of residence where there’s really a lot of people living together, it could just lead to an outbreak in those halls of residence. “And if there’s already disseminated infections, many of which are unobserved, two weeks wouldn’t be long enough at the end of term – it’s too late, essentially.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “If students are travelling home, we must ensure they do so in a way which minimises the risks of spreading the virus, and the date when universities must stop in-person teaching will be an important part of this. We will set out details on this shortly.” As case numbers continue to rise on campus, including more than 900 confirmed infections at the University of Leeds, staff are looking at industrial action to make their case for online-only teaching.",education
"Downing Street is under mounting pressure to perform a U-turn on providing free school meals over the holidays in England, with Conservative MPs growing angry at the damaging impact of the government’s refusal to back down in the face of the campaign led by the footballer Marcus Rashford. The Guardian understands that discontent is brewing behind the scenes among Conservatives, as Labour attempted to seize the initiative on Sunday when its leader, Keir Starmer, pledged to force a fresh Commons vote on the issue before Christmas unless there was a rethink. The move came after his party’s motion to extend the policy until Easter 2021, in a bid to stop children going hungry during the coronavirus crisis, was defeated last week in parliament. As dozens of councils, including some Tory-led, and businesses across the country have stepped in over recent days to offer to feed children during the October half-term, the sense of unease within Conservative circles is hardening. One Tory MP told the Guardian the issue had been a “political handling disaster” and that they had “never known so many Conservative MPs and council leaders so angry”. Separately, the senior Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin became the latest to break ranks to warn that the government had “misunderstood the mood of the country” on the issue and would have to rethink. The former children’s minister Tim Loughton also said it was a mistake by the government not to extend free school meals during the holidays. Loughton, who abstained in last week’s Commons vote, said he would vote to keep school meals during the Christmas holidays and until the pandemic is over in the event of a motion being put to MPs again. It came as a government U-turn was predicted by Laura Sandys, a former Conservative MP and founder of the Food Foundation thinktank, which has backed calls by Rashford’s taskforce for the implementation of key recommendations from the national food strategy in a bid to end child food poverty. On Sunday, the 22-year-old England and Manchester United forward continued to use his social media platform to highlight firms offering support, tweeting a map apparently showing dozens across England, adding: “Ever been more proud of being British?! And we’re still going, wow wow wow.” Meanwhile, the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, intervened on Sunday to liken the debate over the issue to something out of the pages of Charles Dickens’ 19th-century novel Oliver Twist. Downing Street has already been forced into a U-turn once on the issue, deciding to provide £15-a-week meal vouchers to eligible children over the summer after pressure from Rashford, but it has refused to do so for the holidays ahead. In an apparent softening of tone after a No 10 spokesman last week refused to praise councils and firms offering help, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said Rashford deserved “huge credit” for his work on the issue although he stood by Downing Street’s line. Defending the government’s stance, Lewis told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country was in a different position compared with the summer, adding: “We’ve put the uplift into universal credit, around just over £1,000 a year, but also very specifically we’ve put £63m into local authorities to support and help people in hardship … and a number of local authorities are using it to do exactly that.” But one Conservative MP said – referring to the Ministry of Housing, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Education – “It’s been a political handling disaster. No 10, MHCLG/DWP/DfE handling has been woeful. I’ve never known so many Conservative MPs and council leaders so angry. “There was an argument to be had that FSM [free school meals] isn’t the best route to get support to vulnerable families and that targeted benefits via our £9bn UC [universal credit] top-up is a better route to help vulnerable families: not least because FSM excludes pre-school children. But this week’s handling means that moment has passed.” The chair of the Commons education select committee, Robert Halfon, who penned a piece for the Spectator on Saturday setting out the Conservative case for extending free school meals and was among five Tory MPs who voted against the government last week, said: “No one has a benevolence or monopoly on compassion on this issue and the Labour party should stop pretending that it does and actually what we should do is come together and work out a proper solution, all parties, and it would be worth the government sitting down properly and genuinely with Marcus Rashford, Henry Dimbleby [co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain] and others to sort this out once and for all.” “I very much hope they [the government] consider my recommendations,” said Dimbleby, whose report had concluded that without urgent state intervention the Covid-19 crisis would lead to a “sharp rise in food insecurity and outright hunger”. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is defence select committee chair and voted with the government last week, is now calling on Downing Street to change course on the issue and extend free school meals in the holidays. “The free school meals provision clearly is very simple, people are aware of it, it’s worked before, it makes sense then to employ it into the future,” he told the Guardian, adding: “This generation of children have had their lives impacted in a way we’ve not seen since the second world war, we must do everything we can do to provide support. If that means utilising a system which is well appreciated then our government should recognise that’s the direction of travel we should go.” The founder of Food Foundation, Sandys, said: “Everybody needs to do the right thing, which is adopt the politics that have been put forward by the Rashford taskforce. “Those people who are closest to this understand that, including those who represent wards with lower incomes. Many Conservative-run councils are understanding the real and deep need and I would expect that the government will come on board over the next couple of weeks. I am just disappointed that they have not done so in time for this mid-term break.” The head of the Trussell Trust, the UK’s biggest charity food bank network, Emma Revie, called on the government to offer struggling families more generous support. Revie told the Guardian: “Marcus Rashford’s campaign has been incredible, shining a light on the unbelievable compassion and generosity in our communities. But it is not right that anyone is having to rely on charity to put food on the table for their family. “I hope that we can channel some of that compassion into longer-term solutions that go beyond the school holidays.” The Trussell Trust network operates more than 1,200 charity food bank outlets across the UK. Last month it warned that it was expecting a 61% increase in food bank referrals as furlough ends at the end of October and more families fall on hard times. The pressure on the government came as Tory-controlled councils added their names to a growing list of local authorities around England announcing that they would provide food support at half term. They included Medway council – a unitary authority in one of the poorest parts of Kent – which went in the opposite direction to Conservative-controlled Kent county council by saying it would provide free school meals during half-term to 6,000 eligible children. Amid the backlash over its position on free school meals, the government has announced that it is extending its lockdown policy of allowing families to access 30 hours of free childcare even if their income drops below the minimum income threshold. The policy of allowing access to support from the 30 free hours and/or tax-free childcare had been introduced by the DfE for those who were previously eligible but whose income had temporarily dropped during the pandemic. Parents are returning to their formal childcare settings, according to the DfE, which said attendance for early years settings was now at 86% of pre-coronavirus daily levels. ",education
"The volunteers at Hillingdon Crisis Support Service in north-west London did not get much sleep over the weekend. The team of 10 have been working around the clock to get a week’s worth of lunches ready for children over half-term. The widespread anger at the government’s decision to refuse to provide 1.4 million disadvantaged children in England with £15 a week in food vouchers during holidays is particularly acute here: many of the families being supported by the centre live in Boris Johnson’s constituency. “Where is Boris?” asks the food bank manager, Kim Brigdale, 55. “Have you seen any of them in a food bank? Can you see any of them trying to sort out free school meals for the kids?” She points to receipts posted on the fridge for goods that the team of volunteers have bought with their own money. “Where’s the government?” Though Labour’s attempt to get the government to provide meals for the poorest children – prompted by a campaign by the England footballer Marcus Rashford – was defeated in the Commons last week, local charities and businesses have rallied together and offered to help. Several local councils, including Hillingdon council, announced they would be stepping in to ensure children do not go hungry. But there is widespread frustration that it has come to this. Over the weekend, Hillingdon Crisis Support Service received a record number of donations following a call for help posted on Facebook and a GoFundMe page by one volunteer, Chloe Cole, who is studying early years education. The food bank, based in Harefield ex-servicemen’s club since March, responded to a growing number of families who desperately needed help to feed their children during lockdown. At one stage the centre was supporting about 25 families and a 50-room care home. While demand had decreased since then, it has started to creep up again. One brown bag contains enough food for five days of lunches for a single child, according to government recommendations: half a loaf of bread; the option of jam, chocolate spread or ham; cheese; 100g pasta with sauce; two packets of biscuits; one jelly spread; two packets of crisps; three types of fruit; and two yoghurts. There is a vegan and gluten-free option. Each bag costs about £4, which one volunteer points out is a fraction of what MPs’ can expense on food a day. For the centre’s co-founder Joanna Murphy, food poverty is an issue she personally understands. When her partner was unable to work after being involved in an accident, she was forced to go to a food bank to feed her children. She says the experience was so horrible that she left in tears, and vowed to create a welcoming, non-judgmental space for the families that slip through the cracks. “If we don’t look after each other, these children are not going to be fed, there are going to be parents that feel like they’re failures,” says Murphy. She describes Johnson as the opposite of Robin Hood. “He takes away from the people when he is supposed to work for the people. He is supposed to better this nation.” In the early afternoon, community champions from Morrisons supermarket respond to the Facebook callout with 30 lunches, which they will deliver every day this week. The team are delighted. “He’s [Johnson] not doing his job for the people. We are doing his job as communities, businesses, and volunteers,” says Murphy. Throughout the day, families turn up to pick up the free school meal bags, including a 16-year-old who collects lunches for himself and his sibling. Gemma Pugh, a 26-year-old mother of three, says Murphy and the centre provide an essential service, giving families food as well as blankets, and pillows. She is deeply frustrated by the vote against providing free school meals. “How much does it cost to give a child a school meal?” she says. “It’s a couple of pound a child and he [Johnson] can’t provide it, but he can provide this high pay for other people, but forget about the children that will be the next generation that is coming up in society. If we don’t provide for them, then what is going to be left in this world?” In Breightmet, an area of Bolton in Greater Manchester, volunteers at a community outreach group are loading up cars with bags full of ingredients for disadvantaged families to make packed lunches with during half-term. Set up by Dorothy Foster and Jean Barrass seven years ago, Reach Family Project would usually be helping families in the area with things such as money management skills, after a referral from schools or social services. But the team of five head out to deliver 50 free school meals packs – including bread, cheese, crisps, bananas, pasta and beans – which will help 250 people, off the back of Rashford’s campaign. “We only made the decision on Friday as a result of the government’s decision [to vote down the extension of free school meals],” says Barrass, 52, a former safeguarding lead at a primary school. “It’s been non-stop this weekend.” The effort is being run from the home of a volunteer, Angela Barry, which is situated in the former “red wall” seat of Bolton North East, where Mark Logan is the Conservative MP. Logan voted against Labour’s motion to extend the provision of free school meals. Barry, 33, says they are trying to stay “unpolitical” about the subject, and that it is “too early to judge if [the government] is right or wrong”.  But Barrass, who struggled financially after being widowed at 37 with two young children, says the decision had made her blood boil. “These are children, these are the future of our generation. [MPs] get everything they want on expenses. Their expenses cover the cost of hundreds and hundreds of meals.” The government grants that usually fund the group’s work did not cover the cost of the demand received since posting about the free school meals, so Reach has set up a GoFundMe page instead. But Phil Hart, 59, who became one of the group’s trustees after a 40-year career in banking, says the generosity of the public and local businesses alone “is probably not enough” to feed children throughout school holidays. “It shouldn’t be political. I’ve never gone to bed hungry so why should anybody else. We’re the fourth-richest nation in the world, this shouldn’t be happening.” Back in Hillingdon, volunteers who voted for Johnson before say they will not do so again. “When it comes to the next election, he’ll be out there asking everybody to put the little cross on the page. Do you think I will? I tell you what, I would vote anything but them.”",education
"Demand at food banks and child poverty charities in Ben Bradley’s constituency has doubled despite falling donations, with organisers describing the MP’s comments on free school meals as “disgusting”. Bradley wrote a series of tweets on Friday explaining why he had voted against extending free school meals for deprived children in England during the holidays until Easter 2021. He wrote: “At one school in Mansfield 75% of kids have a social worker, 25% of parents are illiterate. Their estate is the centre of the area’s crime. “One kid lives in a crack den, another in a brothel. These are the kids that most need our help, extending FSM doesn’t reach these kids.” Bradley then replied to a tweet in which another user said “£20 cash direct to a crack den and brothel really sounds like way forward with this one”, writing: “That’s what FSM vouchers in the summer effectively did …” Labour MPs have called on Bradley, who later said the tweet had been “totally taken out of context”, to apologise. At Sherwood Forest Foodbank, in Mansfield Woodhouse, demand for food parcels is “up to double” what it had been before the national lockdown in March, according to its client coordinator Jo Hays. She worries that when the government’s furlough scheme ends on 1 November, it could triple. “We see people on the frontline who are coming to us and they’re not from a crack den or any of that. The majority of people we see is as a result of the government lockdown,” she said. Hays, who said the pressure the food bank was under was “the worst we’ve seen” with families making up most new claimants, criticised Bradley’s stance as “misinformed”. “It’s: ‘if you want to do better you’ve got to look after yourself’, but there’s no jobs and people are losing the ones they had,” she said. The MP’s apparent “vilifying of people in Mansfield on benefits” was “disgusting”. On Wednesday, a satellite branch of the food bank will open at St Peter and St Paul’s church in Mansfield. The Sherwood Forest branch will have to stock both sites at a time when supplies are diminishing as the general public begins to feel the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis. “We have got money in the bank, but that’s not going to last long if we don’t get any donations. The stock we’ve got would last about a month and a half or two months,” said Hays. On Friday, Bradley invited Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, who has spearheaded the campaign for the extension of free schools meals during holidays, to visit a school in the Nottinghamshire district to discuss “why FSM is not the right approach”. But Clare Harding, headteacher at Asquith Primary School in Mansfield, pointed out that it was “ironic” that the MP had not shown up to a meeting with pupils from the school in Westminster in March, when her school was presented with a Kellogg’s award for its funded breakfast club. While she agreed that a “long-term solution” needed to be found to address the root cases of poverty, she said “that won’t help the children who need feeding now”. She added: “I have had children steal food out of lunchboxes because they are hungry.” During the national lockdown, the school ran a food bank for up to 25 families a week, and Harding said that this school year it had bought more school uniforms for deprived children than in previous years while the numbers of children receiving free school meals was rising.  Amanda Fisher, 50, who helps to run School’s Out for Summer Mansfield, which works with schools in the area to provide food vouchers to families with donations from the public, said demand there had doubled in the past four months. The community organisation was providing for 200 children who had been flagged by their school for extra support in July, but the number has risen to 400. “Over Christmas we could be looking at 600-plus,” Fisher said. She said delays to universal credit claims, job losses and zero-hours contracts were fuelling the demand. “We’ve worked so hard as a group to not make these people feel ashamed that they have to come to us,” she said. “But [Bradley] has basically said these families that have got children on free school meals are not worthy.” Fisher, who has been on benefits and has claimed free school meals for her own children in the past, said that when she first saw her MP’s Twitter tirade she had thought it was spam. “I just cannot believe the actual mindset of this chap. He’s almost demonising children because of the circumstances that they might be in,” she said. “I’m absolutely appalled that he is my MP. He’s not a Mansfield lad, so that says it all. “He’s been quite well-off through his childhood. He can’t even begin to imagine what these families are going through, I can, because I’ve been there.” Among the schools the organisation is working with is St Edmund’s C of E primary school in Mansfield Woodhouse. The school also clashed with Bradley on Friday. In a Facebook post, the school stated that his comments amounted to a “stigmatisation of working-class families” and that staff “know the truth about families who qualify for free school meals and it is nothing like what he suggests”. In a response from his personal Facebook account, Bradley asked the school to “remove” the “partisan nonsense”, arguing that his comments had been taken out of context.",education
"Universities must act to eradicate discrimination against working-class students, including the mockery of regional accents, equality campaigners have said. A Guardian investigation has found widespread evidence of students at some of the country’s leading universities being ridiculed over their accents and backgrounds, in some cases prompting them to leave education. The analysis found discrimination against working-class students was particularly prevalent among Russell Group universities. The group, which is made up of 24 institutions, has a reputation for academic excellence. In a series of Guardian interviews, students past and present reported bullying and harassment over their accents and working-class backgrounds. Some said their academic ability was questioned because of the way they spoke. The Social Mobility Commission (SMC), which monitors progress in improving social mobility in the UK, described the situation as unacceptable and said accents had become a “tangible barrier” for some students. This week the Guardian reported complaints of a “toxic attitude” towards some northern students at Durham University. Last month the university launched an inquiry after wealthy prospective freshers reportedly planned a competition to have sex with the poorest student they could find.  But experiences of classism and accent prejudice are not confined to Durham, said Sammy Wright, the lead commissioner on schools and higher education for the SMC. He said the government body had spent 18 months examining the differing chances for young people based on where they come from. “We found an entrenched pattern in certain areas where social mobility is very low, and often the only way to grasp opportunities involved moving away from where they were brought up – to go to university or find jobs,” said Wright, who is also vice-principal of Southmoor Academy in Sunderland. “But we also found that social and economic disadvantage often hampered any chance to move out. Accent is a part of this, alongside cultural capital and social networks. In my own work in schools in the north-east, accent can become a marker of everything else, a tangible barrier – most of all to the young people themselves, who internalise a sense of social inferiority.” Wright said well-meaning university outreach teams were consistently failing in their efforts to reassure working-class students. “They promise their institutions are friendly and welcoming, but when that message comes in a home counties accent from bored middle-class students who have been sent into the north to deliver the message, my students are rightly sceptical.” The Sutton Trust, a charity that helps young people from disadvantaged backgrounds access higher education, called on top universities to do more to ensure an inclusive and supportive environment for all undergraduates.  Sir Peter Lampl, the trust’s founder and chair, described the experiences of some students as “scandalous”. “It’s really tough for young people from low-income backgrounds to get into top universities. For this and for other reasons, it’s completely unacceptable that they are discriminated against while they’re there,” he said. Analysis by the Office for Students (OfS), the government’s higher education regulator, shows that virtually all communities with the lowest levels of access to higher education are in industrial towns and cities of the north of England and the Midlands, and in coastal towns. For example, the most recent data shows that 55% of young people in London go into higher education but only 40% in the north-east. The OfS director for fair access and participation, Chris Millward, said the issue of accent prejudice spoke to deeper inequalities in the education system. “It is crucial that universities strive to create an open and inclusive culture for all. There is no such thing as a ‘right’ accent or background for higher education – all students deserve the opportunity to thrive, no matter where they come from,” he said. Sara Khan, a vice-president of the National Union of Students, said working-class students were sold a “myth of meritocracy”, but in some cases the reality was starkly different. “As long as working-class students have to pay for education, work alongside their studies to cover basic necessities, and are saddled with debt for the rest of their lives, higher education will never be a welcoming environment for them,” she said. “It is unfortunately inevitable that in a system like this, such students would face prejudice and harassment, which is only the tip of the iceberg regarding the classism in our education system.” The Russell Group has been contacted for comment.",education
"England and Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has locked horns with Tory MPs in a Twitter row over the footballer’s campaign to extend free school meals (FSM) to cover holidays. Fresh from scoring Manchester United’s winning goal against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday evening, Rashford told his followers he would be paying close attention to the FSM vote in the Commons on Wednesday and “to those who are willing to turn a blind eye to the needs of our most vulnerable children”. His message was repudiated by former Brexit minister Steve Baker, while Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield, tweeted “extending freebies are a sticking plaster not a solution”. Rashford, who recently became an MBE in the Queen’s birthday honours list, has been widely praised for his intervention on tackling food poverty among children. However, Baker rejected the footballer’s suggestion that anyone would be turning a blind eye and flagged up the risks to the economy. Labour will use an opposition day debate in the Commons to call a vote on the issue, with a motion: “That this house calls on the government to continue directly funding provision of free school meals over the school holidays until Easter 2021 to prevent over a million children going hungry during this crisis.” In a post on Twitter, Rashford said: To which Baker responded: “No one will be turning a blind eye and it is wrong to suggest anyone would. Not destroying the currency with excessive QE [quantitative easing] is also one of our duties.” Then when Rashford asked Baker to turn on his comments and let him respond, Baker countered: “You have 3.4M followers Marcus, to my 96K. The power is yours here. Everyone knows feeding hungry children is a top priority. I’d like to see UC [universal credit] boosted. But if the economy and currency collapse, the poor will be devastated. Alleging a blind eye is just wrong.” Undeterred, Rashford also took issue with Bradley, who tweeted: “Gov has lots of responsibilities: supporting the vulnerable, helping people to help themselves, balancing the books. Not as simple as you to make out Marcus. Extending FSM to sch hols passes responsibility for feeding kids away from parents, to the State. It increases dependency.” Rashford responded: “Ben, the economy already pays a high price for child hunger. If children were fed properly you would increase educational attainment and boost life chances. @KelloggsUKI calculated we would spend at least £5.2M a year on lost teaching hours as teachers are caring for hungry kids.” According to research by Labour, almost a million children living in areas in England that are subject to tier 2 and tier 3 enhanced coronavirus restrictions will lose access to free school meals over the holidays. Asked about Bradley’s comments, a Downing Street source said: “The prime minister thinks the free schools meals programme is very valuable, and that is why it was extended by the Conservative government. We’ve got a whole range of additional support to make sure that children and their families don’t go hungry during the pandemic.”",education
"An estimated 1 million pupils have signed up for free school meals in the UK for the first time during the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced many families to cope with a significant drop in their income. Around 1.4 million children were already enrolled on the scheme. We want to understand more about how the scheme is working for families who receive free school meals, and speak to those who have signed up for the first time during the pandemic. We’d also like to speak to school staff who provide the meals about the rise in uptake as a result of coronavirus.

"Students from northern England are being ridiculed over their accents and backgrounds at Durham university, and even forced out, according to a report compiled by student. Lauren White, who is in her third year at the university, said “At first when they mocked and mimicked my accent, I sort of went along with it, even laughed, but then when I persistently became the butt of jokes about coalmining and started to get called feral because I was local it started to feel malicious,”  We’d like to hear from students at other UK universities about whether they have had similar experiences.

"Among the many miseries inflicted by Covid-19, the cancellation of the school Christmas fair – that annual event that compels parents to pay £5 to buy back the toy they donated a week earlier – may not rank highly. But alarm is growing over the loss of this and other fundraising events hosted by parent teacher associations (PTAs) to plug the gap in schools’ finances. Research by the charity Parentkind shows its 13,500 PTA members have lost as much as £42m in fundraising in 2020 because of the pandemic. The figures are especially bleak given that over the past decade state schools in England have faced their worst decline in funding since the 1980s, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Meanwhile, coronavirus has heaped higher bills at headteachers’ doors, such as setting up online learning, hiring more supply staff to cover isolating teachers, and heftier cleaning costs. Some schools are also stepping in to feed disadvantaged children in the holidays. If PTA funds were buying “extras” before the pandemic, now they may have to cover teachers’ salaries and basic supplies. At Brookland infant and nursery school in Barnet, north London, the parent association used to raise an average £14,000 a year, says its headteacher, Brenda McCafferty. “We have always used it for projects such as a new toilet block, interactive TVs and a games’ area outside, as parents like to know what they are spending their money on.” This year, because of Covid, the PTA’s summer fair, Bonfire Night and cake sales have been cancelled, and the school did not benefit from its usual summer site lettings, leaving a £30,000 hole in its budget. “The government has told us that we can’t claim back loss of income, so we’re now forced to look at staffing costs. It is extremely difficult to balance the books. We will have to rely more on parental contributions and PA funding,” McCafferty says. Not all schools can ask parents for money. Carol Rogerson, of the support group PTA+, says the impact of coronavirus on PTAs “will definitely widen the gap between rich and poor”. She says: “I’m seeing quite a few PTAs in deprived areas say they can’t fundraise at all this year because they simply can’t ask.” Projects on Rocket Fund, a crowdfunding platform for schools, include an appeal to buy food for vulnerable pupils’ families and a £7500 request for the hire of 30 computers. In other schools, it is business as usual. “At some west London schools, fundraising is almost a competition as to who can put in the most money,” says Rogerson. “I know of a PTA [in an affluent area] that’s raised £6,500 from selling face masks, more than a lot of PTAs make all year. We always advise asking the local community and speaking to local businesses, but many of those are hard hit too.” PTAs are not, however, all unused bunting and empty collecting tins, and some have run socially distanced events. In Weybridge, Surrey, the Friends of St James’ primary school set up a relay race over the summer. “Any families that wanted to take part sent me their address and I plotted them all on a map,” says the co-chair, Daisy Huntington. “Each child had to run to the house of their nearest classmate, who would then continue the relay. People cheered from their doorsteps and the relay ended at the school gates. “It was emotional for everyone – the first time in two months that any of the kids had seen each other, or their teachers. And it raised over £12,000.” But most PTA fundraisers during Covid have been virtual. “Normally we do discos, movie afternoons, arts and crafts events, and three big fairs with as many as 700 people attending, raising £30,000 a year,” says Deborah Azagury-Slattery, chair of the PTA at Sinai Jewish primary school in Brent. “This year, it’s been a struggle, but we’re trying to be imaginative and ran a virtual family fun day, with online entertainers, arts and craft, raffle prizes, and bingo, which raised £4000.” At small schools, PTA cash can be even more essential. “We have even more things that school needs to buy this year,” says Louise Stiff, a PTA member at Plaxtol primary, a Kent village school with only 97 pupils. “We’re looking to fund things like technology to enable teachers to run online learning, new handwashing facilities in the playground and marquees to help keep the bubbles safe outdoors.” Her PTA, which usually raises £23,000 a year, brought in £3,500 from a virtual summer fair where children took part in sponsored at-home egg and spoon races, while animals, including a hedgehog, stick insect, tortoise and spider were entered into a money-raising virtual pet show (a dog called Dottie won). PTAs are increasingly asking parents to sign up to lottery schemes such as Your School Lottery to raise money, as well as requesting sign-ups to shopping affiliate schemes such Amazon Smile, and Give As You Live, where a proportion of sales are passed back to the school.  Kate Atkins, head at Rosendale school in Lambeth, says increasingly, PTAs are being asked to focus on children’s wellbeing. “Schools are being called upon to do more and more, for example on mental health and wellbeing, while funding has not increased,” she says. “So we rely increasingly on PTA funds to support children and their families to cope with the additional stresses they face. “These funds should be provided equitably to all schools via the government; however at the moment schools are having to use PTA funds.” Of course, the sweet spot is a PTA event that raises funds and boosts children’s spirits. At Harold Wood primary, in Romford, east London, the PTA is working on “a community Christmas Fayre – totally different from anything we have ever done”, says its secretary, Lindsey Philpot. “We will have pop-up stalls on people’s driveways instead of all crammed into a school hall. The children cannot wait.” 1 Distanced trails or a treasure hunt Organise for families to put a poster of a certain letter or image in their window, plot a map with all sites marked, and charge a few pounds for the map and a treat for the end. 2 Spare change challenge Give each class an empty bottle (the same size, such as a 2 litre drink bottle) and set up a competition to see which class can fill it with change the fastest. 3 Sell pre-packed crafts (such as jewellery making, make a soft toy with stuffing etc) where the PTA can buy in bulk and children can make something at them home over the holidays, or any lockdown. 4 Selling treats prepared according to anti-Covid hygiene rules in individually wrapped bags for children to enjoy at home, instead of the usual cake sales. 5 Non-uniform or crazy hair day. 6 Movie afternoon A Christmas treat for classes run in bubbles, either after school or during the last day of term. The PTA provides snacks and a film and parents are asked to donate in return. 7 Virtual Zoom party The PTA sets up an entertainer on Zoom and families are charged to join in. 8 Online raffle, auction or lottery Be careful, though, about licensing for selling virtual tickets to a non-physical event – see advice here. For help running a lottery there are operators such as yourschoollottery.co.uk. 9 Clothes drop-off scheme for families to dispose of unwanted goods, with proceeds going to the school. One such operator is bag2school.com. 10 Affiliate spending online PTAs benefit when ever a parent uses a website such as thegivingmachine.co.uk, giveasyoulive.com, or smile.amazon.co.uk to shop from sites including M&S and Boots (the first two), or Amazon.",education
"More than 200 children’s authors and illustrators, including Shirley Hughes, Philip Pullman, Malorie Blackman and Matt Haig, have put their names to a letter decrying the government’s vote against providing free school meals for children in England during half-term. This week, Conservative MPs rejected a Labour motion, inspired by the footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign on child hunger, by 322 votes to 261. Rashford has urged MPs to unite and stop being influenced by “political affiliation”. Published on Friday, the letter, which was put together by the children’s author Anne Booth, says: “Regardless of our individual personal backgrounds, political and religious positions, we all recognise the unique position children and their families have been placed in because of this pandemic, and believe that no child in this nation should go hungry this winter. “We believe children should not have to depend on pot luck charity, and there should be official, organised, government support across the nation to ensure no child experiences the insecurity of hunger as well as the stress of the pandemic.” Booth told the Guardian: “Caring about children is the job of authors. We want them to be happy, we visit them at school. We know hungry children can’t read or learn. I was so depressed by that vote, I can’t bear that children are going hungry. We’ve got billionaires and shell companies making money from this pandemic, and we can’t afford to feed children?” Booth said her husband, a former teacher, used to provide breakfast to his students, and that she frequently spoke to teachers about the issue of hungry children in their classes. “Hungry children can’t concentrate – and so immediately you are setting them on a path for the rest of their lives,” she said. “If this government are going to talk about feeding children economically, it is an investment to feed every child.” Booth said she had to close the letter after being inundated with messages of support. “I didn’t expect so many people were feeling so desperate about it. So many authors have told me they had free school meals. And writers are struggling right now, so there could be some who have hungry children themselves. There is not a small subsection of undeserving families who don’t feed their children. People are suffering in England in this pandemic. All children should be looked after.” Other signatories include the children’s laureate Cressida Cowell, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, David Almond, Joanne Harris and David Baddiel. “If more of those MPs read Shirley Hughes as children, they’d be much kinder people now,” said Booth. Several local authorities and restaurants have decided to take independent action, with Rashford sharing offers from restaurants across England. The London councils Redbridge, Hammersmith & Fulham and Southwark, and Liverpool council are offering to pay for daily lunches from Monday. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, is also offering 1,000 Co-op vouchers for children across the region.",education
"My father, David Cassar, who has died aged 71, was a dedicated educator and advocate for special needs schools. For 20 years he was the principal and chief executive of St Mary’s Wrestwood in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, which he turned around to achieve “outstanding” gradings from Ofsted, earning personal praise from inspectors. The children who attended had complex needs, including physical, social and educational. Most of them thrived during their time at the school, often against the odds. Many learned to walk, or speak, or read, with the help of the specialist staff. David believed their needs could not be met in mainstream education and advised the government throughout the 1990s. When policy changed to bring more children into the mainstream, he warned of the limitations and dangers. He was born in Paulsgrove, Portsmouth, one of eight children, two of whom died in infancy, of Maltese parents, John Cassar, a cabinetmaker, and his wife, Josephine (nee Sultana), who worked in a factory. They had come to the UK after the second world war and met in Portsmouth. David always considered himself Maltese. His parents’ English being limited, young David filled in all the family forms, and read letters and bills for his parents.  He attended St John’s RC secondary modern school in the city, leaving at the age of 16 to work in construction. Aged 17 he had a motorbike accident, which left him with one leg shorter than the other. He spent a year learning to walk again. His mother died suddenly when he was in his early 20s – he decided to change his career direction and went to Leicester University to study for a degree in youth and community work. He spent a year in the Bronx, New York, and came back to the UK to become youth and community worker at Impington Village college, Cambridgeshire. He then became the first youth and community worker for Waveney Valley in Suffolk. Deciding to train as a teacher, he attended Avery Hill College, Greenwich, in London, and in 1981 went to teach woodwork and design technology at Peckham girls’ school. In 1983 he moved to Burlington Danes secondary school in White City for three years and in 1986 he became principal of South Lodge in Hertfordshire, a boarding school for girls with emotional difficulties. There he was able to combine his experience of community work and teaching, and he thrived in the role. In 1991 he moved to St Mary’s Wrestwood, which at the time was struggling. He made it into a glowing success. After retiring in 2010, he sat on the bench at Hastings magistrates court, where he continued to influence people’s lives. David was a committed socialist, who gave me the Marxist manifesto as a 16th birthday present. He was a long-time union member and rep of the NUT (now NEU). When at the age of three I declared myself vegetarian, he soon joined me and became a vocal advocate for the cause. He married and divorced three times and is survived by his three children, Joseph, Jessie and me.",education
"The independent regulator of qualifications in Wales has recommended that all timetabled exams should be scrapped next summer, apart from a single paper for each A-level subject, as schools continue to grapple with disruption due to Covid. Qualifications Wales (QW) told the Welsh government there should be no timetabled exams for GCSEs and AS-levels, and that grades should be awarded based on coursework and a set of external assessments taken during the year. Schools and colleges in Wales should be given flexibility over when assessments take place with a number of “windows of opportunity”. The assessments should be set and marked by the WJEC exam board to retain the rigour of external assessment. QW said that dropping timetabled exams, under secure conditions, posed “some risk to public confidence” but it was a reasonable compromise, allowing schools greater flexibility and external assessments would be fairer than school-assessed grades. On A-levels, the regulator proposed that students should sit one timetabled exam per subject, along with coursework and other set tasks, with an additional “backup” opportunity to take the exam if a pupil is ill or self-isolating. In a letter to the Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, QW said: “The current public health crisis means that we cannot be confident that timetabled examinations will be able to take place as usual next year. We are, therefore, proposing different assessment arrangements that provide greater flexibility, without the need for significant additional contingency measures. “For the most part, our proposals move away from reliance upon timetabled exams and all of them include the ‘banking’ of some assessment evidence prior to the summer that could be used to generate results if schools were closed.” The single A-level exam would enable students in Wales to apply for higher education places next summer, alongside their peers in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where A-levels are being retained. Education minister Kirsty Williams will consider the proposals and make an announcement on Tuesday, 10 November, when pupils are back in school after the Welsh “firebreak” to reduce Covid transmission. The Scottish government has cancelled National 5 exams, which are roughly equivalent to GCSEs, and replaced them with teacher assessments and coursework. Northern Ireland is keeping exams, but has asked schools to keep evidence of pupil progress as a contingency measure. The UK government, meanwhile, has announced that GCSEs and A-levels will go ahead in England, but three weeks later than usual to allow for more teaching time and with some reduced content. Head teachers are calling for a rethink, warning that pupils have lost too much learning time and may be unable to sit exams due to illness or self-isolation. All exams were cancelled in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland this summer after schools were closed to all but vulnerable pupils and children of key workers because of the pandemic.",education
"One weekend in May, when Vicky Blake, the new president of the University and College Union, was supposed to be helping her father with some decorating, she realised she could not lift her arms. “I felt I’d dissolved from the inside out and there was just no power left in my body,” she says. It was the start of months of what her doctor thinks is long Covid, with symptoms including “brain fog” and total exhaustion. But with so many of her members terrified or angry about being expected to teach face to face on campuses where Covid is spreading, and her union fighting to force institutions to move courses online, this has not been a time to slacken off. Blake talks articulately and at great pace, stopping only to apologise that she may be rambling because she could not sleep again last night. She is spilling over with the personal stories she hears all the time – accounts from anxious lecturers, some supporting an elderly relative or with a partner who is immuno-suppressed, told to teach face to face. Stories about academics self-medicating for stress, or support staff bursting into tears on campus because there have been job cuts, and they can’t cope with the huge load on their shoulders. While the UCU’s general secretary, Jo Grady, is often seen as the “front woman” for the union, Blake feels her own job is to listen to the personal stories and spot the trends across the sector. “There is so much job insecurity that they are really frightened to speak out,” she says.  Staff at what Blake calls the frontline, who are teaching face-to-face seminars in rooms she says are sometimes not properly cleaned or ventilated, are frequently paid by the hour, or on casual contracts. She notes that many counselling staff, who are currently under crippling pressure, are now on short-term contracts. Blake knows first-hand how it feels to be insecure in academia. In 2013, at the age of 30, she was struggling to finish her PhD at Durham University while juggling eight different hourly paid academic contracts at Durham and Leeds. In the end she had to abandon her PhD and academic dream because of the lack of stability. When she took on the union job in June, she was working in a full-time support role as a widening participation officer at Leeds. “I never have finished my PhD and it’s a massive regret. But when I look at what I was trying to juggle it was just stupid. I’m not surprised I couldn’t do it in the time I didn’t have.” But it is not only university staff who are on her mind at 3am. It is the students, too, some of whom are joining the rallies she is hosting online from a quiet corner of her parents’ dining room. She tells me about an academic friend distressed by the faces of his online students. “He sees these faces that were so full of hope and now it’s abundantly clear how stressed they are. As the weeks go by the mood is shifting, and he says he can see the worry, the disappointment.” Another academic she knows is feeling wretched because, after hearing about students struggling to feed themselves, all she wants is to make home-cooked food for everyone self-isolating on her campus. Blake says she “vividly” remembers “the nervous feeling in my stomach” when, aged 18, she arrived at Durham from Somerset to start a degree in natural sciences. She was “nerdy” and had an eating disorder. “I was so scared that no one would like me and so relieved when I found my friends.” Like many students, she made some of her strongest friendships beyond her corridor in halls, and suspects she would have found today’s experience of living in a “bubble” with immediate neighbours very lonely. There are now reports of students killing themselves, Blake notes. While, sadly, mental health problems on campus had reached a serious level long before Covid-19, she is convinced some deaths are linked to the pandemic, with students, isolating in tiny residence bedrooms that were never designed to spend whole days in, let alone weeks, struggling with anxiety and depression. “Students should never have been placed in the situation they are,” Blake says. She argues that vice-chancellors have “sidelined the scientifically informed, serious concerns of unions”, in favour of “peddling the fiction of a Covid-secure campus where an only slightly modified experience was waiting for students”. She feels this misrepresentation is a missed opportunity – universities should have campaigned together, alongside unions, to force the government to give them a proper support package. Such support would have enabled them to tell students to stay at home, without the fear of a financial black hole if students deferred or dropped out, she says. Despite the UCU’s Covid dashboard this week logging nearly 34,000 positive cases in UK universities since the beginning of term, most vice-chancellors say the union’s position on shutting down most activities on campuses indefinitely is unrealistic. As one said: “Education matters. Covid-19 will be with us for at least another year – maybe longer. The question is: do we shut down now and watch lives ruined, or do we step up and find a way through it?” Blake becomes angry when she hears this. “That’s so patrician. To pretend you’re forcing people on to campus in a deadly pandemic for their own good, because they need to be learning to be independent and doing their own washing,” she says. “I can’t articulate how furious that makes me.” Her fury is, in part, because she feels universities are trying to portray her union as “a bit hysterical – and it is not lost on me that we are a union led by women at the moment”. The union’s campaign is based on far more than emotion, she says. New documents released by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, revealed that it advised weeks ago that all university and college teaching should be online “unless face to face teaching is absolutely essential”. “Vice-chancellors say they are being realistic,” she says, “but what is more realistic than looking at the scientific evidence, or learning from the more than 200,000 Covid cases in US universities and colleges this term?” She says the only debate the government seems to have any appetite for is how to get students home for Christmas. “They are deflecting from the current huge problems in universities by focusing on the holidays. It’s just crazy. Many students want to go home now.” With union branches balloting members on how the Covid crisis is being handled, the fight is only just beginning. “Staff in universities are exhausted. They are frightened about their safety and that of their students, they are angry and, overwhelmingly, they are disappointed,” Blake says. “But we believe in following the science. We are fighting for that and our students and our jobs.”",education
"England’s exam regulator Ofqual was riven by uncertainty and in-fighting with the Department for Education before this year’s A-level and GCSE results, with the government publishing new policies in the middle of an Ofqual board meeting that had been called to discuss them. Minutes of Ofqual’s board meetings reveal the regulator was aware that its process for assessing A-level and GCSE grades was unreliable before results were published, even as Ofqual was publicly portraying its methods as reliable and fair. The minutes also show repeated interventions by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the DfE, with the two bodies clashing over Williamson’s demand that Ofqual allow pupils to use the results of mock exams as grounds for appeal against their official grades. Ofqual’s board held 23 emergency meetings from April onwards. As the publication of A-level results on 13 August drew near the board met in marathon sessions, some running until late at night, as controversy erupted over the grades awarded by its statistical model being used to replace exams. Williamson wanted the regulator to allow much wider grounds for appeal, and on 11 August Ofqual’s board heard that the education secretary had suggested pupils should instead be awarded their school-assessed grades or be allowed to use mock exam results if they were higher. Ofqual offered to replace its grades with “unregulated” unofficial result certificates based on school or exam centre assessments, but that was rejected by Williamson. Negotiations over the use of mock exams continued into the evening of 11 August. In the middle of the day’s second emergency meeting the board discovered that the DfE had gone over its head with an announcement that “was widely reported in the media while this meeting was still in session”. The meeting ended close to midnight. During the controversy, Ofqual published and then abruptly retracted policies on the use of mock exam grades the weekend after A-level results were published, with three separate emergency meetings held that Sunday. Shortly after, Ofqual backed down and scrapped its grades in favour of those assessed by schools for both A-levels and GCSEs. The minutes show that Ofqual had serious doubts about the statistical process it used to award grades, with a meeting on 4 August hearing that the board was “very concerned about the prospect of some students, in particular so-called outliers, being awarded unreliable results”. The board’s members “accepted reluctantly that there was no valid and defensible way to deal with this pre-results”. But despite the board’s doubts, Ofqual officials continued to insist in public that its results would be reliable. Roger Taylor, the Ofqual chair, wrote in a newspaper article on 9 August that “students will get the best estimate that can be made of the grade they would have achieved if exams had gone ahead.” Ofqual also issued a statement on 10 August saying it wanted to “reassure students that the arrangements in place this summer are the fairest possible”. Separate details of meetings held between the DfE and Ofqual – obtained under a freedom of information request by Schools Week – show that Williamson met Ofqual twice in the two days before A-level results came out. Williamson held 10 meetings with Ofqual to discuss the 2020 results from March until A-levels were published on 13 August, while the schools minister, Nick Gibb, attended 16 meetings. The records also show that DfE officials held 55 meetings with Ofqual specifically to discuss the summer’s exam results.",education
"Thousands of Britain’s child-health specialists have joined forces to condemn the government for its refusal to fund free meals for disadvantaged children in England over the school holidays, amid a spreading grassroots campaign on the issue led by England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford. With a growing number of councils and businesses this weekend offering to provide free meals, more than 2,000 paediatricians across the UK have signed a letter expressing their shock at the decision. They state that ensuring children have enough to eat is one of the “most basic human responsibilities”. The letter, co-ordinated by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and seen by the Observer, says: “Every day, we see the impact of hunger and malnutrition in our work as paediatricians. It is not unusual for us to care for children who don’t have enough to eat or who don’t have access to a substantial meal outside of what is provided in school. “We call on the UK government to match the pledges of the Welsh and Scottish governments and the Northern Ireland Executive, to continue to provide children from low-income backgrounds with free meals over the coming weeks and to then extend this at least until the Easter school holiday.” The letter praises Rashford as a “source of inspiration” for his campaign, which continued to attract a groundswell of support last night. Hundreds more businesses have signed up to help provide meals this weekend and scores of councils, including prominent Tory-led authorities, have agreed to fund local programmes. An online petition set up by Rashford now has more than 700,000 signatures, while Labour is planning to embarrass the government by holding another Commons vote on the issue. Russell Viner, president of the Royal College, told the Observer that he had “rarely seen such anger among our members”. He added: “We care for children who don’t have enough to eat. We see far too many of them. It is heartbreaking that it has become a normal part of our jobs and hunger is all too common for millions of families in the UK. There is an opportunity to put this right. It is pointless to talk about levelling up the country, an ambition which we support, while refusing to offer temporary relief to children and families.” The intervention comes amid frustration among many Conservative MPs, who want the decision to be reversed before the Christmas holidays. One senior figure said ministers were making a “massive mistake” by refusing to back Rashford’s campaign. Rashford’s successful campaign to provide food vouchers during the summer holidays is estimated to have cost £126m. However, other Tory MPs caused anger by criticising the free meals drive. Ben Bradley, the Mansfield MP, was accused of linking free meals with “crack dens” and “brothels” in social media comments. He said his remarks had been taken out of context. North Devon MP Selaine Saxby apologised after appearing to criticise businesses giving away free food. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, also faced a backlash for a withering response to a 16-year-old constituent who had questioned his opposition to extending free school meals. Ministers are also facing criticism after it emerged that schools in some of the most deprived areas of the country were told they will not now receive the laptops to help pupils learn remotely. Allocations of laptops for disadvantaged pupils have been slashed by around 80%. A Department for Education spokesperson said allocations of laptops were being “more effectively” targeted to the children, schools and areas of the country that have “greatest need”. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already extended free meals during school holidays until next Easter. In Northern Ireland, children will be given meals over this month’s half-term break. Official figures from earlier this year suggested 1.4 million disadvantaged children were eligible for free school meals in England, but that is thought to have increased during the pandemic. The concern among child health experts heaps further pressure on ministers. Dr Max Davie, officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “We’re a rich country. We shouldn’t have to fight for food vouchers when we’re in the middle of a pandemic.” Dr Liz Whittaker, consultant paediatrician at St Mary’s Hospital, London said: “Missing meals isn’t just about going hungry on an individual day, it has a lasting impact on a young person’s life. It is impossible to justify any argument that this saves the state money.” Meanwhile, Covid cases continue to mount. A further 23,012 positive tests were announced on Saturday, along with 174 more deaths. A further 1,139 were admitted to hospital. Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, called on the government to rethink and overhaul food provision for poor children. “The government has got to sort this,” he said. “They need to sit down with people like Marcus Rashford and his taskforce, which has got some of the biggest food companies involved. They need to set out a long-term plan to combat child food hunger, not only looking at rolling out free school meal vouchers at Christmas temporarily during the coronavirus pandemic, but also rolling out breakfast clubs, introducing a holiday activities programme, and examining [the level of support in] universal credit.” Late on Saturday, former children’s minister Tim Loughton became the latest Tory to call on the government to change course. “I will now lobby ministers to reverse this decision for the Christmas break,” he said. However, ministers insisted that there was a “better way” to deal with the issue of child hunger. Baroness Barran, the civil society minister, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “The government has made over £200bn available to protect people’s incomes and people’s livelihoods. We have worked very closely with charities who operate food banks across the country. There are different approaches to how we do this but we have used all the levers possible to try to make sure that people are safe and well as we go forward. “We have provided more money through universal credit, we have provided more money to local authorities and we believe that is a better way of approaching this problem.”",education
"A quarter of nurseries and childminders in deprived areas of England say they will not get by beyond Christmas without additional income, according to a survey. The poll by the Early Years Alliance (EYA) found that low demand for places and inadequate government support during the Covid pandemic could result in mass closures of childcare facilities. Overall about one in six providers said they could close by Christmas, and just over half said they would require emergency funding to stay open over the next six months. Nearly two-thirds said the government had not provided adequate support during the coronavirus crisis, and only a quarter expected to make any profit between now and March. Mumsnet’s CEO and founder, Justine Roberts, said that without affordable childcare some parents would be unable to work, and she called on the government to intervene as a matter of urgency. “This has been a disastrous nine months for maternal employment and women have also borne the brunt of school and nursery closures during lockdown,” she said. “Many families just will not be able to cope without nurseries and early years settings.” The poll of 2,000 childcare providers found an average fall of 21% in occupancy levels compared with last year. The government says it is supporting the sector by “bulk-buying” early years places, but the EYA says in many cases the money is not reaching the frontline.  Neil Leitch, the EYA chief executive, said many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders were reaching the point of no return. “There is absolutely no excuse for the government’s continued indifference towards the early years sector,” he said. “It claims that children’s access to education during the pandemic is a top priority, and yet it is apparently perfectly happy to see thousands of early education providers fall by the wayside.” Michelle Angus of CheekieChops Childminding, based in Sunderland, said: “I childmind children from six months old to 12 years old. In March, I had 45 children on my books, but today I have 18. I have just done my accounts and have lost three-quarters of income compared with this time last year. I have had to end the employment of one assistant and reduce the hours of other assistants already.” Sharon Brayer, the manager of Busy Bees pre-school in New Milton, Hampshire, said: “Busy Bees has been running for 28 years and we do not know how much longer we will be open. New children have not taken up their places. We lost money during lockdown and still are. Staff are suffering with mental health issues. If we had more financial support to sustain us, it would be one less thing to worry about.” The EYA is calling for an emergency early years sufficiency fund for childcare providers at risk of closure, which the research analysts Ceeda estimate would cost £240m over the next six months. A Department for Education spokesperson said nurseries, pre-schools and childminders had already received significant financial support over the past months and would further benefit from the government’s 2020/1 funding package of £3.6bn for free early education and childcare places. Judith Blake, the chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said: “It is essential that we have enough childcare places to support families to ensure the country can recover from Covid-19, both economically and socially.” Tulip Siddiq, the shadow minister for children and early years, said Labour had been saying for months that the childcare sector was on the brink of collapse. “Today we learn that this collapse is now imminent and set to begin just as families enter the toughest winter for a generation. As ever, this will hit the most deprived communities hardest,” she said. “Urgent action is needed by the government to save the nurseries and childminders that working parents and children rely on. It is now or never to save the childcare sector, and it has to be now for the sake of our economy.”",education
"Warnings by the equalities minister against teaching key concepts of racism – such as white privilege – “as fact” risk having a silencing effect in UK classrooms, a teaching body has said. Penny Rabiger, a co-founder of BAMEd, a network representing black and minority ethnic school staff, says the government’s direction could be damaging. Educators say they are finding it frustrating that teaching about racism could be treated as controversial. Pran Patel, a former assistant headteacher who provides anti-racism and unconscious bias training to UK schools, says: “White privilege is straightforward: white people don’t deal with racialised systemic discrimination. That’s the reality of the society we live in. “The consequences of white privilege are there to see: the pay gap for black and minority ethnic people, the fact black people are 40 times more likely to be stopped and searched and more likely to be sectioned. Saying we need to be really balanced about that, I find problematic.” This year, following the death of George Floyd in America and Black Lives Matter protests across the globe, many UK headteachers, who had slumbered on the issue of racism, have been sharply awoken, while their students confidence to speak out has been boosted by high-profile support and petitions for more representative curriculums. However, just as schools were implementing new anti-bullying policies and curriculums to include black perspectives, in October the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, warned that teaching about white privilege “as fact” without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views would be breaking the law. Invoking the 1996 Education Act, which forbids the promotion of partisan political views, Badenoch, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, said schools that “openly support the anti-capitalist Black Lives Matter group” were in contravention of their “statutory duty to be politically impartial”. What does this mean for teachers? If a GCSE student comes across the work of Richard Delgado or Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, scholars in critical race theory, should a teacher steer clear of their questions? After all, Badenoch said, “this government stands unequivocally against critical race theory”. Or if a year 6 student finds something about white privilege on Instagram, should teachers be explaining it as a reality – or as a “contested political idea”, in Badenoch’s words? Rabiger says: “The minister’s remarks could have a silencing effect. The risk of what she has said is a bit like section 28 and gay rights, where you’re not allowed to be seen to be ‘promoting’ a particular view. This is scaring people away from the trickier questions. I would have no problem teaching about white privilege. As long as you’re teaching about the social factors and being balanced, that’s not against the law.” Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, brought in by Margaret Thatcher’s government, banned the “promotion” of homosexuality and “acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”. This had a chilling effect on teachers. Critics said the legislation “cast a cloud of confusion and ambiguity” and many schools opted simply never to discuss homosexuality. It was repealed in 2003. Teachers do need to be equipped for the toughest questions, says Rob Carpenter, chief executive at the Inspire Partnership, an academy trust with nine primary schools across south London and Kent. He and his team decided to “frame our leadership meetings around different books, like Hashi Mohamed’s People Like Us, or Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge. “We take a chapter and that then turns into a discussion about ‘what does that mean for us?’” he says. The idea is for staff to engage in some of the trickiest conversations among themselves first, so they feel more prepared heading into the classroom. These texts tackle issues such as white privilege. But what about teaching it to kids? “We wouldn’t explicitly teach about white privilege in a non-contextual way, but we would approach the theme of social justice and equity within the context of a historical period,” Carpenter says. In June, 12 days after the death of George Floyd, Omie Elizabeth Dale published an open letter to Stanground academy, in the largely white city of Peterborough, about her schooldays there.  It detailed shocking instances of racism, including students saying “n***** lips” and “gorilla fingers”, while some teachers laughed at jokes about catching Ebola in Africa or appeared to endorse xenophobic and Islamophobic sentiment. The real issue, says Dale’s letter, was the school’s passivity. “I remember when a large number of students were planning to go on an EDL [English Defence League] march. While they were not allowed to in the end, there was no attempt to understand why they wanted to go.” Dale, who left the school in 2013 and now works in public relations, says: “My letter mainly came from a place of thinking there will be students who may be experiencing the same stuff I had. I had a largely positive experience. It wasn’t really until I left that I was struck by my experience and what was tolerated there.” Wayne Norrie, chief executive, since 2016, of Greenwood academies trust, which runs Stanground academy among its 37 schools, invited her to speak to him and she is now the trust’s adviser on racism and has been asked to join the board. Dale said she was persuaded to get involved because Norrie “does have a real wish to improve the lives of his pupils in every possible way”. Norrie says Dale “explained to me what it was like to be black, walking into a white environment, and how that made her feel”. But he is cautious about quick-fix solutions. “What I fear is tokenism,” he says, “people rushing in and getting it wrong”. The trust is putting together a three-year plan, beginning with surveys to families this term. Some people in education back the equalities minister’s view that white privilege is a contested idea. Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, an English teacher and member of campaign group Don’t Divide Us, says: “I’m very much in favour of schools being places of intellectual inquiry, but what I am not in favour of is telling children they personally are racists or at risk of being racists or are personally oppressed.” She says her group has been contacted by teachers concerned by their school’s approach to Black History Month, or parents whose children have been asked to list the ways in which they are privileged. Cuthbert suggests a compromise for teaching the topics. “You could have a Black Lives Matter speaker in and a Don’t Divide Us speaker in. As an educator, you want to complicate things, not close them off.” Michael Brotherton, a lawyer in the education team at law firm Stone King, says: “Legally, context is everything and delivery is everything. You could have two lessons on white privilege, and one could be balanced and thought-provoking, and the other could be a monologue.” Where schools may run into trouble is proving the lesson was balanced. “Written evidence is always the best evidence. But the lesson plan would only get you so far, because obviously you could have said anything.” He concedes: “There is a risk teachers might run scared.” In her letter about her old school, Dale reserved her strongest warnings for teachers who failed to respond to her questions or proactively tackle racist behaviour. Her little brother is now at Stanground academy. She will be trying to make sure that his questions will be answered clearly by staff.",education
"Four out of five schools with the poorest pupils in England do not have enough devices and internet access to ensure all self-isolating pupils can keep learning, according to a leading education charity. The lack of equipment means schools were having to dip into alternative budgets and that it was the the poorest pupils’ education that suffered during self-isolation, Teach First warned. A socio-economic divide was also underlined by the finding that schools with the most affluent intakes were nearly three times (29%) more likely to use donations to pay for digital devices compared with schools with the poorest pupils (10%). The scale of the need for devices to facilitate online learning during the pandemic was “enormous”, said one headteacher, commenting on the survey carried out for Teach First. “At our school we soon learned pupils were using smartphones to complete homework rather than accessing the school’s online work platform on a suitable device,” added Kathryn Hobbs, the headteacher of David Nieper Academy in Derbyshire. “When it comes to schoolwork, a smartphone just isn’t sufficient – but the hard truth is that some families simply can’t afford the most appropriate IT equipment. For schools to continue to support all of their pupils throughout this pandemic, we need more access to IT devices, but looking into our budget, there’s not enough money to meet the need.” The survey – which also found that nearly three in four (73%) school leaders said they do not have enough digital devices and internet access to ensure all self-isolating pupils can keep learning – was based on data collected by Teacher Tapp, a daily survey app that questioned more than 8,000 teachers each day. Teach First’s chief executive, Russell Hobby, said: “It’s not right that some children will fall further behind at school simply because their families can’t afford laptops and internet access.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said it had purchased more than 340,000 laptops this term to support disadvantaged children. “By Christmas, this will be an injection of over half a million since the pandemic hit,” she added. This was part of more than £195m invested to support remote education and access to online social care, she said. “We are entirely committed to ensuring as many disadvantaged children as possible benefit from receiving a device this term, and ensuring no pupil, no matter their background, loses out on an outstanding education.” Separately, the DfE has asked schools that are not using 4G wireless routers that have been distributed to sign up for a scheme in which they can be handed back and “reallocated” to other pupils. Schools are being urged to sign up to an online portal to see how much data is being used by each router they’re responsible for. The details were included on Friday in an update to government guidance, which notes that remote learning equipment given to schools during the summer term was owned by local authorities and academy trusts. It added that those bodies could choose to transfer ownership of the laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers to individual schools or give devices to care leavers, or children and families with social workers.",education
"Sue Owen, my mother, who has died aged 70, was for many years a teacher in adult education, helping people gain a second chance to achieve qualifications or enter university. She went on to lead a teacher training unit for Manchester’s adult education service, and her final job after retirement was teaching English at the Wai Yin Society, a Chinese cultural centre in central Manchester. She was fascinated by foreign cultures and languages, and mastered German, Spanish, Russian and French. Throughout her life, she would always attempt to learn at least some of the language before going abroad, often to the surprise of waiters or tour guides.Sue was born in a British army hospital in Wuppertal, West Germany, the daughter of Eric Ismay, a British soldier, and Gerda Freitag, a German woman who worked at the British barracks. The family moved to the UK in 1952, but within a year Eric was posted to Korea as a UN peacekeeper, so Sue and her mother spent the next three years in the company of other German wives of British soldiers in a row of tin huts at the army barracks in Hampshire.The family moved house frequently as her father pursued his career. Sue went to seven different primary schools and quickly learned to change her accent as soon as she encountered her new classmates.In 1968, she went to the University of Essex, where she studied politics and Russian, subjects that helped feed her lifelong interest in leftwing, internationalist politics. After university, she moved to Manchester, where she started her teaching career, and married Tudor Owen in 1978. I was born later that year, followed by my two sisters, Rachel in 1980 and Siân in 1989. She gave the three of us a firm moral sense and a clear feminist outlook.She and Tudor were always hugely encouraging and supportive of their children’s ambitions, and, later, the source of irreplaceable help, advice, childcare and love when we had children of our own.After their retirement a decade ago, my parents threw themselves enthusiastically into language, history and art classes, volunteering for a refugee charity, travelling, spending time with their close-knit group of friends, and singing in local choirs. Sue loved to sing – especially Joni Mitchell songs, always adding her own improvisations to the melody.From 2015 to 2019 Sue and Tudor also cared for Sue’s elderly mother, and, after Gerda’s death, Sue organised a trip with other family members to find the site of the Freitag family farmhouse, once in Germany but now part of Poland. It was a powerful moment for Sue to locate its overgrown remains, along with the wooden church where her grandparents had got married and the town hall where her mother had worked at the start of the war.She loved the idea of living as far as possible in harmony with nature – as her mother’s family had done on their farm – and in recent years rewilded part of her garden for this reason. A voracious reader of books and the news, for over 50 years Sue would settle down at the dining table each evening to read the Guardian from cover to cover. She died unexpectedly as a result of an operation – a devastating shock to her family and friends. She is survived by Tudor, her children, and her grandchildren, Ben, Amy and Dylan, who adored her.",education
"The University of Manchester’s vice-chancellor has apologised for falsely claiming to have contacted the alleged victim of a racial profiling incident on campus. Nancy Rothwell told BBC Newsnight on Thursday she had written to first-year student Zac Adan, 19, to apologise after he was pinned to a wall by security guards who demanded to see his student ID. During the interview, she said she had been “very, very concerned” by the incident and had “apologised to the student for the distress that he felt”. However, she has since written to Adan to “sincerely apologise” over the claim. In a YouTube video posted by the university’s media team, Rothwell said the last few weeks had been “extremely difficult” for the university. “Last night, I appeared on BBC Newsnight. It was a difficult interview. This morning, I realised that one of the things I said in that interview, with good intent, was, in fact, incorrect,” she said. “I said that I had written to the student that was involved in a serious incident on 13 November. I found out today that, in fact, that was not included in correspondence to him. I am devastated that I made the wrong remark on national television.” She added: “I can’t tell you how sorry I am about it. I can only commit to the fact that I am passionate about this university, about our staff, our students, and our values, which, of course, include zero tolerance of any discrimination, and support for everybody within it, and I will do the very best I can to uphold those values, and to support our university.” Adan, a student of French and linguistics, said he was accused of “looking like a drug dealer” by the security officers after returning to the university’s Fallowfield campus from a visit to a local shop on 13 November. He told the BBC he had been left “traumatised” by the events. The University of Manchester, which is part of the prestigious Russell Group of universities, has suspended the officers involved and launched an investigation into the incident. Rothwell’s renewed apology over the handling of the incident comes after anti-racism campaigners called for her to resign last week. On Monday night, dozens of students took part in a protest on campus amid growing anger at the university’s handling of the coronavirus lockdown. The university has been at the centre of a series of controversies this term, including the installation of temporary fencing around the Fallowfield campus without prior warning, prompting demonstrations from students. The fencing, which was erected on the first day of the lockdown, cost £11,000 and was torn down by students. A small group of students have also occupied a university building to demand a 40% cut in rent at residential halls after most tuition moved online. A counter-offer of a 20% reduction from the university was this week described as “a slap in the face” by the University and College Union.",education
"As parents and teachers worry about school safety, Ofsted, the schools watchdog, will start a “phased return” to inspections in September, starting with all schools graded “inadequate”, plus a sample of others. Headteachers will get one day’s notice of the visit, which will result in a letter on how the return to lessons is going and what needs to be done, rather than a grading. NO, absolutely not. I accept that Ofsted must continue with their regulatory role, so if they get wind of issues in a school around child protection and safeguarding, they should certainly go in and deal with that. But a fact-finding visit in September would be ridiculous and pointless. The clue is in the name, Ofsted, which stands for the Office for Standards in Education. There are no standards at the moment for what education in a post-pandemic world looks like. There’s no need to spend millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on visits that add to the huge pressure on teachers coping with issues around integration and closing the academic gap. I also think we should be cautious about inspectors going into lots of schools and “bubbles” in September, talking to children in different classrooms and potentially spreading the virus. It costs a lot of money to keep inspectors on the payroll. I think they have had nothing to do during lockdown and want to be seen to be contributing to the debate somehow. And even though Ofsted have given assurances that they won’t judge schools, they will be making some kind of comparative judgment because Ofsted loves creating benchmarks and standards. I think they will put schools into some kind of database, and are being disingenuous about their motives. An Ofsted visit in September could cause way too much stress. Schools have the challenge of preparing to welcome back all students with a second wave of the pandemic on the horizon. We don’t know what the autumn term is going to look like, we don’t know whether schools are going to go into local lockdowns, and we don’t know how much trauma our students have suffered. Headteachers’ focus should be on how they can keep students safe and encourage health and wellbeing, while delivering a programme of learning that won’t be impacted too much by any further disruption. They shouldn’t be thinking about whether they are prepared for an Ofsted visit.  If the purpose of the visit is to do safeguarding checks and to assess the welfare and the wellbeing of the students, I would be in favour – as long as the inspectors come up with helpful suggestions and offer support. Schools have tried their hardest to rise up to the challenge. I would like to see Ofsted bringing solutions, not judging and criticising. YES. Ofsted will look at how schools are getting pupils back up to speed and help school leaders through collaborative conversations, without passing judgments. The visits will not be graded and Ofsted will publish the outcome of discussions with leaders so parents can understand what steps have been taken to help their children back into full-time education. Schools should not be frightened of these visits. Personally, I would embrace the idea and say: come and look at the good stuff that we’ve been doing and let’s share that across the country. If there have been schools that haven’t been able to provide the standard of education they would like, then maybe they can get advice and guidance. Ofsted can share information with leaders about what they have learned from visits to other schools. We need to focus on academic performance as well as pupils’ social and mental health. You can’t separate the two. If you have children who are supported with their mental health but not supported academically, it stores up problems for later on. A lot has been made of the amount of online learning provided by private schools compared with some state schools. If this is because a state school does not have sufficient resources, Ofsted could help support the case for increased funding. If schools aren’t funded enough to have been able to provide materials and laptops in lockdown, then the public and parents need to know that was not the fault of the school. So I would urge school leaders to actually volunteer to have one of these visits. Having Ofsted write about the provision in place will help to show a positive picture of the situation in the vast majority of schools in England. It should also help to raise provision for all children in all schools. YES. We could be going in and out of lockdown for a while and I think there should still be accountability for schools during that period. There’s a potential for education to be really disrupted. I think there’s a place for Ofsted to see what schools are up to and check they are delivering the curriculum, both online and face-to-face. It’s also important that standards are maintained during the September restart. There is a role for Ofsted to check that all schools are doing what is expected of them. But I think it should just be a light-touch visit, checking how things are going and the curriculum schools are teaching, and getting parents’ feedback. Constructive guidance about where a school is falling down and explaining what needs to be done to address that could be very helpful. NO. In principle, I would support Ofsted going in to check that schools have got the support they need. But I don’t want headteachers and governors getting prepared for the box-ticking exercise that I think an Ofsted inspection often is. I think pupils and staff need some time in September to see where the land lies. Going in to check on failing schools won’t be helpful. If Ofsted had concerns about a school before Covid hit, what opportunity do they think those schools have had to put things right? They haven’t had the chance to do anything. Instead of thinking about Ofsted, I want schools to be able to concentrate on making sure everyone is feeling emotionally and physically safe, including the staff.",education
"My father, Robert Cundall, who has died aged 92, took up the chair of chemistry at the University of Salford in 1975, and he formed a new Department of Biochemistry there in 1980. In 1985 he moved to the MRC Radiobiology Unit at Harwell, Oxfordshire, where he collaborated in work on energy migration in DNA until his retirement in 1992. Over the course of his career, Bob worked with research students, postdocs and collaborators in the UK and overseas on a wide range of topics, including photo- and radiation chemistry, free radicals, explosives, the kinetics of polymerisation and pyrolysis and fluorescence spectroscopy. He published 164 scientific papers. Born at Barmby Moor, east Yorkshire, Bob was the only child of Edward Cundall, a seed merchant, and his wife, Clara (nee Deighton). He was educated at Pocklington school, winning the sixth form prize for science and an open bursary in science at St Andrews University, where he obtained his first degree (1950) and then a PhD in chemistry (1954). There he met Margaret Strachan, whom he married in 1952; they had two sons, John and me. He began his working life with ICI’s Nobel division in Ayrshire, which manufactured explosives, before taking up a research fellowship at the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa in 1953, then returning to the UK for a brief period as a Brotherton research fellow at the University of Leeds. In 1956 Bob was appointed lecturer, subsequently reader, in physical chemistry at the University of Nottingham, where, except for a six-month sabbatical as visiting professor at the University of Kansas, he stayed until 1975. He lectured in thermodynamics and researched into photochemistry and radiation chemistry with a group of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. He collaborated with Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds universities, Christie hospital in Manchester and the Cancer Research Campaign laboratory at Mt Vernon Hospital in Middlesex (where he studied the degrading effects of ionising radiation on biochemical systems including amino acids and proteins). From 1972 until 1985 he was co-editor of the journal Progress in Reaction Kinetics. In the mid-1960s he also took over Colonel Brian Shaw’s famous lectures on explosives, which he gave at the Royal Institution in London in 1972. Margaret died in 2004. In 2006 Bob married Betty Rouse (nee Scarborough) and they lived happily in retirement in Oxfordshire. He continued to follow the cricket, especially the fortunes of his beloved Yorkshire, and could recall seeing Donald Bradman bat at Headingley. In retirement he took up woodwork, and made toys for his grandchildren. He liked nothing better than sitting down with old colleagues and friends over a tot or two of fine Scotch whisky to reminisce. Betty died in 2019. Bob is survived by John and me, his grandchildren, Lucy and William, and a great-grandson, Lamayan.",education
"Boris Johnson needs an urgent national plan to get all pupils back to school in England from September, with an army of support staff, the requisitioning of public buildings and extra help for disadvantaged students, unions and cross-party MPs have said. As the government admitted that most primary pupils in England would not get back to the classroom before summer, ministers were urged to set out a comprehensive strategy or risk an “epidemic of educational poverty”. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had hoped all primary schools in the country would reopen four weeks before the summer holidays but was forced to admit on Tuesday that this would be missed because of the difficulty of keeping children apart and in bubbles of 15. Government sources said scientists were reluctant to advise the watering-down of physical distancing rules at this point in the pandemic. Another 286 coronavirus deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with the number of excess deaths since lockdown hitting 63,000 – a toll believed to be greater than anywhere else except the US. Announcing the U-turn in the Commons, Williamson said he hoped all schools could return by September but could not guarantee that would be achieved. New statistics showed that just one in four eligible children in reception, year 1 and year 6 returned last week, undermining Johnson’s plan to allow parents back to work to boost the economy. Teaching unions warned that a September start for all pupils should not be taken for granted, and called for a national recovery plan for education. “The consequences of Covid-19 are going to be felt in our education system for months to come,” said Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU). With fears of a second spike in infections, the NEU is advising the government to develop a national approach to “blended learning” combining education at home and school, with increased support for disadvantaged children, including free internet access. There have been growing concerns about the disparity in quality and quantity of online learning available to pupils since lockdown.  The union also suggested the requisitioning of local public spaces, including libraries and community centres, to reduce pressure on school space. “The scale of the challenge is immense,” said Bousted. “We need a national recovery plan for education along the lines of the job recovery plan.” A string of Conservative MPs – including the former education ministers Robert Halfon and Tim Loughton – called on the government to consider radical measures to help pupils lagging behind after missing up to six months of education. Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, warned there would be an “epidemic of educational poverty” without more assistance for those most at risk of falling behind. Loughton suggested catch-up schemes and mentoring over the summer using “National Citizen Service youth workers … or mobilising the many students who are now delaying going to university and will find it hard to travel or get a job”. Labour also called for ministers to consult unions, headteachers and parents on a new timetable for reopening, saying the government “need[s] to face up to the scale of damage this is doing to children and scale up their response”.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, said: “The starting point for this needs to be rapid action to support summer schemes for this summer.” The SNP suggested England could follow Scotland with a plan for blended learning and use of libraries and council offices to relieve pressure on classroom space. Scotland has also suggested retired teachers could consider returning to the classroom. Williamson admitted helping children catch up could take “a full year and more”, but resisted the idea of summer schools. He said schools that were not able to reopen would be given “basic minimum curriculum requirements we expect them to deliver for all children”. If the need for physical distancing persists in schools, more staff will have to be recruited to teach smaller classes, potentially from the thousands of disillusioned teachers who have left the profession in recent years over workload and pay. About one in five teachers (22%) quit within the first two years, rising to two in five after 10 years. According to official statistics, just over half of primary schools in England reopened to more pupils from 1 June. Williamson said that figure had now risen to more than 70% of primary schools. Schools will be permitted to open to more age groups if they have space, but not all have the facilities to keep children 2 metres apart, particularly those in smaller urban buildings. Defending the government’s approach, Williamson said: “We believe this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. While we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer, we continue to work with the sector on the next steps where we would like to see schools that have the capacity bring back more children to do so before the summer holidays … We will be working to bring all children back to school in September … Exams will take place next year.” While Labour and the unions said the delay was right, the decision was met with dismay in some quarters, as the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, warned that children’s education was being forgotten while theme parks, pubs and shops were being allowed to reopen. She called on the government to come up with a coherent plan to make up for children’s lost education and show the same level of determination that led to the opening of emergency Nightingale hospitals and the introduction of the furlough scheme to save millions of jobs. Schools may have to build additional portable buildings or find temporary accommodation in sports halls or empty offices to accommodate more children safely, she said. “Some worry that the economy is clearly being prioritised and education is not being prioritised at the same level. From everything that’s been said, [children] could be going to theme parks and sitting in pub gardens with their parents, or they could be shopping, but they will not be in school. That seems to be the wrong way round. The risk is that children will get left behind in this lockdown. “Time has a different meaning for children – two months, six months is a lifetime when you are 11 years old. Like us, children are worried. They are worried about whether life will ever be the same again. Will normality ever return?”",education
"At this time of year, it’s the custom for final year students at the University of Birmingham to have their picture taken holding their dissertation in front of Old Joe, the red brick clock tower in the centre of campus. But Nathan Clarke, who recently finished his history degree, missed the photo opportunity when the coronavirus lockdown began. “Campus was shut before I was able to hand in,” he says. “I had to hand in my thesis online and was robbed of an Instagram post.” Like many of the class of 2020, Clarke’s graduation ceremony has been cancelled and replaced by a virtual event. “The end of university has been anticlimactic,” he says. “Not being able to celebrate is a great shame – particularly for my mum, who had already picked out her dress.” As term draws to a close, graduation ceremonies across the UK have been cancelled or postponed to the disappointment of students’ families. “I was the first person in my family to attend university and it was a big deal for my grandma, in particular, to see me in my gown,” says Kelly Williamson, who studies at Edinburgh Napier University. “We’d already paid for a hotel, so that added stress to the situation. My family members have some long-term health conditions so I don’t know if they will be well enough to attend the next ceremonies that go ahead.” Ruth, who studies Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, regrets losing the chance to say goodbye to her friends. “My ceremony has been postponed, but there will be a virtual ceremony this year. The gown hire company offered to post a cap and gown to my address to ‘celebrate your achievement at home’ – but my mum wants to attend an actual ceremony, so I’ll wait. I wouldn’t have minded missing it because it’s expensive, but it would be amazing to see all my classmates one last time – especially the international students who had to fly home.” Some students are still isolating on campus. Ruby Forrester, an English literature and religious studies student at Cardiff University, has stayed in the city with her housemates because she suffers from asthma and her parents work for the NHS. “Two of my housemates also stayed in Cardiff with me, which was a saving grace. We celebrated my housemate’s 21st by turning our bedrooms into fake bars and going on a bar crawl through the house,” she says. The lockdown has also disrupted assessments, with students forced to write dissertations away from libraries and to sit exams online. Bill Bowkett, who studies politics at the University of Kent, says his exams have been rearranged into 48-hour open-book essays to ensure students graduate on time. But Bowkett says the system is flawed. “I see why they have done them, but when exams are open-book, they are no longer exams. The level playing field has been lost. I am never guaranteed a quiet space at home, with seven people in total. My siblings are out of school and my parents are working from home. Not everyone has access to a reliable internet connection or technology that will enable them to access online resources. It will be those who are the most economically disadvantaged who will suffer the most.”For students like Ashling Sugrue, whose film and television degree at the London College of Communication includes practical work, the transition has been more complicated. “The crowning achievement of our course’s graduates is a short film. The lockdown hit on the exact week we were supposed to fly out to Spain for the shoot. Now nobody in the year has that calling card that the short film was supposed to be, so we’re all anxious about how we’re going to find work once the lockdown has ended. I’ve pictured my graduation so often and strove to get the best grades so I could really relish the feeling. Now I guess I’m getting my diploma in the mail instead.” Among the biggest concerns for this year’s cohort are their future job prospects; the Bank of England’s chief economist has warned of a significant increase in unemployment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Conor O’Brien, a history and American studies student at the University of Manchester, is worried by the impact of the pandemic on his ability to find work after graduating.  “I feel the inequalities of the job market will only be exacerbated,” O’Brien says. “The pandemic has shown the cracks within British society and only a radical overhaul will prevent millions of young people like me from becoming victims of a different type.”",education
"A leading teaching union has warned the prime minister that plans to reopen schools more widely next month fail to address that coronavirus poses a greater risk to black and minority ethnic pupils and staff. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, called on Boris Johnson to ensure that the government’s approach to reopening state education will address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME people. In his letter, the union leader requested urgent clarification from ministers that they would fulfil their legal duties under the Equality Act “to prevent further discriminatory impacts related to the transmission of the coronavirus”. Early figures on the incidence of Covid-19 showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were black or from another minority ethnic background, despite BAME people making up only 14% of the population, according to the last census. Roach said the higher transmission and mortality rates have provoked “a real sense of anxiety and fear among many BAME teachers”. He also criticised the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for its failure to address ethnicity in their recently published analysis of the risks posed by reopening schools. “We can’t have a colourblind approach to the relaxation of the current rules to protect against this major public health crisis,” said Roach. The leaders of Birmingham city council wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, last week calling for “further guidance … for schools with large BAME communities on the implications of reopening”. The council leader, Ian Ward, and the cabinet member for education, skills and culture, Jayne Francis, wrote: “The vast majority [of BAME parents] have stated that they will not be returning their children to school on 1 June [due to] their concerns on the disproportional impact on them as black parents if their child were to contract the virus and bring it home.” Jackie, a black British teacher at a school in south-east London which is due to reopen next month, said she felt like she was in limbo due to the lack of government advice on the specific risks the virus posed to BAME pupils and staff. “They have not addressed it properly,” she added. “We’re not being told what the risk is. Am I more vulnerable because of my age and ethnicity? I would like to have the evidence.” Carol, a black British agency teacher in north London, has switched from primary to secondary school teaching partly due to concerns that she would be more at risk of contracting the virus in early years education where children need more hands-on assistance. She said she had experienced symptoms of Covid-19, which she had been told were likely contracted from someone at school who was asymptomatic. She was also concerned that her son, who is teaching vulnerable children during lockdown, was at risk. “Sometimes the children were spitting and the school didn’t even want him to wear a mask.” The NASUWT said it was not satisfied that the government’s plans to test, track and trace the spread of Covid-19 were sufficiently robust to reopen schools. “It’s premature to be moving down that route when that infrastructure isn’t in place,” said Roach. Sue Harte, the headteacher of John Stainer community primary school in Brockley, south-east London, who has decided not to reopen next month, said she had received no information about test, track and trace. “I honestly have got no sense of where the government are with that,” she said. A Department for Education spokesman said schools should be “especially sensitive to the needs and worries of BAME staff, parents and pupils”, and consider if measures need to be put in place to address them.",education
"Monty Losowsky, who has died aged 88, played a crucial role in the establishment of the largest teaching hospital in Europe, St James’s in Leeds, a task he performed with the quiet authority, modesty and calm that were his hallmarks. A distinguished consultant, he was the opposite of the domineering caricature, slight in build with a gentle voice that lowered the temperature at tricky committee meetings and held lecture theatres silent so that everyone could hear. Never a bow-tie or pinstripe man, he was described by the author Alan Bennett, who became a friend when Losowsky was treating the TV presenter Russell Harty in 1988, as looking like someone who had come to mend the ward’s radiators. Harty’s hepatitis B proved fatal, but Losowsky’s persistent transparency with the media, in spite of initial gross intrusion, established trust and became a model for handling similar high-profile cases. My admiration for him, as a journalist, then became friendship.  He was born in the East End of London, where his parents, Solomon and Dora (nee Gottlieb), whose families had fled pogroms in Poland in the 1900s, worked in tailoring. The second world war played havoc with Monty’s education as successive evacuee billets saw him shuttle between 14 different schools. But the challenges brought out the best in him, and in later life he recalled the kindness he experienced in the temporary homes he stayed in. Once he found a bit of continuity at the Coopers’ Company school in London he became a star pupil there. Monty’s early medical career, after qualifying at Leeds University in 1955, included stints in Paris and at Harvard University in the US, where work in the celebrated liver unit at Boston City hospital set him on the specialist path in which he would make his name.  On his return to Britain from Boston in 1962, Monty became a consultant at Leeds General Infirmary and set up a clinical research unit into liver disease. He was then asked to look at the possibilities of extending teaching to what became St James’s university hospital, and in 1969 became professor of medicine there, charged with starting academic departments in the muddle of redbrick buildings around the city’s former workhouse. The project flourished and he helped to guide it until his retirement in 1996, in the process transforming the hospital from being an also-ran into its current eminence. He was dean of the university’s medical school between 1989 and 1994 and appeared in Jimmy’s, ITV’s “real life soap opera”, which ran from 1987 to 1997 and added to the hospital’s fame. He wrote more than 350 research papers, served as president of the British Society for Gastroenterology, and helped to found the Coeliac Society, now Coeliac UK. Retirement did not end his devotion to Jimmy’s: he played a crucial role in the creation of the Thackray Medical Museum there, which was based on the hospital campus. Monty’s other interests included bold DIY projects and conducting history tours around St James’s.  He is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Malkin), a teacher of deaf children whom he married in 1971, daughter Kate and son Andrew.",education
"Melz Owusu has addressed research seminars, given a TED Talk and performed raps at academic conferences to try to decolonise higher education. But eventually the Phd student and former sabbatical officer at the Leeds University union came to a realisation: “I was like, hmm, this idea of transforming the university from the inside and having a decolonised curriculum isn’t going to happen with the way the structures of the university are.”  After listening to the experiences of black students, Owusu began to see the problem was that universities are “built on colonisation – the money, buildings, architecture – everything is colonial”. This sparked the idea of a Free Black University to “redistribute knowledge” and place black students and a decolonised curriculum at its heart, rather than as an add-on. A GoFundMe campaign launched to finance the project has raised more than £60,000 since being set up this month, and won backing from both the University and College Union and National Union of Students. Owusu, who studied politics and philosophy at Leeds and will start a PhD in epistemic justice at the University of Cambridge in October, is “super-excited” at the success of the fundraising campaign, which aims to raise £250,000 to get the project up and running by the autumn. Most of the money so far has come from large numbers of individual donations, ranging from £5 up to a few hundred pounds, with larger sums gathered through fundraising events. A key aim, however, is to persuade universities to “redistribute” money to the initiative by making an annual donation. The Free Black University will benefit their students and the community as a whole, says Owusu. Campaigns along these lines by student activists have already started at Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan, Leeds, Exeter and UCL. Owusu sees this as a way not only for institutions to fulfil their promises to current black students, but as payback for the role they have played in the progress of racism, from benefiting from donations by slave owners to developing the study of eugenics. “A lot of universities we have seen with Black Lives Matter have been putting out statements about ‘we’re in support of black lives’ but we hear from black students all the time that they leave university traumatised,” says Owusu. “They fail. They experience racism all the time and the university doesn’t necessarily deal with that in the best way, or deal with it at all.” The idea for the free university had been brewing for a while but the recent surge of interest in Black Lives Matter, following the death of George Floyd, has brought it to a head, says Owusu. “It feels like there is a growth of collective understanding of how deeply racism is entrenched in our society and realising how little has been done to challenge that at the core. “We decided to launch it at this moment because, one, it was ready to be launched and, two, the world’s eyes are on how do we actually make black lives matter, and one of the ways I think that will happen is through transformative education.” A small team of PhD students, recent graduates and student activists is putting together the project with the aim of having a legal structure in place before October. The plan is to deliver open-access online lectures exploring radical and transformational topics, build an online library of radical readings, develop a journal and podcast, provide a members’ space for black academics who need support, and hold an annual conference bringing together black radical thinkers. The curriculum will be centred around sociological, historical and philosophical approaches to black liberation but could move into more scientific and creative areas. Eventually, applying for degree-awarding powers may be an option, so long as those involved feel it is possible to do without becoming institutionalised. An important element of the project will be a space of community and care for black students, connecting them with black therapists, counsellors and community healers to offer a range of support. Members of black and minority-ethnic communities are at greater risk of developing mental health conditions, with some research suggesting that experiencing racism can increase the chances of developing depression. In the longer term, with enough money, the aim is to have a physical hub including teaching rooms, a bookshop, restaurant and healing areas in one of London’s most diverse neighbourhoods, such as Brixton or Lewisham. While other races will be able to benefit from the open-access resources provided, the main focus of the project will be the black community, to make up for the fact, Owusu says, that “black students and the black community in general have not been able to access the current spaces that are within academia in a fair and consistent and safe way”. There is plenty of evidence to back this up. Figures published last year by the Office for Students showed white students were much more likely to be awarded first class or upper second class degrees than black students, with the gap between the two groups 20 percentage points or more in nearly half the universities in England. Earlier this month, freedom of information requests revealed that only a fifth of UK universities had committed to decolonising their curriculum and only 1% of professors at UK universities are black. Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, says: “The reason this campaign is really important and has received so much support, particularly from black scholars and students in academia, is they know how difficult it is and how damaging it is for your own sense of self worth to navigate through a university system that is at best ambivalent towards you, and at worst openly hostile.” Fope Olaleye, NUS black students officer, says: “We welcome the Free Black University as it will fill a gap for black students within a sector in urgent need of change. “We would invite higher and further education providers to put their money where their mouth is and financially support it.” But Deborah Gabriel, founder of Black British Academics, a network of scholars committed to enhancing racial equity in higher education, is not convinced it is the answer. “While there is certainly merit in finding solutions to the prevalence of white privilege and systemic racism outside the present system, I think that the notion of a ‘free’ university is perhaps overly optimistic,” she says. “Sadly, nothing is free and therefore such a model would be unsustainable.” A more realistic response, she says, would be to establish partnerships between UK higher education institutions and the historically black colleges and universities in the US, which, although founded as a result of segregation, now tend to produce black graduates who do better than those from mainstream institutions “because of the sense of worth, value and belonging”. A spokesman for Universities UK says many institutions are already developing a more inclusive programme of learning, which includes reviewing their curriculums and reassessing reading lists, as well as conducting liberation or decolonisation activities. But Owusu argues a more radical approach is needed – a “reprieve” and a space where the black community can find “access to a curriculum and teaching staff where everyone looks like them”.",education
"Ivy league Princeton University has announced it will remove President Woodrow Wilson’s name from the institution’s School of Public and International Affairs due to his history of racism. In a statement released Saturday, the university president, Christopher Eisgruber, said the decision came after a “thorough, deliberative process”, five years after a group of student activists occupied his office in protest against the faculty’s dedication to the controversial 28th president. The removal of Wilson’s name from the faculty – which will now be known as the School of Public and International Affairs – comes as many institutions across the US are facing protests and campaigns over controversial dedications and monuments. The movement, which has seen statues of Confederate figures targeted as well as those of figures like Christopher Columbus and Spanish conquistadors, is part of a wide-ranging national debate over racism, sparked by the killing of George Floyd, who was African American, by a white police officer in Minneapolis. In a statement, Princeton’s trustees said they had considered “whether it is acceptable for this University’s school of public affairs to bear the name of a racist who segregated the nation’s civil service after it had been integrated for decades”. It was, they added, “a question … made more urgent by the recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Rayshard Brooks, which have served as tragic reminders of the ongoing need for all of us to stand against racism and for equality and justice”. Wilson is credited with improving educational standards at Princeton and he was honored with the creation of a faculty dedicated to public and international affairs studies, as well as a residential complex. While he is remembered as a progressive, internationalist statesman, Wilson’s reputation is clouded by his racist policies in other areas of government when he was president from 1913 to 1921. Wilson segregated federal workers in Washington DC, blocked a proposal to include racial equality as a founding principle in the League of Nations, and hosted White House screenings of the racist 1915 film Birth of a Nation, which celebrated the founding of the Ku Klux Klan. He was seen as accepting of brutal racial segregation in the south as a way of keeping the peace. In the New York Times in 2015, the lawyer Gordon Davis, whose grandfather was demoted in his civil service career as part of a systematic purge of the federal government, wrote that Wilson “was not just a racist”. “He believed in white supremacy as government policy, so much so that he reversed decades of racial progress. But we would be wrong to see this as a mere policy change; in doing so, he ruined the lives of countless talented African Americans and their families,” Davis wrote. In his announcement, Eisgruber said the steps – Wilson’s name will also be removed from halls of residence – were a necessary reckoning, but only part of the picture of dealing with racism, both past and present. “These are not the only steps our University is taking to combat the realities and legacy of racism, but they are important ones,”’ Eisgruber said, adding that he hoped the changes would provide “a firm foundation to pursue the mission of teaching, research, and service that has defined our highest aspirations and generated our greatest achievements throughout our history and today”.",education
"Class sizes in England’s state secondary schools have ballooned to their largest size for nearly 20 years as a result of last decade’s baby boom, which teaching unions say underlines the difficulty of containing potential Covid-19 outbreaks. Official data from the Department for Education (DfE) shows that secondary school rolls increased by 81,000 pupils at the start of the academic year, pushing the average class size to 22 and the average size of a secondary school up 2% to 986 pupils. Overall, the number of state school pupils in England rose to nearly 8.9 million, with the numbers set to increase again in September.  The government is preparing to ditch a string of physical distancing restrictions to meet Boris Johnson’s pledge that all pupils will be able to return to the classroom. The government is to announce next week that the use of smaller “bubbles” in primary schools – comprised of 15 pupils kept together with one teacher – will be dropped in favour of larger bubbles comprising an entire class. In secondary schools, the advice is likely to see entire year groups treated as one bubble, as suggestions that older pupils be kept apart within schools are dropped, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph. But teaching unions said the new data from the school census underlined the difficulties for schools with crowded classrooms. The National Education Union (NEU) said that nearly a million schoolchildren were being taught in crowded classes with 31 or more pupils, which it described as “shocking”. “The prime minister knew this when he stated last week, and again in the Commons on Tuesday, that schools must open fully to all pupils every day from September,” said Mary Bousted, the NEU’s joint general secretary. Headteachers are adamant that any forms of physical distancing for pupils and staff can create logistical issues. One noted that while secondary school year groups of pupils could be contained, in many cases teachers regularly taught across different year groups, exposing them to greater risk. James Bowen, director of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “These figures should be ringing serious alarm bells for the government. They point to a system that was already under huge strain before the coronavirus pandemic put schools and colleges under enormous extra pressure. “Parents too will be concerned by the number of pupils being educated in class sizes of 31-plus. The government needs to address this problem urgently and make sure that all schools have the resources they need to keep class sizes at a manageable level.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said questions remained about how sixth-form and further education colleges would operate. “We will want to understand the public health guidance which underpins the approach to full reopening,” Barton said. “This is important for the confidence of parents, pupils, and staff. And, as none of us know what the coronavirus situation will look like in September, we think it would be sensible to have a plan B if the conditions do not allow for a full reopening. “We would also caution that a full return in September will not be school or college as normal. There will be a raft of safety measures in place, and we all need to prepare ourselves for the likelihood that there may be localised full or partial closures if there are outbreaks of the coronavirus, and this may be the reality for some time to come.” The DfE’s school census also showed that 35% of primary schools were now academies, and 77% of secondary schools. The department announced that it was postponing the introduction of the new reception baseline assessment planned for primary schools in England in September. The assessment, which aims to gauge the abilities of children at their entry into formal schooling, has been delayed until 2021 “due to the challenging circumstances faced by schools in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic”, the DfE said.",education
"More than 250 former pupils at Westminster School have signed a letter demanding that it combat the “toxic culture of racism within the student body”, promote the teaching of black culture and confront its links with the slave trade. It is one of the first indications that Britain’s public school system is now coming under pressure to follow the example of many universities and examine how it tackles racial and colonial issues. The letter, to the outgoing headmaster Patrick Derham and his replacement, Dr Gary Savage, explains how “recent events surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement” have forced the pupils to examine what they were taught at the prestigious school whose political alumni include Nick Clegg and Dominic Grieve. While praising the school for “taking a constructive approach to learning”, the former pupils said “our education fell short in educating us about the great privilege that we had as predominantly white students of a public school”. The pupils complain that during their time at the school they did not read a single book by a black author and that black history and Britain’s role in the slave trade were largely ignored. “Schools such as Westminster, with all its privilege and power, have a duty to ensure its students are actively anti-racist, and equipped to contribute to a fairer and more equitable society,” the pupils claim.  The letter notes that the school has a house named after Richard Hakluyt, who promoted the English colonisation of the Americas, and boasts a society named after John Locke, whose Constitutions of Carolina justified slavery. It also has a statue to Elizabeth I, whom the pupils describe as “the monarch who began the English colonial project”. The UCL Legacies of British Slave ownership website reveals that Westminster School has at least 28 alumni linked to the slave trade. These include William Beckford, a former lord mayor of London who inherited an estate in Jamaica with 3,000 slaves. Dr Miranda Kaufmann, a historian whose blog promotes greater understanding of black British history, welcomed the pupils’ intervention. “There’s been quite a lot of movement on this among universities over the last couple of years but I’m not very conscious of many schools doing much. But … the pupils need to think personally about what they can do as well.” The letter also claimed that racist incidents at Westminster had been brushed aside. “It would be great to hear from you what concrete measures you have taken, or intend to take, to reverse a longstanding toxic culture of racism within the student body, which has long gone unpunished,” the pupils ask in their letter. In a statement, Westminster said it had established a “challenging racism committee” made up of staff and pupils and that it was reviewing its procedures to identify ways in which it could “ensure a diverse school community that is truly reflective of the multicultural city in which we live”.",education
"The eminent trade unionist Fred Jarvis, who has died aged 95, was distinguished by his lifelong passion and commitment to education. A president of the National Union of Students in the 1950s, he was the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers from 1975 until 1989, when it was the biggest teacher union in Europe. He was a member of the TUC general council from 1974 until 1989 and its president in 1986-87. It was his fate, having had the opinion formers and a large public on his side during the 60s, to have reached the top of the NUT during the Margaret Thatcher years, and to find that he had enemies. The years 1985 and 1986 were marked by highly unpopular teachers’ strikes in London. Within three years, with Jarvis still at the helm, the NUT had lost two of its main privileges: the ability to negotiate teachers’ pay directly with their employers, the local education authorities; and teachers’ de facto control of the curriculum, which was ended by the Education Reform Act 1988. But in a sparkling account of his life and times, You Never Know Your Luck, Reflections of a Cockney Campaigner for Education (2014), Jarvis portrayed himself as a fortunate man. He was born, and had a happy childhood, in a working-class family, in West Ham, east London, where his father, Alfred, was a screener in Spillers’ flour mills. His mother, Emmie (Emily, nee Jones), took the education of young Fred and his brother, Dennis, seriously, and an uncle who had married into the middle class stirred a precocious interest in politics. Fred escaped unscathed from the bombing of the East End during second world war and, a few years later, the fate of many of his army comrades who died while serving with him on the Normandy beaches. He himself was able to write newspaper articles from the dugouts. On being demobbed, Jarvis took up a cause he had been investing in since his early teens: rights in education. At Plaistow secondary school he had written an underground student news-sheet and when caught, changed its name from the Martyrs’ Own to Invicta, which got the headteacher on his side. In 1941, Spillers moved north to Wallasey, Merseyside. Fred’s ability to get himself noticed was quickly on show at Oldershaw grammar school and in the local communist fronted youth movements. He chose the one that did not have adults in charge. This was to lead to a local youth parliament and after the war getting himself adopted as the Labour candidate for Wallasey in the 1951 election, though he did not win. By then he was, however, already deep into student politics. He had become chair of the National Association of Labour Student Organisations (Nalso), with a seat on the NUS executive. This was while studying at Liverpool University for a social sciences diploma, from which he emerged with distinction. Accepted at St Catherine’s College, Oxford, he studied philosophy, politics and economics. It was there that he met Anne Colegrove, a future teacher and chair of education on Barnet council, whom he would marry in 1954. He decided to put politics before trying to get a first at Oxford. Shirley Williams, a contemporary, remembered a sophistication that made him a “man among boys”. Also by then he was openly fighting the harder left Socialist Society. Except in regard to Anne, a member of the Socialist Society, and thereafter always known as “Fred’s Red”, this was the cold war by proxy. A taste of the real cold war came soon afterwards, through the executive of the NUS. Jarvis’s initial interests focused on its role in the International Union of Students. He was a delegate at the 1950 IUS conference in Prague, Czechoslovakia. With the Stalinists in charge, and money rolling in from the KGB, the line was to support North Korea (“Korea”) and to expel the “Titoists”, the Yugoslav student union. Opposing these policies on both counts, the British delegation was treated as Public Enemy No 1, even physically taunted. While this gave Jarvis lasting friendships with leading Europeans on the same side, Olof Palme and Guy Penne (a future African emissary for François Mitterrand) among them, it was a struggle to get support from the NUS executive, not just to disaffiliate from the IUS but to help found the ISC (the International Student Conference). His presidency of the NUS, 1952-54, was marked by successful campaigns for student grants modelled on the grants ex-serviceman had received and from which Jarvis himself had benefited. He also ran an anti-discrimination case which was taken up by MPs. This, in turn, got him noticed by the NUT, to which he was recruited in 1955 as an assistant secretary. Four years later the NUT created for him, and pioneered for unions as a whole, the job of head of publicity and public relations. Jarvis fizzed with ideas. In 1959 he gained backing for a massive education and careers exhibition at Olympia, in London, under the patronage of the young Queen. He got her not only to be the patron, but to come in person. In 1961 the NUT supported him in putting together an independent commission on the need to invest in education “for national survival”. Its members were big names and the issues taken up in several later government commissions of inquiry. Then, two years later, dozens of organisations supported a non-party campaign to make education an issue in the forthcoming election. The case for comprehensive schools and raising the leaving age figured. When Labour won in 1964, Harold Wilson, the new prime minister, gave an NUT-supported lecture within weeks on education as embodying the hopes of society as a whole. And Jarvis continued to get significant support for the public interest campaign, the Council for Educational Advance. In the 70s the climate changed. The political debate on the vastly expanding education service turned to issues of economic effectiveness and accountability. The expansion of the teaching profession, which went with comprehensive education and the raising of the school leaving age – policies that fitted the NUT’s core strategy of boosting its membership and its bargaining muscle – were showing up some shortcomings in schools. The NUT was slow to notice that teachers were no longer the solution: they were part of the problem. The first signs of a public backlash came in 1969 with the Black Papers, launched by two academics, Brian Cox and AE Dyson, attacking low standards in the comprehensives. They were dismissed by an education establishment as the ravings of the New Right, and apparently not taken seriously by Thatcher in her time as minister of education or the new leader of the Conservative party. However, in 1976, the Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, reacted to the horror stories of out-of-control teachers by setting a new policy line. In a speech at Ruskin College, Oxford, he attacked the “educationists’ consensus that the curriculum was a ‘secret garden’”. This heralded the policy swing of the Thatcher years. Jarvis had just become general secretary of the NUT, the first non-teacher to hold the post. His famous luck appeared to be running out. While some of the Jarvis skills helped ensure a pay commission that awarded the teachers a big rise, his executive was split between warring factions of the left. Neither his bonhomie nor his persistence in finding the reasonable political solution could keep him off the defensive. It was also unfortunate that he was knocked down by a car and spent time in hospital when crucial decisions were being taken on the London teachers’ strikes. The Education Reform Act, which Thatcher’s government brought in, was a measure of how far the political pendulum, and public opinion, had swung. The act not only instituted a national curriculum. It diminished the professional status of teachers in removing much of their discretion. When he stepped down from the NUT, Jarvis seemed to be liberated to fight anew for what he saw as public interest issues in education. This included drawing John Major, then prime minister, into a relatively supportive correspondence on secondary schooling. He also believed he could sow some seeds for a future Labour government. From the early 90s he convened a group of educationists – professors, headteachers and local education authority officers – as “critical friends” of the Labour party, to develop its line on education. But in the runup to the 1997 election, Tony Blair followed the Thatcher model of distrusting the teachers’ biggest union and all who had been associated with it. The “Fred group” got nowhere near Blair or his advisers. But Jarvis continued to build on the opportunities his life provided. He pursued his keen interest in politics, education, Europe and, his great hobby, photography in pursuit of his political interests. This led to some great reportorial exhibitions. His unique access to Millbank during the 1997 Labour campaign encouraged him to unearth images of his 50s student politics encounters; and to continue with a series on British schools including his old “Plaistow Sec”, and his lifelong passion, the Hammers, the West Ham football team in whose shadow he had grown up. Jarvis was active in numerous public bodies, including the Franco-British Council and the council of the National Youth theatre. He and his wife were made honorary citizens of Sainte Cécile les Vignes, a wine-growing village in the Rhône Valley, where they had acquired a small house and were neighbours of Penne, their friend from student days. In 2015, Jarvis was appointed CBE, but on the day of the investiture, 14 July, preferred to be in France to celebrate the greatest day in the republican calendar – the start of the French revolution. Anne died in 2007. Jarvis is survived by his son, Robin, and daughter, Jacky.",education
"“It’s great news, to be fair,” said Chris Dyson, headteacher of Parklands primary school in Leeds, welcoming the government U-turn on free school meals (FSM). It’s an issue close to his heart – out of 360 pupils, 213 depend on FSM and holiday hunger is nothing new to his community. What was new, however, was that earlier in the day he found himself on BBC Radio 4 discussing FSM with none other than Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford whose intervention prompted the government’s change of heart. The government U-turn that followed has been warmly and widely welcomed across the sector. As a direct result, the families of about 1.3 million children in England will be entitled to a voucher worth £15 per week per child throughout the summer holiday, which will help alleviate the pressure on household budgets. The reality is, however, that the FSM scheme only covers a minority of children in poverty. Many whose parents are working in low paid, insecure jobs are not eligible and will continue to go hungry over the holidays. Campaigners say many families are already turning to food banks and with the additional pressure of Covid, the food crisis is only going to get worse. Holiday hunger may have hit the headlines in the middle of a modern pandemic, but the problem has been around for as long as school meals – creating the problem of how to feed the poorest children when schools were closed. Back in 1909, two years after schools were able to start feeding pupils, school authorities in West Ham in London’s East End fed eligible children throughout the Christmas holidays. It was morally right to do so, they argued, even though it was unclear whether they had a legal obligation to do so. “The weather was so severe and the distress so acute … that we felt bound on the last day of the ordinary school to announce that the feeding centres would remain open to supply those children who were already in receipt of meals under the Act,” TW Watts, the chair of the education committee, told the London Daily News. The issue arose again following the introduction of the Education Act in 1944. This made school meals a requirement – but was hazy on what should be done for children during the holidays. According to End Hunger UK, some authorities provided holiday meals in the 1960s and 1970s – but most did not. Holiday hunger periodically surfaced as an issue in parliament – if not a cause celebre championed by famous footballers. In 1967 the Conservative MP Dame Joan Vickers argued that holiday hunger “affects the children of the lower paid worker in particular” and that those on free school meals “should also receive them during the school holidays”. More recently, austerity – in particular rising living costs and shrinking real incomes levels for the worst off – has brought holiday hunger to the fore again, with food banks able to plot rising demand from the poorest families over each holiday period, and voluntary initiatives springing up to launch holiday meal schemes. About 3 million children potentially go hungry during the holiday, according to the charity Feeding Britain – one million of them on free school meals and a further 2 million who do not qualify for free meals but whose parents cannot afford to always buy meals, the children who have been labelled “food insecure”. Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Extending the voucher scheme into the summer will help ensure that we don’t see the hardship children are facing get worse in the summer holidays, but it only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals. “We are already hearing of soaring numbers of families being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.” Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation, added: “It shows that the government is listening to the needs of vulnerable children. Of course this is really just the beginning. We think children’s food needs to become much more of a national priority.” Access to food during lockdown has been a particular problem for some families. Data collected by the Food Foundation on food insecurity levels during the pandemic has shown that among households with children, the prevalence of food insecurity increased from 5.7% to 11%. A month into lockdown, the parents of 2 million children said they had experienced one or more forms of food insecurity and more than 200,000 children missed meals because of insufficient food. After seven weeks of lockdown, 30% of adults with children eligible for FSM reported food insecurity, compared with 9% of adults with non-FSM children. While summer holidays have always had a negative impact on the educational levels of low income children, the fear is the additional effect of school closures will put vulnerable children at even greater disadvantage. New research has already shown there has been a nutritional impact on low-income children. A small-scale study from Northumbria University showed that children eligible for FSMs are consuming less fruit and vegetables and more sugary drinks during the lockdown than before. Extending FSM over the summer holidays will be a huge relief for many families, but others will continue to go without and campaigners would like to see a children’s right to food commission to help tackle systemic childhood food insecurity for the long-term. In the meantime headteacher Chris Dyson will carry on putting together food hampers for his vulnerable families and the wider community, distributing 1,000 tins of baked beans, 2,000 bagels and 1,000 boxes of porridge to try to stem holiday hunger, but he too is hoping for lasting change . “Holiday hunger has been around for the last few years, but it’s getting worse and worse every year as the gap between rich and poor gets wider. I know this is a one-off, but I think this could be the start of something special.”",education
"Campaigners have threatened to take the government to court over its decision not to extend its free school meals voucher system for low-income families over the summer holiday period. The national voucher scheme, which is worth £15 a week to recipients, was introduced in March to help poorer families feed their children when schools were closed under lockdown measures. But ministers announced on Thursday that it would not run during the summer holidays, adding that the government had “always been clear” that the voucher scheme would come to an end when schools close in July. Sustain, a food charity and the Good Law Project, a not-for-profit membership organisation, said that if an adequate alternative plan was not put forward in the next few days they would take legal action to reverse the decision in order to protect more than 1 million children at risk of holiday hunger Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, said hunger had no respect for term dates, adding: “Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, we have heard more and more stories of families with children struggling to put food on the table due to having too little money. The situation has got worse as parents lose jobs and income.” Jolyon Maugham QC, director of Good Law Project said: “Millions of families across the country still face financial hardship because of the pandemic. Yet the government still has not come up with a decent plan to ensure kids don’t go hungry. If they don’t, we will take formal legal action.” Responding to the government announcement, Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the General Education Union, tweeted:  The families of about 1.3 million children in England who are on free school meals qualify for the voucher scheme, which was criticised after some parents waited weeks for them to arrive and others were unable to use them in supermarkets. The Department for Education (DfE) said £129m has been spent on the scheme so far. About 5 million people in households with children have struggled to put food on the table each day during the coronavirus crisis, while a third of children on free school meals did not have adequate alternative options, according to estimates by the Food Foundation thinktank. The DfE hinted it may expand an existing programme of summer holiday activities and food for children from low-income families run by charities, though it could provide no further details. The programme covers just 50,000 young people in 17 local authorities in England. The Welsh government has announced it will continue to provide £19.50 per child per week funding to enable councils to provide free school meal equivalents throughout the summer. The UK government has changed tack on vouchers before, originally saying the scheme would not run during the Easter holidays. It changed its mind after an outcry by schools and parents. Vouchers were also available during the summer half-term. Andrew Forsey, the chief executive of Feeding Britain, a charity which operates holiday hunger schemes, said with the summer holidays just weeks away ministers would need to explain quickly how they would fund and organise an expansion of the current arrangements given the scale of demand. He said: “Ideally we’d wish for every family to have adequate funds for food but as that is not going to happen anytime soon we’ll have to formulate as effective response as we can. We are confident we could make a good fist of it.”",education
"The future of the early years and childcare sector is at risk in England, the Early Years Alliance (EYA) has said, as fewer than half of parents with young children plan to take up their childcare places on 1 June. Just over 40% of parents of under-fives say they will send their children back to nursery, preschool or childminders this week, according to a poll by the EYA of more than 6,300 care providers. A further 13% of parents say they are still “completely undecided”.  Three in 10 parents gave the government the lowest possible rating on a scale of one to 10, when asked how clear the government has been on the rationale behind reopening childcare settings. The average rating from parents was 3.9 – where one is “very unclear” and 10 is “very clear”. The results are so stark that the alliance said the early sector in England could collapse. “It is no exaggeration to say that the very future of the childcare sector is at risk if the government doesn’t get its act together and provide the support that providers need,” said Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the EYA, a membership organisation representing nurseries and childminders. “The government’s attitude towards early years settings has been frankly appalling,” he added. “It has refused to reverse its last-minute decision to restrict providers’ ability to access furlough funding; it has refused to offer any financial support to help early years providers meet the additional costs of operating safely during this outbreak, while providing thousands of pounds to schools for the very same purpose; and it has refused to commit to any kind of transitional funding to help the sector get through this period of significantly reduced demand.” The most commonly cited reason for not taking up childcare places from the 4,490 parents who responded to the poll was fear over their children’s safety. This was followed by concern over the safety of their wider family, and anxiety over the safety for staff and childminders. When asked what would need to happen to take up their place, parents cited a sustained fall in the number of coronavirus cases both locally and across the country, and more information from the government on the science underpinning the decision to reopen childcare settings. Some children in England are set to return to school on 1 June 2020 as part of new guidance set out by the government. Initially, this is limited to early years, reception, year 1 and year 6 children.  The Office for National Statistics estimates there are approximately 2.1 million children in the year groups, making up about 43% of all primary school children. The EYA also asked childcare providers in England if they planned to reopen on 1 June. Two thirds of the 6,300 responses said they were planning to reopen, with just over one in five saying they would not and 15% saying they were undecided. The online survey comes after more than 30 early years experts, parent groups and organisations issued a highly critical response to the government’s guidances. The detailed response by experts including Cathy Nutbrown, a professor of education at the University of Sheffield, and organisations including the Association of Educational Psychologists and the Association for Professional Development in Early Years, said the Department for Education’s guidance on reopening early years settings and schools did not provide a safe return for children and threatened their wellbeing and education. The advice, it added, had been “confusing, contradictory or unworkable”.  The government’s guidance, it went on, is “inadequate in addressing the health aspects of safeguarding children and staff, while wholly failing to consider the value or otherwise to the children of rushing them into a new and uncharted scenario with major implications for their education and wellbeing.” Samantha Bailey, from Cheshire East, will be keeping her daughter at home. “We feel that it is too early to be reopening due to the current lack of thorough scientific understanding of Covid-19. The advice given to government from Sage on Friday 22 May also failed to reassure us that the risks are minimal, rather that the risks are not fully known. The increasing number of children with pulmonary inflammatory syndrome in Europe is also a factor in our decision.  “Additionally, my daughter is a suspected asthmatic. We therefore feel it best for her to remain at home due to her personal circumstances. Until the scientific understanding is greater and the level of risk better ascertained with reliable track-and-trace in place (for the safety of staff), we will endeavour to keep our daughter at home.” Cristina Lopez-Bueno, from London, is planning to send her son back to nursery this week.  “I have concerns but as a working single parent feel little option but to send my child back. I am reassured that the nursery will do the best they can to minimise risk although there are still some unknowns. “On balance, I believe the long-term impact on my child of staying home for a longer period of time will not be positive and the attempting to work full-time at full capacity is extremely difficult to manage alongside his care, and in my view not sustainable. The pressure on both of us from this and the fact that we do not have a garden and it is just the two of us in the household is considerable.”",education
"An Oxford college has ordered staff and students to undergo training to combat racial bias after an undergraduate made a “joke” drawing a comparison between protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and flour shortages. The comments, described as racist and trivialising by witnesses, were made during a virtual hustings event by a candidate for the position of “cake rep” – a welfare position on the junior common room committee at Christ Church college. The student, who has since withdrawn her candidacy, was reported to have said: “The US is facing two very important crises at the moment – the curious incident of George Floyd, and the event of flour shortage. “I would like to put forward the motion that these incidents are not two, but rather one. Flour shortage leads to rioting, which leads to death, which leads to racism. And racism leads to death, leads to rioting, and that leads to flour shortage.” A statement issued by the college condemned the remarks as “deeply offensive” and promised concrete steps to combat prejudice, but students have criticised college leaders for their handling of the incident and failing to support those calling out racism. Melanie Nneka Onovo, a second-year student of history and politics, said the hustings followed an emergency meeting she had called to propose a motion to send a donation to Black freedom charities in the US, where there have been outrage and widespread protests following Floyd’s death after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. “The motion passed unanimously, but just 20 minutes later, a Christ Church student – husting for a committee position – made a distressingly unpleasant and distasteful joke about George Floyd,” she said. Onovo was horrified that no one challenged the comments, and said that when she then tried to intervene she was muted and had since been attacked for making the incident public. “I was disheartened that none of my fellow students spoke out at this language … I decided to call the actions out; but I was muted by the moderator. Since then, I have attempted to bring attention to the racism that is rampant in Christ Church, but have been consistently inundated with racially insensitive comments that became increasingly hostile. I have been made to feel isolated and guilty I spoke out.” The incident coincides with a report in HuffPost UK that the University of Oxford has delayed publishing admissions data on the diversity of its students in light of “world events”. Oxford has been criticised for its lack of diversity and has been making strenuous efforts to widen student participation. Christ Church already has a compulsory anti-bias session as part of its induction programme, but the college’s disciplinary officers Prof Geraldine Johnson and Prof Dirk Aarts – known as censors – acknowledged in their statement that it was not enough. “We will therefore work with students to ensure that not only freshers, but the entire community, continues to confront the very real impact of racial bias and all forms of discrimination. “To that end, we will be taking concrete steps to introduce new and ongoing initiatives to combat prejudice and to give everyone –students and staff – the tools to stand up for the values of tolerance and equality that Christ Church embraces today.” The dean of Christ Church, Martyn Percy, was among the signatories to a letter published in the Guardian on Friday from the heads of Oxford colleges pledging to fight systemic racism and discrimination, in response to events in the US. The letter said: “We recognise and regret that, for black members of our community, the unfolding crisis, together with the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on their communities, has caused them particular anxiety, anger and pain.”",education
"Ministers must avoid a “last-minute” approach to reopening England’s schools, the head of the umbrella organisation of unions has said, as the government’s scientific experts prepare to publish evidence about the safety of the move. With just 10 days to go until 1 June, the date named by Boris Johnson for more children to return to classrooms, the TUC secretary general, Frances O’Grady, is pressing the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to establish a taskforce, which would include people from unions representing teachers and non-teaching staff, to work out the details. O’Grady said that without proper planning and communication there was a risk of a repeat of “the chaos and confusion the prime minister’s back-to-work announcement caused”. England’s primary schools have been told to prepare to welcome more pupils from 1 June – but that date has not yet been confirmed, and a growing number of councils have said they will not comply. Welsh and Scottish schools will not reopen on 1 June. “Getting kids back into the classroom must be done in a safe and planned way. As it has done in other sectors, the government urgently needs to a set up a Covid-19 education taskforce with unions and other key stakeholders. We have been pressing Gavin Williamson for this,” O’Grady said. She added: “This will help give confidence to staff and parents, many of whom currently feel in limbo.” The government’s roadmap document said the 1 June date could be delayed if the pandemic was not sufficiently under control. “Changes will be announced at least 48 hours before coming into effect,” it said. In his widely watched Sunday night statement on 10 May, Johnson appeared to suggest more workers in England should be “actively encouraged” to return to the workplace the next day. But the government later clarified that the changes came into effect on the Wednesday. The devolved governments also rejected his “stay alert” slogan and continued to advise people to stay at home. The government’s panel of scientific experts, Sage, is expected to publish a series of papers on Friday covering the evidence behind reopening schools to more pupils. The Department for Education and Williamson have already held several joint meetings with the teaching unions – the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders, the National Education Union (NEU) and the NASUWT – the most recent being on Tuesday, where school reopenings were discussed.The teaching unions say there has been “no shortage” of meetings with officials and ministers, from Williamson down, but that unions representing non-teaching staff have been excluded. A meeting involving all school unions has now been pencilled in for next week.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “It’s good, but belated, recognition by Gavin Williamson and ministers that they need to talk to all school staff unions. “The problem all along is that this government doesn’t understand how schools work. They are highly complex institutions, and if ministers had listened to staff then they wouldn’t have gotten into the mess they now find themselves in, with a widespread revolt among councils.” The government in recent days softened its language around Johnson’s 1 June start date. Headteachers noted that the DfE’s updated guidance issued to schools on Thursday said they should prepare for reopening “from 1 June, at the earliest”. Children in reception, year 1 and year 6 are to return first. Johnson said in his statement that he wanted all primary school students to spend a month in the classroom before the summer holidays. But with stringent distancing measures required, including splitting children into “bubbles” of no more than 15, ministers accept that may not be feasible. Councils and headteachers have said schools do not have the extra space needed. The Scottish government announced on Thursday that its schools would not reopen until 11 August – after the summer break, which begins earlier in Scotland. Even then, schools will operate a “blended model” involving a mix of classroom- and home-based learning.The Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, Layla Moran, said: “Liberal Democrats have demanded from the outset that the government publish the scientific evidence behind their decision to reopen schools. Yet, with just 10 days before schools are due to open, parents and teachers are still being kept in the dark.“This announcement is so long overdue. We all want to get children back in school but the public need answers, particularly [about] the likely impact on the infection rate of these measures.”",education
"When Kelly Rivers left school at 15 she never dreamt she would one day be thrown into the role of teacher to three of her six children, and with no access to a computer, tablet or printer. But that is the challenge she has been facing under lockdown – and she has been finding it tough. “I have to message a friend whose child goes to the same school and ask what their children have been asked to do,” she says. “And I don’t want to keep asking because they have their own problems.” The family, from Dagenham, converted their three-bed house into a five-bedroom home by splitting rooms and turning living space into bedrooms. There is no space for a table in the kitchen. Kelly’s husband, Lee, a cleaner and the sole earner, brought back £750 a month before lockdown. His 80% furlough pay has recently come through: “It’s already nearly all gone as we have to pay rent, council tax and other bills,” Kelly Rivers says. Along with the couple’s three-year-old and three school-age children, the two eldest siblings, Martin, 19, and Jessica, 23, are also at home – plus a two-year-old grandson. “I’m trying to give my children what they need: clothing and food,” says Rivers. She has limited data on her smartphone and can’t let them use it. “I don’t want to allow one child to use it and then not the other, because it causes arguments, so the best thing to say is ‘no’.” Before lockdown the children could use computers at the library or their grandparents’ house, or after-school clubs. Bethany and Ruby, both 14, are in year 9 at different secondary schools, while Scarlett, five, is in year 1 at a local primary. Martin is studying for a BTec in engineering, and is accessing emails from college on his phone and doing his coursework on paper. None of the children’s schools has any spare laptops or tablets they can lend the family, but Bethany’s headteacher has visited her at home, and Ruby’s teachers have phoned to offer reassurance and support. Last month, legal activists from The Good Law Project argued that every school-age child being taught remotely had the right to a laptop or tablet and internet connectivity in their home. After the group announced it would sue local authorities to push the government into action, the government said that in England it would start supplying equipment to care leavers, children with social worker support, and “disadvantaged” pupils in year 10 to 12 preparing for exams. Jolyon Maugham, founder and director of The Good Law Project, says he suspects the government initially failed to anticipate the need to provide laptops and tablets for poorer families. “Education is being delivered online. For more prosperous families that’s not a problem. But poorer families are missing out. My suspicion is that the government has been trying to cover up the slowness of its response. By the time they came to recognise that there were around 1 million children who wouldn’t be able to access education, there was no longer much supply of laptops and tablets.” Headteachers have been expressing frustration at the lack of progress in getting the help on offer. One of them is Vic Goddard, principal at Passmores academy, Harlow, and star of the 2011 BBC programme Educating Essex. He has been promised just 29 laptops and only 13 routers to share between the 200 families at his school who say they do not have enough technology for their children to learn online. “My reaction has been verging on the hysterical,” he says. “It’s so frustrating.” Even the 29 laptops he expects to get from the government have not arrived. “I’ve become increasingly cynical about it all.” As far as he’s concerned, it’s a case of “great headlines, small impact”. In the meantime, to ensure all children have equal access to education at his school, he has stopped offering online learning and is now sending out packs of workbooks for all pupils to complete. Another headteacher says 107 children at her school were eligible for a laptop but she has been offered just 25, none of which has arrived. “I have been getting messages from families daily who need them. How am I going to choose who gets one?” Many schools have been trying hard to reach poorer children. At Parklands primary, in Leeds, one of the most deprived schools in the country, fewer than 20% of children have access to a dedicated tablet, computer or smartphone. The headteacher, Chris Dyson, has been loaning textbooks and ensuring the worst-off families collect food parcels along with their books. “The best home schooling work these children can do is to read. When you read a book, you can get away from all this crisis and go to a new world. “We’re hoping children will keep their love of learning going by doing bits and bobs, but our priority is their mental wellbeing so when they return to school, they come back safe and happy. Then we can start to pick up on the learning they’ve missed.” Maugham is sceptical about whether the government will be able to deliver on its promises and is concerned that, even when schools return, many children from poorer families may not. In a recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, higher-income parents were more willing for their child to go back to school than lower-income parents, despite the fact that children from better-off families were spending up to 75 more minutes a day – 30% more time – on home learning than poorer children. Rivers fears her daughters will not qualify for any government devices because they are not yet in year 10, and she is worried about them falling behind. “The most important thing I can do is to make sure they are happy and they’re not stressed. But at the same time, I want them to do well in their work when they go back to school. I don’t want them to need to do a big catch-up, because that will be more stressful for them” She listens to five-year-old Scarlett read every day, and does her best to encourage her other children to talk about what they were taught in school. A typical day involves TV, board games, books, writing stories or comics, and arts and crafts activities. “We try and spend as much time as we can in the garden – it releases all the steam.”  But the pressure to teach them is taking its toll: “Some days, I just don’t know how I deal with it. I take my hat off to teachers. They need to be paid double.” Rivers is also full of praise for School Home Support, a charity that works with schools to help families on low incomes and vulnerable children. Jaime McDonald from the charity, who is attached to Bethany’s school, has been trying for weeks to get the family a laptop. “She’s been absolutely brilliant, phoning up every day, asking how I am, even popping round to chat to me and the kids from a safe distance, bless her.” School Home Support is rolling out a pilot that will give more than 120 families – including the Rivers family – access to technology and data over the next few weeks, thanks to donations from other charities and tech companies. “We knew that access to technology would be a real issue for the families we work with when the learning went online,” said Jaine Stannard, the charity’s chief executive.  She says some families are facing financial ruin and so have more pressing problems to focus on than their children’s schoolwork. Realistically, she thinks a lot of the children will not return to school until at least September: “That’s a long gap to be missing school.”The children who most need support from their teachers and the government are now further at risk, she says. “They will fall behind. The gap is going to widen.”",education
"A group of senior scientists has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely in England and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The Independent Sage committee, which is separate from the government’s official advisers and is chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says new modelling of coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September would further reduce the risk. The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so new cases are found and isolated fast. “It is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,” Prof King said. In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a vital part of the decision-making process. The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children, with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes. King said the decision of when to reopen schools was a “careful balance” but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. “The current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.” King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Support for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their local area.” The Independent Sage committee will host an online discussion at midday on Friday for teachers, parents, children and union representatives in association with the British Medical Journal and Mumsnet. It will be broadcast on the Independent Sage YouTube channel, the committee’s Facebook page, on Twitter via @independentSAGE and @Sir_David_King, and on the BMJ’s home page.",education
"My friend Peter Rushton, who has died aged 68 of a heart attack, joined Sunderland Polytechnic (now Sunderland University) in 1979 after working for a short while at Wrexham Glyndŵr University (formerly North East Wales Institute of Higher Education). He remained at Sunderland for the rest of his life, becoming professor of historical sociology in 2009. Peter was born and brought up in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the son of Stanley Rushton, a lecturer in statistics, who died when Peter was five years old, and Marjorie (nee Champion), a hospital social worker. His mother had a passion for historical buildings, churches, and historical sites and most holidays included visits to these. Peter inherited her enthusiasm. His interests were wide ranging and his knowledge extensive. Having gained a first-class degree in archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge, Peter completed an MA in sociology at Manchester University, followed by a PhD on early modern witchcraft. His first teaching subjects – criminology and sociology – remained within a repertoire that expanded to include advanced social theories, gender and family studies, punishment and society and, at postgraduate level, law and early modern society. He supervised numerous PhD candidates, and generations of students valued his erudition. During the 1980s Peter initiated a pioneering part-time MA in historical studies that led to a lasting research partnership with Gwenda Morgan. They had great enthusiasm for uncovering secrets hidden in archives and together became authorities on early modern criminal transportation. Only a week before his death Peter completed proofreading their final book, Treason and Rebellion in the British Atlantic, 1685-1800. His other publications and conference papers represented his diverse research interests, including mental health, gender, sexuality, law, the history of Sunderland, and contemporary politics. In 2018, he co-edited, with Catherine Donovan, Austerity Politics: Bad Ideas in Practice. A committed trade unionist, Peter never aspired to managerial positions. He had a strong sense of justice, arguing consistently against unfairness and willingly gave his time to act as a critical friend to colleagues across the university sector. Peter influenced many people, many of whom benefited from his kindness. He enjoyed spending time with a small circle of close friends, who appreciated his conversation. He was keen on travelling and walking and was an excellent photographer. He is survived by his sister, Lesley, and two nephews.",education
"Parents are divided over the prospect of sending their children back to school, a new poll has revealed, as parent groups warned that mixed messages and poor communication had caused widespread anxiety about returning. With school leaders still grappling with the practicalities of reopening primary schools for some year groups in just a week’s time in England, an Opinium poll for the Observer found that 43 per cent of primary school parents and 54 per cent of secondary school parents feel anxious about the prospects of returning. Primary schools have been instructed to prepare to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as their early years provision. However, councils of all political colours have suggested they will not follow the advice, while Welsh and Scottish schools will wait to reopen. There are now also concerns that the return of pupils has become such a chaotic issue that it could worsen the attainment gap between affluent and poor areas and families. Some teaching unions have suggested the families of vulnerable children have been more reluctant to see them return to school. David Laws, the former education minister who now oversees the Education Policy Institute, said that a widening divide was a “significant risk”. John Jolly, chief executive of the parent group Parentkind, said there was confusion about the reopening of schools. “Parents are looking for certainty,” he said. “Some want the certainty of saying schools are safe and we’re going back. Some want the certainty of keeping children out of school until there is a vaccine, which may reflect families with underlying conditions. Then you have other parents that want a clear timeline. “Parents are not convinced about messages around schools being safe. They are not sure about that message from the government, or that the evidence for that is being communicated. There is a lot of uncertainty about the message being communicated by schools locally.” Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, warned the situation on the ground was now “chaotic and increasingly untenable”. “Not only are school leaders having to think about how to reopen schools, but how they convince parents that their children should go back, and organise the school site. Then they don’t know how many staff they will have. Schools are vital for society. But they have to be safe.” However, professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said schools should be allowed to reopen. “Covid-19 generally barely affects children and young people and actually we’ve shown that they are about half as susceptible,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There is no doubt in my mind for children themselves, the balances are clearly in favour of going back to school.” He said the risks to family and the community could be managed with an effective track and trace system and a phased return. While a working track and trace system is seen as necessary for rules around schools and other parts of the lockdown to be loosened, several local government sources warned that councils were now facing a race against time. There have been complaints that local public health officials have been sidelined during the pandemic, despite their expertise. They are now being drafted in as part of several pilots of the track and trace system, but insiders warn they now face huge time pressures. Professor Donna Hall, chair of the New Local Government Network, said: “At the beginning of March, public health directors were quite rapidly cut out of the national pandemic response. They are there for all aspects of public health, working on things like HIV, hepatitis, pandemic flu. Disease control is their job. They are highly skilled … but they’ve been cut out in quite a strange way. “Other countries have deployed local resilience forums for testing and tracing. A national contact centre is never going to get to the granular detail you need for contact tracing. I’ve been out with the people who do it – they are forensic. You won’t get that through an app. It is people on the ground, observing how a disease spreads. It could be from a petrol pump or a salt shaker. That’s the kind of detail needed. “They may be piloting things, but we’ve left it really late for that. Not giving local government a big role is foolish and dangerous.”",education
"Dr Paul Phillips is in what he calls “a very difficult situation”. Weston College, the further education college he runs in Weston-super-Mare, is facing a big coronavirus-shaped hole in its budget. He needs to spend at least an extra £750,000 on Covid-19 safety adjustments and catch-up courses, but expects his revenue from apprenticeships in industries like tourism, hospitality and construction to drop by up to £2m. “I’ve got a massive redundancy issue. I’m already restructuring.” The government this month announced a £1bn education catch-up fund to help English pupils get up to speed with what they have missed in school during lockdown, but it decided that no extra money should go to the 16-plus sector. Now, further education colleges are facing severe financial difficulty and some will not survive the Covid-19 crisis, teachers and college leaders have warned. “Unless the government provides a financial lifeline to colleges next academic year, it is highly likely that some will eventually end up becoming insolvent, and others will have to make significant cutbacks,” said Anne Murdoch, college leadership adviser at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL). The government’s own commissioner for further education, Richard Atkins, admitted last week that around 30 to 40 colleges are currently “at risk of running out of cash”. Speaking to the education select committee, he also warned that colleges’ income would be badly damaged by “a potential 50% plus drop in apprenticeships” from the economic slump. The coronavirus outbreak has decimated the commercial income of further education colleges, which often let out their facilities for conferences and run services such as restaurants and hair salons, staffed by students. Colleges must also meet all the costs of the extra cleaning and social-distancing measures that will be required in classrooms next year as a result of the pandemic, while also facing a reduction in demand for some vocational courses. “So many further education courses are attached to industry and jobs. So if there’s a collapse in the jobs market, you might see colleges reducing the courses that are on offer to young people,” said Niamh Sweeney, spokesperson for the National Education Union. “There’s a very weak relationship between the government’s industrial strategy and colleges. The government doesn’t see that there is a link between good, industrial-related training in colleges and onward employment. This is the biggest industrial slump that the country might ever have and further education is the perfect place to overcome that.” The ASCL said the sector was already desperately short of funding thanks to a decade of austerity and neglect. “There was a funding crisis before the pandemic. The pandemic has just further exaggerated it,” said Philips. “I’m worried that we can’t survive and deliver high quality provision without extra funding coming into the college and the further education sector.” Last week, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that “for decades, we have failed to give further education the investment it deserves”. He ditched the “absurd mantra” of wanting half of all young people to go on to higher education and promised to create an employer-led, “German-style” further education system instead, saying: “From now on, our mantra must be further education, further education, further education”. He did not announce any new money for the sector. The national funding rate for 16- and 17-year-olds has been frozen at £4,000 per student since 2013. By contrast, the government provides £5,371 in average annual funding per pupil aged 11 to 16 and £9,124 per student in higher education, according to campaigners Raise the Rate. Further education students have not been entitled to the free school meals voucher scheme or the free devices scheme during the lockdown, and further education colleges cannot access the extra funding being provided this term to schools suffering exceptional Covid-19-related costs. “It’s ridiculously unfair. It’s time there was an equity of approach between the school academy sector, further education and higher education – I’m sick and tired of further education being the poor relation,” says Philips. A Department for Education spokesperson said the government has provided unprecedented support and claimed they are “providing an additional £400m for college and sixth forms this year and £1.5bn to upgrade college buildings and facilities”, as well as additional funding for traineeships.",education
"Michael Gove has reopened old wounds from the coalition government by claiming one of his proudest achievements is introducing the pupil premium – a policy the Liberal Democrats insist was their signature education reform, which has since been underfunded by the Tories. In a speech last Saturday on restructuring government entitled “The privilege of public service”, Gove cited the pupil premium as “one of the reforms of which I am proudest”. The education secretary during the coalition years added: “I believe it has been transformative”, adding that proper data was now needed to judge just how effective it had been. But his comments angered leading Liberal Democrats who insist that although the Tories had also mentioned a premium for poor pupils in their 2010 election manifesto, the drive to introduce it under David Cameron’s government came from them. They say they had to fight constantly to fund it properly during the coalition years from 2010 to 2015, as the government ordered huge cross-departmental austerity cuts. The premium is additional funding provided to publicly funded schools in England with the aim of raising the attainment of disadvantaged children, including those eligible for free school meals. Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey, who was energy and climate change secretary in the coalition government, said last night: “While it’s not surprising Michael Gove wants to try to claim credit for one of the most radical and progressive education policies of the last 40 years, he gets a C- for history and less for honesty, because the policy was a Liberal Democrat innovation and a huge achievement by Lib Dem ministers. “Conservative ministers know very well that whether it’s the trebling of renewable power, the raising of the income tax threshold or the pupil premium for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, these were Liberal Democrat policies, which we had to fight the Tories every day in government to achieve.” His fellow leadership contender, Layla Moran, accused Gove of “shamelessly rewriting history”. She said: “The pupil premium was fought for and delivered by the Liberal Democrats in government to give children from disadvantaged backgrounds the best possible start in life. If the Tories were truly proud of this policy, they would not have slashed funding for the pupil premium by millions of pounds in real terms since 2015.” The Lib Dems and Labour have complained that funding was frozen after 2015, although for the year 2020-21 it has been raised in line with inflation. James McGrory, who was a special adviser to deputy prime minister Nick Clegg during the coalition said: “With the pupil premium, Michael Gove is yet again polishing his brass neck. “It was a Liberal Democrat policy, which Gove and the Tories had to be fought tooth and nail to deliver in government, especially when it came to early years education. “It also speaks volumes that Gove is prouder of something Nick Clegg and David Laws did than he is of his own much-vaunted and misguided Free Schools crusade.”  The Conservatives say the pupil premium was included in their manifestos not only in 2010, but also in 2015 and 2017, and that they remain fully committed to it.",education
"In Britain, one focus of the Black Lives Matter movement has been how we tell the history of the country. Beyond the protests about statues, young people have been campaigning against changes to the national curriculum in England made in 2014. When the then education secretary, Michael Gove, announced he wanted to refocus the teaching of history in schools to “celebrate the distinguished role of these islands in the history of the world”, he removed the curriculum’s explicit focus on racial and ethnic diversity, particularly within Britain. Though some of his more extreme ideas were dropped after opposition from teachers and academics, his changes meant the teaching of black history became optional. This has led to black people being almost entirely written out of the version of British history taught in schools, says Lavinya Stennett, the founder of the Black Curriculum, an education social enterprise that delivers black British history in schools. GCSE exam data collated by the Guardian shows that although schools are permitted to teach black history, as well as the history of people outside Europe and the US, few of them do. Up to 11% of GCSE students are studying modules that refer to black people’s contribution to Britain. And less than one in 10 are studying a module with a focus on empire, despite this being a significant feature of the last 400 years of British history. This finding is backed by a survey of 50,000 people that explores the history participants learned at school. Of the 59 GCSE history modules available from the three biggest exam boards, Edexcel, AQA and OCR, 12 explicitly mention black history. Only five mention the history of black people in Britain, the rest are about black people in the US, other countries or the transatlantic slave trade. Of the five that cover black history in Britain, three include migration, one deals with empire in the 17th and 18th century, and one mentions race relations in postwar Britain in a thematic study of power over an 850-year period. This means up to 11% (approx 28,412) of GCSE students in 2019 were studying modules that made any reference to the contribution of black people in British history. No modules in the GCSE syllabus for the most popular exam board, Edexcel, mention black people in Britain. Yet there have been black people in Britain since at least the Romans arrived as well as black communities of sorts since the 1500s, as David Olusoga chronicles in his book Black and British. They include a trumpeter in Henry VIII’s court who wrote to the king asking for a pay rise, seamen at the battle of Trafalgar and soldiers fighting for Britain in both world wars. And of course white British people have been in Africa: running the transatlantic slave trade to the Caribbean and the US and occupying the likes of modern-day Nigeria and Kenya to Egypt and South Africa. A spokesperson for Edexcel’s parent company Pearson said they are planning to introduce a module about migration in Britain that will cover black British history, and that work on this will be accelerated in light of recent events. They said that diversity and inclusiveness “is an absolute priority for us and we’ve worked hard to ensure that our history GCSE qualification covers a range of cultures and countries … We always encourage feedback and take action on it where possible”. The consequences of this missing history, in Stennett’s words, is that many people do not know why Britain is the way it is today. “People are not aware of the contributions that were made [by black people] to Britain. Also, they don’t understand their classmates or the people around them,” she says. This omission harms black Britons, Stennett says. “The whole basis of the Windrush scandal was that ‘these people don’t belong here’, that their citizenship could be revoked. It makes me feel like we don’t belong, like we’ve never made any contribution,” she says. “That is not the truth.” Everyday life for black Britons is permeated by this history, according to Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson, the 19-year-old co-creator of the Impact of Omission, including how microaggressions play out. “When black people say, ‘Please can you not touch my hair,’ people think it’s about invading personal space. And it is to an extent, but you also have this history in this country about how black people were put into zoos and petted like animals,” she says. Human zoos including Somali people among others continued in Britain until the 20th century. “People think you are overreacting when you’re like, ‘Can you please not do that.’ People think it’s PC culture. But when you do something like that it recalls a deeply painful and traumatic history that black people have to reckon with every single day. “You can walk through the world, touching people’s hair because you think it looks fluffy but it’s a completely dehumanising thing that has its roots in human zoos. That’s the impact of omission, that people can walk around not thinking about the history of their actions.” Nell Bevan, an 18-year-old who co-created the Impact of Omission with Jikiemi-Pearson, says: “I remember hearing adults say that you learn history so you can learn the mistakes that we used to make. But how can you avoid mistakes that you are not taught about?” When black people feature in GCSE history lessons it is often in the context of the slave trade. Without the inclusion of other aspects of black history and a broader understanding of empire, the focus on slavery, though crucial, can reinforce narratives of black people as victims. So it is also important, according to Clare Broomfield, the head of history at Villiers high school in Southall, Middlesex, for pupils to learn about different cultures before colonisation. “Studying the Mughal empire or the Benin kingdom moves away from the narrative that people of colour and black people are seen only as slaves or victims,” she says. The data shows that a third of GCSE students studied the modules centred on non-European or American cultures. Of that third, 95% were studying one of two modules on China under Mao. Three other modules focus on non-European/American culture outside the context of an invasion: the Mughal Empire 1526-1707; South Africa 1960-94: the People and the State; and Conflict in the Middle East 1945-95. Less than 2% (4,228) of all students studied these topics at GCSE. For the purposes of this comparison we have classified Russian history as European history. It’s not just black history that is missing. Despite the Conservative party’s enthusiasm for “imperial heroes”, there is very little coverage of the empire in GCSE history lessons. Although British historymakes up the vast majority of what pupils study at GCSE history, modules focusing on empire make up a small proportion of that. Allowing that students study four modules, we calculated that only 9% (about 23,676 pupils) have studied modules that make significant reference to the British empire over the course of their two-year GCSE. That is fewer than one in 10 learning about one of the most significant periods in British history over the past four centuries. Of the eight modules that cover the British empire: only one tackles the subject directly, OCR’s the Impact of Empire on Britain 1688-c.1730. Three reference empire in relation to migration in Britain; one covers it in a general 1,200-year overview of warfare; and two reference empire in short period studies of the UK: Britain in Peace and War 1900-18, and Restoration England 1660-85. In the syllabus for the most popular exam board, Edexcel, only one module, British America 1713–83: Empire and Revolution, makes a significant reference to the British empire. However, it is entirely focused on British colonisation of the US. A passing reference is made to Sir Walter Raleigh’s failed colonisation of Virginia in the module Early Elizabethan England 1558-88. In contrast, there are 21 modules on British history that make little to no reference to the empire. Peter Mandler, a leading historian based at Cambridge University, characterised the traditional focus of British history as “Hitler and Henrys”, making reference to the focus on the Nazis and the Tudors. Yet even within these “traditional” topics, Broomfield says a wide range of perspectives can be drawn out. “The Tudors and 1066 can be taught in a way that includes the non-white or immigrant people who participated in them, eg the black Tudors, the Jewish immigrants who came with William the Conqueror Indian Lascar sailors,” she says, citing a few examples from the OCR migration course that she teaches.  However, schools face two significant obstacles to reform: a shortage of money and a lack of time among teachers. Broomfield says it is difficult to buy textbooks on a small departmental budget: “Textbooks are expensive. My budget is not huge – even for the OCR GCSE migration course you need four textbooks at £12-£13 each. And if you are teaching more than 100 pupils, that soon adds up.” Another problem is teachers’ lack of knowledge, she says. “It’s maybe something that you have never studied before yourself, so, particularly if you’ve taught about life in Nazi Germany for the last 25 years, you’re not going to want to change that.” But Broomfield urges teachers to instead see it as a way for pupils to connect history to the world around them, and to learn about new topics themselves. “From a teacher perspective, I have found it endlessly fascinating to discover all these new and exciting stories,” she says. “If we don’t teach this history, we lose that knowledge and understanding of how rich and culturally diverse our society has been since the Romans.” Additionally, a series of changes to the education system means the national curriculum is taught fully only in local authority-run state schools – but not in academies, free schools or private institutions. Stennett says when history is taught well, it has a positive influence on BAME pupils. “People feel seen where they were not seen before,” she adds. “It gives them a sense of identity and belonging in the classroom.” According to Olusoga, the erasure of black history in Britain is an intentional feature of racism that he traces to Enoch Powell, whose search for a pre-colonial white England discards 400 years of British history and skips back to before the Elizabethans. Whatever the intention – the combination of curriculum setting by politicians, modules offered by exam boards and schools’ take-up of those modules means that for today’s students the erasure of black people’s centuries-long contribution to Britain remains.When asked whether the Department for Education was concerned about the low numbers studying either black history or the British empire, a spokesperson said: “The curriculum in our schools is already incredibly diverse and offers pupils access to different black history topics across all key stages, teaching children about significant figures from black and ethnic minority backgrounds to help them learn about our shared history with countries from across the world.” A letter to Stennett from Nick Gibb, the minister for school standards, seen by the Guardian, reiterates areas where it is possible to study black history in the current history curriculum but rejects a request by the Black Curriculum to make it mandatory. Free black history wallchart Starting on Saturday 11 July, the Guardian is publishing a free wallchart series giving a timeline of black history - from the first African Roman emperor in AD193, to the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. In a total of six parts, it will show how the history of black people has impacted the world, and will help all of us understand how we got where we are today. Notes on the data Specific data about what history students learn at key stage 3 (aged 11-14) or in primary schools is not available. Within the curriculum laid out here for England’s key stage 3, schools are allowed to teach what they want. Fewer than half of students doing GCSEs in England, 45%, take history. But it is only at this stage that we can get information on the topics studied. Scottish and Northern Irish exam boards were unable to provide details about the modules taken at GCSE/national 5 level. GCSE specifications: AQA, Edexcel, OCR history A and OCR history B",education
"As many as 13 British universities could face financial disaster from the after-effects of the coronavirus outbreak, affecting one in 20 students in the UK and causing steep job cuts, according to research. Estimates by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the UK higher education sector will endure losses ranging between £3bn to £19bn in 2020-21, with the exact size of the losses dependent on how many students decide not to enrol. The IFS calculates that pension obligations and investment losses caused by the economic downturn will also have a major impact on university balance sheets over the next four years. Universities will be unable to recoup their losses through cost-cutting unless they also make “significant” numbers of staff redundant, the research found. Although the IFS did not name the 13 institutions most at risk, the authors suggest that those with the lowest reserves and smallest investments will need a government bailout or debt restructuring to survive. “It is not the institutions with the largest Covid-related losses that are at the greatest risk of insolvency. Rather it is those, generally less prestigious, institutions that entered the crisis in a weak financial position and with little in the way of net assets, which are at greatest risk,” the IFS stated. Universities with the largest predicted losses under the IFS’s analysis were “highly profitable” before the crisis and have substantial financial reserves, allowing them to sustain significant drops in income. “If the government wanted to avoid university insolvencies, by far the cheapest option would be a targeted bailout, which may cost just £140m,” said the IFS’s Elaine Drayton, one of the report’s authors. “Rescuing failing institutions may weaken incentives for others to manage their finances prudently in the future. General increases in research funding avoid this problem but are unlikely to help the institutions that are most at risk, as few of them are research-active.” Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said the IFS report was further bad news for students and staff in higher education. “Universities are already seeking to sack staff, with casual staff and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds suffering the most. We need a comprehensive support package that protects jobs, preserves our academic capacity and guarantees all universities’ survival,” Grady said. The IFS’s central projection calculates an £11bn loss in income for the sector, with a 50% fall in new international students. It also assumes that enrolments from the EU will halve in 2020-21 “due to travel restrictions and disruption to administrative services … as well as health concerns,” despite it being the final year that students within the EU are treated the same as UK applicants. The institute expects enrolments from the UK to be 10% lower as “some students may choose not to attend what is likely to be a significantly different university experience or may stay away for health concerns”. The downturn in financial markets will also likely hurt finances. The IFS estimates that universities will need to increase their pension provisions by 25%, while investment income is expected to fall by 10%. The IFS also offers two more scenarios, including a “pessimistic” scenario with £19bn in lost income, thanks to much larger falls in student enrolments and a more severe market downturn widening pension fund deficits and reduced investment income. The “optimistic” scenario of a £3bn loss includes a 25% fall in international and EU enrolments and no additional pension provisions required.",education
"Protesting students at the University of Manchester have pulled down fences that were erected around their halls of residence as part of measures aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus during the new lockdown.  Students living on the university’s Fallowfield campus said fences had been erected early on Thursday morning without warning from the university, and they were only able to leave through a single exit guarded by security. As well as fencing off most entrance points, the university disabled swipe cards that grant entry to buildings other than their accommodation. The university initially said the measures were to prevent access by non-residents, and students could continue to access and leave their own accommodation subject to ID checks. However, on Thursday night the university apologised for the fences and announced they would be removed on Friday morning. “I sincerely apologise for the concern and distress caused by the erecting of a fence around our Fallowfield halls of residence today,” Prof Nancy Rothwell, the vice-chancellor. “This was not our intention – in fact quite the reverse.” In a protest on Thursday evening, hundreds of angry students gathered in what they described as “HMP Fallowfield” to protest against the university’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, including mental health support. At the end of the rally, students tore down all of the fences that had been erected in the morning.  The government has urged students across the country to stay on campus during lockdown rather than rush back to their family homes and for their universities to continue face-to-face teaching. The University and College Union and National Union of Students are warning that this poses a serious risk to the health of staff and students. George Rogers, a first-year planning and real estate student residing in Oak House halls, said the increased security measures were contributing to a stressful atmosphere on campus. “A lot of people have gone home, you feel the campus getting slightly emptier,” he said. “I don’t understand why they need to put up fences to keep us safe from the virus. It makes us feel like they don’t trust us, it feels like they’re locking us in our rooms.” One student on Twitter asked how the university thought it was acceptable to put up fences without prior notification. The university sent an email at 3.30pm on 5 November stating that “security staff will ensure that only students who live in that accommodation can access safely and help avoid the mixing of households”. Students may be subject to ID checks to access their rooms, the email added. Isabella Mearns, a first-year architecture student, said the university was restricting access to green spaces. “We just feel like prisoners at the moment. Recently we had this boy who committed suicide and this is their response, to lock us in. This is ridiculous,” she said. The NUS is campaigning for the government and universities to ensure that students are treated equally by coronavirus restrictions. The union’s president, Larissa Kennedy, said students had been “policed, threatened and blamed to appalling levels” throughout the pandemic. The government is also urging universities to continue providing face-to-face teaching, although some institutions, including Manchester, have already shifted their courses entirely online. Along with the UCU, the NUS is warning that continuing face-to-face teaching puts the health of students and staff at risk. Dozens of students left messages on the Facebook page of the University of Lincoln after it used the site to announce a continuation of face-to-face teaching, with many expressing concerns that they were being asked to commute through high-risk areas. On its website, the University of Lincoln posted a letter to students from the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, in which she said: “By keeping universities open, we are prioritising education so that there is no gap in your academic journeys and lives.” The pressure on universities also came as Independent Sage, a group of experts set up as an independent alternative to the government’s own scientific advisory panel, criticised government guidance that students based on campus should remain there. It warned that the government’s policy was likely to exacerbate Covid-19 spread in the community between areas of high and low infection by concentrating journeys in December as students return home. A University of Manchester spokesperson said staff and students had raised concerns about non-residents accessing accommodation. They stated: “We are therefore introducing new security measures out of hours at key entrance points to our campus, accommodation and main pedestrian routes to help keep our students, our staff and our community safe. As now, residents can continue to enter and leave as they please. “Regrettably the fencing began to be installed ahead of the message being seen by halls students. We apologise for any worry that this has caused and would like to reiterate that all students who live on site can continue to come and go freely.”",education
