" A Victorian woman is facing almost 300 animal cruelty charges after wildlife officers allegedly found the carcasses of 140 protected native birds, including 128 wedge-tailed eagles, at her property. The office of the conservation regulator said police, wildlife officers, and officials from the agriculture department searched the woman’s property in Violet Town in August after a number of dead wedge-tailed eagles were found in the area. She has been charged with 291 breaches of the Wildlife Act 1975 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986, including offences relating to poisoning the birds of prey. The maximum penalty for killing native birds or being in possession of them without a licence carries hefty fines or penalties of up to two years in jail. The woman will face court in Benalla next year. The chief conservation regulator, Kate Gavens, said her office took matters like this “very seriously”. “Wedge-tailed eagles are Victoria’s largest bird of prey and an important part of our environment,” Gavens said. “This investigation shows the conservation regulator’s commitment to combating wildlife crime and protecting the iconic wedge-tailed eagle.” Wedge-tailed eagles are seen as a pest by some farmers because of concerns they will prey on lambs, but the department of environment, land, water and planning says the birds very rarely take healthy lambs and never full-grown sheep. Wildlife experts have said killing the resident pair creates a territorial vacuum that encourages more birds to come.  To report wildlife crime contact CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.",environment
"Fish populations will continue to be over-exploited in EU waters, partly as a result of Brexit, after a decision on next year’s fishing quotas among EU countries fell well short of scientific advice. Fishing limits are set to exceed scientific advice for about a third of EU fish stocks, after EU ministers met on Thursday morning, with EU member states citing the uncertainty regarding fishing rights after Brexit as a reason for breaching limits on sustainable catches. The Brexit-fuelled dispute among EU ministers on fishing quotas in the north-east Atlantic means the EU target to end overfishing by 2020, set in legislation from 2013, will now be missed. This year was supposed to be when “total allowable catches” for fish in EU waters were set in line with scientific advice for the first time in the history of the EU common fisheries policy. It was supposed to be when the wasteful practice of throwing back healthy fish to die as discards was ended, and when fishing quotas were to be set through long-term management plans rather than annual bunfights among ministers in Brussels. Instead, EU ministers voted to roll over at least a quarter of fishing quotas from last year because they were shared with the UK, in defiance of the scientific advice. Annual disputes over fishing quotas will continue after Brexit. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, described this year’s negotiations as “exceptionally challenging” but said progress was being made towards sustainable fishing across the EU. He said: “We have brought eight total allowable catches in line with the levels that guarantee the maximum sustainable yields from those stocks. EU ministers have followed my proposals on the precautionary approach for nine fish catch quotas. This is a step in the right direction. The commission proposal was very ambitious and I welcome today’s overall good outcome. “We have also managed to respond to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and secure continued fishing for all EU fishermen and women. Vessels can take to the sea on 1 January 2021 and the fishing sector can be reassured that their business is recognised as a priority for the EU.” Rebecca Hubbard, a programme director at Our Fish, a campaigning organisation, said: “Brexit has been the excuse by which EU ministers have continued overfishing. It is very bad for sustainable fishing.” Destructive practices such as bottom trawling will continue, and the management of important fisheries in the North Sea will still be subject to annual negotiations among EU ministers and the UK. Campaigners said these decisions would harm the EU’s fisheries industries and fishing fleets in the long term. “Unfortunately, today’s outcome shows how far EU member states are from delivering their promises to their citizens, including our children who will inherit the legacy of their decisions,” said Hubbard. “EU fisheries ministers willingly lock themselves into this abusive cycle which helps nobody, not the fish, the ocean, the climate or the fishers.” Ministers agreed to higher catches than scientific advice recommends for EU-only populations, unaffected by Brexit, such as pollack and sole in the Bay of Biscay. The EU has also set limits for stocks shared with the UK to allow fishing to continue in the first three months of 2021, with that quota to be distributed among EU member states according to the existing pattern of “relative stability”. Scientists had advised a 17% cut in most catches for 2021. Campaigners said this flouted the EU’s rules on bringing fishing into line with scientific advice for 2020, but that future years could be better managed. Andrew Clayton, of the Pew Charitable Trusts, a campaigning group, said: “While smaller in scope than the usual December council decisions due to the uncertainty around shared stocks, the outcome suggests the commission is making some progress to improve management in 2021, but ministers are still opting for several catch limits in excess of scientific advice. When full limits are eventually agreed for stocks shared with UK and Norway, it is critically important that the science on sustainable fishing is followed.”",environment
"The Covid-19 vaccinations captured the world’s attention in November yet, around the same time, researchers behind a trial known as HPTN 084 also published spectacular results. The trial, which took place across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, found that an eight-weekly injection with a drug called cabotegravir was more effective than daily medication in an oral pill form in preventing HIV in women. An estimated 38 million people in the world are currently living with HIV – two thirds of these people live in Africa. In South Africa, more than 62% of the 7.5 million adults living with HIV are women. While a pre-exposure prophylactic pill is currently available for people at risk, the HPTN 084 trial – undertaken by the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) and partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – found cabotegravir to be 89% more effective. “The injection overcame many of the challenges that women in the region experience with taking a daily pill,” trial chair Dr Sinéad Delany-Moretlwe says, explaining that stigma often prevents people taking their pill consistently. “Partners may feel insecure because they think it means their partners are going to be unfaithful and just generally women experience judgments about being sexually active,” she explains. Delany-Moretlwe, who works at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, says that the injection is “discreet and convenient and not visible” and therefore “overcomes barriers” for many women in African countries. The HPTN 084 trial involved 3,223 cisgender women ranging in age from 18 to 45. Only four women who received the injection acquired HIV compared to 34 women who took the pill. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a result like this for HIV prevention in women,” says Delany-Moretlwe. “This is a product that can be used by men and women, when it’s licensed, potentially, so I think that’s what’s exciting.” “I’ve worked in HIV prevention for a long time and I know we’ve had more disappointments than successes,” Delany-Moretlwe says, but “it’s an incredibly exciting result. With introduction and use of the injection, we can hopefully begin to see the reduction and possibly elimination of HIV acquisition in young women in our region.” Amelia Tait Imagine a city where power is generated from turbines and waterways. Where cycle paths, green space, allotments, veg boxes and vegan restaurants are plentiful, buses are powered by human waste and streets are closed so kids can play. It’s not a fantasy. It’s happening today in Bristol, a city increasingly feted for pioneering environmentally friendly urban life. The first city in the world to declare a climate emergency and Britain’s first European Green Capital, it is consistently top of various green matrices. This year it was judged the most environmentally friendly big British city based on high recycling rates (47.4%), generous green space (29 hectares), council seats held by the Green party (11) and carbon emissions and gas consumption. A green virtuous circle appears to be whirling in the West Country, as environmentally conscious citizens urge their leaders to make more ambitious climate commitments. In 2014, Britain’s first “poo bus” was launched, its journeys between Bristol and Bath entirely powered by human and food waste. Bristol’s leaders have looked further ahead than most. Back in 2007, the city began powering its 34,000 street lights with green electricity and, by 2014/15, it had reduced its emissions by 38% compared with 2005. The Bristol Energy Co-operative’s most exciting new scheme proposes using the water flowing through Netham weir in the city to generate electricity. A community team working at the Lawrence Weston housing estate gained planning permission for the tallest turbine of its kind in England, which will power all 3,500 homes in the area. Other schemes include a phone app using thermal imaging to help 70% of residents who struggle to pay their electricity bills identify the energy efficiency of their homes. Traders then fix problems for an affordable fee. Mark Pepper, project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, says “from being seen as a middle-class problem” paying attention to the climate crisis is now seen as a way of investing in the future. As well as being a middle-class concern, environmental issues have typically been championed by people who are overwhelmingly white. This, too, is changing in Bristol, the first major city in Europe to elect a black mayor, Marvin Rees. “Someone said, ‘I hear the voice, I hear what the voice says but I don’t hear my voice’,” says Carlton Romaine, coordinator of the Black and Green Ambassadors project in Bristol, which aims to create a new generation of environmental leaders from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. “We want to empower the BAME community because we’re always at the bottom and we’re usually add-ons,” says Romaine. “We want to be leading green projects or at least a partner, not just somebody that is asked to do something.” Patrick Barkham The Air Company, based in New York, makes vodka from two ingredients: carbon dioxide and water. Each bottle that’s produced takes carbon dioxide out of the air. It has been chosen as one of the finalists in the $20m NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, which aims to incentivise innovation in the field of carbon capture, utilisation and storage. The company’s chief technology officer, Stafford Sheehan, hit upon the idea while trying to create artificial photosynthesis as a chemistry PhD student at Yale. Photosynthesis, you may remember from chemistry at school, is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert CO2 into energy. For 2bn years, plants were equal to the task of balancing the carbon in the atmosphere – but now we are emitting it at a rate beyond what nature can restore with photosynthesis. Hence the interest in carbon capture. “Our aim is to take CO2 that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and transform it into things that are better for the planet,” says Sheehan A nice cold martini is undoubtedly better for the planet than global warming. Unfortunately, however, it would require 11 quadrillion Air Vodka Martinis to make any kind of significant impact. But Sheehan hopes to make alcohol for a variety of different applications. “Ethanol, methanol and propanol are three of the most-produced chemicals in the world, all alcohols,” he says. “Plastics, resins, fragrances, cleaners, sanitisers, bio-jet fuel… almost all start from alcohol. If we can make the base alcohol for all of those from carbon that would otherwise be emitted, that would make a major impact.” Air Company currently captures its CO2 from old-fashioned alcohol production: concentrated CO2 rising from a standard fuel-alcohol fermentation stack is transformed into vodka. That’s a fairly boutique product. However, power stations are much more plentiful sources. “You can burn natural gas, then capture the CO2 you’re emitting, and that feeds you the carbon dioxide,” says Sheehan. “That’s what we’d like to do and that’s where you can do it at scale.” Richard Godwin The Pacific Trash Vortex is the largest accumulation of rubbish in the world. Ocean currents mean the Eastern Garbage Patch near Japan is locked in a perpetual exchange of tyres, toothbrushes, discarded Minion toys, etc, with the Western Garbage Patch, between California and Hawaii. It spans more than 1m sq miles. Most of it is plastic: an estimated 87,000 metric tonnes broken down into 1.8tn tiny pieces. In 2012, a Dutch teenager named Boyan Slat gave a Ted Talk that had grown out of a school project. He revealed a plan to install a series of floating platforms that would harness those ocean currents and concentrate the rubbish in tighter areas, making it easier to remove. He founded the company Ocean Cleanup in 2013 and raised over $40m in funding. “There isn’t an instruction manual for doing this,” says Slat when I connect with him over video link – no longer a wide-eyed kid but a shaggy haired 25-year-old. After much research and trial and error, the company is now concentrating most of its efforts on rivers, stopping at source most of the plastic before it can get into the oceans. However, Ocean Cleanup achieved a significant milestone last year by extracting plastic from the ocean and turning it into something useful: sunglasses, yours for $199. The frames only represent a drop in the ocean in terms of plastic extracted, but Slat hopes they will create a virtuous circle. Each pair will fund the clean-up of up to 24 football fields of plastic from the Garbage Patch. “It would be quite poetic if we could fund the clean-up by recycling the plastic we take out.” Slat sees 2021 as an inflection point – the moment to deliver on its promises. “We have the tools to do it now. We have applied the lessons we’ve learned. Now it comes to actually doing it at scale.” What gives him hope? “The willingness of the world to address the issue. When we started, I thought the main difficulty would be people not caring – and the technology would be relatively easy. Actually it’s the opposite. But that makes me hopeful that when all the tools are there, it will actually happen. It is possible, even in this time when everything seems so polarised, to tackle problems through all the things humans are good at: entrepreneurship, ingenuity, creativity. It can bring people together. Things that seem insoluble can be solved.” Richard Godwin Antarctic blue whales Blue whales were abundant off South Georgia before industrial whaling arrived in 1904. By the 1970s they had vanished from the surrounding seas. Between 1998 and 2018 there was only a single sighting. This year, that changed: there have been 58 blue whale sightings. Kakapo The kakapo is the world’s heaviest, longest-lived parrot – a flightless, nocturnal creature which, like New Zealand’s other flightless birds, was imperilled by the mammalian predators introduced by humans. Years of conservation efforts had saved it from extinction, but then the species was struck down by the respiratory disease aspergillosis. Stricken birds were helicoptered to Auckland and treated in a human hospital with a paediatric nebuliser. The virus was contained and the population now stands at 213. Beavers It seemed like 2020 was the year every grand estate obtained a licence to release beavers into large, fenced enclosures. The beaver is increasingly valued as a natural flood-defence engineer, with its dams storing water upstream and slowing the flow of flood water, protecting towns downstream. Its ponds and channels have also been shown to benefit fish, amphibians, insects and birds. This year, the government in England allowed beavers unofficially released in the River Otter in Devon to stay, paving the way for its return as a natural native species, 400 years after being hunted to extinction. Great fox spider The critically endangered spider was feared to be extinct in Britain. But the nocturnal 5cm arachnid, known for its speed, agility and ambush hunting, has been rediscovered on a Ministry of Defence site in Surrey. Mike Waite from Surrey Wildlife Trust rediscovered the spider after being allowed in to survey the area over a two-year period. MoD sites are often wildlife havens with land undisturbed by the general public. Hen harrier A fine spring and summer across the UK meant that voles bred prolifically in the wild, in turn helping birds of prey enjoy successful breeding years. The endangered hen harrier enjoyed its best breeding year for nearly two decades. Nineteen nests produced 60 chicks. Patrick Barkham Four years ago, Rebecca Mayhew lost her job, then the pigs on the farm she owned with her husband Stuart were plagued by health problems due to the way they were intensively farmed. The couple became uneasy about the animals’ welfare and the health of their conventionally farmed land, so they sold their pigs and took a holiday in Scotland, where Rebecca fell in love with a friend’s Jersey cows. Four years on, their once-conventional arable and pig farm is a very different beast. The Mayhews have embraced regenerative farming, a way of working that aims to fix the food production system by restoring degraded soils and reducing and ultimately eliminating artificial fertilisers and pesticides. The revolution at the Mayhews’ 500-acre South Norfolk farm began with a small herd of Jersey cows. Unlike a traditional dairy, where calves are removed from their mothers after a few hours and fed formula, they chose to produce milk naturally, allowing calves to feed from their mothers, who are milked just once a day. “Looking into what’s good for the cows, and what’s good for us led us into looking at what’s good for the land,” says Rebecca. The Mayhews have jettisoned the farming orthodoxies of the past half-century. Ploughing is sacrilege: it erodes fertile top-soil. Decades of relentless scaling-up is turned on its head: big fields are turned into smaller fields – hedges replanted to stop erosion and provide shade and fodder for the cattle. Grazing fields that would normally be sown with a monoculture of rye-grass are instead seeded with up to 20 species to provide healthier food for the cattle (which, in turn, need fewer expensive veterinary drugs). Arable fields are planted with “cover crops”: so clovers are planted alongside barley or oats. Clovers are “nitrogen-fixing” plants that take nitrogen from the atmosphere and add it to soil, so it can be used by other plants – a free fertiliser and soil-improver. “Modern conventional farming is a constant war with nature. It’s about killing everything so one plant can grow,” says Mayhew. “We need to mimic nature and work with it.” The Mayhews’ new way of farming is nature-friendly so they’ve been able to take advantage of government subsidies for wildlife-enhancing farming. British farmers know that generous EU farm subsidies are coming to an end and farm payments in the future are likely to be more dependent on farms providing environmental “goods” such as healthy soils and clean water. Patrick Barkham Between the ages of 42 and 57, Bernardeta Gómez from Spain couldn’t see a thing. But then scientists embedded a port into her skull and after 16 years of blindness, Gómez was able to see again. It was all thanks to the innovations of Eduardo Fernandez, director of neuroengineering at the University of Miguel Hernández in Elche, Spain. Fernandez is working on a unique cure for blindness – instead of developing an artificial retina, he has created a device that restores sight by feeding signals directly to the brain. As the majority of blind people have damage to the nerve system connecting the retina and the brain, Fernandez’s work could help more people than developing an artificial eye. Fernandez has compared his prosthesis to a pacemaker or cochlear implants, both of which are pieces of electronic equipment that have been widely implanted into humans for more than 60 years. His system is made of a small camera attached to a pair of slightly outsized black glasses. This relays live video to a computer, which translates the footage into electronic signals. These signals are sent through a cable to a 100-electrode implant in the brain’s visual cortex (hence the port in the back of Gómez’s head), which deliver currents directly to the brain, producing sight. Gómez was able to see a low-resolution representation of objects rendered by white-yellow dots and shapes. She could see lights, letters and shapes at 10 pixels by 10 pixels. Although she couldn’t make out human faces, she was able to play a simple computer game “piped directly into her brain”. Unfortunately, the implant had to be removed after a year. “The body’s immune system starts to break down the electrodes and surround them with scar tissue,” explains Fernandez, “which eventually weakens the signal.” He hopes to continue testing his bionic eye while figuring out ways to stop the implant degrading. Ultimately, the prosthesis will be wireless. Amelia Tait Among the many novel terms that have entered our lives lately – “lockdown,” “herd immunity,” “flatten the curve” – one is decidedly more glamorous. In November it was suggested that “Dollying” should become shorthand for referencing an occasion when a celebrity does something that makes you love them even more. This was in response to the revelation that Dolly Parton had contributed $1m towards the Moderna Covid vaccine, news which was met with euphoria as we collectively – and only slightly melodramatically – exclaimed that Dolly had “saved the world”. Yet before we add “Dollying” to the dictionary, let’s consider the competition. How about “Doing a Rashford”, in reference to Man Utd’s striker Marcus Rashford forcing the UK government to confront child poverty and reinstate free meals for underprivileged schoolchildren? “Riri-ing” could also work, following Rihanna’s donation of $2m to charities supporting domestic-violence victims during lockdown. And then there’s “Pitting” (I sense this cute word game has now run its course), after Brad Pitt was spotted delivering groceries to disadvantaged LA households. The internet squealed with delight. These acts stand out in a year in which celebrities have been stripped of red carpets and live concerts and rendered impotent, left to spout platitudes over social media. Philanthropy has become common ever since Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concerts for famine-stricken Ethiopia in the 1980s, and is now so widespread it’s “almost part of the job description of an A-list star,” says Jo Littler, sociology professor at London’s City University. It is, she adds, “a form of brand promotion”. This means we have an ingrained scepticism when we see a celebrity doing a good thing: is it genuine or a PR play? Evan Ross Katz, a fashion writer and podcast host, says acts resonate when, instead of “affixing themselves to something because it’s trendy,” the celeb has a personal connection to the cause. Such was the case with Rashford, who subsisted on free school meals growing up, or ASAP Rocky, who last month delivered meals to the homeless shelter in New York where he and his mum sought refuge when he was young. Gestures needn’t be grand. Ryan Reynolds recently sent 300 parkas to a school in the remote Inuit community of Arctic Bay after the town’s mayor tweeted that they were desperate for winter gear. Justin Timberlake bought a wheelchair-friendly van for a teenager with cerebral palsy. And Taylor Swift’s longstanding custom of helping out regular folks continued when she paid for an 18-year-old to study maths at a UK university. We don’t need our celebs to be decent people but when they are – and in a way that isn’t overly forced and holier-than-thou – it provides a much-needed boost to our battered morale. Jamie Waters At first glance, Jarod Rollins’s work looks like magic. In a cove on an island off the coast of Maine, Rollins spends his days examining transparent worms in the hopes of extending human life. Of course, it’s not really magic, it’s science: Rollins works at the MDI Biological Laboratory, a non-profit research institution, and is motivated by a desire to “help people age more gracefully or even turn back the ageing process”. In July 2019, Rollins and 10 other researchers from across the globe made a monumental breakthrough: they increased the lifespan of some Caenorhabditis elegans worms by 500%. The reason these unassuming roundworms are frequently used in ageing research is because they share many of their genes with humans. An ordinary C elegans worm will live for three to four weeks – Rollins and his team kept them alive for months. “If we do make a discovery in C elegans and find a gene that helps regulate the rate at which they age, there is a good chance that that research is going to apply directly or indirectly to humans,” he explains. “I’m not in the business of making worms live longer,” he laughs, “I want to make people live longer and healthier, and worms are just one step on the way.” The worms in the experiment lived longer because his colleagues in China altered two signalling pathways in their cells. These pathways were previously both linked to ageing – in the past, experiments altering one of the pathways had doubled C elegans’s life expectancy, while experiments with the other increased the worms’ lifespan by 30%. The team expected that altering both pathways simultaneously would see worms living 130% longer. Instead, they lived five times longer. Mutating the two pathways sends signals to cells telling them to use dietary nutrients to go into “maintenance mode” instead of “growth mode” – fixing the damage caused by age. But what are the immediate repercussions? Rollins explains that scientists used to look for one “silver bullet” in anti-ageing research, but the therapies that “are going to have the most effect are probably going to stimulate multiple different genetic pathways at once… This is really going to change how people look at the ageing process.” Amelia Tait Troubled eras have always inspired positive human progress – and 2020 will be no different, says Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford University This year has been a terrible and chastening experience. But rather than allow doom and despair to sweep us away, we should be optimistic about the future – and in the long run, we might just owe 2020 a debt of thanks, rather than mutter its name with spite. The experiences of this year will – and must – teach important lessons about being better prepared for future epidemics. It will lead to greater understanding of how to plan and execute large-scale emergency responses more quickly and more efficiently and with better outcomes. And it will make us think about the risks and threats in the world around us with greater clarity and depth. The fact that Covid-19 vaccines have been developed with astonishing speed might encourage those who fear the worst about other big problems. Climate change is the most obvious mega-threat: in the long run, our pandemic experiences must help with that. While Covid hit the economy, one outcome may be smarter policy that looks to keep people in jobs, ensures towns and city centres remain vibrant and encourages small businesses to flourish and grow – rather than enabling virtual monopolies to impose strangleholds over the economy which heighten social inequalities. And 2020 has forced a recalibration of ambitions and expectations on a personal level. At the start of the year, our aims might have included a promotion or a higher salary. Today, those hopes have been replaced by something rather more modest and, indeed, better for us: to see friends, visit the pub, watch live sports, go to the theatre or visit somewhere new. Outside the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd in May proved a catalyst in raising voices who demand a fairer, more equitable and kinder society. It forced global public attention to focus on the realities of discrimination and racism, to recognise that there might be better alternatives to having statutes of rich slave-owners towering over town squares and that cultural imperialism did not end when the age of empire did. Beyond 2020? We would do well to remember that, in the past 30 years, more people have been lifted out of poverty than ever before; more children and mothers have survived childbirth; more people are able to read and write than at any point in human history. For all the horrors of the year, hope is still present – as the historian Agathias wrote in the sixth century, times of disaster throw up prophets who talk about doom and gloom and predict how much worse things will get with great certainty. Much better, then, to be positive and optimistic.",environment
"New international rules to tackle the “wild west” global trade in plastic, which has seen wealthy nations dump contaminated plastic waste on to poorer ones, will result in a cleaner ocean within five years, according to a UN transboundary waste chief. The rules, which come into force on 1 January, aim to make the trade more transparent in order to allow developing nations such as Vietnam and Malaysia to refuse low-quality, difficult-to-recycle waste before it is even shipped. “It is my optimistic view that, in five years, we will see results,” said Rolph Payet, the executive director of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions. “People on the frontline are going to be telling us whether there is a decrease of plastic in the ocean. I don’t see that happening in the next two to three years, but on the horizon of five years. This amendment is just the beginning.” At the moment, developing countries – many of which have recycling industries that take in shipments from other nations – cannot see whether a given shipment of plastic is actually recyclable or if it is too contaminated to use before it arrives. Waste that cannot be recycled usually ends up being illegally burned or dumped in landfills or waterways. Only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled. About 12% has been incinerated. The other 79% has accumulated in landfill, dumps and the natural environment, where it often ends up washing into rivers via wastewater, rain and floods. Much of it eventually ends up in the ocean. The new rules, agreed by more than 180 nations under an amendment to the Basel convention, introduce a system of “prior informed consent” for all exports of difficult-to-recycle or contaminated plastic. Payet acknowledged that tighter export controls may at first see major plastic exporting nations, such as the UK and the US, dispose of waste in landfill and incinerators instead. “In the short term, yes, there will be landfilling, there will be incineration of the plastic waste,” he said. “But in the long term, if government policies are right and if consumers keep applying pressure, it will create the environment for more recycling and a circular approach when it comes to plastic.” Turkey is the largest export market for British plastic waste, with Malaysia second, according to October data. So far this year, Britain has had 22 repatriation requests from seven countries to take back plastic exports, the Environment Agency told the Guardian. They include Malaysia, which sent back 42 containers of “illegal” waste in January, as well as Indonesia, Vietnam, Romania, Croatia, Poland and Belgium. Under the new rules, prior consent would have been needed for 20 of those 22 requests, presumably resulting in refusals. The Basel amendment has been incorporated into UK law, allowing UK regulators to implement and enforce it. Payet said China’s ban on plastic waste imports in 2018 had sent “shockwaves” through developed nations, who were reliant on China to take material they could not recycle themselves. “The China export ban was a signal to the world that something was seriously wrong and we had to fix it.” As well as plastic waste, developing nations also export the hidden health and environmental costs of disposal. Many of the nations that import problematic or heavily contaminated plastic lack the proper facilities to deal with it. “It was the wild west for plastics,” Payet said. “It was easier for everybody to put everything in a container and export it without asking questions: ‘Does this country have the capacity to deal with it, the technology to deal with it – and also, what can we do with the things we can’t recycle?’” The amendment is a “catalyst” for change, he said, and it is now up to governments to encourage the recycling sector, an industry with low profit margins, and other private sector firms, to innovate. “There is a lot of pressure from industry, from consumers, from supermarkets, to be innovative. Covid-19 has thrown a spanner into the works, but it also helps us to reflect a lot more on how we can repackage food in a healthier way.” The UK, which alongside the US is the world’s largest producer of plastic, exports two-thirds of its plastic waste. Britain’s total plastic waste exports to non-EU countries in October was 22.9m kg, of which 13.9m kg went to Turkey.  A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said it had pledged to ban the export of polluting plastic waste to non-OECD countries and to introduce tougher controls on waste exports, though as of October the UK was still sending 7.1m kg to Malaysia, which is not in the OECD. Simon Ellin, of the UK Recycling Association, warned that the new rules could mean more waste plastic going into domestic landfill or incineration. “In the UK we export about 70% of the plastic we collect because we don’t have the processing capacity to handle it,” said Ellin. “A lot more will be incinerated and landfilled.” Despite that “short-term hiccup”, said Tim Grabiel, a lawyer with the Environmental Investigation Agency, the new rules would have a positive impact. “I personally believe that from an ethical and environmental perspective, it can have a very positive effect,” he said. “[Contaminated plastic] has been an economic burden on developing countries. We will see a lesser amount coming to developing countries, and it will free up their waste management capacity for their own domestic waste.”",environment
"The mother of Ella Kissi-Debrah has called on the mayor of London to rethink his plans for a new four-lane road tunnel under the Thames warning it will drive up pollution with a potentially devastating impact on young people’s health. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, speaking after a coroner ruled that illegal levels of air pollution had caused the death of her nine-year-old daughter in 2013, said it was critical Sadiq reconsider the £2bn scheme. “I am kindly asking the mayor of London to take another look at the tunnel as there is absolutely no evidence that air quality will improve especially for the most polluted schools,” she said. Kissi-Debrah fought a seven-year campaign for justice for her daughter, and the coroner’s ruling is believed to be the first in the world to identify air pollution as a cause of death. In a landmark narrative verdict, Philip Barlow, inner south London coroner, said Ella died from acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure. Now Kissi-Debrah says she has looked at the “impact assessment reports” of the proposed Silvertown Tunnel and is convinced it would increase dangerous levels of toxic air in an already polluted part of London. Khan has come under increasing pressure over the proposed tunnel with a growing list of MPs, councillors, environmentalists and residents coming out against the project. They argue it will increase pollution, drive up car use and increase emissions in the midst of a climate crisis. The shadow climate change minister, Matthew Pennycook, whose Greenwich and Woolwich constituency would contain one end of the tunnel, earlier this year called on Khan, a Labour mayor, to reverse the plan. Lyn Brown, the Labour MP for West Ham, where the other end of the tunnel would be, has also called for the project to be scrapped. The rising cost of the scheme has come under scrutiny. In September the Guardian revealed that the project could cost nearly £2bn over the next three decades if it goes ahead. The figure – which includes the construction, maintenance and operation of the tunnel as well as interest payments on the debt – is more than twice the original estimate. In June, a report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, backed by some of the UK’s leading climate scientists, found that the development was incompatible with the Greater London Authority’s aim to become carbon-neutral by 2030. But Khan’s administration has repeatedly defended the scheme, saying it was essential to improve river crossings in east London that are “antiquated and worn out”. City Hall insists the new tunnel would provide a “public transport-focused river crossing” with improved bus links, and be paid for by introducing tolls on both the Blackwall tunnel and at Silvertown. But Kissi-Debrah said instead of focusing on a new road tunnel the mayor should extend the planned ultra low emissions zone [Ulez], which is due to be widened from its current central London zone to the north and south circular from October 2021. “Based on the success of the Ulez can the mayor rather consider implementing it London wide? 250,000 children have an asthma diagnosis and they will breathe better and it would save lives.”",environment
"The mother of Ella Kissi-Debrah called for her legacy to be the passing of a new clean air act to force the government in the UK to clean up the environment for future generations of children. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah spoke after a coroner ruled that illegal levels of air pollution, predominantly from traffic, had caused the death of her nine year old daughter in south London in February 2013. The coroner’s ruling was the first in the world – experts believe – to identify air pollution as a cause of an individual’s death. In a landmark narrative verdict, Philip Barlow, inner south London coroner, said Ella died from acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure. He ruled that the “recognised failure” of government and other bodies, to reduce nitrogen dioxide levels or to provide information to the public about their risks, was a possible contribution to the schoolgirl’s death. “Ella died of asthma contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution,” said the coroner on Wednesday. Ella lived within 25 metres of the south circular road in Lewisham, and other busy routes. During her lifetime nitrogen dioxide emissions in Lewisham, where she lived, exceeded EU and national legal limits and World Health Organization guidelines. Particulate matter (PM), PMs 10 and 2.5, levels were above the WHO guidelines. In the three years before her death, Ella had multiple seizures and was admitted to hospital 27 times after severe asthma attacks. “The whole of Ella’s life was lived in close proximity to highly polluting roads,” the coroner said. “I have no difficulty in concluding that her personal exposure to nitrogen dioxide and PM was very high.” Air pollution he said had induced and exacerbated her severe asthma. Seven years on from Ella’s death, nitrogen dioxide emissions met legal limits across the borough for the first time last year, but particulate pollution continued to exceed World Health Organization limits. The inquest was the second into Ella Kissi-Debrah’s death. The first hearing in 2014 did not consider air pollution as a cause of death. But her mother fought to find the truth about what was causing her daughter’s acute asthma attacks, collapses and respiratory and cardiac arrests. She forced a second inquest after her lawyer presented new evidence from Prof Stephen Holgate, a world expert, which found that air pollution levels at the Catford monitoring station a mile from her home consistently exceeded lawful EU and national legal limits. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said after the ruling: “We’ve got the justice for her which she so deserved”. She said she needed time to reflect on the ruling. “I think that it would be a fitting legacy, to bring in a new Clean Air Act and for governments – I’m not just talking about the UK government – governments around the world to take this matter seriously. “My biggest desire is to prevent future deaths, anything that saves future lives I am going to be in support of.” Kissi-Debrah said rather than a blame game, there needed to be a public awareness campaign with clear, concise, messages to teach the population about the damage air pollution is doing. Environmental lawyers, and campaigners joined the call for a radical and broad focused new clean air act – akin to the one introduced after the Great Smog in the 1950s, to be passed. Simon Birkett, Founder and Director of Clean Air in London, said: “It is the duty of the government to protect life and the environment for current and future generations and to do this they need a new Clean Air Act which will deal with present pollution and clean up the environment for future generations.” Illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide should have been reduced in the UK and Europe by 2010, but the latest data shows 75% of air quality reporting zones in the UK are still breaching legal limits, and levels across the continent are also still unlawful. The Government recently threw out an attempt to get tougher WHO limits on PM pollutants into the environment bill, with Rebecca Pow, air quality minister, questioning the “economic viability and practical deliverability’ of the stricter target. “In the seven years since Ella died, nearly a quarter of a million other UK families have suffered tragedy as a result of vulnerable loved-ones breathing toxic air – four times more than those killed by Covid this year,” said Greg Archer, of the NGO Transport & Environment. “In modern Britain this is inexcusable and preventable.” The failure of successive governments to meet legal limits led ClientEarth, the environmental legal group, to successfully taken the UK government to court three times. Katie Neild, UK clean air lawyer for Client Earth, said: “The inquest has thrown into sharp relief just how long the government has known about the harm that air pollution wreaks on people’s lives and how slow they have been to react. How many more lives will be lost before ministers act to clean up the air with the urgency and ambition that people’s health deserves?” Jocelyn Cockburn, the human rights lawyer who represented Ella’s family, said under article 2 of the Human Rights Act, the right to life, there was a compulsion on the government to act or take reasonable steps to protect life. “I think it entirely possible in relation to those people who have been affected by air pollution that they could use the Human Rights Act to try and enforce their right to breathe clean air … and there may be other legal avenues in relation to forcing the government to take steps to reduce air pollution levels or to inform the public.” Responding to the verdict, a government spokesman said: “Our thoughts remain with Ella’s family and friends. “We are delivering a £3.8bn plan to clean up transport and tackle NO2 pollution and going further in protecting communities from air pollution.”",environment
"When Julie Blackburn was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2016 she was told to avoid her triggers, scenarios which cause upsetting flashbacks. “But when your trigger is rain, there is no getting over it,” she said. “My husband and I don’t sleep when it’s raining, we take it in turns to stand at the window watching the rain – it’s just living in constant fear.” Blackburn’s house in Old Coulsdon, Croydon, has been flooded several times, first in 2000 when heavy rain overwhelmed the Victorian sewer system and filled her home with toxic waste. Rapid development and poor infrastructure led the south London borough to be rated the fourth worst area in England and Wales for surface water flooding in 2011. “You wouldn’t believe how long it takes to get over a flood. And I wouldn’t wish anyone to experience it,” said Blackburn, 52, who spends one to three hours a day on flood campaigning once she has finished work as a Cad technician. Even two decades on from the first major flood at the property, Blackburn struggles to feel comfortable inviting people over and fears leaving the house for too long. When they were away over the summer and the street flooded, neighbours had to deploy their sandbags. “It’s not just a little bit of water in your house, it’s the whole knock-on effect,” Blackburn said. “Mental health illness is still a taboo so perhaps it’s just not spoken about.” Research from the University of York and the Centre for Mental Health found people who have been flooded in the UK are nine times more likely to experience long-term mental health problems than the general population. PTSD was the most commonly reported condition, with a prevalence rate of between 7.06% and 43.7%. Anxiety and depression were also common. The report, which examined studies on flooding events in the UK from 1968 to 2016, found people affected by flooding experienced anxiety during heavy rain even years after being flooded. Symptoms included stress, sleep problems, panic attacks, nightmares, anger, mood swings and increased use of alcohol, prescription drugs or antidepressants. “We clearly need to think about longer term deployment of resources to areas that have been affected by flooding,” said Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive at the Centre for Mental Health. “For many people, mental health impacts may be felt years after the event but they’re just as serious.” Nikki Stocks, 59, lives in Todmorden, Calderdale, an area in West Yorkshire that has been particularly hit by floods in recent years – some residents have been flooded six times in the last five years. “You’re living on a knife edge, and it doesn’t ever seem to settle,” she said. “You don’t want to be reminded, you don’t want sandbags at your door all the time, but that’s how we live here.” She lives alone and is disabled, receiving her income through benefits, so has struggled to get her house repaired completely from when it was last flooded in 2015. “I can’t get loans to get it done all in one go, it’s just a slow process of saving a bit of money and then getting a bit of work done,” she said. Living with depression and PTSD, Stocks has relied heavily on the local charity Healthy Minds Calderdale over the years. “I feel like they saved my life,” she said. Lou Birks, the charity’s team lead for the area, said they launched a flooding project focused on bringing the community together so those affected could support each other. “We do support groups for people who want to just get stuff off their chest, and one-off workshops, for example on managing anxiety. “Every time it rains consistently, heavily, people’s anxiety levels go up. This is the climate we live in. It’s almost like a rolling programme of newly anxious people as we continue to get flooded.” Another Todmorden resident who has been flooded, Paul O’Reilly, said he experienced “massive anxiety attacks” during the storms in February this year, even though the water only came up to his back garden. “I get anxiety attacks when I read weather forecasts that predict awful weather. The threat of floods and heavy storms are triggers for me,” said the 67-year-old. “I used to think rain was a bloody nuisance, but then it became an enemy.” Dr Joana Cruz, a research associate at the University of York who led the study, said as the climate crisis increases the frequency and strength of storms, “we must provide tools for these communities to build resilience prior to flooding”. She added that more research on the issue is needed, particularly looking at the impact of flooding on people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The study also showed displacement and loss of a sense of place and home were common factors that underscored mental health problems related to flooding, even up to a year afterwards. O’Reilly, whose ground floor was gutted and rebuilt after floods in 2000 and then repaired and redecorated again after 2012 floods, said: “It’s like a major invasion of your privacy, it’s something that comes as a shock to the system that you’ve never experienced before.” With the added stress of coronavirus, O’Reilly has found this year particularly tough, but like many he has found solace in sharing his burden with people around him. “I’ve always been a self-reliant person, but you have to swallow it and say you need help sometimes, and I’m glad it’s been there when I needed it,” he said. For Stocks, she hopes that greater awareness of the mental health repercussions of flooding will encourage people to come forward: “It’s got to be talked about, even though it stresses me and I get upset, because if it isn’t talked about, it gets buried and people think they’re on their own.”",environment
"It’s a fine, crisp day and the first frost of the season, a significant occasion for any gardener and one that has not gone unnoticed by the seed guardians of the Stroud Community Seed Bank. Beth Richardson, a 27-year-old student midwife and coordinator at the seed bank, meets me by a big compost heap that steams on contact with the icy cold air. The heap, a valuable group resource, belongs to the allotment where Beth grows her crops. In allotment greenhouses and back-garden potting sheds across towns, cities and villages in the UK, communities of local growers are digging deep and planting the seeds for a richer, more diverse and more resilient food system. It is a trend being repeated all over the world. “Seeds are so powerful, so vital to life, but the range and variety of seeds that the big companies provide are very narrow,” says Josie Cowgill, one of the Stroud seed bank’s 30-strong growers and seed-savers. “In our small way, we are trying to, in each of our gardens or on the land that we grow food on, increase the biodiversity within our plots and within Stroud.” The Stroud Community Seed Bank in Gloucestershire is one of hundreds of initiatives across the UK focusing its seed-saving efforts on “open pollinated seed”, which – providing there is no cross pollination – will reliably produce viable, true-to-type plants year after year. Rather than being locked into a cycle of buying new seed every season, seed can be saved and stored for future use. “What we have to do to combat the very narrow genetic basis to our seed is get as many people as possible growing as wide a diversity of seeds as possible,” says Kate McEvoy of Real Seeds, a small-scale producer specialising in open pollinated seed for organic growing. Sally Oates’s garden can be heard before it is seen. Situated among acre upon acre of bare, intensively farmed fields her comparatively small plot of land appears to be a lone island of sweet, thundering birdsong. Oates says her garden, enclosed by luscious green hedges, provides its own compost and its own seeds. “What I would encourage is other gardeners to get together locally and form what is called a seed circle so within the group they can grow their favourite old varieties. When they have surplus seeds they can just exchange them. Even a few gardeners getting together, you can have quite a variety of seeds between you.” Simon Allen, another of Stroud’s seed guardians, adds: “It doesn’t need a knowledge of genetics, it just needs observation and care.” Richardson explains that “after a number of years, the seed is more adapted to the soils, climate and conditions that it’s been grown in, if the strongest specimens are selected. It’s essentially a better crop grown in Stroud because over the years it has evolved to the conditions here. It becomes a landrace.” Seed guardian Annie Page, whose polytunnels teem with bright red tomatoes, describes her garden as her sanctuary. It’s not difficult to see why. Rows of cabbages and Thrupp parsnips stand proud in the morning sun that streams into the steep valley. “One of the landrace varieties we all grow is called the Thrupp parsnip. Thrupp is a village just outside Stroud, and the lady who saves the seed has been doing it for years. It grows really well in our area. It has adapted so it’s going to be slightly different to parsnip seeds anywhere else in the world. We are developing the seeds by saving them.” Although there are many safeguards around the world for the preservation of seeds, such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew, the continual evolution and specialisation of these saved seeds is of significant value to the robustness, resilience and diversity of seed globally. Sinead Fortune, programme manager of the Seed Sovereignty Programme, says: “By being grown out and maintained by seed guardians, they’re still living and developing. They’re still a real living entity, as opposed to a static seed in a bank somewhere.” McEvoy adds: “The more you have these things being grown on a local scale and by many people, the more resilient it is. You haven’t got just one point of failure. You’ve got multiple backups.” One of the few upsides of the lockdowns over the past year has been a huge boost in demand for seed. The seed guardians hope this could be the green shoots of a “grow your own” revolution that re-diversifies seed crops. McEvoy says that in the spring not only the Stroud seed bank but “all the home garden seed companies were basically having to just shut down their websites. They had more orders than they could actually get out the door.” Fortune, who works with many national suppliers, wondered if seed might be the new loo-roll, and if people were stockpiling. The question was whether sales were eventually going to come down but “they’ve stayed constantly much, much higher” she says. “This is promising because it means that maybe a shift is really starting to happen. I think those empty shelves in March and April were a bit of a wake-up call for a lot of people; there’s a groundswell going on. That’s very exciting. “There are brilliant things going on in every single city,” she adds. “There are community gardens and community allotments. If people don’t have a garden or access to land, there are a lot of initiatives to get engaged on all sorts of levels. I would really urge them to see what is going on in the community.” For the seed guardians in Stroud and across the country, the quiet, radical work of drying seeds on window ledges and in airing cupboards continues. Cowgill says the process is “good for the soul” and extends an open invitation to other would-be growers to begin playing in the soil, with potentially hugely positive consequences for the individual and the planet. She sums up the impact of seed-saving in the context of 2020: “It’s difficult times we are living in. We have got a pandemic, we’ve got climate change, we’ve got biodiversity loss, habitat loss and economic collapse as well. It might feel quite small, just saving beans and growing your own food, but actually I think it is really fundamental. “By doing something infinitesimally small like this tiny little gesture in a tiny little group, in a tiny little country somewhere, you are working towards something that makes you feel more hopeful. It’s a positive step. I’m not saying this is a magic wand or a cure-all, but it’s a positive step.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",environment
"When Pushki was brought to his new home on 12 November, he was scared, dangerously skinny and severely dehydrated. The two-week-old sea otter pup had been found crying on the beach in Homer, Alaska, seemingly having been separated from his mother. He needed help, fast. Now, nearly a month later, he’s running the show at the Alaska SeaLife Center (ASLC), an aquatic rehabilitation, scientific research and education facility in Seward, Alaska. The young sea otter, whose name captures his mischievous spirit (Pushki is another name for the Alaskan plant known as a cow parsnip, which can sometimes cause burns), has been keeping his veterinary team busy with his playful baby antics. “He’s incredibly lucky to have this second chance at life,” said Lisa Hartman, the ASLC husbandry director. “If we weren’t here, he likely wouldn’t be either.” But earlier this year, the research center seemed like the one in trouble. The ASLC is the only facility in the state that rehabilitates aquatic animals, and has a zoo and aquarium that are open to the public; in a normal summer, the center sees more than 160,000 visitors, largely from out of state. This year – because the vast majority of Alaska’s summer tourists come in on cruise ships, all of which were canceled due to the pandemic – it saw only a fourth of it normal numbers. The future of the 22-year-old center – and the more than 4,000 creatures it houses – appeared uncertain. On 13 July, the ASLC announced they would be forced to close permanently unless they were able to raise $2m by the end of September. Their plea resonated: by 1 October they had raised $4m, over half of which came from individual donors. Tara Riemer, CEO and president, said while they’re not yet operating at their prior level, at least they will remain open and be able to continue caring for their animals and conducting important research through the winter. With several species of seals, a few sea lions, myriad fish and an assortment of marine birds, the ASLC has made a name for itself as a bustling aquarium in small-town Seward (population: 2,700). But it also punches well above its weight in the global conservation and science arenas. The animals cared for at the center – some of which, like Pushki, have just been rescued and others which have been living there for much longer – have helped inform the greater aquatic and arctic research. One of the center’s newest studies is looking at ice seals, who historically haven’t been studied as rigorously by the scientific community as some of their aquatic peers. Studying the seals, as the ice they reside on melts due to global warming, helps give researchers an understanding of “what’s happening with our environment and our ecosystems in real time”, according to Hartman. “We’ve been able to gather information that nobody else has been able to gather before,” said Hartman. Their longest-running study began more than 20 years ago, when Steller sea lions became listed as endangered. By examining a nearby rookery over multiple generations, researchers have been able to study what threatens their existence. In the time since, they have learned about what makes for a successful breeding period for the Steller sea lions and what are some of the biggest obstacles for the juveniles to make it to adulthood. “You get an incredibly different perspective by watching them over so many years,” said John Maniscalco, the lead scientist of the study since its inception. “A lot of studies don’t last this long. You’re not going to get that understanding of how things are changing in one year versus five, 10 or 20 years.” The center is the only facility in the state capable of rehabilitating aquatic animals – the few other animal facilities in the state have a different focus. The closest facility that could take sick or hurt Alaska animals is a 44-hour drive (or several hours of driving and multiple flight connections) away in Vancouver, Canada, and getting permits to export animals is challenging. For animals rescued in poor shape, waiting that long is often not an option. The ASLC is also the only oiled wildlife response center in the state – meaning that, in the event of an oil spill, they had be tasked with organizing animal clean-up efforts. The ASLC hopes to empower other centers to take action if and when animals need to be rehabilitated: in recent years, the ASLC has started training professionals at zoos and aquariums nationwide on how to respond to animals that have encountered oil spills. They’re the only place in the country that offers that training. “If we were not here there would not be a resource to help train people, nor would there be a group of trained professionals locally that can immediately be deployed,” Hartman said. “Those first 72 hours are critical in getting your hands on those animals and starting treatment.” Whenever they can’t release an animal back into the wild, either due to regulations (NOAA doesn’t allow ice seals to be returned, for example) or because they missed out on learning necessary survival skills from mom (as is the case for Pushki), they’re sent to another aquarium or zoo with a goal of furthering that conservation message well beyond their state boundaries. Caring for a sea otter like Pushki is one of the most expensive endeavors the ASLC undergoes; it costs the center $25,000 a month to look after and rehabilitate him, largely due to their entirely shellfish diet. In the coming months, the ASLC will look for aquatic facilities elsewhere to house Pushki for the rest of his life. But, Hartman argues it’s worth it, because saving Pushki, and others like him, helps influence future generations to care about the world around them. Pushki will soon join the legions of other ASLC graduates who now, in some small way, teach millions around the world about the importance of healthy ecosystems and being good caretakers of the planet. “For me, the most critical thing about the Alaska SeaLife Center is about developing a sense of empathy and care for our environment and our world and the animals we share it with,” Hartman said. “We have the ability to connect people. To see what is happening in our world and try to inspire change.”",environment
"Two new fungi species that infect flies and eject spores out of a large hole in the insect’s abdomen “like small rockets” have been discovered in Denmark. The new species, Strongwellsea tigrinae and Strongwellsea acerosa, are host-specific and rely on two species of Danish fly – Coenosia tigrina and Coenosia testacea, according to researchers at the University of Copenhagen. While most fungi spore once the host is dead, with strongwellsea, the host continues to live for days, carrying out normal activities and socialising with other flies while the fungus consumes its genitals, fat reserves, reproductive organs and finally its muscle, all the while shooting out thousands of spores on to other individuals. After a few days, the fly lies on its back, spasms for a few hours and then dies, according to research by the University of Copenhagen and the Natural History Museum of Denmark published in the Journal of Invertebrate Pathology. The unusual tactic of keeping the host alive while releasing spores is called active host transmission (AHT). It is an effective way of getting access to other healthy individuals. Scientists think the fungi could be producing substances that “dope” their hosts (sometimes colloquially referred to as “zombies”), meaning they can stay fresh enough to live for days after infection – only collapsing once there is nothing left in their abdomens but the fungus. “We suspect therefore that these fungi may produce amphetamine-like substances which keep a fly’s energy levels high up until the end,” said lead researcher Prof Jørgen Eilenberg from the department of plant and environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. Researchers also believe the fungi produce substances that keep microorganisms away from the fly fungal wound and keep it clean, but they are yet to test this. “They work like small rockets,” said Eilenberg. “They are almost shaped like torpedoes and are designed for going fast.” If they land on another fly they stick to the cuticle and then wiggle their way into the abdomen, where they start to proliferate. Thousands of spores will be released out from a single fly. The parasites probably only infect a small percentage of individuals – between 3 and 5% in a healthy fly population. Because the host continues to behave normally it is difficult to identify when it has been infected, which is why AHT is relatively under-researched. It has only been discovered in two complete genera – strongwellsea and a similar fungal genus called massospora, which uses cicadas in a similar way. Strongwellsea tigrinae was discovered by Eilenberg in 1993 in North Zealand in eastern Denmark. Strongwellsea acerosa was first seen in a residential area in greater Copenhagen by one of his students, Dorthe Britt Tiwald, in 1998. Both have only now been officially declared new species. There are now a total of five known species of strongwellsea. Dr Matthew Kasson, an associate professor of forest pathology and mycology at West Virginia University, who was not involved in this latest research, agrees strongwellsea may be producing the same “dope” compound as massospora, which he has researched. “It’s unclear how many species we have but I really think we’ve just scratched the surface,” he says. “The reason this discovery is important is because we can’t make broad, sweeping conclusions about host manipulation and behavioural modification based on a single genus. Having a second genus like strongwellsea, which induces the same behavioural response, is important in solving this bigger puzzle of active host transmission … Collectively, this group of insect-destroying fungi may represent the next frontier for drug discovery.”",environment
"Native oysters have unexpectedly returned to the shores of Belfast Lough after more than 100 years, researchers have discovered – though scientists are still unsure how they got there. Ostrea edulis, the European flat oyster, is listed as threatened and/or declining by the Ospar conservation scheme and is the focus of numerous biodiversity projects around Europe. But now it has impressed scientists by establishing itself in Belfast Lough without the aid of a reintroduction programme. Large numbers of oysters were last recorded in the sea inlet during the late 1800s before they were fished to oblivion a few years later. A WhatsApp photo of an oyster, found by an old friend who had taken a loughside walk, was what first alerted David Smyth at Bangor University in Wales to the recurrence of the species. “I nearly fell off my chair,” he said. That was two years ago and, on a visit to scour the coast, he failed to find any himself. But after receiving another report, Smyth conducted a systematic survey in May and June this year, and discovered 41 live oysters scattered around the coast. It’s a boost to biodiversity in the lough, since oysters filter seawater and their shells provide a habitat for many other sea creatures including tiny worms, snails, algae and anemones. Smyth and his colleagues published details of the discovery in the Regional Studies in Marine Science journal. They reveal that some of the oysters, based on estimates of their age, might have been living in the lough for a decade. “The big question is, how did they get there?” Smyth said. One theory suggested by the researchers is that sediment moved to Belfast Lough from the Irish Sea perhaps contained young oysters, which then went on to establish a small population in the area. Belfast is an increasingly busy port and it is also possible that the regular washing effect caused by ships’ wakes has reduced the amount of sediment along the lough shore to levels suitable for oyster reproduction. They prefer a seafloor littered with shells and low in sediment, according to Joanne Preston at the University of Portsmouth, who was not involved in the research. “I think it’s really interesting,” she said of the oysters’ return, adding: “The take-home message is, if you create the environmental conditions … then the species will be able to establish there again.” The oysters, still scarce in the lough, would probably require intervention from conservationists if they are to thrive, said Smyth. Because of this, and the possibility that the shellfish may contain pollutants, he cautioned against members of the public gathering and eating them. In principle, however, the lough could one day be home to a future oyster fishery right near Northern Ireland’s capital, he added. The return of oysters was encouraging, said Lynn Gilmore at the Seafish Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, an industry group. She also happened upon one of the oysters while out walking this April, and told Smyth about her find. She said that 40 years ago the water quality was very different: “I remember my granny letting us go swimming in Belfast Lough – and coming out with tar on our feet and her having to clean it off with butter.”",environment
"For about a year, McKinnon and Quinta have been watching a flock of sheep in a nature reserve in western Victoria. But the two Maremma dogs aren’t really there to look after 146 sheep. They’re there to protect 20 tiny eastern barred bandicoots in an ingenious trial to help bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Two weeks ago, the bandicoots were released from breeding programs into the fenced 50-hectare reserve to stop the bandicoots from escaping. But the fencing won’t stop feral foxes, a key threat to the bandicoots, from moving through the area. Conservationists hope the presence of McKinnon, a four-year-old male, and Quinta, a three-year-old female, will stop the foxes attacking the bandicoots. Zoos Victoria threatened species biologist Dr Amy Coetsee says the dogs have been trained since they were puppies to ignore bandicoots and bond with the sheep. “These dogs aren’t great pets – they like to have a job,” says Coetsee. “They’re big shaggy beautiful animals, but they will create what we call a landscape of fear.” The idea to use the dogs as guardians comes from a project at Middle Island in south-west Victoria, where Maremma dogs protect Little Penguins during breeding season. Coetsee said: “The dog is a bigger predator than the fox. It doesn’t necessarily stop the foxes moving through, but it makes them more cautious and they won’t stop to look for prey.” Eastern barred bandicoots only exist in protected reserves, such as fox-free French Island, and are extinct on Australia’s mainland. Zoos Victoria guardian dog coordinator David Williams said some of the bandicoots might not survive the move back to a natural habitat, but the presence of the dogs should change the behaviour of foxes enough to give the bandicoots a fighting chance. The dogs are monitored and fed regularly and all three species – sheep, dog and bandicoot – should be able to share the same grassy habitat. Coetsee said a measure of success would be if the 10 female and 10 male bandicoots started to breed. Guardian dogs could turn out to be a cheaper and friendlier solution to feral foxes than having to build long fox-proof fencing. Zoos Victoria is working with the University of Tasmania and the National Trust of Australia, which owns the reserve, on the trial. There are 35 remote cameras on the reserve. The dogs are fitted with GPS trackers and the bandicoots have lightweight radio transmitters attached to their tails. Coetsee said the bandicoots, that weight only about 750g, would once have thrived in the area. The digging action of bandicoots helps soil health and seed distribution, said Coetsee. “They’re a pretty amazing and resilient animal and they should be here.” Conservation efforts to save the bandicoot started in the late 1980s, with captive breeding programs and releases into safe havens on islands helping to stop the species going extinct. If the Skipton trial works there are plans to release more bandicoots into other areas with guardian dogs in 2021.",environment
" Unions have mounted a legal push for casual fruit pickers to be paid a minimum of $25 an hour, putting an end to farmers paying as little as $3 an hour under piece rate arrangements. The Australian Workers’ Union on Tuesday afternoon applied to the industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission, to change the Horticulture Award to introduce a minimum pay rate. The Horticulture Award currently allows farmers to pay workers either a piece rate, according to how much fruit they pick, or an hourly rate. A series of inquiries and reports have exposed exploitation in the fruit-picking industry, which is staffed largely by offshore labour including Pacific Islanders and backpackers. Last week, a report by the McKell Institute, commissioned by the AWU, found some blueberry pickers were being paid as little as $3 an hour, and alleged systematic wage theft by labour hire firms the union says now dominate the industry. Walton said the industry was rife with problems including physical violence, harassment and passports being taken away from overseas workers. “It’s become the centrepiece for exploitation in this country,” he said. He said the minimum pay rate would stop growers ripping off workers by reducing the piece rate when work was easier – something he said he saw on a visit to a blueberry farm. “In certain strips of blueberry plantations some had grown more than the others,” he said. “If you got a bountiful strip they’d doctor the rate. “If the industry is so focused on having piece rates in place, that’s completely fine. But don’t use piece rates as a way of undercutting what is already the lowest award rate in the country.” Under the AWU’s proposed amendment, employers would still be allowed to pay piece rates. However, they would be required to pay the award’s current minimum hourly rate – which is the same as the minimum wage – no matter how little fruit was picked. For casuals – the vast majority of fruit-pickers – that would be $24.80 an hour. Permanent employees would be required to be paid $19.84 an hour. “Piecework rates are persistently set at levels which do not enable a competent employee to earn the minimum hourly rate,” the AWU said in its submission to the FWC. Walton said that fruit farmers depended on foreign workers arranged by labour hire firms. The AWU last tried to change the award to put a floor under piece rates in 2009, but was defeated by employers. The chief executive of the National Farmers Federation, Tony Mahar, said the organisation would “reserve comment until we see the detail of the AWU’s proposal”. “However it must be stressed that when properly used, piece rates reward productivity and no change to the award can be allowed to compromise that position,” he said.",environment
"In June 1975, a small group of activists set off from the coast of California in an 85ft boat. They were headed for the Dalniy Vostok factory ship, which was at sea conducting business as usual: harpooning sperm whales. The activists were members of Greenpeace, an organisation that had only recently been founded, in Vancouver in 1971, and they were setting out to meet the Russian whaling ship under the banner of what would become one of the most famous slogans of the environmental movement, Save the Whales. They thought they knew what to expect. Inspired by the Canadian ecologist and writer Farley Mowat, who had explained that commercial whaling was taking some species close to extinction, Greenpeace had decided to make saving whales a key part of its mission – specifically to photograph the reality of commercial whaling at sea, which few people had ever witnessed. But what they saw when the Dalniy Vostok came into view was a shock nonetheless. “There was blood all over the water, there were dead whales in the water, and there was a large pipe that came out from the hull of the factory ship that was running constantly with blood,” says Rex Weyler, co-founder of Greenpeace. “We could see the giant slabs of whale being ripped off the bone. There was the stench of dead whales and blood, and there were sharks in the water. It was a horror show.” Amid the carnage, Wexler and activists including Paul Watson, who went on to found the campaign group Sea Shepherd, attempted to slow the whale hunt by placing themselves between the live animals and the harpooners, and took photos. But they also tried something unexpected of their own. Using an onboard sound system, they began to blast an eerie noise: whale song, taken from the 1970 album, Songs of the Humpback Whale. Produced by marine biologist Dr Roger Payne from audio of male humpbacks singing off the coast of Bermuda, Songs of the Humpback Whale had been a surprise hit with the public, and remains the only multiplatinum-selling album of animal sounds. It also announced a scientific breakthrough: Payne and his team had found that whales don’t just call but actually sing to each other, in slowly repeating patterns. The success of the album had been one of the reasons Greenpeace chose whaling as an early focus in the first place. By the early 1970s, public understanding had advanced to the point that whales became animals that “people internationally could all relate to”, says Weyler. “Whales are intelligent. They have families. And they even, we learned at that time, make music and vocalise. The whale was the perfect species in danger that could stand for all of wild nature.” As the activists turned on the loudspeakers to blast it at the Dalniy Vostok, they also hoped whale song could be a language that could cross boundaries. “We came right up beside the giant ship. The crew lined the rails of three decks, towering above us,” recalls Weyler of the moment when they played the music. “It was quite dramatic. They waved and shouted and hooted. They seemed, to tell you the truth, quite friendly and interested in us. “And they were fascinated by the whale sound. Very few of the crew on the boat were actually whalers and harpooners. There were people working in the kitchens, boathands, people who were cutting up and processing the whales dragged on board.” The effect was profound. Although the harpooners did not stop whaling that day, Greenpeace had scored a success. The anti-whaling movement would go on to transform world opinion, paving the way for the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) 1982 decision to ban commercial whaling starting in 1986 – of which Russia, along with Japan, was one of the biggest proponents. The Dalniy Vostok would eventually cease whaling and became a fishing trawler. (In 2015, it sank off the coast of Russia, killing most of the crew.) Whale populations began to rise, and have done so – with some exceptions – ever since. As of May 2020, humpback whale populations had returned to 93% of their pre-whaling size. But in 2020, 50 years on from the release of the album, whales are once again in the global headlines for all the wrong reasons. A new series of threats to whales have appeared. Commercial whaling has started to return, with Norway and Japan among the countries that have abandoned the IWC ban. And whaling is the least of it. Collisions with ships, bycatch from fishing, habitat loss due to the climate emergency and a global plastic pollution crisis are hitting whales from all directions on a scale unknown in the 1970s. Most pernicious of all, however, is the noise. “Shipping has increased by 300% in the past two decades and noise is a massive issue,” says Helen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager for the Worldwide Fund for Nature. “Sound in the water is really important for the toothed whales like sperm whales, which use sound to identify prey and to navigate. If you upset those functions then you are undermining that animal’s ability to survive.” The deadly threat posed to whale song by shipping noise was underlined during the pandemic, when whales got a brief respite from the din. In lockdown-quietened waters, researchers were able to record whales singing with increased frequency, and at lower volumes. But with new vaccines emerging and the global economy adjusting to the pandemic restrictions, the “lockdown effect” looks set to be a blip. Fifty years since an album of whale songs brought to public attention one of the great wonders of the ocean, do we need to save the whales all over again? “When I discovered that humpbacks were singing, one of my biggest worries was, ‘well, nobody knows what a humpback whale is’,” says Payne, now 85, speaking from his home in Vermont. “The attitude that people had to whales then is very hard to conjure up in our age. It was sort of, ‘uh-huh’. People knew whales were very big, and that was about it.” He first heard whales singing in the late 1960s, on tapes made by a US navy engineer, Frank Watlington. Watlington had been listening out for explosions off the coast of Bermuda, but was surprised to find the noises obscured by the sound of whales calling to each other. Using military hydrophones, he recorded the whale vocalisations at rare length. A whale enthusiast himself, Watlington recognised the recordings’ potential significance, and passed them to two visiting marine biologists: Payne and his then wife, Katy. We still don’t know all the reasons that baleen whales sing, but it is thought to be how male humpbacks advertise their location and credentials to potential mates. Katy Payne, a researcher in acoustic biology at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, used the recordings to prove that male humpbacks sing the same songs together in groups, and gradually compose new ones, changing their songs each year. Females are thought to be attracted to males singing the most “current” songs. If it was a breakthrough to realise that the whales could sing, perhaps as remarkable was discovering how emotionally involving the songs of these vast marine mammals are to human ears. “Something about their sounds knocked me out, inspired a sense of wonder, just a ‘wow’ reaction,” recalls Roger Payne of hearing the recordings for the first time, and realising they could help draw public attention to whales. “It felt obvious to me that this is the way that we can capture people’s imagination.” Payne produced the album from Watlington’s audio and released it commercially as Songs of the Humpback Whale. The album was a hit. National Geographic magazine gave it a further boost by distributing 10.5m promotional copies. Payne says he has seen crowds of 200 people burst into tears on hearing it. “The definition of a song is simply a repeated rhythmic pattern,” he says, but whale song transmits “a message that gets to other levels of your brain than the songs of most animals. “Some of the laws of musical composition of humpbacks’ songs are the same as in human music,” he notes. “Whales, for example, use sonata form: the establishment of a theme and then a variation, then a return. Well, how the hell do you explain that? My suspicion is that music probably vastly predates our species.” What’s more, Katy Payne and her colleague Linda Guinee would go on to prove that humpback songs also use the equivalent of “rhyme”: consistent end-note sounds to the most complex sections, thought to be a mnemonic device to help the whales memorise the longest songs. Songs of the Humpback Whale heralded a cultural shift, as awareness of whales’ intriguingly human-like qualities became widespread. The “great whales” – including humpbacks and blue whales – became awe-inspiring wildlife icons, a status that is now self-evident. They were also in unparalleled danger. Commercial whaling had existed since the 1800s, but by the mid-1960s it was happening on a mass scale around the world. It was largely through the efforts of Greenpeace that the public began to realise the threats posed to whales, after the activists returned from their shocking encounter with the Dalniy Vostok. “It was a really traumatising experience for all of us on the Greenpeace ship,” says Weyler, speaking from his home on Cortes Island, British Columbia. “We had never seen anything like that.” Still, he credits that trip and the resulting photographs for beginning to change public opinion. “We were aware that just explaining that the whales were being hunted would not be enough to get the attention of global policymakers and media. By confronting the whalers and bringing the pictures of the horror of the slaughter, that’s what shocked the world – and brought ecology into the modern era.” In 1974, a 14-year-old girl named Maris Sidenstecker was one of those shocked. The teenager, from Los Angeles, had come across an article in an inflight magazine explaining the new existential threat to blue whales. “I just could not get it out of my mind,” says Sidenstecker, now a marine biologist. Inspired, she designed and printed a T-shirt with her drawing of a blue whale and the words, “Save the whales”. People began to ask her where they could buy one and soon, through a small ad in Rolling Stone magazine, Sidenstecker was shipping T-shirts nationwide. “That’s when we really started selling a lot more,” she says, “boxes and boxes of them.” At the age of 16, Sidenstecker founded a charity, Save The Whales, which she still runs today. It was official: saving whales was mainstream, and the anti-whaling campaign went worldwide. “Later, we confronted the whalers in the mid-Pacific around Hawaii and then, even later Greenpeace, Sea Shepherd and other organisations confronted whaling fleets in the South Pacific and South Atlantic,” recalls Weyler. “It became a global movement.” By the 1980s, as the IWC ban came into effect and populations began slowly to recover, crowding on to the deck of a boat to catch a glimpse of a whale’s back became a life-affirming way to spend leisure time. “Whale-watching was something I pushed right from the start,” says Payne, “because if you see a whale up close you’re not going to forget it.” The 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home captured the zeitgeist with its story of saving humpback whales in San Francisco Bay. Save the Whales had become – along with the effort to reduce the hole in the ozone layer – perhaps the greatest environmental success story of the 20th century. Incidentally, Sidenstecker never claimed to have invented the phrase “save the whales”. Greenpeace chose it independently for its campaign, and in a 2015 interview with NPR, Katy Payne remembered Watlington telling them, “Go and save the whales”. At one point Sidenstecker attempted to register the name for her charity. “We did try to trademark the name about 20 years ago,” she says from her home in whale-rich Monterey Bay, California. “We were told to forget it. It’s a phrase in the public domain now that everyone uses.” Just as the world thought whales were saved, however, new threats began to emerge. In 1993, just seven years after the IWC whaling ban, Norway broke from the agreement and resumed commercial whaling; it is still the world’s biggest killer of whales. Japan abandoned the agreement in 2018. Iceland, too, is also still whaling, though there are signs that the practice might be coming to an end as whale-watching tourism makes better economic sense. Still, commercial whaling pales in comparison to the death toll in what is known as “bycatch”. Whales are frequently entangled in fishing gear, such as lines joining equipment on the seabed to surface buoys, or killed while fishers are hunting other species. Worldwide, bycatch kills as many as 300,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises every year, making it by far the biggest killer of cetaceans. According to the WWF, bycatch led to the recent extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin in China, and is a critical threat to endangered North Atlantic right whales and Arabian Sea humpback whales, among many other cetacean species. Another threat is from commercial shipping, particularly collisions. “Vessels are getting bigger and travelling more quickly, which makes them a key threat to whales,” says McLachlan. Whales struck by ships often die, and a recent study  suggested that speed limits don’t always help: even slow-moving boats are likely to kill endangered right whales in a collision. But the most poignant new threat of all, given the profound impact of Songs of the Humpback Whale, must be the disruption of their song caused by the noise from commercial shipping, which has had a direct effect on whale populations. “It’s about communication, including for breeding and between mothers and calves,” says McLachlan of whale song. “You know yourself that if you’re in a crowded pub. You have to shout to be heard, and it’s exhausting after a while.” Some scientists also speculate that commercial shipping noise may be altering the content of the whale songs. Michelle Fournet of Cornell University hypothesises that whale song may be richer and more complex when human-generated noise abates, as it did during the pandemic, when reduced shipping activity briefly allowed humpbacks to benefit from the clearer singing conditions. That effect is not likely to last, however. Some solutions are being sought, such as responsive shipping routes plotted to avoid areas where whales are likely to be breeding, feeding or migrating. In Canada’s Bay of Fundy, “shipping lanes were moved for right whales, and they returned to areas they had vacated”, says McLachlan. “There is even whale-avoidance software that vessels can operate.” In October 2020, blue whale song was also found to change during migratory journeys, with a Stanford University study showing that whales’ switch from night-time to daytime singing as they start to migrate – potentially another way to better predict whales’ migration routes, and thus help reduce collisions. Similarly, with bycatch, technological innovation could help lower casualties from fishing equipment with, for example, remote collection of lobster traps rather than lines attached to a buoy on the surface. Many of the threats cannot be solved with technology, however. Critical habitat loss and the plastic pollution crisis are threats for which taking action after the fact is often too little, or too late, or simply impossible. For example, once toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) had entered the food chain, banning them did not change that fact. They are still found in orcas off Scotland. “It is key for overall ocean health that we have a healthy, dynamic population of these top predators,” says McLachlan. She adds that, because whales store tonnes of carbon dioxide in their bodies, they are also key to mitigating the climate crisis. If whales are threatened, it’s bad news for all of us. Roger Payne’s obsession with what he calls “whale speak” continues to inform his research. As well as discovering that some whales sing, another breakthrough was calculating just how far some great whales can hear. In deep ocean (and, he adds, in a pre-human-noise-pollution world), “I was shocked to calculate that blue whales and fin whales could hear each other as far as 13,000 miles away.” But it’s the languid musicality of whale song itself that connected with so many people. Otherworldly in the truest sense, it predates humans by tens of millions of years. There is something else that plays on Payne’s mind, something he has never been able to prove, and probably never will. “My suspicion is that the difference between whale communication and human communication may be that they are transmitting emotions directly,” he says. “We can’t do that. We need words.”",environment
"The willow tit has become Britain’s fastest declining resident bird, and one of half a dozen imperilled woodland species, according to the definitive survey of the country’s birds. Numbers of the diminutive tit, a subspecies unique to the UK, have plummeted by 94% since 1970, and by a third since 2008. The willow tit, which lives in dense birch thickets close to wetlands or water, has almost entirely vanished from south-east England and now survives mainly in post-industrial sites such as former coalmines, north-east of Derbyshire. Woodland birds have slumped by 27% since the 1970s and are continuing to dramatically decline, falling by 7% over the past five years, according to the new report. The breeding populations of five rare forest-dwelling species – lesser spotted woodpecker, lesser redpoll, spotted flycatcher, capercaillie and marsh tit – are now less than a quarter of what they were 50 years ago. Fiona Burns, lead author of the report produced by the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) together with the government’s nature conservation bodies, said: “The UK’s birds are telling us that nature is in retreat. The continuing losses seen across many species are not sustainable and more needs to be done to stop the declines and help populations revive and recover.” According to Mark Eaton, principal conservation scientist at the RSPB, the willow tit’s decline is caused by a burgeoning wild deer population eating out dense thickets and the scrubby under-storey of many woodlands, the drying out of soils caused by the climate crisis, and the fragmentation of woods because of developments such as housing, new roads, and new railways. All three trends are particularly pronounced in the south-east. While a few woodland species such as goldcrest can survive in non-native conifer plantations, such new forests – being planted in part to offset carbon emissions – will not help the declining birds. “The easiest solution to our lack of trees is a very poor solution for these struggling birds,” said Eaton. The Breeding Bird Survey also shows a continuing decline for “farmland” birds, including Britain’s fastest declining bird, the migratory turtle dove. Farmland birds have continued to decline by 5% between 2013 and 2018 with an overall decline of 45% on 1970 populations. But Eaton said the prognosis for farmland birds was more hopeful, with conservation science better understanding the reasons for their declines, and agri-environment schemes – where farmers are paid for nature-friendly practices – being scientifically proven to boost bird numbers. With the government promising that its new post-Brexit farm support, the Environmental Land Management Scheme (Elms), will provide money for farming that produces “public goods” such as healthy soils and wildlife-rich countryside, Eaton said there were “reasons to be cautiously optimistic”. “We know agri-environment schemes work,” he said. “It’s having them at sufficient scale across enough farms to really turn things around at a population level. Certainly in England there’s the potential for that scale to be achieved [with Elms].” One thriving farmland bird is the wood pigeon, which is singlehandedly responsible for the biomass of native British birds actually rising since the late 1960s, despite the loss of 19 million pairs of native birds, to leave a population of 83 million native pairs. Smaller birds have declined in number – 10.7 million pairs of house sparrows have vanished – but the wood pigeon has added 3,300 tonnes of biomass to the UK total of 20,000 tonnes. The wood pigeon has prospered with the intensification of arable farming, fattening up on winter-sown crops and oilseed rape. According to Eaton, Britain’s bird populations show signs of “biotic homogenisation”, which means there are fewer species thriving but some adaptable “generalist” species such as wood pigeons are thriving, while species with very particular needs, such as willow tits, are disappearing. Britain’s 83 million pairs of native birds are joined each summer by 57 million non-native pheasants and partridges, which are released to be shot. While fieldfares and golden orioles are close to becoming extinct as breeding birds in Britain – not helped by global heating pushing their natural ranges northwards – there is some good news. Climate warming has helped large waterbirds colonise Britain, with cattle egrets now following little egrets, little bitterns and spoonbills to breed successfully, helped by improved legal protections for the birds and their wetland habitats. Populations of some of Britain’s rarer breeding birds have also increased, with cirl buntings, stone-curlews and corncrakes responding to targeted conservation action.",environment
"Rain returns in the fretting hours, beating against panes of dream. Early traffic splashes down from Broseley, birds stay hunched in roosts. When the weather breaks, they sally out in the first damp glimmer. At dawn, behind horizon clouds, what is not fire burns what is not day. Sunlight of the new normal is a cool, rinsed thing that draws something not-normal from the water. A mist rises from ponds and brooks. It flows uphill, pale and smoky, following the old green rut of a track, hollowed and abandoned generations ago. What looks like a pasture with a few tall lime trees and a cluster of thorns was once a place of wilder festive gatherings. The mist moves up it with direction and purpose as a processional breath, to pool in open ground beyond the trees. The day is over quickly and leaves little of itself behind but the tinkling of goldcrests in the ivy and the echoes of gunshots. Dusk is filthy with mud and mystery. On the hill, against a moony lustre in the south-west, there is the slight of a buzzard gliding darker than the edge of trees – a thought just beyond sight. So, whistle. Whistle it back. The buzzard mews, and although the sounds are so unlike, here it comes, turning short spirals in the lighter air, lifting on the central-heating updraught above school buildings towards the hill until it’s overhead. In a breeze through year’s end, the buzzard takes a speculative turn to inspect the whistler, then without pause or wing movement, swings over pines and the cold quarry hole north. Along the lane it is still mild enough for bats to thread laceholes between trees, and the spirit claps for the almost-touch of wings and ultrasound grins of them. Three tawny owls, one in the wood, one in the lane, one in the field, shake their calls out, triangulating a position. The lane owl, silhouetted in an ash tree, throws its head forward and hoots three times. It retreats into the dark with the studied urgency of a quarry blaster who has lit the fuse in a drill hole of black powder.",environment
"The “ugliest orchid in the world”, a toadstool discovered at Heathrow airport, and a bizarre scaly shrub have topped a list of new species named by scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and their collaborators in 2020. The researchers said the 156 new plants and fungi highlighted the amazing diversity of species that remain to be found, with the potential to provide new crops, medicines and gardener’s favourites. One is a morning glory plant, whose sweet purple tubers are already eaten by local people in the high Andes of Peru. A third of the new species are orchids, but one confounded the family’s reputation for great beauty, with RGB Kew calling it the “ugliest in the world”. The plant – Gastrodia agnicellus – was found in a national park in Madagascar and its 11mm flowers are brown, fleshy and grotesque, and are likely to be pollinated by flies. The orchid remains underground in the deep shade of a humid forest most of the time, emerging only to flower, but it has “a noticeable musk rose-like scent”, the scientists said. “In a difficult year, it’s so thrilling to see botanical and mycological science continue, with a bumper list of incredible newly named species,” said Martin Cheek at RBG Kew. “There are some amazing new finds, each with their own unique qualities and potential for humanity.” “However, the bleak reality facing us cannot be underplayed: with two in five plants threatened with extinction, it is a race against time to find, identify, name and conserve plants before they disappear,” he said. There were six new webcap toadstools named in the UK in 2020, all from a genus known to be important in supporting the growth of oak, beech and birch trees. Cortinarius heatherae was discovered along the river on the boundary of Heathrow airport by the mycologist Andy Overall and named after his wife, Heather. Three were found in Scotland, one in Brighton and another in woods at Barrow-in-Furness. The strangest new species was a dwarf shrub with bizarre scaly leaves that grows in extremely hot natural salt pans in Namibia. Its name – Tiganophyton – is derived from the Greek word τηγάνι (tigani), which means frying pan. DNA analysis showed the plant is part of the cabbage order, but represents a completely new family – such discoveries are rare. Among the new orchids, 19 tree-dwelling species are from the tropical paradise island of New Guinea, one with spectacular golden orange flowers and others having hair-like tufts on their flowers. A beautiful new bromeliad discovered on a forest-shaded limestone cliff in Brazil was one of the species already under threat. The scientists believe the plant is pollinated by hummingbirds but only 25 plants were found and the extraction of limestone to make cement is a serious threat in this area. Another new species is a shrub related to blueberries found in Indonesian New Guinea, close to the world’s largest gold mine. Other finds included two new species of succulent-leaved aloe in Madagascar, which may have the medicinal benefits already known in aloe vera, and a new herb from the medicinally important plant family Apocynaceae, whose members are used to treat health issues such as flatulence, gonorrhoea, paralysis, burns, and fungal skin infections. The herb was found in the Chirinda forest of Zimbabwe but only a few plants are known to exist. One discovery did not involve scientists tramping through jungles or across mountains but was found by searching online. The spectacular Tanzanian hibiscus was found by the Australian specialist Lex Thomson, who was studying online images of historic herbarium specimens. The new plant has great potential for gardeners as it can withstand much drier conditions than the well-known Hibiscus schizopetalus.",environment
"Microplastic particles have been revealed in the placentas of unborn babies for the first time, which the researchers said was “a matter of great concern”. The health impact of microplastics in the body is as yet unknown. But the scientists said they could carry chemicals that could cause long-term damage or upset the foetus’s developing immune system. The particles are likely to have been consumed or breathed in by the mothers. The particles were found in the placentas from four healthy women who had normal pregnancies and births. Microplastics were detected on both the foetal and maternal sides of the placenta and in the membrane within which the foetus develops. A dozen plastic particles were found. Only about 4% of each placenta was analysed, however, suggesting the total number of microplastics was much higher. All the particles analysed were plastics that had been dyed blue, red, orange or pink and may have originally come from packaging, paints or cosmetics and personal care products. The microplastics were mostly 10 microns in size (0.01mm), meaning they are small enough to be carried in the bloodstream. The particles may have entered the babies’ bodies, but the researchers were unable to assess this. “It is like having a cyborg baby: no longer composed only of human cells, but a mixture of biological and inorganic entities,” said Antonio Ragusa, director of obstetrics and gynaecology at the San Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli hospital in Rome, and who led the study. “The mothers were shocked.” In the study, published in the journal Environment International, the researchers concluded: “Due to the crucial role of placenta in supporting the foetus’s development and in acting as an interface with the external environment, the presence of potentially harmful plastic particles is a matter of great concern. Further studies need to be performed to assess if the presence of microplastics may trigger immune responses or may lead to the release of toxic contaminants, resulting in harm.” The potential effects of microplastics on foetuses include reduced foetal growth, they said. The particles were not found in placentas from two other women in the study, which may be the result of different physiology, diet or lifestyle, the scientists said. Microplastics pollution has reached every part of the planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People are already known to consume the tiny particles via food and water, and to breathe them in. Their effect in the body is unknown but scientists say there is an urgent need to assess the issue, particularly for infants. In October, scientists revealed that babies fed formula milk in plastic bottles are swallowing millions of particles a day. In 2019, researchers reported the discovery of air pollution particles on the foetal side of placentas, indicating that unborn babies are also exposed to the dirty air produced by motor traffic and fossil fuel burning. The Italian researchers used a plastic-free protocol to deliver the babies in order to prevent any contamination of the placentas. Obstetricians and midwives used cotton gloves to assist the women in labour and only cotton towels were used in the delivery room. Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King’s College London, told the Daily Mail it was reassuring that the babies in the study had normal births but “it is obviously preferable not to have foreign bodies while the baby is developing”. Elizabeth Salter Green, at the chemicals charity Chem Trust, said: “Babies are being born pre-polluted. The study was very small but nevertheless flags a very worrying concern.” A separate recent study showed that nanoparticles of plastic inhaled by pregnant laboratory rats were detected in the liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and brain of their foetuses.",environment
"The sun sets the water ablaze, creating a dazzling trail of Greek fire, the light glittering as it bounces off the breeze-ruffled surface into my squinting eyes. I wish there was some way of distilling that molten brightness and drinking it; it is such a potent antidote to the past few days, which were hardly days at all, just a few hours of sickly gloom while the valley festered under cloud and murk. December can be a squalid month: dark, muddy, windy, waterlogged. The pocket of Wharfedale where I am living is overshadowed by the Chevin escarpment, and the sun barely creeps above it at this time of year. When a bright day finally materialises, I feel a vital urge to bask in the sunlight, and will spend as much time as possible between work manoeuvring myself into the valley’s high places, open spaces and sun traps. This is one such spot: the wetland nature reserve surrounding the small lakes created by the inundation of the old gravel pits. The sight of sunlight and water together is heartening in itself, reminding us of life’s fundamentals, but this area of water, woods, rough grassland and reedbeds is also home to a busy avian community. I have seen little egrets flying above the adjacent River Wharfe, and I think I spot one today. Cormorants, coots and black-headed gulls congregate on the wildfowl lake. Best of all, for me, are the lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), which overwinter here in relatively large numbers. At one point, a hundred or so rise up from the banks of a lake and flock together in a great aerial organism; a morphing, contorting mass which recalls the shapeshifting grace of a starling murmuration, twisting and turning in apparent unison. Lapwing flight is sometimes mischaracterised as clumsy, but in this massed form they reveal enormous powers of control and coordination. As the flock’s collective mind changes from one moment to the next, so does its appearance, oscillating between the main colours of lapwing plumage – black, white, and iridescent green – as the angle of flight shifts. Up there in the cold December sun, the birds seem wild, bright and brilliant.",environment
"Watching an American indie band is not the most obvious way to commune with a wonder of the natural world but look up Saint Simon by the Shins on YouTube. The band plays in a forest in central Mexico, surrounded by towering chandeliers of butterflies, trees full of butterflies, clouds of butterflies. It is a stunning encounter with the monarch, one of the world’s most remarkable migratory insects. Today it is tragic, too, because the video, filmed 15 years ago, is already a memento of vanished glory. Eastern monarch populations, which overwinter in Mexico, have fallen by 80% over 40 years.  Western monarchs, which over winter in California, have all but gone. In 1997, more than 1m were counted in California over Thanksgiving. Five years ago, it was 300,000. In 2020, less than 2,000 were counted. Despite this collapse, the US government has concluded that the monarch is unworthy of special protection under the Endangered Species Act. There are more urgent priorities, apparently. In Mexico, conservationists are murdered for trying to protect the monarch. Ultimately, the extinction crisis will kill us, and if we cannot take the international action required to save this wondrous creature – outlawing insect-killing pesticides and saving ancient forests – then perhaps obliteration is what we deserve.",environment
"Australia’s wildlife are at least 20 times more likely to come across a deadly feral cat than one of the country’s native predators, according to a new study. Invasive cats, which kill billions of native animals each year, form a triple threat, the study finds, by hunting with greater intensity, in broader environments and in greater numbers than an equivalent native marsupial predator – the spotted-tailed quoll. “They eat everything and they’re in every environment,” says study author Dr Rowena Hamer. “They’re impressive, but devastating.” Feral cats have a devastating toll on Australia’s wildlife, killing an estimated 2bn animals every year and being implicated in at least 25 mammal extinctions and pressuring a further 124 threatened species. Domestic cats also kill about 230m Australian birds, reptiles and mammals each year, research has found. Hamer and colleagues attached GPS collars to 25 feral cats and 10 quolls in four locations in the middle of Tasmania and then tracked their movements. Quolls are similar in size to cats and have similar diets, hunting for small mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs. “This was about understanding why cats are so devastating, because Australia seems to have similar native predators,” said Hamer, who did the research while at the University of Tasmania, and is now a conservation ecologist at the not-for-profit Tasmanian Land Conservancy. Hamer’s results, published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, reveal quolls are more selective and less voracious hunters than cats. Using data on the numbers of cats and quolls, the habitats they prefer, and how often they go back to the same area, the study finds native wildlife are at least 20 times as likely to encounter a cat than a quoll. Hamer said the data showed the location of the cats and quolls every five minutes over about a month for each animal, and showed some quolls travelling 12km over a few days. Across fields, the data showed how quolls sprint across open areas in a straight line. Cats have only been in the Australian environment since the late 18th century and generally native species have not found ways to avoid being killed when they come across one. The study also found there were about nine cats for every square kilometre in the area studied, but there were only 0.4 quolls. Whether in pasture, grassland, woodland or creek banks, wildlife is now more likely to come across the invasive cat than the native quoll. The Australian National University’s Prof Sarah Legge, who has researched the toll of cats on native species, said the study revealed useful and complex information on why cats were such a “superb generalist predator that native mammals struggle to evade”. Legge, who was not involved in the study, said: “We know they are targeting small- to medium-sized mammals and this study helps us understand why it’s happening and gives us some clues as to what to do about it.” One approach suggested by the study is to maintain and restore complex understorey in habitats to give native animals places to hide from cats. Feral cats were declared a pest species in 2015. Feral cats threaten some 124 nationally listed species, according to the government. The Australia government is developing a new threatened species strategy which is expected to be released later this year. The previous five-year strategy, which closed in mid-2020, included targets for cat management and culling. Some 844,000 cats were culled between July 2015 and June 2018, an interim review said.",environment
"A landholder’s controversial plans to clear almost 2,000 hectares of native vegetation on Queensland’s Cape York were denied after he rejected government advice that it would put five threatened species at risk. Kingvale station owner Scott Harris, who wanted to clear the land for cropping, had also refused to pay for ecological surveys before clearing, according to a detailed statement provided to environmental campaigners by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, and seen by the Guardian. Guardian Australia revealed in December 2020 that Ley had rejected the plan to clear eucalypt forest and melaleuca swamps in a catchment running into the Great Barrier Reef. Ley released a statement of reasons to the Wilderness Society on 24 December with details about the process and her decision. In the statement, Ley said she was ready to allow the application with conditions, but Harris “had not given his consent to these conditions”. Ley’s refusal under Australia’s national environment laws was a rare example of a minister using the national powers to deny a development application. The power has been used just 24 times since the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act came into force in 2000. Campbell Newman’s Queensland government had granted a permit for the Kingvale clearing in 2014, but the plan was referred to the federal government to assess its likely environmental impacts. Environmental campaigners successfully went to court in 2018 to force a more comprehensive assessment of the Kingvale plan. Environment groups lined up to oppose the plan, encouraging more than 6,000 public submissions. Ley wrote that the clearing would be likely to have a significant impact on five species: the bare-rumped sheathtail bat, northern quoll, golden-shouldered parrot, antbed parrot moth and red goshawk. To protect the species, Ley wanted surveys carried out before any clearing took place, and an offset area identified, with a management plan that would improve habitat. Harris had offered not to clear trees on an area of the property the same size as that being cleared, but Ley’s statement said Harris did not propose to manage the area. In the statement, Ley said there had been “considerable correspondence” between Harris’s legal representative and the government. Ley wrote that as a result, she understood Harris’s position was that there was no evidence that any matters of national environmental significance existed on the property, or that clearing would have any impact on threatened species. Harris was not able to consent to the offset conditions, Ley wrote, and he had not agreed to pay for pre-clearance surveys. Ley had invited Harris to a meeting with her and environment department staff, but Harris “did not take up these invitations”, she wrote. Ley wrote that without mitigation, the clearing would have contributed a “substantial new and ongoing source of pollutants”, with fertilisers, sediment and pesticides going downstream into the Great Barrier Reef’s waters. The area proposed for the clearing drains into two rivers – the Hann and Kennedy – which run for 200km before reaching the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park at Princess Charlotte Bay. Ley said the Queensland government’s development permit required erosion mitigation measures, but she wanted further steps, including soil conservation, groundcover maintenance and sediment management. Gemma Plesman, a senior campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said it was estimated there were fewer than 1,500 golden-shouldered parrots left in the wild, and Kingvale had habitat suited to the bird. She said: “The fact that our system would even assess and consider the destruction of suitable habitat in the first place is preposterous.” She said surveys found termite mounds that the parrot and the northern quoll used for shelter, which would have been bulldozed. The fact that Ley was willing to allow the plan subject to offsets exposed a flaw in national environment laws, Plesman said. “Any system that would have allowed the destruction of mature habitat for endangered species will continue to lock in the loss of those species. “Our federal environment laws need to be strengthened so that old growth and important forest for endangered species like the golden shouldered parrot are off limits from destruction.” Representatives for Harris did not respond to email, text and voicemail messages requesting comment.",environment
"Perched on a tussocky slope, we eat our sandwiches in the winter sun, sit-mats sinking into damp moss among leaves of betony and St John’s wort. Heather stems nudge against my knees. Young hawthorns make a spiky canopy above my head. Through backlit stalks of knapweed, a field lies way below us, held in a crook of the Warksburn. The far side of the river is bordered by a cliff seen through a lattice of riparian alders. Atop that is a sheep field and above that the wide Northumberland sky. The Warksburn gathers water from a series of sikes or rills – including Nameless Sike – in the south-east corner of Kielder Forest. It’s a crimped blue line on the map like a pulled thread from a knitted jumper, twisting and looping through boggy ground between mist-caught ranks of conifers. Nearby, there are signs of the farming past in the shielings, stells and stack stands: shepherds’ huts, circular sheepfolds and mounds for drying fodder for winter. Passing the forestry village of Stonehaugh, the river winds through upland country sprinkled with names drawn from the land: Standingstone Clints, Lousy Bog, Cowcrook Moss and Boggly Burn. The Black Pool is deep and dark. By the long abandoned house of Low Roses Bower, there’s a netty called the Long Drop. A small stone building on the crag’s edge and 12 metres above the burn, it was in use until the 1950s. Past Roaring Hole waterfall, past settlements and peles, past a former watermill and through ribbons of woodland, the river descends to join the North Tyne. Running through what were once the unruly Debatable Lands, it inspired a 19th-century fiddle tune, the Warksburn Waltz. The great Northumberland forests are woven into the recent audio tales of the November Club, a local performing arts charity; the stories in Lost, Found and Told are united by a soundscape of moving water. We too find inspiration, sitting on the riverbank, sketchbooks held in cold hands, pencil and pen feeling for the lines of trees, the smooth curve of a natural weir. This was one of the first places that I discovered when I moved to Northumberland. At this difficult time, I feel calmed by the continuity of its flow and the history it carries with it.",environment
"Just before the 2008 Olympics, a machine on the roof of the US embassy in Beijing began to tweet air pollution measurements to the world. The numbers that appeared each hour were often shocking but they demonstrated the power of objective measurement. The resulting response has led to huge improvements in air quality for much of the vast Chinese population. Globally, particle pollution contributed to an estimated 4.1 million early deaths in 2019, but 141 of the world’s 234 countries had no regular measurements. If you live in the US, Canada or western Europe, your average distance to a monitoring site is just over 20km (12 miles). This seems a long way to give an understanding of the air in your local street but in central Africa the average distance is more than 1,000km. Satellite data can help but it is hard to resolve pollution in the lowest part of the atmosphere where we live. Computer models can combine satellite data with the location pollution sources and the sparse measurements, but this data is not good enough to tell us how air pollution changes day to day and in response to cleanup initiatives. There is an urgent need for more pollution measurements around the world.",environment
"Leading scientists have warned that global conservation is being undermined by celebrity power after they suffered death threats and abuse in a hostile dispute over trophy hunting. Groups such as the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting and Born Free are pressuring the UK and US governments to ban trophy hunting, with support from many famous names, much of the public and more than 150 MPs across the political spectrum. Many of them signed an open letter calling for a ban, which scientists say contained misleading information. Several scientists told the Guardian that poor political decision-making and abuse directed at them are being fuelled by what they describe as “myths driven by emotion and morality that ignore critical facts”. They also warn that well-meaning but ill-informed campaigning on the emotive issue risks imperilling millions of acres of wildlife habitat and African livelihoods. Although poorly regulated trophy hunting has had a negative impact historically on some wildlife populations, there is wide evidence, including from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), that for many threatened species such as the black rhino, white rhino, lion and markhor, well-regulated trophy hunting has brought population increases and reduced larger threats. Conservationists say that when habitats are managed for hunting, it can protect many other endangered species living in the same area. In 2019, 133 leading scientists and community representatives warned in a letter to the journal Science that banning hunting without implementing viable alternatives to protect habitat and generate revenue for local communities would imperil biodiversity. The scientists involved say this has led to a wave of abuse, including from anti-hunting campaign groups and celebrities. Dr Amy Dickman, a lion conservationist from Oxford University who has received funding from both pro- and anti-hunting groups, was the first author on the Science letter and said she had received numerous verbal attacks. The actor and animal welfare campaigner Peter Egan called her “a very limited scientist”, while others accused her of being a “paid mouthpiece” for hunting or called her “a monster” and “a twisted sadistic bitch”. Dickman claims another said they would love to see her face ripped off by lions. She was also asked to leave a meeting in parliament of politicians, activists and the media arranged by the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting. She is not alone: other signatories to the letter have reported similar abuse. The scientists say such attacks deter people from pointing out when misleading information is being spread. Adam Hart, professor of science communication at the University of Gloucestershire, said: “A lot of conservation scientists are scared to get involved in this debate as it is so toxic. I have had people call me a shill for the hunting industry, which is absolute twaddle. We get personal slurs against our professional integrity just for trying to engage people with the science, and trying to limit the wildlife loss that will come if trophy hunting is banned.” Born Free in the US and the UK Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting both say trophy hunting does not support conservation. Dickman said: “The campaigners’ narrative – suggesting trophy hunting is driving species to extinction and banning it will make things better – is false. I am unaware of any species where current trophy hunting is the primary threat to their persistence. The major threats are overwhelmingly habitat loss, poaching, prey loss and conflict with humans – all of which will be worsened if land used for trophy hunting is converted to agriculture or settlement. She added: “I can completely sympathise with how those images of grinning hunters turn peoples’ stomachs – they do the same to me – but the kinds of killings we see in areas where wildlife has no economic value are even worse.” Many red-listed species and their habitats are assessed by the IUCN as being supported to some extent upon by trophy hunting, including the giant eland, black rhino, white rhino, African elephant and lesser kudu. A UN report found that trophy hunting is conserving millions of acres of wildlife habitat in sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya’s 1977 ban on hunting was followed by declines of 70-88 % in some wildlife species monitored, including the warthog, lesser kudu, Thomson’s gazelle, eland, oryx and impala, while livestock increased substantially. Tanzania lost anti-poaching units and millions of acres of hunting areas after elephant trophy hunting imports were banned in the US. More than a million people signed a 2020 petition presented to Downing Street to ban trophy hunting imports, and the results of a government consultation are pending. In July, more than 50 African community leaders, who say they represent the views of millions of people across southern Africa, signed an open letter criticising British celebrities for using their influence to drive bans on trophy hunting – naming Ricky Gervais, Joanna Lumley, Peter Egan, Ed Sheeran, Dame Judi Dench and Piers Morgan. They asked them “to stop undermining our globally recognised conservation efforts and our basic human right to sustainably use the natural resources on which our communities’ livelihoods depend.” They added: “Imposing worldviews and value systems from faraway places, amplified through your powerful, influential voices, results in disastrous policies that undermine our rights and conservation success.” Dickman agreed: “I find it strange that people listen more to actors and comedians than to trained conservation scientists, or more importantly, to local stakeholders.” Born Free’s head of policy, Dr Mark Jones, said: “Trophy hunting is an emotive issue. Nevertheless, Born Free does not condone abuse of any kind.” He added: “We challenge the claims made by proponents of trophy hunting that it delivers significant conservation and community benefits, or that it positively contributes to the sustainable use of wildlife. Trophy hunting is a cruel relic of a colonial era that results in intense animal suffering and disruption of wildlife populations, while contributing little or nothing to local economies or wildlife conservation. It is also wracked by corruption and greed.” The Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting did not respond to requests for comment.",environment
"A coalition of NGOs is calling for an urgent ban on destructive bottom trawling in EU marine protected areas, after the failure of member states to defend seas. The ban is part of a 10-point action plan to “raise the bar” to achieve biodiversity targets, which they say will not be met by current promises, such as last year’s high-profile pledge by world leaders at the UN summit on biodiversity in New York to reverse nature loss by 2030.  A raft of EU laws to safeguard marine life – including a duty on EU member states to achieve “good environmental status” in seas by 2020, to achieve healthy ecosystems and to introduce sustainable fisheries management – have not been enforced, says the group, which includes Oceana in Europe, Greenpeace and ClientEarth. They warn that this failure, combined with existing pressures on Europe’s seas, including climate change, risks triggering irreversible changes to the ecological conditions under which humanity has evolved and thrived. The 10-point call to action, which the groupwill present to EU leaders, MEPs and member states, follows the commitment of Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission, and many EU heads of state or government, to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.  The call was published in response to a European parliament draft report on the EU’s biodiversity strategy for 2030. That draft report, which will be presented to the environment committee on Thursday, expresses strong regret that the EU has “neither fully met the 2020 biodiversity strategy objectives nor the global Aichi biodiversity targets”. While the NGOs welcomed the draft report, they said it does not go far enough to ensure enforcement of current EU laws or to set action plans to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. Rebecca Hubbard, programme director of Our Fish, which aims to end overfishing, said: “The EU has failed to achieve good environmental status for EU seas and the EU biodiversity strategy must be implemented if we are to have a chance of saving it – this implementation needs to include the 10 action points we have in our report.” She said the EU has also failed to end overfishing, and to protect marine habitats from bottom trawling. “What we really need to do is go from strategies and goals to action and outcomes. National pledges, goals and agreements are important for setting a direction but if we are going to save the planet we need action.” The 10-point action plan calls for a network of fully and highly protected ocean sanctuaries covering at least 30% of the oceans by 2030 and a drastic improvement in fisheries protections. It urges the EU to commit resources to dramatically ramp up, implement and enforce existing legislation to safeguard marine life. The groups also call on the EU to carry out environmental impact assessments of fishing activities, to set fishing limits with “precautionary buffers” for climate change and mandatory remote monitoring systems for all fishing fleets. It calls for measures to mitigate bycatch and for protections of the deep sea, such as closing sensitive areas to hydrocarbon exploration. And it calls for an end to harmful fishing subsidies and controls on underwater noise. Nicolas Fournier, the campaign director for marine protection at Oceana Europe, said: “The EU 2030 biodiversity strategy is strong on marine protection targets, but we want the European parliament to raise further the EU’s ambition on biodiversity, both internationally to champion the 30% of ocean protection and support the UN treaty for the high-seas, but also in Europe to call for a ban of all destructive fishing gear inside marine protected areas, starting with bottom-trawling.” Fewer than 1% of European marine protected areas are fully off-limits to fishing. Last month, the European court of auditors warned the EU had failed to halt marine biodiversity loss in Europe’s waters and to restore fishing to sustainable levels. In 2019, the European Environment Agency found “signs of stress at all scales” and warned the current and historical use of Europe’s seas was “taking its toll” on marine ecosystems  The call for action comes just days after warnings from international scientists that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinctions, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival.",environment
"Global sales of electric cars accelerated fast in 2020, rising by 43% to more than 3m, despite overall car sales slumping by a fifth during the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla was the brand selling the most electric cars, delivering almost 500,000, followed by Volkswagen. Sales of electric cars more than doubled in Europe, pushing the region past China as the world’s biggest market for them, according to data published on Tuesday by EV-volumes.com, a Sweden-based consultancy. Sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) made up 4.2% of the global car market, up from 2.5% in 2019. The rising sales are being driven by government policies to reduce carbon emissions, but a key factor is that electric cars are simply a better technology, said Viktor Irle, sales and marketing analyst at EV-volumes.com. Sales of electric cars did fall below 2019’s levels from March to June, at the height of the Covid-19 lockdowns, but recovered strongly after that and by December were at double the level in December 2019. A series of governments have set dates for the end of sales of fossil fuel-powered cars in the next decade or so. “The political push is still there – [governments] everywhere speak about the green recovery,” said Irle. “But the main reason for growth is simple – electric cars are a better technology. There is no noise, no pollution, better acceleration, and cheaper running costs. If people test-drive an electric car, they’re not going to go back to gasoline vehicles. The problem at the moment is that the price is a little bit higher, but the cost is really coming down as well.” Irle said the surge in sales in Europe may in part be because carmakers had to meet EU emissions targets averaged across their fleets in 2020, and may have pushed sales of low-emission vehicles more than in 2019. The relatively high purchase prices of today’s electric cars may have helped manufacturers weather the Covid-19 storm, Irle added: “The cheap car segments are always the worst hit [in recessions], because it’s not normally high-income people that buy those cars.” Tesla’s approach of selling cars directly to customers, rather than via franchised dealers, may also have helped while others’ showrooms were closed, and carmakers including Volkswagen also took up this sales approach in 2020. There are about 150 new BEV and PHEV models expected on the market in 2021. This indicates that 2021 will see continued growth, said Irle, who estimates sales of about 4.6m electric cars by the end of the year. The EV-volumes.com data showed the five highest national sales were in China (1.3m), Germany (0.4m), the US (0.3m), France and the UK (both 0.2m). However, growth in the US was only 4% in 2020, due to few new models being available. In the UK, 2020 was a record year for electric vehicle sales, according to data from the trade body SMMT, which said the sector was looking to a green recovery from poor overall sales. Sales of BEVs almost tripled in the UK, while those of PHEVs almost doubled, giving the vehicles a combined market share of 10.7%. Other non-plug-in hybrids took 18% of the market, but overall car sales were down 29%. In December 2020 BEVs and PHEVs outsold diesel cars by two to one in the UK, while the Tesla Model 3 was the UK’s top selling car that month. “The accelerated take-up [of electric vehicles] in 2020 is encouraging but a true mass market depends on a wide range of models at competitive prices,” said Steve Gooding, director of pro-motoring organisation the RAC Foundation. “The industry is delivering on the first point – there are reports that more plug-ins will be launched in the UK in 2021 than those running on petrol and diesel – but there remains an affordability gap. “Much attention also focuses on battery-powered cars as being ideal for the city, but they could be just at home in rural and remote areas where there is plenty of space for public and private recharging facilities, and a relative scarcity of forecourts selling fossil fuels, and where there is availability it comes at an inflated price.” ",environment
"The UK has been accused of failing to honour its promise to curb shipments of plastic waste to developing countries, after it emerged Britain’s new post-Brexit regulations are less stringent than those imposed by the EU. From 1 January, shipments of unsorted plastic waste from the EU to non-OECD countries were banned. But Britain will continue to allow plastic waste to be exported to developing countries, despite a Tory party manifesto commitment to banning the practice, and promises of no regression of environmental standards post-Brexit. UK exports will now be made under a new system of “prior informed consent”, under which the importer has to agree to accept the waste, and has the opportunity to refuse it. Britain is one of the biggest producers of plastic waste in the world, second only to the US. It exports about two-thirds of its plastic waste. The EU ban and the UK’s new regulations were prompted by international rules, under the Basel convention, to tackle the global trade in plastics, which has seen wealthy nations dump contaminated plastic waste on poorer ones. The regulations came into force this month. Jim Puckett, director of the Basel Action Network, said it was known as early as April 2019 that the EU planned to ban exports of dirty and unsorted plastic waste.  “We had assumed the UK would at least follow the EU, and so it is a shock to find out now that instead they choose to have a far weaker control procedure, which can still permit exports of contaminated and difficult-to-recycle plastics to developing countries,” said Puckett. “They are talking the talk, but they have failed to walk the walk.” Puckett said about 90% of plastic waste exports come under the category of dirty and unsorted plastic waste, subject to the Basel rules. “This is the guts of the amendment. This is the stuff we see being dumped and burned in south-east Asia.” The UK shipped 7,133 metric tonnes of waste to non-OECD countries, including Malaysia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Turkey in September 2020 alone, according to HMRC data analysed by the organisation the Last Beach Clean Up. Yuyun Ismawati, an activist with Indonesian environmental group Nexus3 Foundation, said: “It is disturbing to see that the UK wishes to continue its waste management malpractice using developing countries as dumping grounds. In Indonesia, we have documented large amounts of imported UK plastic waste dumped and burned in farming communities by substandard recyclers who can only actually recycle a small percentage of the waste.” Indonesia was one of seven countries to request containers of UK plastic waste be sent back last year. Luke Pollard, the shadow secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, said it was time the government delivered on its pledges. “The government has made big promises to match environmental standards from Europe and to ban plastic waste exports. There can be no dither or delay. “The British people expect to see these exports banned, more recycling of materials at home and faster action on the climate crisis. It is up to ministers to deliver on their promises and fast, but this does not look good.” Waste that cannot be recycled usually ends up being illegally burned or dumped in landfills or waterways, where it finds its way into the ocean. Last month, the UN transboundary waste chief told the Guardian he hoped to see a reduction in ocean plastic within five years after the introduction of the new international rules. Tim Grabiel, environmental lawyer at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: “We would have liked to see the UK show leadership and align with the EU in going the extra step and banning plastics to non-OECD countries. If 27 states of the EU can do it, then the UK certainly can. We hope in time the UK will reconsider its position.” While the UK’s introduction of prior informed consent for plastic waste exports will increase transparency in the notoriously lawless transboundary trade, the system is open to abuse, environmentalists say. Sam Chetan-Welsh, a Greenpeace political campaigner, said: “Our government promised to maintain or exceed EU environmental standards after Brexit, but creating a loophole to allow the dumping of our plastic trash on environments and communities bodes very badly. This is not leadership, it’s failing to do the bare minimum.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said the government had “pledged to ban the export of all plastic waste to non-OECD countries”, but did not give a timetable for action. The department said it had commissioned research to better understand existing UK plastic waste recycling capacity and would consult in due course on how to deliver its manifesto commitments.",environment
"The energy company Origin wants to search for fossil fuels across 225,000 hectares of the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin in Queensland’s channel country – part of one of the world’s biggest free-flowing river systems. The company is waiting to hear if the Queensland government will grant the applications for 10 petroleum leases, which were submitted in July last year but have not been previously reported. The 10 blocks – covering an area about the size of the ACT – are to the east and south-east of the tiny outback town of Windorah. Several blocks straddle Cooper Creek, with one block neighbouring Lake Yamma Yamma – a nationally important wetland. Campaigners are concerned Origin could be planning to target unconventional gas resources in the area, potentially using hydraulic fracturing and multiple drill sites. Asked what was planned for the leases, the company said only that it would target “any potential hydrocarbons” if its applications were successful. Last year it was revealed an independent report commissioned in 2019 by the Queensland government, but not made public, had called for a ban on unconventional gas exploration in the region. The government is now consulting stakeholders and traditional owners to develop a new set of regulations covering the basin area. Oil and gas production has taken place in the basin since the late 1960s. A 2020 federal government assessment of the Cooper basin shows existing gasfields to the south and east of Origin’s applications. Carmel Flint, national co-ordinator for the Lock the Gate Alliance campaign group, said the energy industry was focused on developing unconventional shale gas locked up in sedimentary rock in the area. She said the Queensland government had previously committed to protect the area, in particular from unconventional gas exploration, which required more gas wells than conventional gas production. “We want to see a moratorium on all unconventional gas drilling and activities on the floodplains of the basin while the government works out the long term process to look after these areas,” Flint said. “They should not be handing out petroleum leases whilst they are undertaking consultation to protect these areas.” Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, has been researching the floodplains of Cooper Creek for two decades. He said the Cooper Creek floodplain could bulge as wide as 80km during flood in the area of the leases. He said the basin was an “incredibly complex” system of ephemeral rivers and lakes that can go from isolated pools and dried-up channels during dry periods to rivers many kilometres wide during floods, unleashing an explosion of birds, plant and insect life. “That incredible complexity gives it incredible fragility. It’s recognised as one of the world’s last big free-flowing rivers,” he said. “The spectre of potential exploration and development on sensitive floodplain could have major environmental impacts in stopping water from going to where it’s used to going.” He said the floodplain downstream from Windorah, in the area covered by Origin’s applications, was particularly important. “It’s extraordinary by any scale,” he said. During floods the region becomes a magnet for wading birds, including migratory species from the northern hemisphere. Because the region was so flat, Kingsford said, the water moved slowly, “and any obstructions can change the course of the river”. In October the state’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, wrote to environmental campaigners at Lock the Gate Alliance promising protections for the Lake Eyre basin, which includes Cooper Creek. He said the Palaszczuk government had made a commitment in December 2019 “to ensure the protection of streams and floodplains in the Queensland section of the Lake Eyre basin by returning the protections that existed in the Wild Rivers framework”. The 2019 independent report, which was leaked and later tabled in parliament, recommended that gas wells and ponds be excluded from areas which frequently flood, and unconventional petroleum and gas production should be designated “unacceptable use” in an area that overlaps with some of the Origin lease applications. Origin is among a number of high-profile businesses to support independent MP Zali Steggal’s climate change legislation that includes a target for Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions to to reach net zero by 2050. A spokesman for Origin said in a statement the company was the majority holder of the petroleum lease applications, which he said had been made by a smaller company, Blue Energy. The spokesman said: “They are yet to be granted by the Queensland government, along with any regulatory conditions and work commitments. “Origin would adopt all regulations and put in place approved management plans, procedures and controls to protect the environment.” A statement from Queensland’s Department of Resources said the applications for the petroleum leases were “under consideration” but there was “no prescribed timeframe by which any decisions must be made”. The Department of Environment and Science said in a statement it “remains committed to working with First Nations peoples, industry, local councils, stakeholders and communities to ensure the sustainable management of the Lake Eyre basin”. Consultation to develop a new framework to cover the region was postponed in February 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the statement said, but this would “recommence soon”.",environment
"There are many ways to be a plant. Hawthorns take their time, laying down annual growth rings before they flower, producing berries year in, year out, and surviving to a grand old age. But weeds like the goosegrass (Galium aparine) are in a hurry. They complete their ephemeral cycle of life, seed to seed, in just a few months. It is January, and already I see their seedlings shouldering aside the decaying leaves along the bottom of a bare hawthorn hedge. They will have germinated only last autumn, but their vibrant green shoots are stealing a march on their competitors whose seeds are still lying dormant in the soil. And the smell … when I pick and crush a handful of its precocious, sappy shoots, buried last week under a layer of snow, it transports me to the first warm days of April. When spring finally arrives, this weak-stemmed, well-adapted social climber – which invests little in structural strength – will be threading itself through the hedge. It claws its way upwards with row upon row of tiny hooked hairs along the edges of its stems and whorled leaves, gripping anything they touch. Then in May, the minute white, four-petalled flowers will be quickly followed by paired, hooked seeds that are carried away on fur, feathers and clothing. Every generation of children on a country walk learns how tenaciously a well-aimed handful of goosegrass will stick to coats, hats and gloves. The goosegrass is ubiquitous, a ruderal that follows humanity around, thriving wherever we cultivate soil. Which is surely why it has acquired more than 70 local, colloquial names. The commonest is cleavers, but my favourites, bearing witness to its tendency to cling, are gentleman’s tormentors (Suffolk), lover’s kisses (Somerset) and devil’s garters (Northern Ireland). Some of last summer’s withered plants remain woven into this hedge. A few remaining seeds fulfil their destiny and stick to my gloves. That may be how I originally carried it home, where it has since become a persistent, but sometimes useful, garden weed. A handful of those hooked shoots, dragged across the pond surface, magically skims off the floating carpet of duckweed that threatens to smother it every summer without disturbing the aquatic life below.",environment
"Insect populations are suffering “death by a thousand cuts”, with many falling at “frightening” rates that are “tearing apart the tapestry of life”, according to scientists behind a new volume of studies. The insects face multiple, overlapping threats including the destruction of wild habitats for farming, urbanisation, pesticides and light pollution. Population collapses have been recorded in places where human activities dominate, such as in Germany, but there is little data from outside Europe and North America and in particular from wild, tropical regions where most insects live. The scientists are especially concerned that the climate crisis may be causing serious damage in the tropics. But even though much more data is needed, the researchers say enough is already known for urgent action to be taken. Insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals on Earth, with millions of species and outweighing humans by 17 times. They are essential to the ecosystems that humanity depends upon, pollinating plants, providing food for other creatures and recycling nature’s waste. The studies show the situation is complex, with some insect populations increasing, such as those whose range is expanding as global heating curbs cold winter temperatures and others recovering from a low level as pollution in water bodies is reduced. The good news is that the raised profile of insect declines in the past two years has prompted government action in some places, the scientists said, while a “phenomenal’’ number of citizen scientists are helping with the huge challenge of studying these tiny creatures. The 12 new studies are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Nature is under siege [and] most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event,” concludes the lead analysis in the package. “Insects are suffering from ‘death by a thousand cuts’ [and] severe insect declines can potentially have global ecological and economic consequences.” Prof David Wagner of the University of Connecticut in the US, the lead author of the analysis, said the abundance of many insect populations was falling by 1-2% a year, a rate that should not be seen as small: “You’re losing 10-20% of your animals over a single decade and that is just absolutely frightening. You’re tearing apart the tapestry of life.” Wagner said most of the causes of insect declines were well known. “But there’s one really big unknown and that’s climate change – that’s the one that really scares me the most.” He said increased climate variability could be “driving [insect] extinctions at a rate that we haven’t seen before”. “Insects are really susceptible to drought because they’re all surface area and no volume,” Wagner said. “Things like dragonflies and damselflies can desiccate to death in an hour with really low humidity.” One of the studies identifies an increasingly erratic climate as the overarching reason for region-wide losses of moths and other insects in the forests of north-western Costa Rica since 1978. This could be a “harbinger of the broader fate of Earth’s tropical forests”, said Wagner. However, another study contradicts a 2018 report of a 98% collapse in insects in a Puerto Rican forest. The new paper says “abundances are not generally declining” and that changes in populations are driven by the impacts of hurricanes and not climate change. Brad Lister, who led the 2018 study, said he was unconvinced by the work but would conduct his own analysis of the data used and submit the conclusion to the PNAS editors. Wagner said increased public attention had spurred some action, such as an EU initiative to protect pollinators, a pledge of €118m (£106m) for insect conservation in Germany and $25m in Sweden. Another of the papers sets out actions that can protect insects. Individuals can rewild their gardens, cut pesticide use and limit outdoor lighting, it said, while countries must reduce the impacts of farming. All groups can help change attitudes towards insects by conveying that they are crucial components of the living world. The biggest systematic assessment of global insect abundances to date, published in April 2020, showed a drop of almost 25% in the last 30 years, with accelerating declines in Europe. It indicated terrestrial insects were declining at close to 1% a year. The previous largest assessment, based on 73 studies, led the researchers to warn of “catastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind” if insect losses were not halted. It estimated the rate of decline at 2.5% a year. Other PNAS papers found both declines and rises. Butterfly numbers have fallen by 50% since 1976 in the UK and by 50% since 1990 in the Netherlands, according to one. It also showed the ranges of butterflies began shrinking long ago, dropping by 80% between 1890 and 1940. However, a study of moths showed zero or only modest long-term decreases over the past two decades in Ecuador and Arizona, US. “The most important thing we learn [from these new studies] is the complexity behind insect declines. No single quick fix is going to solve this problem,” said Roel van Klink of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research. “There are certainly places where insect abundances are dropping strongly, but not everywhere. This is a reason for hope, because it can help us understand what we can do to help them. They can bounce back really fast when the conditions improve.” Wagner said: “We know nature is under siege and we know we are responsible – we don’t really need to have a lot more data to start changing what we do. It’s unconscionable what could happen if we don’t start paying attention and change our way of consumption.”  Another paper in the series, co-authored by Wagner, concluded: “To mitigate the effects of the sixth mass extinction event that we have caused, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice, that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live.” ",environment
"The environmental activist Greta Thunberg has been featured on a new Swedish postage stamp, in recognition of her work to “preserve Sweden’s unique nature for future generations”. Thunberg, who turned 18 on 3 January, is pictured standing on a rocky cliff top wearing a yellow raincoat, with swifts flying around her, as part of a set by the artist and illustrator Henning Trollbäck titled Valuable Nature. The series, available from Thursday, features some of the 16 environmental quality goals recently drawn up by the Swedish government, including habitats designated as important to protect, said the national postal service, PostNord. Other stamps in the set, intended for domestic letters, feature high mountains and their flora, a forest, an agricultural landscape and a uniquely biodiverse bog. This year’s European stamps include a picture of the endangered green spotted toad. “We’re pleased that Greta, among several illustrations of important nature, will be symbolised on our stamps,” said PostNord’s Kristina Olofsdotter. “These natural places are very important and we all need to do our part to preserve them.” Previous stamp series in Sweden have portrayed Astrid Lindgren, the children’s author who created Pippi Longstocking, the footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović and the late DJ and producer Avicii. In a recent interview to mark her birthday, Thunberg, whose solo school strike in 2018 snowballed into a global youth movement, told the Sunday Times she had stopped flying and “consuming things” but did not judge people whose choices were less environmentally friendly than her own. “I’m not telling anyone else what to do,” she said. “There is a risk when you are vocal about these things and don’t practise as you preach, then you will be criticised and what you are saying won’t be taken seriously.”",environment
"The Arctic is “pervasively” polluted by microplastic fibres that most likely come from the washing of synthetic clothes by people in Europe and North America, research has found. The most comprehensive study to date found the microplastics in 96 of 97 sea water samples taken from across the polar region. More than 92% of the microplastics were fibres, and 73% of these were made of polyester and were the same width and colours as those used in clothes. Most of the samples were taken from 3-8 metres below the surface, where much marine life feeds. Other recent analysis estimated that 3,500tn plastic microfibres from clothes washing in the US and Canada ended up in the sea each year, while modelling suggested plastic dumped in the seas around the UK was carried to the Arctic within two years. The researchers found plastic fibres at the north pole. With plastic recently discovered at the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, and the peak of Mount Everest, it is clear humanity’s litter has polluted the entire planet. It is known to injure wildlife that mistake it for food. People also consume microplastics via food and water, and breathe them in, although the health impact is not yet known. Much more water flows into the Arctic from the Atlantic than the Pacific, and the new research found higher concentrations of the microplastic fibres nearer the Atlantic, as well as longer and less degraded fibres. “We’re looking at a dominance of Atlantic inputs, which means sources of textile fibres in the North Atlantic from Europe and North America are likely to be driving the contamination in the Arctic Ocean,” said Peter Ross, at Ocean Wise Conservation Association in Canada, who led the study. “With these polyester fibres, we’ve essentially created a cloud throughout the world’s oceans.” “The Arctic is, yet again, at the receiving end of pollutants from the south,” he said. Toxic chemical pollutants including mercury and PCBs are well known at the pole. “It’s certainly cause for concern, when we realise that the Inuit people rely very heavily on aquatic foods.” The 3-8m layer of sea water is “a biologically important area where we find phytoplankton, zooplankton, small fish, big fish, seabirds and marine mammals, foraging looking for food”, said Ross. Large animals such as turtles, albatross, seals and whales are known to be killed by plastic and he said there was no reason to think it was different for the smaller ones. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications, and took 71 near-surface samples stretching from Norway to the north pole and then into the Canadian High Arctic. Another 26 samples were taken at depths down to 1,000m in the Beaufort Sea, to the north of Alaska. “A dominance of polyester was evident throughout the water column, highlighting the pervasive spread of synthetic fibres throughout the waters of the Arctic Ocean,” the researchers concluded. They found an average of 40 microplastic particles per cubic metre of water. The researchers said the type of plastic found at different depths in the oceans would depend on the density of the plastic, with buoyant polystyrene likely to float and dense PVC more likely to sink to the ocean floor. Polyester is closer to neutral buoyancy. Only a small proportion of the fibres found are thought to be from fishing gear, which use different plastics. It is possible that some of the fibres were carried to the Arctic by winds. “It is impressive how many samples they were able to take from such inhospitable places,” said Erik van Sebille, at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “The results show again plastic is now omnipresent. The question should perhaps become ‘where don’t we find plastic yet?’” “Plastic anywhere in the environment is an atrocity, but in the Arctic it’s probably more harmful than in most other places,” he said. “That’s because it comes on top of the dramatic and dangerous climate change that the region and its ecosystems are experiencing. Pollution could be the proverbial drop that tips the bucket, as we say in Dutch.” Ross said individuals, clothes manufacturers, wastewater treatment companies and governments could all help stem the flow of microplastics into the Arctic: “We all have a role to play. It’s not about blaming textiles, or blaming the petrochemical complex. It’s about everybody acknowledging that this is not something that we want to see in the world’s oceans.” Van Sebille said: “We could hardly go out and about without clothes, could we? But we should think about better textiles.”",environment
"In the bleak midwinter, Orkney is surprisingly busy with wildlife. Starlings murmurate over the old Stromness pier every night before flying down to roost in its struts. Geese gather in their hundreds in the hollows between hills. And, down by the water’s edge, seals have been hauling out on to the rocky strands to give birth. A few weeks ago we visited Windwick, South Ronaldsay, to see this year’s crop of pups: the foreshore was crowded with cow seals feeding their fluffy, wet-eyed babies. One or two bulls waited in the shallows nearby, rising and falling with the waves, or seen in silhouette like submarines. One mother sat up to her belly in water, watching her pup yelp for her, seeming to will it forward into the surf. It cried and cried. She waited, eyes fixed on it, then gently rolled over in the foam, as if to demonstrate how fun it might be to swim. It was a charming afternoon. So I have returned to Windwick to check on their progress. At first the beach looked empty. Was I too late? But, craning over the cliff, I finally located a pocket of holdouts. At first I felt a flash of horror: there were bodies strewn over rocks and rotting heaps of kelp. Some sleek and grey marl, others stained a nicotine yellow. All was deathly still, like the aftermath of some terrible battle. But then one flipper paddled the air, another corpse twitched awake, and the whole scene came to life. These are the awkward teenagers of the seal world: in the absence of their mothers they now shed their baby clothes, scratch themselves on rocks, and live off their fat reserves until – eventually – they must leave the beach to begin their seagoing careers. Until then, they will lie around, filling the air with Wookie-like wails. They haul themselves up on to the land, are found on roads and in fields, and generally get under people’s feet. Fifteen per cent of the world’s grey seal population breeds here on Orkney in the winter months. It’s a privilege to see it. But I must admit that some life stages are cuter than others.",environment
"The hill has two names. Its Welsh one as given on the Ordnance Survey map is Allt Tair Ffynnon (high place of three fountains). The other – a local one bestowed since the tide of the old language ebbed from this valley – is both biblical and physically descriptive of rock strata thinly clad by hill vegetation: Jacob’s Ribs. Especially in years of drought, a striking geology is revealed beneath parched grass. You see it to best effect left of the road from Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant to Llanfyllin. There should be stories about it, and perhaps once were, but they’re lost. I’m reminded of Uvayok, a sleeping giant of a hill a quad bike ride out across the tundra from the settlement of Iqaluqtuutiaq in Nunavut – the Inuit High Arctic homeland in Canada. A wealth of tales from the oral tradition attaches to Uvayok. For Allt Tair Ffynnon, to my knowledge there are none. Yet it has such presence. It’s one of those hills that “give back / The sun’s glare with a fixed intensity”, as Hugh MacDiarmid wrote in Bracken Hills in Autumn. Allt Tair Ffynnon is the perfect autumnal bracken hill. It gathers the western light that floods along this valley. A brace of fine journalists for this newspaper group – Christopher Wordsworth and Geoff Nicholson – lie in the chapelyard at its foot. From my skylight, when I lived in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, it dominated the view. I was captivated by this hill, in the way that a rare and lucky man or woman might find in their domestic companion someone whom a world fixated on appearance and achievement might not celebrate, but whose imperturbable good humour is a quiet delight. On winter mornings, it rises above valley mist and frost as a shimmering presence, its bracken a sodden, heavy terracotta against the sky’s wan blue. You come at its dragon-crest summit by way of the hillside beyond Llannerch Aur (golden glade). Three springs – small, gravelly, quartz-pebbled pools among fallen bracken-litter, runnels seeping down from them, rowans overhanging gracefully, fieldfares feasting on frost-darkened berries – punctuate an ascent which few make other than the quiet sheep of the hills. I passed by recently, and stopped to contemplate its glow in the last sun, which stilled my heart.",environment
"A whale skeleton thought to be up to 5,000 years old has been discovered, almost perfectly preserved, by researchers in Thailand. The skeleton, believed to be a Bryde’s whale, was found in Samut Sakhon, west of Bangkok. Researchers have excavated 80% of the remains and have so far identified 19 complete vertebrae, five ribs, a shoulder blade and fins. The skeleton measures 12 metres (39ft), with a skull that is 3 metres long. The bones will be carbon dated to verify their age, but it is thought they are between 3,000 and 5,000 years old. Bryde’s whales are still found in Thailand’s waters, where they are considered a protected species. The whales – which prefer waters above 16C (61F), and feed on schooling fish such as anchovies – face threats from fishing equipment as well as tourism. The remains, which were found about 12km (7.5 miles) inland, will help scientists understand the evolution of the species, and track how sea levels have changed over thousands of years, said Varawut Silpa-archa, the natural resources and environment minister. Marcus Chua, of the National University of Singapore, said the discovery adds to evidence of “relatively large sea level changes around 6,000 years to 3,000 years ago in the Gulf of Thailand, where the shoreline was up to tens of kilometres inland of the present coast”. Previously, only marine deposits containing small fossilised marine shells or crabs had been found inland, and it was not clear if those fossils had been moved by humans, said Chua. “A large subfossil whale dated thousands of years ago near Bangkok would provide strong evidence of where the sea was during that time,” he said. Such evidence is highly relevant, given that the climate crisis is contributing to rising sea levels. “This could certainly bring attention to the issue, and show how and where low-lying areas could be inundated by the sea when that happens,” said Chua. The discovery will also help deepen researchers’ understanding of the Bryde’s whale, as well as other marine life. Alongside the skeleton, researchers found preserved items including shark teeth and shells. “Scientists could also study the deposits found at the same level as the whale to reconstruct the biological communities present during that time, and compare them to present day systems,” said Chua. The exact age of the skeleton is expected to be confirmed in December.",environment
"Scientists have discovered a climate crisis refuge for coral reefs off the coast of Kenya and Tanzania, where species are thriving despite warming events that have killed their neighbours. The coral sanctuary is a wildlife hotspot, teeming with spinner dolphins and boasting rare species, including prehistoric fish and dugongs. Researchers believe its location in a cool spot in the ocean is helping to protect it and the surrounding marine life from the harmful effects of the climate crisis. Tim McClanahan, the author of a study on the refuge published this month in Advances in Marine Biology, has been looking for coral sanctuaries in the west Indian Ocean for more than a decade. “I’m very excited about it,” McClanahan said. “It gives us something to hope for. Some good news in gloomy times.” Marine biologists are scouring the ocean to find and protect coral refuges – areas where reefs have the best chance to survive the climate crisis. McClanahan, the lead scientist for the Wildlife Conservation Society, who lives and works in Mombasa, Kenya, said he had an “epiphany” when he realised why the reef was so rich in wildlife. The coastline has the highest density of dolphins in east Africa, and coelacanths, fish once believed extinct, swim in its deep waters. “I thought ‘why are all the animals here?’ And I realised it was because of Kilimanjaro,” he said. The coral refuge, which stretches from Shimoni, 50 miles south of Mombasa, in Kenya to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, is fed by cool water from deep channels formed thousands of years ago by glacial runoff from Kilimanjaro and the Usambara mountains. The cool water appears to protect the corals from episodic warming events like El Niño.  McClanahan put temperature gauges along the coast and used satellite data to monitor them. Then, when there was a warming event, which occur only every few years, he got into the water to see its effects for himself. “It turns out there is a long stretch from Kenyan waters into Dar Es Salaam where these warm water events like El Niño don’t penetrate. So the stress killing corals does not penetrate. Outside that area, the corals are bleached and dying. But inside the area, of around 400 sq km [150 sq miles] they retain their colour and their health. They are reds and brown. My research partner likes to call them: ‘happy corals’.” McClanahan said he has found three potential coral sanctuaries in the western Indian Ocean, but only for this one is the available scientific evidence “pretty strong”. Part of his research was to examine whether – if fisheries are better managed – the effects of global heating could be mitigated in the ocean. “Our study shows that while warming waters may devastate surrounding reefs, this area could become an incredibly important sanctuary where marine species big and small will flock to find refuge from climate change,” he said. “If well protected, this key transboundary marine ecosystem will remain a jewel of biodiversity for the entire east African coast.” Unfortunately, however, the climate crisis is not the only threat to the area’s biodiversity and the newly discovered refuge. Unsustainable fishing continues, and there are future plans for coastal development, including a port in northern Tanzania.",environment
"An “ecological Swat team” has discovered 20 previously unknown species in the misty cloud forests and cascading waterfalls that flank Bolivia’s Zongo valley. Among the animals found were a minuscule 10mm-long frog, a pit viper, two metalmark butterflies and an adder’s-mouth orchid. The pristine forests are just 30 miles (48km) from the capital, La Paz, but the expedition also rediscovered the devil-eyed frog, seen just once before, and a satyr butterfly not seen for nearly a century. Alongside these were threatened species including the spectacled bear and the channel-billed toucan. The high, steep-sided peaks of the Andes harbour enormous biodiversity because movement between them is difficult for wildlife and results in isolated hotspots of evolution that are known as “sky islands”. The scientists spent two weeks hiking up and down the 2,000-metre slopes and, while expecting to find some new insects, were surprised by what they encountered. “We certainly did not expect to find new vertebrates, like the two snakes and the frog, so that was very exciting,” said Trond Larsen, of Conservation International, who co-led the expedition with Claudia Cortez, the head of conservation for the municipal government of La Paz. “What’s so amazing is that you could hear the distinctive call of the little frog throughout the forest, but you get close and they stop calling,” Trond said. “Trying to spot it when it’s not making a sound and is hidden in the moss was a tremendous task.” The team rediscovered the devil-eyed frog that had only been seen once, 20 years previously, by Steffen Reichle, a Bolivia-based scientist who was also on the new expedition. “That was really exciting – it was just assumed it must have gone extinct, but we actually found it to be relatively common,” Larsen said. The expedition was part of Conservation International’s Rapid Assessment Program, which Trond describes as an “ecological Swat team” that responds when information on a poorly known area is urgently needed. In the Zongo valley, the assessment is underpinning a new conservation area that will protect not only wildlife but also the clean water, construction materials and forest foods that local people rely on. The ecosystem also regulates the flow of water to the small dams in the valley that help power Bolivia’s capital. The protected mountain slopes will furthermore provide vital refuges for species moving uphill to escape the rising heat brought by the climate crisis. The 17-strong team of scientists hiked into their study area over a long, high suspension bridge that spans the Zongo River. As well as the highly venomous pit viper, they found another new snake which had the red, yellow and green colours of the Bolivian flag. The flowers of the new adder’s-mouth orchid appear to mimic an insect and may serve to fool unwitting pollinators, while a new cup orchid displayed striking purple and yellow flowers. A bamboo species found by the team was new to science but already well known by indigenous communities who use it to make musical instruments called sikus, or panpipes. Another plant, in the arrowroot family and which closes its leaves at night, similar to hands in prayer, was rediscovered after 125 years. “This truly beautiful and diverse landscape has become a safe haven for amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants that haven’t been found anywhere else on earth,” said Larsen.",environment
"The water shines blue and gold in the evening light. Across the fields, a herd of dark fallow deer runs out of the trees and across the brooks. One by one, they slow to a stop and queue, waiting as the animal in front of them disappears into a ditch, reappears as it climbs out, and then runs to catch up with the others. I count 79 deer, but see only one adult stag, its tall antlers glinting as it turns to watch the stragglers. A female marsh harrier, brown with a cream head, flaps over them, probably heading to roost. The sun will soon drop below the shadows of the South Downs, so I turn and head down the steep flood bank and back across the marsh. Noisy flocks of starlings descend on the tall trees by the river. They crowd on to the branches and chatter in a loud atonal chorus. More join them and the cacophony builds. Then they begin to soar into the air, 40 or more at a time, forming clouds of black dots – swerving in fluid, changing shapes, first one way, then back, moving across the brooks until they rise above a patch of reedbed and drop down into it. As the birds adjust their flickering wings to land, the sunlight leaks through their turning feathers, making the wings shimmer briefly, like flashing lights, before they disappear. I watch several small groups perform the same ritual as they settle down for the night. Only occasional bursts of chattering from deep within the vegetation – growing louder, then fading – give away their presence. A bird of prey spears low across the dark water and up over the reeds. The starlings react instantly, exploding in deafening alarm calls. Some fly up in defensive swarms, while the others scatter across the marsh or stay hidden. The sparrowhawk, a large female, chases across the reedbed, then turns and dives out of sight. It must be the same bird that hunts here most evenings, having learned to make the most of the wintering roosts. She emerges again, this time flapping slowly, purposefully, carrying a limp starling in one dangling foot. She glides into the blackness between the nearby trees.",environment
"Labor says revelations that the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg proposed amending the boundaries to an area of internationally significant wetlands after he was lobbied by a developer and major party donor demonstrate why Australia needs an independent environmental regulator. Federal Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, compared the now-treasurer’s past proposal in relation to Toondah Harbour to the Jam Land case, in which Frydenberg’s office sought advice about changing protections to grasslands at the centre of an investigation into illegal clearing on a property part-owned by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and his relatives. “Another day, another historic example of Josh Frydenberg trying to change the rules to help his mates,” Butler said. Guardian Australia revealed on Thursday that Frydenberg wrote to the Queensland government in early August 2017 concerning Walker Corporation’s proposed Toondah Harbour apartment and retail complex. He suggested the two governments jointly create a proposal to change the boundary of the Moreton Bay Ramsar wetland. Walker Corporation, which has been a major Liberal party donor, has applied to build up to 3,600 apartments, a marina, a hotel and shops inside Moreton Bay, south-east of Brisbane. The site is an important habitat for migratory birds and is listed under the Ramsar convention, an international treaty set up to protect the ecological character of listed wetlands. In the letter to Queensland’s then environment minister – now the deputy premier – Steven Miles, Frydenberg wrote that in order to meet Australia’s obligations under the Ramsar convention any proposal to change the boundary of the wetland “is required to demonstrate that the change is in the ‘urgent national interest’ and that additional areas of compensatory habitat be included in a revised boundary”. Lang Walker and executives from Walker Corporation had met with Frydenberg and senior environmental officials in 2016 and department records of that meeting show they raised the potential under the Ramsar convention for part of the wetland to be delisted in the “urgent national interest”. “The proponent had previously lobbied Mr Frydenberg about the project,” Butler said. “Mr Frydenberg’s 2017 letter indicated that amending the boundaries for the internationally protected wetlands would need to be done by demonstrating ‘urgent national interest’.” A spokeswoman for Frydenberg said: “No environmental approval was provided for the project while the former minister was in the portfolio.” Butler said: “Mr Frydenberg has history as environment minister. Today’s revelations reinforce the need for strong national environmental standards and a strong independent cop on the beat,” she said. Guardian Australia revealed in 2019 that Taylor met with Frydenberg’s office and senior environmental officials to discuss critically endangered and protected grasslands that were at the centre of an investigation into illegal clearing by Jam Land, a company in which he holds shares via his family company Gufee. The Guardian’s investigation found evidence to suggest that Frydenberg’s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands could be watered down and whether this could be done without making the decision public. Both Frydenberg and Taylor have repeatedly stated that their discussions at the time were focused only on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing, with Taylor saying he had raised the matter on behalf of constituents in his electorate of Hume and that he “has never asked Mr Frydenberg to change laws governing the clearing of native grasslands”. Frydenberg said at the time: “Following the briefing and since, no changes to the listing have been made.” But the Greens democracy spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said on Thursday: “We have never had a satisfactory answer about the role Frydenberg played in seeking to downgrade the listing of endangered vegetation on property owned by Angus Taylor’s family.” She added that Frydenberg’s letter about the Toondah Harbour development was “yet more proof” of the need for “strong protections for nature that are independently enforced”. “These FOI documents raise serious questions about the extent to which this government will consider relaxing environmental protections to push through developments proposed by their donor mates,” Waters said.",environment
"An empty 1970s shopping centre in Nottingham could be transformed into wetlands, pocket woodlands and a wildflower meadow as part of a post-pandemic urban rewilding project. The debate about Broadmarsh shopping centre, considered an eyesore by many, has rumbled on for years. This year it was undergoing a £86m revamp by real estate investment trust Intu when the firm went into administration. The number of empty shops on UK high streets has risen to its highest level in six years, and as retail giants such as Debenhams and Arcadia Group falter, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust has come up with a new model of inner city regeneration: urban rewilding. The trust wants to bulldoze the already half-demolished Broadmarsh building and turn it into 2.5 hectares (6 acres) of scruffy green space at an estimated cost of £3-4m. The designs were created with Influence Landscape Architects and could set a precedent for what to do with the growing amount of vacant retail space in other cities. “It’s unbelievable to hear that stores like Debenhams are in the position they are in – they’re stalwarts of the city, but it does put out an opportunity,” said Sara Boland, managing director of Influence. Ponds surrounded by reeds, crocus meadows and wet grasslands would attract butterflies, dragonflies and a range of birds including reed warblers and black redstarts, according to the Wildlife Trust, which is calling on people to back its green vision. It will put its plans to Nottingham city council in the coming weeks as the authority canvasses views on what Broadmarsh could become as part of a 10-week consultation process. The proposed scheme would run counter to the conventional idea of urban parks and instead hark back to what Broadmarsh would have looked like in centuries gone by. “Often open spaces in cities can be manicured and a bit formal,” said Boland. “The idea of this was to have more rewilding, restoring, protecting – this kind of connectivity, so the zones we then developed were about foraging, pond dipping and protecting species.” Nineteenth-century maps helped architects get a clear picture of what this part of Nottinghamshire once looked like – a fertile garden area covered in fruit trees. Old street names include Pear Street and Peach Street; those fruits would be grown in the park to reflect its heritage. Crisscrossing the park would be walkways based on centuries-old street layouts. Nottingham Wildlife Trust has long wanted to create green corridors in this area of the city to connect it to Sherwood Forest to the north. It has put up nest boxes on many buildings close to Broadmarsh to encourage black redstarts, which used to live in the city but are now rarely seen. “We’ve actually spent quite a bit of time over the past 20 or 30 years looking at various redevelopment proposals for this part of the city and for the Broadmarsh centre. We’ve submitted ideas for roof gardens and new avenues, all sorts of greener features,” said Erin McDaid, head of communications and marketing at Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. “We feel this could be a real opportunity for the city to stand out from the crowd as cities across the UK look to recover their economies and find a new direction for urban centres.”  The Broadmarsh centre was opened in 1975, in an area of the city designed with drivers in mind. Now times are changing, said Nottingham resident Ewan Cameron. “I don’t think people really want [a shopping centre]. It’s kind of a 90s style of thinking … Broadmarsh felt like a place that people used to walk through, but there was no sense of community, no sense of life. “Anyone coming into Nottingham on the train would have to pass by it before they reached the city centre, and it was just this horrible, ugly building with no windows. It was very unwelcoming,” he said. When Intu went into administration five months ago, Cameron started a petition to turn the unloved shopping centre into green space. It struck a chord with many people, and already has 10,000 signatures. Last year Nottingham city council won the Guardian’s public service award for its ambitious policies to become the UK’s first carbon-neutral city. The city met its 2020 target to reduce carbon emissions by 26% four years early and the energy consumption of council buildings has fallen by 39%. A green development would show the city’s commitment to securing 30% of land for nature by 2030, the Wildlife Trust says. David Mellen, Nottingham city council leader, said the conversation about the Broadmarsh site had captured people’s imagination. He said: “It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine a significant space right in the heart of one of the country’s core cities and build a new vision for urban areas following the coronavirus pandemic that is people centred and green but also leads to jobs and housing, improving quality of life.” Cameron said he was “blown away” by the new designs. “It’s a chance for people to rethink how cities work and how we can design cities to make people’s lives better, rather than a place to shop,” he said. “I hope the council will genuinely listen to people and I hope they haven’t made their mind up already and this isn’t a box-ticking exercise.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",environment
"Walls, windows and a mid-morning cuppa break were no defence against a rising rush of sound that demanded investigation. The hiss and swish, like a battering hailstorm but on a blue-sky day, arose from somewhere out of doors. It flushed us out into the back garden – a mistake. A dozen or so jackdaws zipped over, and they were heading for the main action, towards a swell that came from over the other side of the rooftop. We raced back through the house and opened the front door to a sky darkened with crows. I hazarded a hundred, but it could have been twice that number. The jackdaws flocked by disciplined instinct and swilled around half a dozen lime trees, quilting the air with vapourless trails. A few carrion crows mingled among them, but they abided by no rules, often beating across the jackdaw traffic. I saw one lumpen hulk of a crow collide with its smaller cousin, sending it into an open-winged cartwheel. The magpies stayed true to their ancestry as forest birds and jumped, as if nervously, from branch to branch. The sight was as nothing compared with the mob music that brayed out of this soup of corvids. The daws lengthened their “jack” calls, lacing them with excitement or anxiety; some even gave orgiastic yelps. One of the magpies sank its familiar high ack-ack rattle into a low slow drill, a purr with menace. The crows – well, I couldn’t hear them above the din. What was all this commotion about? Round and round the limes circled the crows, an audience looking for an event. A man passing with two perplexed-looking sons in tow offered a witness statement: “The magpies have got something dead on the roof.” But we could see nothing at all on any roof. The accused in black and white had ganged up by now, seven for a secret never to be told perching on the rungs of one lime, while two for joy occupied its neighbour. They fell silent, and waited. Nothing to see, move on. The clamour overhead had dropped to a hush, the birds melted away. The tension had gone out of the scene, the heat had gone out of my teacup.",environment
"Communities in the UK are being asked to bid to host a prototype nuclear fusion power plant, which a government-backed programme plans to build by 2040. The site does not need to be near existing nuclear power stations but will need 100 hectares of land and a plentiful water supply. Ministers say the project would bring thousands of skilled jobs and be part of its planned “green industrial revolution” to tackle the climate crisis. Nuclear fusion replicates the intense atomic reactions that power the sun and uses a hydrogen isotope found in seawater as fuel. It cannot produce a runaway chain reaction like conventional nuclear fission, which involves splitting atoms rather than fusing them together. The level of radioactive waste is also far lower. No exclusion zone will be needed around the site, officials said. However, the technical challenges are enormous and the programme’s leaders acknowledge it is “hugely ambitious”. This is because fuel heated to 10 times the temperature of the sun has to be magnetically levitated to stop it melting the reactor vessel. Scientists and engineers have pursued the dream of limitless and clean fusion energy for more than half a century, but the first power stations remain decades away. The UK programme is called Step – the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production – and has been granted £222m to date by the government. Communities have until March 2021 to submit their nominations, with the successful site chosen by the end of 2022. “We want the UK to be a trailblazer in developing fusion energy,” said Alok Sharma, the business and energy secretary. He said communities had an “incredible opportunity to secure their place in the history books” by potentially helping the UK to be the first country in the world to commercialise fusion power. The UK has the largest working fusion reactor in the world – called Jet – at the Culham Science Centre near Oxford. However, a far larger €20bn (£18bn) fusion reactor called Iter is being assembled in France, backed by the world’s biggest countries. It expects to create its first super-heated plasma by 2025 and reach full power by 2035, with the aim of demonstrating that more energy can be taken out than is put in. The goal of Step is to show that a smaller and less expensive plant can create fusion power. Key to this is the spherical shape of the chamber that contains the plasma, which is more compact than the doughnut-shaped chamber being used at Iter. However, this compactness means the Step system must have a much more efficient cooling system. Technology to achieve this is being tested in the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (Mast) experiment, also at Culham. But the Culham site is too small to host the Step project. Prof Ian Chapman, the chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, which is leading Step, said: “Step is about moving from research and development to delivery. It will prove that fusion is not a far-off dream, but a dawning reality.” Tim Luce, the chief scientist at Iter, said: “It is gratifying to see the UK make a firm commitment to continuing its historic leadership in magnetic fusion development. Step promises lower costs but faces various engineering and physics challenges, such as large stresses in the magnet structure and high heat fluxes to the wall. [But] first plasma in 2040 appears to be a realistic goal, assuming favourable and timely results in the present generation of spherical tokamaks.” The UK is a participant in Iter due to its membership of Euratom, but it will leave the group after Brexit. However, officials say they are hopeful that the UK can rejoin Iter as an associate country. The timetable for Step is to have a concept design by 2024, then a detailed engineering design allowing the start of construction in 2032 and operations to begin in 2040.",environment
"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains. Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano’s 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier’s pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets. “They’d put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,” Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.  At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed. Colorado’s Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier. Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US. More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.  By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down. “This is some of the worst work in the world,” said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park’s rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste. Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock. Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff. Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech. The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement – and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste. The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers’ lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area. Land managers have installed Hill’s toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel’s Landing in Utah’s Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier. “If I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out … and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,” Lechleitner said of the new design. But even Hill’s toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren’t cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged. Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they’re not near bathrooms. Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag – often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell – or ask that they bring their own. Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah’s Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won’t degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry. “People are really opening up to the idea,” Henry said. Plastic bags aren’t a perfect fix – they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don’t want to carry their own feces for days on end. If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don’t have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.  “Once you get eight miles into the backcountry, it’s up to you to dig a hole,” Lawhorn said.",environment
"Cultured meat, produced in bioreactors without the slaughter of an animal, has been approved for sale by a regulatory authority for the first time. The development has been hailed as a landmark moment across the meat industry. The “chicken bites”, produced by the US company Eat Just, have passed a safety review by the Singapore Food Agency and the approval could open the door to a future when all meat is produced without the killing of livestock, the company said. Dozens of firms are developing cultivated chicken, beef and pork, with a view to slashing the impact of industrial livestock production on the climate and nature crises, as well as providing cleaner, drug-free and cruelty-free meat. Currently, about 130 million chickens are slaughtered every day for meat, and 4 million pigs. By weight, 60% of the mammals on earth are livestock, 36% are humans and only 4% are wild. The cells for Eat Just’s product are grown in a 1,200-litre bioreactor and then combined with plant-based ingredients. Initial availability would be limited, the company said, and the bites would be sold in a restaurant in Singapore. The product would be significantly more expensive than conventional chicken until production was scaled up, but Eat Just said it would ultimately be cheaper. The cells used to start the process came from a cell bank and did not require the slaughter of a chicken because cells can be taken from biopsies of live animals. The nutrients supplied to the growing cells were all from plants. The growth medium for the Singapore production line includes foetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood, but this is largely removed before consumption. A plant-based serum would be used in the next production line, the company said, but was not available when the Singapore approval process began two years ago. A series of scientific studies have shown that people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy for them or the planet. Research shows cutting meat consumption is vital in tackling the climate crisis and some scientists say this is the best single environmental action a person can take. The companies developing lab-grown meat believe this is the product most likely to wean committed meat-eaters off traditional sources. Vegan diets are viewed as unappealing by some, and plant-based meat replacements are not always regarded as replicating the texture and flavour of conventional meat. Meat cultivated in bioreactors also avoids the issues of bacterial contamination from animal waste and the overuse of antibiotics and hormones in animals. The small scale of current cultured meat production requires a relatively high use of energy and therefore carbon emissions. But once scaled up its manufacturers say it will produce much lower emissions and use far less water and land than conventional meat. Josh Tetrick, of Eat Just, said: “I think the approval is one of the most significant milestones in the food industry in the last handful of decades. It’s an open door and it’s up to us and other companies to take that opportunity. My hope is this leads to a world in the next handful of years where the majority of meat doesn’t require killing a single animal or tearing down a single tree.” But he said major challenges remained, with the reaction of consumers to cultured meat perhaps being the most significant: “Is it different? For sure. Our hope is through transparent communication with consumers, what this is and how it compares to conventional meat, we’re able to win. But it’s not a guarantee.” He said the cultured chicken was nutritionally the same as conventional meat. Other challenges included getting regulatory approval in other nations and increasing production. “If we want to serve the entire country of Singapore, and eventually bring it to elsewhere in the world, we need to move to 10,000-litre or 50,000-litre-plus bioreactors,” Tetrick said. Eat Just already has experience in selling non-animal products, such as its plant-based egg and vegan mayonnaise, to consumers. Another company, Supermeat.com in Israel, has just begun free public tastings involving a “crispy cultured chicken”. Industry experts said other companies, including Memphis Meats, Mosa Meat and Aleph Farms, might do well in future as they were working on textured products such as steaks and were able to produce significant amounts of lab-grown meat from the start. Tyson and Cargill, two of the world’s biggest conventional meat companies, now have a stake in Memphis Meats. A recent report form the global consultancy AT Kearney predicted that most meat in 2040 would not come from dead animals. The firm’s Carsten Gerhardt said: “Approval in an innovation hotspot like Singapore already in 2020 could fast-forward market entry in other developed nations. In the long run we are convinced that cultured meat will address the health and environmental impact issues that traditional meat has when produced in a highly industrialised way.” Gerhardt said he expected cultured meat would replace cuts of traditional meat, but that plant-based products, which were less expensive, were more likely to replace burgers and sausages. “The [Eat Just approval] is a very big deal for the future of meat production globally,” said Bruce Friedrich, at the non-profit Good Food Institute in the US. “A new space race for the future of food is under way.” He said cultivated meat was unlikely to become mainstream for some years, until it matched the cost of conventional meat. Hsin Huang, the secretary general of the International Meat Secretariat, which represents the global meat and livestock industry, agreed the cultured meat approval was a significant moment. “It seems certain that similar products from other companies will follow,” he said. “There has been so much hype on cell-cultured meat that the anticipated first steps to mass sales is a significant moment.” “We believe the market potential for cultured meat is vast, as consumers in general continue to show great enthusiasm for the taste and nutritional benefits of animal products. Of course, our view is that real animal products will better meet these needs, but healthy competition is welcome.” He added that livestock are currently essential to the livelihoods of an estimated one billion poor people globally. He said the IMS believed strongly in consumer choice, with appropriate labelling and regulation.",environment
"Brazilian activists have voiced alarm over their government’s plans to bulldoze a 94-mile highway through a biodiverse corner of the Amazon along the border with Peru that is home to at least three indigenous communities. The planned road is an extension of the BR-364, a 2,700-mile highway that links São Paulo with the Amazon state of Acre, and would connect the town of Cruzeiro do Sul with the Peruvian border town of Pucallpa. Backers of the “transoceanic” project, who include Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, argue it will boost the economy of this remote region by creating a transport hub through which agricultural products can be shipped to Pacific ports in Peru and on to China. “This project won’t destroy the forest, it will bring sustainable development to the region by heating up commercial and cultural relations [with Peru],” said Mara Rocha, a centre-right congresswoman from Acre who supports the idea. Rocha said the project was critical to a region that felt “forgotten and invisible to the rest of the country”. Opponents, however, fear it could have catastrophic consequences for Brazil’s environment, which is already reeling under Bolsonaro as the rate of Amazon deforestation soars to its highest level in more than a decade. A report in the Estado de São Paulo newspaper said an 80-mile (130km) stretch of pristine forest would need to be felled to build the road, which would cut through the centre of the protected Serra do Divisor national park. Experts call the park one of the Amazon’s most biodiverse regions, hosting at least 130 species of mammal and more than 400 species of bird. Brazilian lawmakers are considering plans to water down its protections in an apparent attempt to accelerate the road’s construction. Luís Puwe Puyanawa, a local indigenous leader who opposes the project, said: “The truth is that nobody in Acre needs this transoceanic route – there’s already a road linking us to Peru. What we need is to leave the forest standing.” Miguel Scarcello, the head of SOS Amazônia, an environmental group based in the state capital, Rio Branco, described the project as “irresponsible” and a throwback to Brazil’s military dictatorship when roads where bulldozed through the Amazon in an attempt to populate and develop the region. “It’s such an old-fashioned, backwards vision … that pays absolutely no attention to conservation. It will cut through an untouched area of forest and affect the headwaters of really important tributaries of the Juruá River,” Scarcello said. He described how during the 1964-85 dictatorship such roads “decimated” indigenous communities and inflicted “immense destruction” on the rainforest, as loggers used them to access previously inaccessible areas. “We’re not in the 1960s any more,” Scarcello said. “It’s as if we’ve learned nothing from the effects that this could cause and how much destruction could be caused.” He added: “They say it will bring development but, as always, it will be development for half a dozen people,” and he warned of a “carnival of land grabbing” that would accompany the planned road. If the project is approved, three indigenous communities near the road will reportedly be affected: Nukini, Jaminawa and Poyanawa. Scarcello said it was possible the national park was also home to isolated tribes with whom contact had not been made. Puyanawa, 41, said he feared his community would be worst hit. “The road is expected to pass within about a kilometre of our lands. One of my biggest concerns is that this stretch is home to some of the most important water sources of the Amazon basin. The Alto Juruá provides all the waters that flow into the Rio Solimões and then Rio Negro, until they reach the sea,” he said. “All of these rivers could be really affected and this could cause the disappearance of important headwaters in the Amazon. With that, many species could disappear.” Puyanawa said plans for such a route had been touted by politicians for decades but appeared to have accelerated since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. “Nobody has wanted it as much as Bolsonaro,” he said. Bolsonaro has overseen a highly controversial dismantling of Brazil’s environmental protection system, causing Amazon deforestation to skyrocket, critics say. Last month government figures showed Amazon destruction had surged to a 12-year high, with an area seven times larger than Greater London lost between August 2019 and July 2020. That increase has been blamed on the feeling of impunity that Bolsonaro’s presidency has brought illegal loggers, cattle ranchers and miners seeking to cash in. “They feel completely at ease,” said Carlos Rittl, a Brazilian environmentalist who works at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany. “We are being governed by people whose motto for the environment is: destruction.” The BR-364 extension, which Bolsonaro has publicly backed as a means to give Brazil “a passage to the Pacific”, is not the only Amazon road project worrying environmentalists and climate campaigners. Last week his administration said it would begin repaving the BR-319, a decaying dictatorship-era highway that cuts north to south through the Amazon from Manaus to Porto Velho. “A historic day for the north!” Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook, announcing the news. But in a recent essay, Prof Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research, said reviving the BR-319, which has been abandoned since late 1980s, “would give deforesters access to about half of what remains of the country’s Amazon forest” and was “certainly among the most consequential decisions facing Brazil today”.",environment
"When it was born, the second world war was several years away, none of the Beatles were alive and there were about five billion fewer people above the waves than today. An unnamed 81-year-old midnight snapper, caught by the Australian Institute of Marine Science in 2016, has been revealed as the oldest tropical reef fish known to science. The discovery was made as part of a new study to find out how changing ocean temperatures might affect the biology of these fish, and others like them. Not far behind the octogenarian snapper among the new discoveries was a 79-year-old red bass caught during a fisheries survey in 1997. Both were caught at Rowley Shoals off north-west Australia. Dr Brett Taylor, a fish biologist at the institute who led the study, said he “may have used some colourful language” when he realised the snapper specimen was 20 years older than the previous record for a tropical reef fish – a rockfish from the Caribbean. “The first thing I did was email my co-authors from Western Australia fisheries ... ‘am I seeing this right?” Taylor and colleagues aged the fish by examining “one of nature’s gifts to scientists” – small ear bones called otoliths that never stop growing and have visible bands like the rings of a tree. The study examined the ages of three species – red bass (Lutjanus bohar), midnight snapper (Macolor macularis) and black and white snapper (Macolor niger) – none of which are widely caught commercially. But their close relatives are. “Snappers make up a large component of commercial fisheries in tropical Australia and they’re also a key target for recreational fishers,” said Dr Stephen Newman, from the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development. He said long-lived fish were considered more vulnerable to fishing pressure. As well as the two oldest fish, the research found nine other specimens that were more than 60 years old. Taylor told the Guardian: “A lot of these snapper species that are commercially harvested are 40, 50 and 60 years old that people are buying. There’s a serious history to some of these.” He said he had separately analysed the ocean temperatures in the tropical Indian Ocean where the oldest snapper and red bass were caught. “We talk about climate change being something in the future, but these 80-year-old fish saw a tremendous uptake of temperature [in the ocean] in their life spans.” Taylor said the research underscored that as oceans warm, the lifespan and growth rate of fish would change – important information for economies and communities that rely on fishing. He said: “The main point is to understand how temperature affects growth and the lifespans of these species. By 2100, I don’t think we will have any more 80-year-old midnight snappers. “These locations will warm to a point that based on current models it will have an impact on their biology.” The long-lived tropical fish analysed by Taylor and colleagues are a long way from being the oldest fish in the ocean. That record belongs to the Greenland shark. Analysis of the eyes of these Arctic dwellers has revealed a lifespan as great as 400 years.",environment
"This is a disappearing watery world – always on the verge of surrender to the churning belt of brine beyond the shingle bank. The path in midwinter is flooded and, standing with my sketchbook, feet like the reeds’ in the clear dark water, I think of Elizabeth Bishop’s poem Sandpiper: “… that every so often the world is bound to shake”. This fragile place shakes and shimmers continuously. Nothing is still. France Woods, to my west, is opalescent in the late afternoon, its many oaks a flat plane of optical greys as the weak sun sinks behind the hill. The water between us dances with tiny halations – lead-white and gold. Ash, sycamore and alder branches sweep and tangle in the foreground, bone-black and intricate against the light. Goat willows, toughly delicate, dark green and grey, fan into the listening heavens, offering up just a few slim ovals of bronze – tiny brushstrokes of colour in the December sky. From the top of a young sycamore (her smooth bark a pale, raw umber, buds perfect in their as yet unwrecked opposing symmetry), a robin effortlessly sings the spaces between things. What am I doing? My left boot has started to let in the icy water and my hands, even gloved, are numb. I’ve been drawing for an hour and have only a page of scribbles to show for it – pathetic grasping attempts to describe and outline. Tethered to form in a formless world. From somewhere in the reeds there is the muffled trumpet of a coot, and a cormorant slides rapidly out of his reflection to swallow a struggling eel in the open water. Mesmerised, I can clearly see the writhing lump fight and bulge in the bird’s long throat. Low in the water, he raises his hooked bill, repeatedly stretches, and dips. Sipping water, easing the meal down. Later, from his oak perch, he preens and ignores me (he has seen me before), a strange and wingless biped who understands nothing. The evening lays out her dark pieces, and I abandon my drawing to watch him: Miltonian creature, wingèd eel, part of this place, part of this paradise, this world of loss; alive until he isn’t.",environment
"People are being invited to help track the spread of a moth that often hides its hindwings of dazzling fuchsia beneath a dowdy brown “overcoat”. The dark crimson underwing has enjoyed an “amazing” August, according to experts, appearing in many new locations, including the first ever recorded sighting in Wales. Its spread, along with that of other large “underwing” moths boasting bright colours beneath grey-brown forewings, will be recorded by thousands of enthusiasts during Moth Night, an annual three-night event on 27-29 August during which people are urged to go moth-spotting. While many moth populations are in decline, climate change is dramatically boosting the abundance and distribution of several species of underwing. The red underwing is one of Britain’s largest moths, with a wingspan of up to 9cm (3.5in). Until recent decades it was restricted to southern and central England, but is now spreading northwards and westwards and has been recorded in Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. The rarer dark crimson and light crimson underwings were once confined to the New Forest but are now flying over new sites in southern England. Rarer still is the rosy underwing, a recent colonist of the Channel Islands. Mark Tunmore, the founder of Moth Night and editor of the journal Atropos, said: “Already we have been receiving widespread reports of dark and light crimson underwing moths in southern England, indicating that the range expansion of these species is continuing, induced by climate change. “Particularly exciting has been a recent sighting of dark crimson underwing in Gwent, and just a few days ago we received a report of a rosy underwing in Dorset. So we can’t wait to see what happens with so much interest focused on these stunning species over the Moth Night event.” Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, which organises Moth Night with Atropos, Butterfly Conservation and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said: “Moths are on the move in the UK, with many species in decline, but others, such as the red underwing, are increasing and spreading to new areas. “We need people’s help to find out how far the red underwing has got: has it now colonised Scotland, for example? By taking part in Moth Night, everyone can help.” People can buy humane moth traps, which use special lights to lure moths so they can be identified before they are released the next morning. A simple sheet and a torch, or painting a tree trunk with a “sugar” mix of treacle, brown sugar and brown ale, can also lure in moths. Moth records can be shared and submitted at the mothnight.info website or the event’s Facebook page.",environment
"If you’ve managed to beat the hordes and snag a new bike amid the increase in demand during the coronavirus pandemic, the challenge now is ensuring it survives the growing bicycle thievery problem. There’s no guarantee that any of the measures here will stop your bike from being stolen, but they’ll definitely help. If you’ve just bought a new bike, here’s how to lock it up properly. Don’t buy an amazing bicycle Arguably the strongest anti-theft measure going. A carbon frame and wheelset might make for a quick commute, but your bike will be target number one if it’s seen in the same location day after day. Even if it’s locked up like Fort Knox, a thief only has to be handy with an allen key and cable cutter in order to make off with potentially hundreds of pounds worth of components. The crappier your bike appears, the more likely you are to find it where you left it. If there was ever a better excuse for skipping washing your bike at the weekend, this is it. Use two locks Never lock your bike up with just a cable lock; you’re better off using dental floss. A gold standard D-lock is essential. Stick to brands such as Kryptonite, Oxford, OnGuard or Abus. The Kryptonite Evolution Mini-5 is small enough to be portable but strong enough for quick trips to the shop, park or pub. If you’re leaving a bicycle outside, out of view for longer than an hour, try the Kryptonite Fahgettaboudit or New York Standard. Decent locks are expensive and heavy but thieves would rather go for cheaper, weaker locks. Two D-locks is ideal, but a D-lock with a cable lock for the front wheel should be enough to ensure you return to a bike that’s in one piece. A set of locking security skewers are a good option if you don’t fancy lugging a second lock around with you, and can also be used to secure saddles too. Learn how and where to secure your bike Lock your bike tightly, keeping everything off the ground and leaving no space for power tools, bolt cutters, pry bars or lock pickers. Use your second lock to secure the front wheel to the frame. Leave your bike within eyeshot, among other bikes, somewhere bright and busy where there’s CCTV. Quiet, leafy, posh side streets are never good. Look for dedicated Sheffield stands or cycle hoops. Avoid flimsy racks which only lock the front or rear wheel, wooden posts or trees, and anything your bike can be lifted over. Check whatever you’re locking to hasn’t been cut and covered. (It happens.) Bring your bike inside Going to a friend’s house? Bring your bike in. Going to the pub? Ask if you can leave your bike out of the way in the beer garden. Your work might have a bike/storage room you can use; if they don’t, petition for one. If you live in a tiny flat, congrats on your new piece of bicycle furniture. Alternatively, ask your council to install secure hangers. This might involve befriending your cycling neighbours and getting them behind your cause. Prepare for the worst Make a note of your bicycle’s serial number (it’s on the bottom bracket, underneath the bike), take a few pictures and register it on Bike Register and Immobilise. If it’s lost and found you’ll need to prove it’s yours. If it’s stolen, keep an eye on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace. Avoid setting up a sting if it does appear – there’s a chance you’ll be going up against professional bad people and they’ll be far more experienced at this kind of thing than you are.

"A growing number of “cryptic species” hiding in plain sight have been unmasked in the past year, driven in part by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between animal and plant species using their genetic divergence. The discovery of new species of aloe, African leaf-nosed bats and chameleons that appear similar to the human eye but are in fact many and separate have thrilled and worried conservationists. Scientists say our planet might be more biologically diverse than previously thought, and estimates for the total number of species could be far higher than the current best guess of 8.7 million. But cryptic discoveries often mean that species once considered common and widespread are actually several, some of which may be endangered and require immediate protection. The Jonah’s mouse lemur was only unveiled to the world this summer but is already on the verge of extinction. The newly described Popa langur in Myanmar, previously confused with another species, numbers around 200 and is likely to be classified as critically endangered, threatened by habitat loss and deforestation. The discovery of these cryptic species has been driven in part by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between animal and plant species using their genetic divergence. African elephants, Indian vine snakes and South American neotropical birds are among the growing number of unmaskings. Thousands more are expected in the coming years, from living creatures and museum samples. “DNA barcoding is a tool that allows us to detect differences among species at a finer scale than before, like a microscope allows us to see fine details of surface structure that are invisible to the naked eye,” says Brian Brown, entomology curator at the LA Natural History Museum, who is using the technique for research on flies. “It gives us a way to delimit some of the previously suspected, but unexplored, diversity within what we call species. It is showing that the world is even more wonderfully biodiverse than we suspected.” The first cryptic species discoveries made using DNA barcoding were in Guanacaste conservation area (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica, now the most DNA barcoded place on Earth. In a paper entitled Ten Species in One, Canadian professor Paul Hebert, known as the “father of DNA barcoding”, revealed the true identities of the two-barred flasher butterfly in 2004, along with University of Pennsylvania professors Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs, who have dedicated their lives to the ACG. It was an insect that had bothered Janzen for decades. Taxonomic consensus told the 81-year-old evolutionary ecologist that the caterpillar samples he collected in the ACG were those of a common, unremarkable tropical butterfly found from Texas to northern Argentina. But he did not believe it. Janzen had always been puzzled by the diversity of two-barred flasher caterpillars – Astraptes fulgerator – and the variety of plants on which they feasted. So when in 2004 he had the opportunity to test a controversial new technique called DNA barcoding put forward by Hebert (then primarily known for his expertise on water fleas), he knew which insect samples he would send. The results were thrilling. In his study area alone, the barcoding analysis indicated the two-barred flasher butterfly was, in fact, at least 10 genetically distinct species. The revelation of the butterfly as a cryptic species could mean across the rest of Latin America there are thousands of unidentified insect species waiting to be described – along with many that have never been collected and examined. The findings were highly controversial and provoked a backlash from taxonomists and biologists who questioned whether genetic information should be included in identifying a species. Others did not agree that a binary, genetic threshold should be imposed on the continual process of evolution. For centuries, humanity’s understanding of life on Earth was based on the physical form. Every organism in the library of life fits within a hierarchy of classifications based on appearance, according to the modern taxonomic system first developed by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. “God created, Linnaeus organised,” he immodestly told people. Today, the technique is commonly used alongside traditional Linnaean-based methods, quickly separating samples before further genetic and morphological analysis. Among the sceptics nearly 20 years ago was Brown, who is now responsible for a large unmasking: species once lumped together as Megaselia sulphurizona, a type of humpback fly, also collected in the ACG. DNA barcoding analysis of samples across Latin America revealed 16 separate species, according to his unpublished research with co-authors.  “I thought I could tell my species perfectly well by looking at genitalia,” says Brown, referring to the common practice of identifying insects by studying their reproductive organs. “I didn’t really care if I was going as quickly as possible. But when I started working on this group of small flies, I realised what I was calling one species was actually 16 and that I wasn’t able to identify them morphologically like I thought.” Another convert, Michael Sharkey, an entomologist and emeritus professor at the University of Kentucky, DNA barcoded the insects he had classified for his PhD, only to realise that most of the species concepts he had proposed after three years of hard work were incorrect. “It would have been much better if I had never published. I am happy to have had that experience though; it has taught me that despite best efforts morphological evidence is not sufficient. Barcodes will have their drawbacks as well, but they are a vast improvement,” he wrote of the experience. Either way, the direction of travel is clear. “We’re not going to be looking at genital apertures in beetles in 50 years from now to tell which species were on a tree,” Hebert says. Brown says that if, as he suspects, some species are much rarer than previously thought that only makes conservation efforts more urgent. “I look at my flies and there are maybe 100,000, maybe a million, undescribed species of them in the world. We don’t really know. But if we don’t use methods that take into account genetic divergence, we’re never going to get close to the truth.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",environment
"Jordan Ellis was not suited to school. “I couldn’t just sit there and concentrate. I had to mess about. I hate just sitting in the classroom working, listening to the teachers talk. I don’t like getting told what I have to do,” he says. Ellis, 18, still has to follow instructions on his apprenticeship at Future Roots, a care farm in Dorset, but he’s free from the static confines of a classroom and has 30 acres to mess about in. The pleasant smell of rain fills the air when I arrive at the farm on a muggy morning in August. I’m greeted by Future Root’s managing director, Julie Plumley, and her two dogs. Plumley, 57, had the idea for Future Roots in 2008 after working with troubled children as a social worker. She recalls one visit to a local school as we trundle through muddy grass towards her duck pond. Plumley thought the children’s inability to keep still could have been put to good use on the farm she grew up on. “Dad was my hero. So, he was never the best at anything. He was a dairy man, he fixed tractors, he was a builder, he was a plumber; whatever went wrong on the farm dad would just fix it,” she says. “And I was like: ‘God, the farm can teach you something that you might enjoy’.” There are about 250 care farms operating in the UK. They typically offer farming-related activities including animal and plant husbandry, horticulture and land management. Increasingly GPs or community mental health workers can prescribe these farms as part of a care package. Future Roots, like other care farms, has a range of programmes that cater to people with learning difficulties, mental health issues and physical disabilities. It has managed to stay open throughout the pandemic and today is hosting two groups: the Countryman’s Club, a scheme that helps men over the age of 50, who often have degenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, and the Future Farmers course for students aged 14–18. The course teaches basic literacy and numeracy and offers a City & Guilds award in land-based operations. Plumley works with about 20 schools throughout Dorset and neighbouring Somerset and has a team of mentors who have backgrounds in social services, special education and occupational therapy. 70% of Future Root’s funding comes from local authorities and the schools who send their students to the farm. The remaining 30% comes from donations. She says that the kids who come to her are bright, just not academic. “If you speak to their teachers, they’ll tell you they’re aggressive, they’re angry, they’re into drugs, they’re antisocial.” Despite their reputation, Plumley says she’s never had to exclude anyone from the farm and thousands have attended over the past decade. “The kids have said they walk on to this site and they feel safe – they feel that nobody’s going to trap them,” she says. Many of the young people who come to the farm have dependency issues, live or have lived in the care system, and have been excluded from mainstream education. According to research by Bournemouth University, young people attending care farms “displayed a significant reduction in self-reported mental health risks and behavioural regulation difficulties; improved social relationships and coping; improved life and work skills; and re-engagement with learning”. Ellis has finished with the ducks and stops for a brief chat on the way to his next task. Why is the farm better than the classroom? “You’re out in the open, you’re doing stuff physically, working with people who are actually similar to me and got the same problems and their mind works the same,” he says.  Ellis admits he was a “pain in the arse” when he was younger and had a fiery temper. He took drugs and would rob people using knives. “That’s what happens when you mix with the wrong crowd and get into that mindset,” he says. Ellis is now keeping out of trouble and gets his kicks from tearing around the farm on a tractor. Jaryn Taylor, who turned 17 the previous day, is working in the hay barn. “School messed me over bad,” he says, as we perch precariously halfway up a haystack at the barn’s entrance. “I’ve got learning difficulties, so I can’t read and write properly. They did nothing to help. So, I was messing up in all my lessons and I wasn’t learning anything.” Taylor would get frustrated at the lack of help and would abscond in the middle of lessons. “Basically, I’d tell them to fuck off, walk out and go home.” Since coming to the farm three years ago, Taylor’s life looks radically different. He loves to drive the tractors and wants to own his own farm: “I used to hang around in this little group down in town. There’d be fights and I’d get involved and then I started coming here. I just realised I could do good for myself and just stay away from all of them.” The rest of the group are attending to the stars of the farm, a herd of Simmentals – posh cows from Switzerland. Mo (not her real name), 17, was home schooled before she started here four years ago. She can match every calf in the field to its mother and has done the family trees of all the cows. When Mo arrived on the farm she was terrified of the cows and would not go near them. “It was nice to come here and out of the house. It’s helped my confidence a lot,” she says. “I’m a lot less anxious than I used to be. I wasn’t very social. I didn’t really see anyone.” Mo is excelling at her numeracy and literacy and has already completed the land management course. You’d expect a group of socially excluded teenagers to be carrying the weight of the world around with them. Guards up. Heads down. Constricted. But if the young people here were once burdened with such weight they must have left it at the entrance. All are glowing with enthusiasm for their work, for the animals. It probably helps that they have mentors who seem to encourage them, who champion them, who won’t condemn them for having a tizz when it all gets too much. They’re understood here and it shows. But like all farms, Plumley’s is vulnerable to the potentially disastrous implications of the imminent trade deal with the EU. One of the prevailing fears is that cheap food imports and lower standards on agricultural products could destroy domestic farming. “I am afraid for farming being considered unnecessary in the future and [that] we will be totally reliant on other countries,” Plumley says. The centrepiece of the latest agricultural bill is the Environmental Land Management scheme, where farmers can receive subsidies in exchange for meeting environmental standards. Plumley is not impressed: “It will decrease farming opportunities because landowners will keep land to get subsidies not to farm it. I really feel this is wealthy people rewarding themselves as they buy land.” As we walk back to the hay barn we see Ken Barnes and Andy Pollard from the Countryman’s Club singing along to an acoustic rendition of Loch Lomond. Watching from the sidelines are their wives, Sue Barnes and Sue Pollard, who are about to get some well-earned respite from providing full-time care. Ken and Andy were both active ex-farmers and sportsmen. The farm provides them with an opportunity to reclaim part of their former selves. “I got his wellies out this morning and his face just lit up,” Pollard says. Before learning about the farm she says there wasn’t anything available that Andy wanted to do: “This is like a godsend here, you can’t believe the difference it makes. When he comes home after being here, we actually have a conversation.” Barnes shares Pollard’s enthusiasm: “It took me quite a while to bring Ken here because he always had this thing about being with other people who had the same problems as him,” she says. But now her husband loves coming: “He doesn’t want to do anything else but farm. He’s always been like that. It gives me a break so when he comes here, I know he’s safe, I know he’s being looked after.” It’s coming to the end of the day and a few of the Future Farmers are growing restless and have taken to chucking unripened apples around. We gather round in a circle in a shaded spot next to the chicken coops. All of them are past school-leaving age and today they’re deciding if they want to stay on at the farm. All are adamant they want to continue. Studying in classrooms with more than 30 pupils didn’t work for them. Some of them were bullied, while others struggled with the curriculum and acted up as a result, but the farm is working, and they only have to look to Ellis to see where it can take them. Ellis is coming to the end of his apprenticeship and he’ll soon be able to earn more money and save up for the driving lessons he wants to take: “I can’t believe how much I’ve changed to be honest. I think it is this place. I’m out here every day, I don’t have time to do drugs or think of any of that crime stuff.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Efforts to win endangered species protections for the imperiled Joshua tree in California are encountering entrenched opposition from local officials, who say the added protections may prevent real estate development and economic growth. On Thursday, the California fish and game commission (FGC) will vote on a petition that, if approved, will grant the yucca plants temporary protected status for a year while the agency conducts a study. But local government officials say that granting additional protections to the plant will hinder real estate development and cause undue economic damage. The petition was authored by a local conservationist and grew out of increasing scientific evidence that Joshua trees face existential threats, from urban development and climate change. Brendan Cummings, the conservation director for the Center for Biological Diversity and author of the petition, believes local protections for the Joshua tree are superficial at best and often ignored. He believes local officials’ opposition to granting the Joshua endangered status in the state stems from deference to real estate developments. Since spring, San Bernardino county officials have been outspoken against this proposed listing. Robert Lovingood, a district official who serves a wide swath of the county, warned his constituents it will have a “devastating economic impact” on the high desert region. The Joshua tree – which is not a tree at all but actually a succulent called Yucca brevifolia – grows and reproduces slowly. They are associated with the Mojave desert, and millions of tourists flock annually to see them in national parks and wildlife preserves. But the moths the plants rely on for pollination are becoming more scarce. Wildfires are shrinking the areas where Joshua trees remain. This week, the Dome fire, which sparked on Saturday in the Mojave national preserve, incinerated more than 43,000 acres in some of the world’s densest old-growth Joshua tree forest. Some models predict the plant could be virtually eradicated by the end of the century. In Yucca Valley, a small town north-west of Joshua Tree national park, the city council, the local water district and the mayor have all come out strongly against the petition to study the Joshua tree. The county and Yucca Valley submitted a joint legal brief to FGC stating they “strongly oppose” the move, citing a lack of evidence that Joshua trees are threatened and even argued that “population levels have remained stable or potentially increased over the past 50 years.” Yucca Valley officials cite a local law – requiring residents and businesses to obtain a permit before cutting down any of the succulents on their property – as proof the Joshua tree has ample environmental protection. But a recent public records request – filed by a local retired activist, Ernesto Nevarez – showed the relative ease of obtaining a permit to cut down the yucca plants. Of 147 permit requests the city received in 2020, none have been denied. Nevarez believes this is evidence the city does little to protect the Joshua trees. “After I got the documents, I thought, ‘This is bullshit,’” Nevarez said in a call. He added, “Not one [permit] was declined, there’s no appeal process, there’s no procedural remedy for opponents or proponents of any tree.” Mayor Jeff Drozd has repeatedly argued on social media that further restrictions would bring “red tape, cost and delays” for homeowners but denied charges that he doesn’t care for Joshua trees. “I personally do not oppose protection of Joshua trees, but there is little regard for private property owners,” Drozd said in an email. Speaking to the Desert Sun, he described the possible approval of the petition as “horrible for our town”. But Cummings, the author of the petition, says his goal isn’t to stop development. Moreover, he argues that if his petition passes, it will have positive ripple effects; protections for the Joshua tree will blanket less prominent desert plants and wildlife, such as the endangered desert tortoise. “The Joshua tree, because of its iconic status and because of some of its unique attributes, can be a model of doing climate adaptation planning to ensure that biodiversity of the state is protected,” Cummings said. “Right now, it’s a symbol of our utter failure as a society to address climate change. I’d like to think it can become a symbol of us coming together.”",environment
"When Kosum Kao-Uthai’s family noticed mysterious imprints in the sand outside the hotel resort they own in Koh Samui, she knew exactly which animal had paid a visit. She remembered spotting the same marks, left by a nesting sea turtle, when, as a teenager, she helped her father farm coconuts on the island. Kosum hadn’t seen another for five decades. Yet, this year, as the coronavirus pandemic emptied Thailand of tourists, nests belonging to endangered hawksbill and green turtles cropped up across the island. Since February, 838 baby turtles have scuttled their way across the island’s sandy beaches and into the sea, with two nests yet to hatch. The surge in nests – 19 so far – has delighted conservationists who have been fighting for years to reduce the threats posed by humans. “It is really exciting and we hope that people in Samui will help us protect the turtles in the future – we have a chance,” says Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, deputy dean at the faculty of fisheries at Kasetsart University in Bangkok. Local people and businesses have rallied to protect the animals, building bamboo fences around nests to shield them from roaming water lizards and dogs. Some have camped next to nests in the hope of spotting the babies hatch, or seeing a mother turtle, who usually returns after a break of 10 or 12 days to lay more eggs. One hotel instructed its security teams to keep a watchful eye, visiting every hour, and redirected CCTV and motion sensors to make sure the eggs were not disturbed. Female turtles typically nest every two to three years, using their flippers to dig a teardrop-shaped cavity in the sand, and lay between 80 and 120 leathery eggs. “They look for areas that are calm and peaceful,” says Thepsuda Loyjiw, a marine biologist working at the Banyan Tree resort, where a green turtle laid five nests this year. “We try to grow the [banyan] plants, because normally they love the trees because of the shade,” she says, adding that the turtles usually nest at night. It’s not clear if turtles that may have been put off from nesting on crowded Samui beaches in previous years might have travelled elsewhere to nest. It’s possible that they released the eggs in the water, and they failed to hatch, says Thon. “The eggs inside the sea turtle cannot wait. It’s like humans – if you need to give birth, you will give birth in the taxi,” he says.  The number of sea turtles in Thailand’s waters has fallen drastically over the past century. Samui was a completely different place 50 years ago, says Kosum: “It was only wooden forests, coconut farms and there was no road.” Now the island has more than 2 million visitors in a good year. It’s not just the development of beaches that poses a threat to turtles. Other dangers include poaching, pollution and the risks posed by fishing nets. Around the world, their future is increasingly threatened by global heating, as hotter temperatures contribute to rising sea levels and storms, changing ocean currents and harming the coral reefs on which many depend for survival. There is also growing concern about the impact of the climate crisis on the sex ratio of turtles: the warmer the sand in which eggs are buried, the more likely the offspring will develop into a female. In Thailand, conservation experts are finding new ways to monitor the species. Over recent months, the Phuket Marine Biological Centre has tracked a hawksbill mother turtle that laid eggs on Samui, in an attempt to discover more about how her route can be better protected. “If you want to conserve any animal you have to know their life cycle and habitat,” says Dr Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, the centre’s director. Facial recognition technology that identifies turtles is also being developed. It is hoped that this could help generate more accurate estimates of numbers, as turtles are difficult to count because of their migration patterns. The number of nests reported on Samui in 2020 is far higher than any other year on record – though veterinary reports only date back to 2012. No one knows what will happen when the island sees the return of tourists, which so many businesses depend upon. “Before [the pandemic] it was full, the parking area was full,” says Kosum, adding that the family business has become increasingly hard to run.  Thon hopes a balance can be struck. The pandemic has illustrated that Samui is an important nesting ground for the species, and the pause in tourism caused by the pandemic is a chance to act, he says. “We have to.”",environment
"Scientists have developed a method to 3D-print greener buildings using local soil that they say has the potential to revolutionise the construction industry. The technology is designed to be a sustainable alternative to concrete, which accounts for approximately 7% of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Sarbajit Banerjee, a professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering at Texas A&M University, said 3D printing enabled a versatility that allowed them to print entire architectural facades, although getting such structures to meet existing building regulations remained a significant challenge. Concrete remains the primary material used in many construction projects but it cannot be recycled and requires a lot of energy to mix and transport. The research team’s aim is to print structures using the type of soil that can be found in any garden. “While the widespread use of concrete has democratised access to housing and enabled the growth of cities, this has come at a considerable environmental cost,” said Banerjee. “The move to 3D-print concrete threatens to exacerbate this problem. However, we envision a new paradigm of construction that uses naturally sourced materials. Using such materials will further pave the way for building designs that are specifically adapted to the needs of local climates, instead of cookie-cutter houses. “We see this as a means of providing dignified habitats to some of the neediest populations across the world.” What’s more, the use of local materials would reduce the need to transport concrete long distances, further reducing the environmental impact of the buildings. The research team’s plan to replace concrete with the earth beneath our feet depends on their ability to improve soil’s load-bearing capabilities, to which Banerjee said they “are making excellent progress”.  Once they have a clearer idea of the limits of the technology, Banerjee and his team plan to investigate how it might allow for building on other planets. “We see this research not just as a means of replacing concrete but allowing for construction in difficult environments. For instance, we have worked on addressing the problem of building all-weather roads in the subarctic. [The technology] could one day be used beyond Earth, to create settlements on the moon or even Mars.”",environment
"Expensive prices for electric cars could hold back the UK’s transition from fossil fuel vehicles, the industry has warned, amid signs that demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is waning. The premium paid for electric cars is a concern for more than half of UK consumers, according to a poll conducted on behalf of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK car industry lobby group.  Despite government subsidies, battery electric cars are still more expensive than those burning petrol or diesel, but carmakers are scrambling to ramp up production and sales in order to meet the new restrictions on emissions that came in this year. Sales of new battery electric cars have almost tripled to 39,000 in the year to July, but there are signs that demand is falling back. Data from online marketplace Auto Trader show that the average asking price for electric cars fell 5.2% in the year to August. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader’s commercial director, said the higher “upfront retail price of EVs is somewhat off-putting” for consumers, despite the potential savings from their cheaper running costs. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “Until these vehicles are as affordable to buy and as easy to own and operate as conventional cars, we risk the UK being in the slow lane, undermining industry investment and holding back progress.” The SMMT has been calling for the UK government to broaden the subsidies offered to buyers of new electric cars to include plug-in hybrid vehicles. The withdrawal of subsidies from plug-in hybrids last year prompted a furious reaction from the industry, which argues the controversial technology, which combines an internal combustion engine with a battery, is a crucial stepping stone for consumers. However, environmental groups argue that the best way to accelerate consumer take-up of electric cars is to bring forward bans on internal combustion engines. The government is committed to banning polluting carbon dioxide-emitting engines by 2040, but is considering moving that forward to 2035 or even as early as 2032. Both the industry and environmental groups are united in calling for a dramatic increase in investment in charging points to make it more attractive for consumers around the country to switch to electric cars. The UK will require as many as 1.7m on-street electric car charging points by the end of the decade, and a further 1.1m by 2035, in order to allow for a zero-emissions car fleet, according to analysis by the SMMT and consultancy Frost and Sullivan. That would equate to more than 500 new charge points per day over 15 years.",environment
"Maritime authorities in Spain have warned sailors off the coast of Galicia to give orcas a wide berth after a naval yacht lost part of its rudder following a brush with two of the whales and a similar incident left a French boat with minor damage. Both encounters took place hours apart on Sunday in the Rías Baixas area of north-west Spain. The French boat was found to have marks consistent with the orcas rubbing against its hull, while the Mirfak – a Spanish naval yacht en route to a regatta – lost part of its rudder after the boat attracted the animals’ attention. A video shot by the one of the Mirfak’s crew shows the animals swimming alongside and underneath the boat before the sailors realise the rudder has been damaged. On Monday, Spain’s maritime rescue service warned vessels in the area of the presence of the orcas, and asked sailors “to keep their distance, give them a lot of leeway and inform the coastguard”. Experts from the Co-ordinator for the Study of Marine Mammals (Cemma) in the Galician town of Nigrán are investigating the episodes, which they describe as highly unusual. Alfredo López, a biologist at Cemma, said orcas were usually spotted off Galicia in September each year when the whales make their way up from the Gulf of Cádiz and follow tuna into the Bay of Biscay. “We’re looking into the matter but we don’t yet have all the information we need to draw a clear conclusion,” López told the Guardian. He said the “interaction” with the French boat had taken place at about midday on Sunday, while the Mirfak had encountered the orcas about five hours later in the same area. “We managed to get a look at the French boat, which showed evidence of contact, of the animal brushing up against the hull, but there was no evidence of structural damage in that case,” he said. “The navy boat seems to have broken its rudder, but we’re waiting to see if they’ll let us examine it and the rest of the boat.” López said he and his colleagues were in touch with teams in Portugal to check through similar cases there and to determine whether the same animals were involved. He added: “These interactions are very rare and aren’t something we’ve seen here before.” Orcas, also known as killer whales, can weight up to six tonnes and live for up to 80 years.",environment
"Narrow lanes running west reflect the low sun, where asphalt is dampened by seeping springs and moss revives along the centres. Clusters of browning keys weigh down the ominously thin crowns of ash, and withered beech leaves accumulate in shallow drifts; immature hazelnuts have blown off, gobbled up by squirrels. Sufficient rain has ensured heavier crops of second-cut silage, in contrast to the meagre production of early summer. Grass regrows vigorously on vacated pastures; swirling flocks of jackdaws peck over softened ground before beef cattle are brought back from adjoining fields for another grazing session. South from home, minor roads between high banks lead downhill towards the tidal river. Cuttings excavated through contorted slate help reduce the gradient and made these routes suitable for horse-drawn heavy wagons, carting local produce towards steamers that called in en route to North Corner in Plymouth, there to be unloaded for Devonport market. Lime was also dragged uphill from the kilns at Halton Quay, worked from as early as 1411 and last burned in 1916, for the reclamation of Viverdon Down, which needed lime to be ploughed into the acidic soil. On this quiet evening, stubble fields inside rutted muddy gateways are overrun with pheasants, at liberty before the shooting season. Lower down, tailless poults scuttle across steep land, opposite woods on Mount Ararat and overlooking Hornifast Marsh. Derelict market gardens still grow eucalyptus for the blue foliage used by the cut-flower trade and, in a nearby community orchard, branches on young fruit trees droop with heavy crops of apples and pears. A few gaunt cherry trees survive, almost dead, overwhelmed in ivy topped with strands of scarlet rosehips. Close to the river, old man’s beard – characteristic of chalky soil – benefits from the once-important lime trade; tendrils of its fluffy seeds scramble among bright red haws, smother hedges and tangle the purple flowering reeds at the confluence with the stream from Dairymill. Smooth river water is a mirror for sky, mud banks, reedbeds and darkening woods on the Pentillie meander, and from up-river comes the clacking sound of a gig’s oars, out on a run from Cotehele Quay.",environment
"The government’s badger cull is being expanded to 11 new areas of England including parts of Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire so that more than 60,000 badgers can be killed. Conservation groups said the expansion was a betrayal of trust after the government this year pledged to phase out the badger cull, intended to reduce bovine TB in cattle, after a scientific review cast doubt on its efficacy. Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: “The decision to expand the badger cull is a huge betrayal of public trust by the government. Despite responding to the Sir Charles Godfray TB Review in March with a clear commitment to phase out badger culling in favour of TB vaccination of badgers and cattle, the government is now embarking on a mass destruction of badgers, which is little more than ecological vandalism on an unprecedented scale.” Jo Smith, the chief executive of Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, also condemned the decision. “This is a staggering government U-turn and one which will result in thousands of healthy badgers being shot across England this autumn. “We are at a critical turning point for our natural world and this latest U-turn should set alarm bells ringing. Culling is an outdated policy that seeks to eradicate protected wildlife rather than addressing the real problem which is the main cause of bovine tuberculosis: cattle-to-cattle infection.” Bovine TB causes more than 30,000 cattle to be prematurely slaughtered in England each year, but the contribution of badgers to the disease’s spread is disputed and not precisely understood by science. When the culls began in 2013, 26,594 infected cows were prematurely slaughtered in England. In 2018, 32,925 cows were slaughtered because of the disease. For the first time, culling – including cage-trapping and “free shooting” – will take place this autumn in Derbyshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire and Oxfordshire, where successful badger vaccination projects are under way. Vaccinating badgers has been shown to reduce bovine TB in badger populations. The government has yet to respond to a formal complaint that the cull breaches the Bern convention, while the humaneness of the shooting of free-running badgers allowed under cull licences is being challenged in the high court. The Badger Trust said the government had yet to publish any reliable scientific evidence that culling was reducing TB in cattle, but the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said peer-reviewed research showed reductions in new cattle TB outbreaks of 66% in Gloucestershire and 37% in Somerset. Stuart Roberts, deputy president of the union, said: “The NFU has always supported the government’s 25-year eradication strategy, which provides farmers with a lifeline for tackling bovine TB, and using all available measures to tackle this horrendous disease, including strengthening cattle movements, enhanced biosecurity and controlling the disease in wildlife. “The chief vet has said that proactive badger culling is currently the best available option to tackle this disease and there is clear evidence that badger culling is working.” But critics point out that the 66% reduction in Gloucestershire was followed by a 130% increase the following year. Iain McGill, a vet who signed an open letter to Boris Johnson in the Veterinary Record, alongside Jane Goodall, Chris Packham and others, said the real cause of bovine TB in cattle was infected cows going undetected by the existing skin test, which picks up only half of those with infections. “This shames the veterinary profession to its very core,” he said.  The government said it still intended to phase out “intensive badger culling in the next few years, while ensuring that wildlife control remains a tool that can be deployed where the scientific evidence supports it”. It recently announced long-awaited trials of a bovine TB cattle vaccine and awarded £500,000 in grants for projects to devise new tools to better diagnose the disease in cattle. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “Bovine TB is one of the most difficult and intractable animal health challenges that the UK faces today, causing considerable trauma for farmers and costing taxpayers over £100m every year. “No one wants to continue the cull of a protected species indefinitely. That is why we are accelerating other elements of our strategy, including vaccination and improved testing, so that we can eradicate this insidious disease and start to phase out badger culling in England.”",environment
"Health experts have warned that delays to proposed clean air zones in cities including Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds pose a risk to the nation’s wellbeing. Clean air zones (CAZs) are areas in which drivers of polluting vehicles are charged to enter city centres in an effort to improve air quality. With air pollution at illegal levels in many locations for the past decade, causing thousands of deaths a year, local authorities nationwide had announced plans to introduce the zones. But the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in fewer vehicles on the road during lockdown, has led pollution levels to fall. The funding available to local authorities is designed to bring air pollution below legal limits, so some local authorities have been hesitant to proceed while pollution levels remain relatively low. Birmingham’s CAZ was originally scheduled for 2020, but has been delayed until next year, and the council is expected to announce the exact date later this autumn. A spokesperson said: “Birmingham remains committed to launching its clean air zone in 2021.” Sheffield and Bristol have also delayed their CAZs. According to Sheffield city council, the city’s air pollution in January-August this year was 33% lower than the same period in 2019. The government is working with cities on the zones through its Joint Air Quality Unit, managed by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport. Sheffield council’s cabinet member for transport, Bob Johnson, said: “Following on from the lockdown required to control the spread of the virus, there have been a number of changes to travel behaviour which has led to improvements in air quality. The current situation is dramatically different to the one in which our proposals were originally developed.” He said the economic uncertainty arising from the pandemic meant the proposed CAZ needed to be reviewed. “If we can hold on to clean air by introducing other measures without resorting to charging people, we believe this is the best way forward,” said Johnson.  James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council, said: “If the city’s air pollution is expected to stay below legal limits then we will no longer have the support of the government to introduce a charging clean air zone. Given this uncertainty, our financial support will continue to be paused until the review is complete and we have received further direction.” The city’s plans remain suspended indefinitely. Greater Manchester was expected to conduct a public consultation into its own CAZ this summer but it will instead take place next month. Andrew Western, the councillor leading the city’s plans to improve air quality, said: “We will use the feedback from the consultation process to inform our final plans and understand how best to ensure our residents are not exposed to illegal levels of air pollution.” “Lockdown led to a huge improvement in air quality across our city-region,” he added. “It also showed that better air quality is achievable, and that vehicle emissions are the key to reducing NO2 exposure.” About 800,000 people a year across Europe are estimated to die prematurely because of air pollution. The latest round of delays has led some environmental campaigners to question the government’s commitment to reducing air pollution. Katie Nield, a lawyer at the environmental charity ClientEarth, said: “Clean air zones are the key to reducing illegal and harmful levels of pollution in our towns and cities. Resisting and delaying these much-needed measures is shortsighted and adds an unnecessary risk to respiratory health as we grapple with Covid-19. “It’s not really clear where these U-turns originate. In some cases councils are suggesting central government is behind these delays, while ministers are remaining tight-lipped. The public deserve better. Ultimately it is the UK government’s responsibility to make sure that the necessary work is done to tackle this public health crisis. They are already a decade behind – people’s health should not have to wait any longer.” A Defra spokesperson said: “We remain committed to cleaning up our air and are providing £880m in funding and expert support to local authorities so they can develop innovative plans that work best for their areas.”",environment
"Spuds, tatties, taters – the time to unearth these magic tubers had come. Summer’s heaviest harvesting was under way in billows of dust, rolling tractors and trailer upon laden trailer bound for welcoming barns. Almost five months before, I had stood at this same field corner looking over newly ploughed soil, the fine tilth sculpted into a corrugated landscape of hillocks and hollows. A pair of yellow wagtails flitted from top to top, and in any other year those lemony migrants from Africa would have been the highlight of my walk. But that day I gained more exhilaration from a quartet of wooden crates parked at the end of the field. Each of the waist-high tubs was filled to the brim with seed potatoes, and each peach-sized pellet was destined to be sunk into the raised banks of soil and grow offspring a dozen or so times its own weight. On that day, when the supermarket shelves were empty of flour, pasta and rice, and in that period of perpetual doubt, I glowed in the certainty that, come autumn, there would be still be mash for tea. Over spring and summer, I nursed this crop with my eyes, watched it watered by farm irrigators and downpours. I walked its length and width to estimate how many potatoes lay beneath. When the plant tops were raked off by tractor, I knew there was a fortnight to go, 14 days for the buried skins to harden. Two tractors came down the lines in parallel. One was a taker, the other a receiver. The former, with wheels in the gutters on either side, used spinning wheels to throw up the banked earth into a pouch. The contents bounced on to a quaking conveyer belt, which shook off the soil, and nudged the potatoes up its crane-like stem. At the end of the belt, a funnel sent a continuous stream of tatties raining down into a trailer pulled by the accompanying tractor. Two small potatoes had spilled out on the concrete track. They were in the path of huge tractor tyres that would crush them as they turned. I scooped them up – just enough for a lunch. In the field before me were a hundred thousand dinners.",environment
"A veteran Australian forestry scientist has launched a blistering attack on his professional association after it used the retraction of a scientific paper to dismiss links between logging and increased bushfire risks. In an open letter to the Institute of Foresters Australia seen by Guardian Australia, Dr John Dargavel said the institute’s reaction “damages our standing” and “demeans all foresters in the public eye”. Dargavel, who is retired but remains an associate professor at the Fenner school of environment and society at the Australian National University, got his first role in forestry in 1956 and has edited and written books about the history of the profession in Australia and the world. The institute says it has about 1,000 members, and describes itself as a “professional association for foresters, private forestry, commercial tree growing and all forestry professionals”. Dargavel wrote: “We cannot afford to continue to present ourselves as a blustering, reactive, negative profession, when the heart of forestry offers positive hope for the future.” Earlier this week the institute said it was seeking an apology “over the standard of the [University of Tasmania’s] review process” after the research, produced by three university scientists, was withdrawn. Its president, Bob Gordon, also claimed the paper was retracted after third parties had contacted the journal. However, the journal’s editor told Guardian Australia the researchers had asked the journal to withdraw the paper. The research paper had examined satellite images of Tasmania’s Huon Valley before and after fires in early 2019, but a mistake was made in categorising the types of trees burned – some of which were in plantations and not native forests. The withdrawal prompted a flurry of public statements from politicians and logging industry groups attacking the scientists. Tasmania’s resources minister, Guy Barnett, and the Australian Forest Products Association both claimed there was a “scientific consensus” that there was no link between logging and the risk of more dangerous bushfires – an assertion rejected by some experts. Dargavel wrote that “some of the institute’s public commentary debases our standing as an independent professional association”. Its attack on the university “is negative and repeats the carping, anti-academic tenor of several of the [institute’s] media statements of recent years”. The institute’s focus on the university was misdirected: “Journals, not universities, run the review process for articles. “Asking the university for an apology is pointless because academics have individual freedom to publish. No doubt the authors are already mortified that they had made an error. They and the journal acted correctly in retracting the paper.” Dargavel said he felt the institute was taking “an incredibly negative approach” and was alienating a public that it should be trying to connect with”.  He sent his letter to the institute’s chief executive and Gordon with a request it be disseminated to members. Responding to the letter, the institute said: “While we thoroughly respect the right of members to express their view, we stand by our comments.” Prof Rod Keenan, chair of forest and ecosystem science at the University of Melbourne and an institute member, described Dargavel as an “elder statesman” for forestry science. He had read the letter and agreed the institute should be pushing for more science on the relationships between forestry and bushfires. “I support [Dargavel’s] call for a focus on the science,” he said, adding the institute was better to focus on those issues rather than political conflict.",environment
"The scene could hardly be more idyllic. A broad grassy bank next to a clear, burbling river. Downstream from the stone bridge, herons patrol the shallows, while deer, wild ponies and cattle trot down the hillside in the early autumn sunshine for a drink. This spot at Bellever in the heart of Dartmoor was very different at the height of the summer, when hundreds of “fly-campers” descended from across the UK with tents, gazebos, music systems, fairy lights and generators to grab a taste of post-lockdown freedom. They collected wood and lit fires, putting the environment and precious bronze-age archaeological sites at risk. The gorse bushes that dot the slopes were turned into makeshift toilets, the woods became the site of raves. At one point, 60 groups were crammed together on the Devon riverbank. “It was horrendous,” said Simon Lee, Dartmoor National Park ranger team manager. “This is a wonderful spot and I understand why people would want to camp but they were just not doing it the right way. It was loud and very messy. There was rubbish all over the place, human excrement in the gorse bushes, more than 100 fire pits dug into the ground.” A great deal of work has been done to restore the site and make sure wildlife, including otters and salmon, do not suffer long-term impact. But look closely and evidence of the summer excess lingers. The scars of the fire-pits are obvious and detritus – a child’s flip-flop, an adult’s trainer, a plastic bag – washes up from time to time on the banks of the East Dart River. Because of the Covid crisis, huge numbers of UK people headed to the countryside with their tents and barbecues, putting flora and fauna at risk, not to the mention the peace of human residents. Social media means hidden spots do not stay hidden for long. Dartmoor was a particular problem because it is one of the few places in England where wild or backpack camping is allowed in some places. However, it is not a free-for-all. The rule is that you can camp as part of a hike. You have to carry your own equipment and stay a maximum of two nights. Your camp site should be 100m from the nearest road, out of sight and you should leave no trace. Large tents and big groups are not allowed and no open fires or barbecues permitted. The rangers have a delicate balancing act. They want to attract people to the park but the false idea that Dartmoor was a free campsite seems to have taken hold. “I don’t think people quite grasped the concept of wild camping,” said Martin Jones, a plumber and keen wild camper who lives close to the Bellever spot. “It was just terrible here in the summer. We had to put up with a mini-rave in the summer in the forestry land, boy racers coming down the lane and the whole place was turned into a toilet. You were more likely to get cholera than Covid around here.” He has particularly missed the churring, ventriloquial call of the nightjar, a nocturnal bird that usually hawks for food at dawn and dusk at Bellever. “They vanished when the campers came,” said Jones. “I don’t think we had as many swallows and house martins this summer either. I hope they’ll be back.” So critical was the situation that the park authority invoked a section of the Dartmoor Common Act 1985 to ban camping at Bellever and on the high ground above it, Riddon Ridge, from 7 August to 2 September. Marshals were employed to work with rangers to patrol the riverbanks and hillsides. The ban ended this week but the rangers are still asking people not to camp at Bellever and the Riddon Ridge for the rest of the year and the marshals remain on patrol.  Vanessa and Björn Michael, from Bedfordshire, were among the first to return to the Bellever spot following the end of the ban. They have camped here before, though not this summer. “It’s a lovely spot. We follow the leave no trace rules and stay invisible.” They arrived with tent and firewood but confronted by signs informing them that this remain a “wildlife recovery zone”, they passed by and went to find another spot, melting in the landscape. As dusk fell, tents began to appear on Dartmoor, not at Bellever but on other spots across the moor, a number clearly visible from the road. Campers Jon Foot and Dawn McGeorge had travelled from Dumfries and Galloway to meet family from Devon on the moor. They were tucked away in a hollow and were to be found cooking halloumi and veggie sausages as they took in the sunset. Asked what the draw was, Foot pointed out the bright red sky and the first stars. “There’s nothing better than getting out into a landscape like this. It’s wonderful to be out here in the wild.” The concern is that if the crowds continue to converge on spots like Bellever, the spirit of wild or backpack camping on Dartmoor will be lost for ever.",environment
"The extractive industries have their sights set on Nova Scotia as a literal goldmine, and decades of conservation efforts – as well the future of a beloved river – hang in the balance. Three years after Atlantic Gold opened a goldmine north-east of Halifax, the mining company intends to open three more across Nova Scotia. One of the mines has been proposed alongside the St Mary’s River, Nova Scotia’s longest single waterway – and in the opinions of many, its wildest, supporting both endangered species and ecosystems. This, the so-called Cochrane Hill goldmine, has become the focal point of mounting public opposition to goldmining in Nova Scotia. “To put a mine [on the St Mary’s] is a terrible idea,” said Charlotte Connolly, campaign coordinator with the Ecology Action Centre, an environmental advocacy group based in Nova Scotia. All three proposed mines are under joint federal and provincial environmental review. But according to Connolly, the provincial government has already given Atlantic Gold a warm welcome, publicly touting the economic benefits of goldmining to Nova Scotians and offering a very low royalty rate – a fee charged to any company profiting from a public resource. Very few new mines in Canada fail to receive federal approval according to Jamie Kneen, who handles communications for MiningWatch Canada, a coalition that promotes sustainable mining practices. Over time, Kneen says, as rare metal deposits became scarce, mines have become bigger in order to harvest smaller fragments of gold. Some – like Cochrane Hill – are increasingly situated in vulnerable ecosystems, such as on the banks of major rivers. “Consider the St Mary’s River,” he said. “Do you really want to mess with that? Even if you accept all [of Atlantic Gold’s] promises - that there’s a low probability of a serious problem – the consequences [of toxic waste] are still huge.” The “wildness” of the St Mary’s River is in part due to its unusual concentration of old growth and floodplain forests, which have grown relatively undisturbed for centuries. These forests are storehouses of provincial biodiversity, such as wood turtles and rare lichen, and there are precious few left in Nova Scotia. The St Mary’s has been the subject of intense conservation efforts for decades. The St Mary’s River Association was established in 1979 to protect and restore the river’s once-famous salmon fishery – visited by such celebrities as Babe Ruth and Michael J Fox – and has spent decades building fish ladders and monitoring the health of the ecosystem and resident fish. Since 2014, it has dedicated $1.1m to rebuilding riverbanks and spawning habitat pulverized by log drives, and just last year received another $1.2m to shield the river from acid rain. In recent years, members of the association have noticed the number of salmon nests growing dramatically in the stretches of river they have restored. Slowly but surely, it seems salmon are returning to the St Mary’s. “This is starting to become a major natural corridor,” said Bonnie Sutherland, executive director of the Nova Scotia Nature Trust, which has privately protected over 600 hectares of old growth and floodplain forest along the river. “It’s pretty ironic that this proposed mine is coming at the height of conservation achievement on this river.” In addition to these private efforts, the provincial government has committed to protecting thousands of hectares along the river, turning them into forthcoming provincial parks, wilderness areas and nature reserves. The Cochrane Hill mine, as proposed, would draw water for gold processing from one such forthcoming wilderness area. But once the provincial government officially establishes a wilderness area, it cannot be used by the mine in any way, said Chris Miller of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. Conservationists have flagged multiple other issues with Atlantic Gold’s planned construction: it would drain its treated effluent – which may contain mercury and arsenic, according to Michael Parsons of Natural Resources Canada – through McKeens Brook, which the St Mary’s River Association believes is among the most productive salmon-spawning habitats on the entire river. The mine’s construction would also necessitate rerouting a nearby highway through land protected by the Nova Scotia Nature Trust – probably destroying old growth forests that the trust is mandated to protect. In order for the highway to be rerouted, according to members of the trust, the province would have to seize the land for public use through a controversial mechanism called expropriation. “Expropriation would be wrong on so many levels,” said Sutherland. Nova Scotia’s department of environment declined to comment directly on the potential for expropriation until the proposed mine’s environmental review has been completed. The department said public comment would be invited at that time. “Our company is still completing studies to optimize the plan for the proposed Cochrane Hill goldmine,” said St Barbara, parent company of Atlantic Gold, in a statement to the Guardian. “St Barbara greatly respects the work of local groups to protect and grow spawning habitat of Atlantic salmon and other aquatic and terrestrial life around the St Mary’s River. In line with our commitment to respecting the environment, we have invested a significant amount of time and funding to study all possible impacts our operations could have on the local environment, including water tables and aquatic habitat. We have also assessed how best we can effectively mitigate any possible impacts.” Kneen, from MiningWatch Canada, said that even when mines have been exhausted, they will have to be monitored forever in order to avoid contamination of water and soil. When contamination does occur, Kneen said Canada had a very poor record of holding companies to account, and there were few legal remedies for Canadian citizens or communities to do so themselves. “Like everyone else, we’re trying to navigate our way through the pandemic, while trying to keep the goldmine fight front and centre,” said Scott Beaver, president of the St Mary’s River Association. “If they push a mine through to the St Mary’s, there’s no place in Nova Scotia, in my mind, that can be protected from mining. The St Mary’s is a sacred spot.”",environment
"Scientists are to warn world leaders that increasing numbers of deadly new pandemics will afflict the planet if levels of deforestation and biodiversity loss continue at their current catastrophic rates. A UN summit on biodiversity, scheduled to be held in New York next month, will be told by conservationists and biologists there is now clear evidence of a strong link between environmental destruction and the increased emergence of deadly new diseases such as Covid-19. Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of farming and the building of mines in remote regions – as well as the exploitation of wild animals as sources of food, traditional medicines and exotic pets – are creating a “perfect storm” for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people, delegates will be told. Almost a third of all emerging diseases have originated through the process of land use change, it is claimed. As a result, five or six new epidemics a year could soon affect Earth’s population. “There are now a whole raft of activities – illegal logging, clearing and mining – with associated international trades in bushmeat and exotic pets that have created this crisis,” said Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation at Duke University. “In the case of Covid-19, it has cost the world trillions of dollars and already killed almost a million people, so clearly urgent action is needed.” It is estimated that tens of millions of hectares of rainforest and other wild environments are being bulldozed every year to cultivate palm trees, farm cattle, extract oil and provide access to mines and mineral deposits. This leads to the widespread destruction of vegetation and wildlife that are hosts to countless species of viruses and bacteria, most unknown to science. Those microbes can then accidentally infect new hosts, such as humans and domestic livestock. Such events are known as spillovers. Crucially, if viruses thrive in their new human hosts they can infect other individuals. This is known as transmission and the result can be a new, emerging disease. An example of such events is provided by the HIV virus, which in the early 20th century spread from chimpanzees and gorillas – which were being slaughtered for bushmeat in West Africa – to men and women and which has since caused the death of more than 10 million people. Other examples include Ebola fever, which is passed on by bats to primates and humans; the swine flu epidemic of 2009 and the Covid-19 virus, which was originally passed to humans from bats. “When workers come into rainforests to chop down trees they don’t take food with them,” said Andy Dobson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University. “They just eat what they can kill. So that exposes them to infection all the time.” This point was backed by Pimm. “I have a photograph of a guy slaughtering a wild pig deep in the Ecuadorian jungle. He was an illegal logger and he and his fellow workers needed food so they killed a boar. They got splattered with wild pig blood in the process. It’s gruesome and unhygienic and that is how these diseases spread.” However, not every emerging disease is caused by a single, major spillover event, stressed zoologist David Redding, of University College London. “In places where trees are being cleared, mosaics of fields, created around farms, appear in the landscape interspersed with parcels of old forest. “This increases the interface between the wild and the cultivated. Bats, rodents and other pests carrying strange new viruses come from surviving clumps of forests and infect farm animals – who then pass on these infections to humans.” An example of this form of transmission is provided by Lassa fever, which was first discovered in Nigeria in 1969 and now causes several thousand deaths a year. The virus is spread by the rodent Mastomys natalensis, which was widespread in Africa’s savannahs and forests but now colonises homes and farms, passing on the disease to humans. “The crucial point is that there are probably 10 times more different species of viruses than there are of mammals,” added Dobson. “The numbers are against us and the emergence of new pathogens inevitable.” In the past many outbreaks of new diseases remained in contained areas. However, the development of cheap air travel has changed that picture and diseases can appear across the globe before scientists have fully realised what is happening. “The onward transmission of a new disease is also another really important element in the pandemic story,” said Professor James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University. “Consider the swine flu pandemic. We flew that around the world several times before we realised what was going on. Global connectivity has allowed – and is still allowing – Covid-19 to be transmitted to just about every country on Earth.” In a paper published in Science last month, Pimm, Dobson and other scientists and economists propose setting up a programme to monitor wildlife, reduce spillovers, end the wildlife meat trade and reduce deforestation. Such a scheme could cost more than $20bn a year, a price tag that is dwarfed by the cost of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has wiped trillions of dollars from national economies round the world. “We estimate that the value of prevention costs for 10 years to be only about 2% of the costs of the Covid-19 pandemic,” they state. In addition, reducing deforestation – which is a major source of carbon emissions – would also have the benefit of helping the battle against climate change, add the researchers. “The rate of emergence of novel disease is increasing and their economic impacts are also increasing,” states the group. “Postponing a global strategy to reduce pandemic risk would lead to continued soaring costs. Society must strive to avoid the impacts of future pandemics.”",environment
"The Coalition is being urged to not push through changes to conservation laws that would transfer more development approval powers to the states unless it plans to also introduce promised new national environmental standards. There is growing concern a bill due to be introduced to parliament this week will not include the new standards, which were promised last month by the environment minister, Sussan Ley. National environmental standards were one of the key recommendations of the interim report from a review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The review’s chair, the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, said the standards could underpin a devolution of development approval powers from Canberra to the states and territories. Ley said in July that prototype standards would be introduced in August at the same time as a bill to streamline the approvals system. But in a meeting with environment groups this week, the minister said the bill to be introduced this week did not include standards, according to multiple people at the meeting. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said: “It is only fair that Australians should see the proposed standards before the parliament is asked to vote on any amendment to the environmental law. “When the report was published, Sussan Ley said the standards would be introduced at the same time as the legislation. She referred to “strong rigorous environmental standards” that had “buy-in across the board”. “She should stay true to her word and not pursue amendments until the standards are negotiated and made available to the people of Australia.” Butler said there would be concern if the Morrison government introduced legislation similar to the Coalition’s one-stop-shop proposal that was defeated in 2015. Labor, the Greens and some of the crossbench have expressed alarm that changes to laws are being rushed before Samuel has handed down his final report, due in October. Government and One Nation senators voted to block a Greens motion on Wednesday that would have prevented the government’s bill from being debated in the Senate until the final report is delivered or a consultative committee discussing the development of national standards reached agreement. Guardian Australia asked Ley if the government planned to meet its commitment to introduce prototype standards at the same time as its streamlining bill. “The bilateral agreements will include commonwealth standards,” a spokesman said. “There will be further legislation as a result of Professor Samuel’s consultation process.” Rachel Walmsley, the policy and law reform director at the Environmental Defenders Office, said a potential outcome was that national standards would be attached as an appendix to each bilateral agreement as those agreements were negotiated with the states. “From a legal point of view, that’s very concerning,” she said. “Graeme Samuel’s interim report said that national standards will be regulatory instruments with regulatory functions. “That’s different to something that is an appendix to an agreement. For that to actually have (legal) force, the only recourse there would be for the minister to exercise a call-in power or for the minister to suspend accreditation.” Walmsley said a bill that simply moved to streamline and fast-track development approvals would not bring the improvements Samuel’s report found were necessary to stem an unsustainable rate of environmental decline. The report recommended three phases for reform, beginning with interim standards and steps to establish bilateral processes. The final phase called for a complete overhaul of the act with “a full suite of national environmental standards”, an independent law enforcement regulator, and systems that protect and restore the environment. “All of that could be completely undermined if a bill goes through now that hands power to the states with no enforceable standards or safeguards,” Walmsley said. The Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said Australians wanted to see the country’s environment protected. “We should not be dealing with any of this legislation until we have a copy of that final report,” she said. “It’s about good process, it’s about scrutiny and it’s about protecting Australia’s environment.” Senator Rex Patrick said he believed the government should wait until the final report was released before bringing legislation for debate. “Before being asked to vote on any amendments to the EPBC Act it’s important that senators are well informed,” he said. “As such, we should have access to the final independent review before any vote takes place.”",environment
"The drought in the east, extreme rains in the west and now the wind all over have taken their toll on the final few faded meadow browns still heroically jinking through the flowerless meadows. I’m enjoying pristine red admirals on my late-flowering buddleias, the rare and handsome brown hairstreak (the last species to emerge each summer) continues to flourish and there are large whites a-plenty, but we’ve definitely passed peak butterfly. The season is not quite over yet, however. Some exciting migrants, such as clouded yellows and long-tailed blues may continue along the south coast into October. And thanks to the glorious spring and summer, we’re likely to see extra broods of species showing strongly this autumn – speckled woods, small coppers, wall browns and even white admirals may emerge. Although it is some months before official data can confirm this, it appears to have been an excellent summer for most of our 59 native species. Even those in steep decline, such as the wall brown, have been seen in abundance. But the late broods aren’t all good news: for many species, they are a “development trap” because the caterpillars produced by these butterflies cannot find suitable food plants or reach the stage they require to survive the winter.

"The much-persecuted hen harrier has enjoyed its best breeding year in England for nearly two decades, benefiting from good weather and high numbers of voles. Grouse moor groups hailed the fledging of 60 chicks from 19 nests across the northern Pennines as a vindication of controversial “brood management”, whereby chicks are removed from some nests on grouse moors, reared in captivity and released elsewhere. Brood management is one part of a government action plan for the endangered hen harrier, but most conservation charities have disavowed it, arguing that the shooting industry must first stop the illegal killing of hen harriers. Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, thanked partners including landowners, police and charities, and said: “Despite the great progress there is no cause for complacency. Too many birds still go missing in unexplained circumstances and I urge anyone who is still engaged in the persecution of these magnificent creatures to cease at once.” Although ecologists calculate that the English uplands could support a breeding population of 330 pairs of hen harriers, the birds virtually ceased breeding in England earlier this century because of persecution. Hen harriers are targeted because they predate red grouse, for which there is a lucrative driven shooting industry on the moors. This year’s success – the best since Natural England began working to revive the species in 2002 – means that 141 hen harrier chicks have fledged over the past three years. Amanda Anderson, the director of the Moorland Association, said: “Yet again it has been a fantastic year for hen harriers and we have now seen significant increases in successful nests and chick numbers for three years running as part of the hen harrier recovery plan, which includes the innovative brood management scheme trial. “Twelve of the nests reported today are on land managed for grouse shooting and this reflects a genuine commitment from moor owners and managers to work with others and help rebuild the harrier population.” Dr Ruth Tingay, a co-director of Wild Justice said: “It doesn’t matter how many successful hen harrier nests there were this year if those young birds are subsequently shot, trapped and poisoned on driven grouse moors. This is a species in desperate trouble, its population in continuing decline, and Natural England would do well to put its resources into targeting the criminals within the grouse shooting industry instead of issuing joint press releases proclaiming ‘success’.”",environment
"It has been described as the “holy grail” of marine biology, an act that is crucial to the survival of apex predators but has never been documented in detail: the mating of great white sharks. Despite decades of research into the habits of the white pointer, how and where the marine creatures mate has largely remained a mystery. Until now. The testimony of a fisherman working in the frigid waters of the Otago Peninsula on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island has  shed light on great white sex in astonishing detail. Dick Ledgerwood’s account is only the second of its kind in the world. It took 23 years, a cup of tea and the help of marine biologist Steve Crawford for it to surface. “Witnessing white pointer copulation is informally referred to among scholars as the ‘holy grail’ of white shark ecology,” Crawford, a marine biologist from the University of Guelph in Canada, told the Guardian. “Four-plus tonnes of combined apex predator flesh is an extraordinarily delicate dance.” Crawford first got wind of Ledgerwood’s tale from wharfies at Port Chalmers while he was in New Zealand studying shark behaviour in 2016. He tracked Ledgerwood down, interviewed him at his home in Dunedin, and went out on the water with him. Ledgerwood’s story, published for the first time by the Guardian, is the fullest account recorded of the mysterious white pointer mating rituals. Ledgerwood is now 86, but in 1997, he was fishing each day on the Otago harbour. He started, aged 15, and headed out to sea for 43 years, mostly hunting crayfish and sole. He would spend days at sea, fishing “until the freezer was full up”, before heading back to Port Chalmers where the catch would be processed. In his decades on the water, he estimates he saw 12 or 14 white pointers up close. Most of the sightings were at Taiaroa Head, where the sharks would feed on offal discarded from a fish-processing factory nearby. “On a really calm day, they were just cruising around – and they made you hang on when you were walking around the boat,” Ledgerwood said. “Sometimes they’d circle around come and have a look at you, and then just go away.” It was an early November day in 1997 when Ledgerwood took the Shirley B out on the harbour, setting off from Dunedin and heading east towards Port Chalmers to fuel the boat up. At Sawyers Bay, 11km up the harbour, Ledgerwood’s mate, Roy, called out. “‘Oh, Dick. There’s something white in the water back there’,” Ledgerwood recalled. The duo turned the wooden boat towards the frothing commotion in unusually shallow water near a sandbank. Ledgerwood: “It was two sharks wedged close together, and they were just revolving round and round, very, very slowly”. The pair of fisherman, both having spent decades at sea, “had never seen anything like it”. They stopped the boat and stared at two, four-metre sharks “locked together” in just four metres of water. Despite a 30-metre boat approaching, the sharks were “completely preoccupied”, Ledgerwood says, and the Shirley B drifted to within 10 metres of them. “They just carried on with what they were doing,” Ledgerwood says. “They were … locked together, and just revolving in slow circles,” Ledgerwood says, who estimates a full rotation of the sharks took about ten seconds, a movement he described as a “slow revolution”. Their taut grey bodies were pushed closely together, belly to belly, Ledgerwood remembers, “revolving” the entire time: “They were clenched on”. “[They stayed] in one spot. Rolling and rolling and rolling,” “We just drifted up, and they didn’t worry. I mean you wouldn’t, would you?” laughs Ledgerwood. “Well, I wouldn’t.” Ledgerwood said none of the Dunedin old-timers had ever heard of, or witnessed such an event, and many could make no sense of what the ageing fisherman had seen. “I honestly think some people thought we were seeing things, but we definitely weren’t, because we turned back to go and watch, to see what it was.” The New Zealand Department of Conservation’s shark expert Clinton Duffy, calls Ledgerwood’s testimony “interesting and valuable”. However, his team has yet to verify it and says they would need images or video to do that. “I have seen hundreds of great whites and I have certainly never seen anything like mating behaviour between them,” Duffy says. “It’s hard to witness [copulation] for any species of shark. Globally, most of the observations are from aquaria. Great whites are large, highly mobile, and rare, and it really diminishes the chance you’ll be able to observe that in the wild.” Duffy says it is likely great whites choose quiet, out-of-the-way places to mate, away from aggregation sites like seal colonies, which female sharks tend to avoid because there are too many males. “It’s really, really hard to observe,” Duffy says, adding that basking and whale shark mating has also never been seen in the wild, among many other marine animals. “It’s a bit fraught [pointer mating], and it’s dangerous for both sexes. Other sharks can attack the mating couple, or other males can try to mate with the same female,” Duffy says. “The marine environment is still pretty opaque to us.” During copulation, male sharks use claspers to internally fertilise the female, Crawford says. “Clamping down with their razor-sharp teeth in courtship nips on the female’s side. Evolution has kindly provided females with much thicker skin, very likely for this kind of protection, and then navigate through the dance to actually complete the act.” And it is this “dance” that Ledgerwood witnessed in the waters off Sawyers Bay. “There is only one other incidental, distance observation potentially describing this mating phenomenon in all of the scientific literature,” says Crawford. “Going to completion with the kind of ultra-focused copulation spinning that Dick saw – that would be on the very rare side of things.” The first person to report having witnessed great white sex was a Department of Conservation seal observer, also in New Zealand, who saw the phenomenon in Nugget Point, Southland, in 1991. He wrote a brief account of it for the department: “I have unwittingly been fortunate to witness a mating [between two white sharks]. I had thought at the beginning they were fighting as one animal appeared to be attempting to grasp the other with its great mouth, making great gouges in its side. However, they had eventually become motionless, one under the other, turning over from time to time belly to belly. This obvious copulation lasted some forty minutes before the animals finally parted and glided off in opposite directions.” He did not agree to be interviewed by Crawford and his sighting has not been verified by the Department of Conservation. Crawford says Ledgerwood’s account is “vital” to scientists’ understanding of the elusive white pointer, which remain hunted and feared in spite of their protected status. From an ecological perspective, scientists cannot pretend to have a reasonable understanding of any species’ biology if they have never observed mating, Crawford says. “Previous hypotheses have been put forward suggesting that we never see white pointers mating because they go off on some mid-ocean, deep-water migrations that would be difficult if not impossible to follow and observe,” says Crawford. “If it turns out that white pointers actually prefer relatively shallow substrates to copulate on, this would have an enormous effect on our ability to protect these preferred mating habitats, especially during the mating season, from human interference.” Duffy says while the numbers of Australian and New Zealand white pointers remain stable at around 750 animals, some continue to die in the nets of fishing boats, or tangled in shark lines that protect beaches. Globally, their numbers are dwindling, and they are classified as a “vulnerable” species. For Ledgerwood, the experience is one he will never forget. “They were still, y’know, active when we left,” he says.",environment
"Earlier this year, more than 350 elephants mysteriously died in the Okavango delta in Botswana. Individuals of all ages and both sexes were affected, with many walking in circles before dying suddenly, collapsing on their faces. The mass die-off in May and June was described as a “conservation disaster”. Three months later, most surviving elephants have fled. Last week a plane flew over the Okavango Panhandle, an area in the north-west of the delta where most of the deaths occurred, and eight elephants were spotted, when normally you would see hundreds, says Dr Niall McCann, director of conservation at UK-based charity National Park Rescue. “It is understandable, I’m sure you or I would flee if all our friends and relatives were dying, and that’s what the elephants appear to have done.”  Elephants are now reported to have started dying in a similar way in neighbouring Zimbabwe. At the time of writing, 22 have died, with numbers expected to rise. Dr Roy Bengis, retired chief state veterinarian of the Kruger national park, says testing fresh carcasses in Zimbabwe could be an opportunity to understand what happened in Botswana, although it is not clear if there is a link between the two incidents. “Nowhere do we have anything definitive at this stage. Not that I want another elephant to die but it would be so great to be able to get a very fresh carcass,” he says. There have been many competing theories about the cause of the deaths in Botswana. Human-elephant conflicts are common in the Okavango delta, an agricultural area home to 15,000 elephants and 16,000 people, but poisoning or poaching are unlikely to be to blame. Cyanide was ruled out because no scavengers died and tusks were left intact, according to a commentary piece co-authored by Bengis in the African Journal of Wildlife Research. Pesticides and anthrax were tested for and also ruled out. Researchers have been unable to visit the site in Botswana and most samples were collected from animals that had already started rotting. Samples need to be stored under very specific conditions and quickly transported to international labs with specific equipment to be tested – this was not done, resulting in widespread speculation about possible causes. After months of work, scientists have whittled the cause down to two leading theories – neurotoxins in algal blooms or a rodent virus known as EMC (encephalomyocarditis). Local sources estimate that 70% of elephants in Okavango in Botswana died near waterholes, many of which contained blue-green algal blooms. Toxins from algae were initially ruled out as a potential cause because elephants were the only species to die (with the exception of one horse). Now experts think elephants could be more vulnerable to algal bloom toxins because they spend so much time bathing and frolicking in water. Their long trunks also have a large number of olfactory receptors and they can drink hundreds of litres of water a day, potentially exposing them to more toxins than other species. Prof Christine Gosden from the University of Liverpool, who has previously studied the toxicology of chemical warfare, says she felt a responsibility to look into the mysterious deaths after reading the story in the Guardian. Her findings suggest they could be caused by a recently discovered bacterial toxin produced by algae called BMAA (beta-methylamino-L-alanine). She made the link after reading about the similarities between the behaviour of disoriented whales and dolphins that became beached and died (and tested positive for BMAA in their brain), and reports of elephants walking around in circles before collapsing. “They’re large mammals and they’re showing the same sort of behaviour – they’re clearly lost and disoriented,” she says, describing this connection as a “giant clue”. BMAA has also been found in the brain tissue of people with dementia. BMAA is mainly found in marine environments (as opposed to fresh water) and many researchers question whether it is found in high enough concentrations to kill an elephant. It could be part of a cocktail of toxins, says Dr James Metcalf, a senior researcher at Brain Chemistry Labs, a non-profit research institute in Jackson, Wyoming, who has looked at cyanobacteria in Africa. “I would not be surprised to find BMAA in the brains of elephants. It may be a contributing factor, but without the testing it’s really hard to say.” Zebra, wildebeest, white rhinoceros and impala have all died from ingesting toxic algae but there is no literature about elephants dying from neurotoxins in algal blooms. This might be because pathologists and vets do not initially test for cyanobacteria, and once they decide to do so it is often too late because the tissues have deteriorated or the algal blooms have gone. Rising temperatures and intensive farming methods are fuelling an increase in algal blooms in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and seas around the world. Elephants are naive to this potential threat which makes them vulnerable. “There’s lots of interesting evidence slowly building to suggest that environmental exposure to neurotoxins is having more of an impact on species than we realised. And goodness knows what’s happening with people,” says McCann. The fact that the elephant carcasses were close to water holes does not mean water was the source of the poison – frequently sick animals seek out water because they are feverish or thirsty. Farming is widespread on the floodplains of the Okavango delta and this year has seen a bumper crop of maize and sorghum because of late rains in 2020 following a string of dry years. This could have attracted families of elephants to cropland as well an increase in rodents, which defecate and urinate on tufts of grass. This means they would have been in close contact. Most grazers eat the leaf part of grass, but elephants grab grass with their trunk and eat the whole tuft (including rodent faeces), potentially exposing them to the EMC virus. Unlike neurotoxins, EMC is a fairly well-known pathogen that most frequently affects elephants in zoos where there are lots of rats – there have been several cases in US zoos and one in Australia. It caused the death of 64 elephants in Kruger national park between 1993 and 1994. “[In Botswana] there were anecdotal stories that these elephants just dropped stone dead in their tracks – and that fits with EMC. That’s one of the characteristics that we saw in Kruger,” says Bengis. Like neurotoxins that can kill in as little as 20 minutes, EMC is a quick death that causes elephants to collapse on their feet (although it can incubate for for five to 10 days, so elephants can move long distances in that time). The single dead horse could be a clue – not a coincidence – as horses are also vulnerable to EMC. Normally there is a sex bias in deaths from EMC – 83% of elephants that died in Kruger national park were adult males – but this was not the case with the Okavango deaths. “The timing of the mortalities is also of relevance as extensive studies in the Seronga area [in Okavango] have identified the months of February to May as peak crop-raiding months,” researchers wrote in the commentary paper. “Crop raiding is not only carried out by males, but by family units predominantly comprising females and young elephants, which would explain the lack of sex and age bias.” The Botswana government has ruled out EMC because there was no damage or abnormalities found on heart tissue of the animals, but it is not clear how many samples were tested. Authorities have been contacted for comment. Scientists are keen to solve the mystery to help mitigate future deaths in more isolated, less resilient elephant populations which may be unable to withstand the loss of so many individuals. Without proper testing, researchers cannot be certain this is not the start of an epidemic. Awareness about the risk of emerging pathogens and the importance of testing disease outbreaks in wildlife is greater than ever. McCann says: “If this is a toxicity situation then there’s the possibility of it spilling into the human population.” Authorities are being urged to test fresh samples from Zimbabwe as well as rodent faeces and algal blooms in the Okavango delta.

"Infants exposed to even low levels of air pollution experience reduced lung function as children and teenagers, researchers have found. Their study found that exposure to air pollution in the first year of life reduced lung function development from the ages of six to 15, even at pollution levels below EU standards. “This is worrying because it suggests that damage to lungs in the first year of life can affect respiratory health throughout life,” said Dr Qi Zhao of the IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine in Düsseldorf, whose work was presented at the international congress of the European Respiratory Society. The study included 915 children living in the Munich and Wesel regions of Germany. The children had tests to measure theeir breathing power at the ages of six, 10 and 15. The researchers compared the results with estimated levels of pollution in the areas the children had lived until they were one year old. After controlling for factors including parental smoking, the researchers found that the higher the level of pollution exposure as babies, the worse their lung function was as adolescents. The impact was even greater on children who developed asthma. A second study, also presented at the congress, found that adults who were exposed to air pollution, even at low levels, were more likely to develop asthma. In a study of 23,000 Danish nurses, the researchers found a 29% rise in asthma risk for each increase of 6.3 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in small particulate matter known as PM2.5. They also found a 16% rise in asthma risk for each 8.2 µg/m3 increase of nitrogen dioxide. The WHO limit for PM2.5 is an annual average of 10 µg/m3, and the EU limit is 25. Both the WHO and EU limits for nitrogen dioxide are 40 µg/m3. Shuo Liu, a visiting PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen, told the conference: “The fact that we found a link with asthma, even at relatively low levels of exposure, suggests that there is no safe threshold for air pollution. This is strong evidence that our regulations on air pollution need to be stricter if we want to prevent cases of asthma.” Thierry Troosters, president of the European Respiratory Society, said: “These studies are concerning because they suggest that current regulations, such as the EU limit values for air pollution, are not safe enough. Previous research has shown that up to 67,000 cases of childhood asthma could be avoided every year in Europe if countries would meet the World Health Organization air quality limit values, which are lower than the EU’s current standards.” Campaigners in the UK have called on the government to replace the existing EU air quality directive with more stringent legal limits. Zak Bond, a policy officer at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: “We are campaigning for the government to commit to a legal limit for PM2.5 in the environment bill in line with WHO guidelines. It’s time to reduce air pollution so everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.” Chris Large, the joint-CEO at the environmental charity Global Action Plan said: “This research makes it ever clearer that even low levels can have a horrendous impact throughout people’s lives.” “We’d like the government to adopt WHO standards as a bare minimum and reallocate the £27bn set aside for a new road-building programme towards initiatives such as improving broadband quality that reduce the need for road travel.” The clean air campaigner Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: “People are wrong to think everything is OK as long as pollution levels are within legal limits. There’s no such thing as a safe level.” Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of Mums for Lungs, called on the government to “stop dragging its feet and implement binding and enforceable WHO levels in law”. “We cannot compromise on the nation’s health,” she said.",environment
"The Morrison government has proposed lifting a ban on the importation of exotic parrot species into Australia, with experts concerned it could lead to the introduction of diseases and feral pests and an increase in illegal wildlife trade. It has been illegal to import live psittacine birds into Australia since 1995 when a ban was introduced due to concerns about disease. But the government is now considering a change to the rules in response to calls from pet owners, hobbyists and zoos to develop a safe importation pathway for captive parrots. Currently, the only parrots that can be imported are pets from New Zealand whose owners are relocating to Australia permanently. The federal agriculture department has begun public consultation on a risk assessment that considers the potential biosecurity threats of opening Australia’s borders to captive parrots from overseas. Luis Ortiz-Catedral, a conservation biologist at Massey University in New Zealand, has spent years assessing risks to parrot populations. He said he believed it was important to develop a safe pathway for parrots that were companion animals, but the government assessment was missing important detail on what authorities would do to ensure Australia’s wild native parrot populations were not exposed to disease. “There is an intrinsic connection between global trade of these kinds of birds and the spread of novel diseases and pathogens,” Ortiz-Catedral said. “Before going ahead, I think they need to consider the scale of the cost if there were a spillover into wild populations or to facilities in Australia that have captive populations or zoo collections. “I’m not saying it shouldn’t happen, I’m just pointing out the risks that are not properly addressed in the document,” he said. Johanne Martens, an ecologist at Deakin University, said she was concerned control measures weren’t listed for some common parrot diseases, such as beak and feather disease. She said there were several other risks, including that introduced captive parrots could escape and become feral populations that threaten native species and that opening legal imports would also facilitate the illicit trade of animals. “I don’t really see any arguments in favour. I can see why some zoos and wildlife parks might want to get more exotic species but I don’t really see why it’s necessary. We have such an incredible variety of birds here already,” Martens said. Public comment on the draft is open until 19 September. If the feedback is favourable, import conditions will be developed and prospective importers – such as zoos, aviculturists and pet owners – will be able to apply for a permit. A department spokesperson said the rule changes were being considered now because advances in science and testing meant concerns about disease could be managed. Countries with a compliant history of avian trade with Australia – Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States – would be approved for export of captive parrots without the need for further assessment. Other countries that want to export animals would need to apply and be assessed. The spokesperson said only animals that are on a list of species considered suitable for import under Australia’s national environmental laws – such as the blue and yellow macaw – could be imported. The spokesperson said specific control measures had not been considered for beak and feather disease virus because it was endemic to Australia “and not subject to official notification or control”. Applications to import birds would require “evidence that the specimen has been legally sourced”. The federal MP Warren Entsch is a bird lover who has pushed for a safe pathway for parrot imports with record-keeping and health checks. In 2018, he spoke out in a Guardian Australia investigation that revealed the environment department granted permits for the export of hundreds of native Australian birds to the German organisation the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, despite concerns the animals would be sold at a huge profit. He believes the current prohibition on all imports encourages illegal trade. “If anybody has any understanding of wildlife trade, they would understand that the best way to promote illegal trade is prohibition,” he said. But George Olah, a conservation geneticist at Australian National University’s Fenner School, said introducing Australia as a new importer of parrots could boost both legal and illegal forms of trade. “I have worked with the police on some illegal parrot trade cases,” he said. “Breeders often buy poached parrots and make them ‘legal’ by reporting them as [having] hatched in their facilities and giving them CITES (convention on international trade in endangered species) certificates.” Olah said Australia had learnt from past mistakes when it came to biosecurity regulations and the current policy had been put in place after a lot of consideration. He said trade in parrots, as well as other human activities such as habitat destruction, had contributed to their decline in the wild. “I know that many people don’t share this opinion … but as a wildlife researcher, I think people should just not keep any parrots or exotic animals as pets.”",environment
"An unusual series of strandings and sightings of 29 rare beaked whales has taken place around the shores of northern Europe. Experts have suggested the strandings may be linked to a military sonar exercise. The events, whose rarity indicates that they might be linked by a single cause, began two weeks ago with the sighting of two northern bottlenose whales in the North Sea. They are the same species of beaked whale as the Thames whale of 2006. This was followed by seven bottlenoses that stranded, alive, on the west coast of Ireland, the largest stranding of the species recorded in Ireland. Six of the animals died, and one returned to the open sea. A further 11 animals stranded on the Faroe Islands in the past week – reports indicate that five of the whales were killed for their meat. On Friday two bottlenose whales were seen in Oosterschelde estuary in the south of the Netherlands, and on Saturday, at least three beaked whales were seen in the Firth of Clyde, close to Greenock. Over the past 10 days, three Sowerby’s beaked whales have also stranded and died: in the Netherlands, Wenduine in Belgium, and in Lowestoft, where an individual male, believed to be one of a pair seen off the Norfolk coast, was found dead. On Sunday a female Sowerby’s stranded close to Portsmouth in Hampshire, and died soon after. Rob Deaville and Matt Perkins, from the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme of the Zoological Society of London, who are responsible for examining strandings, told the Guardian that the preliminary examination of the Lowestoft animal did not reveal any obvious signs of decompression sickness, but they would be conducting further investigations on this and the whale found near Portsmouth to determine their cause of death. These deep-diving marine mammals can only feed at oceanic depths. Their appearance in shallow coastal waters is rare and often fatal – as in the case of the Thames whale, which died from dehydration after being unable to feed. A diet of squid and fish is the source of fresh water for cetaceans. There are many theories as to why such strandings occur. Storms appear to be a factor, and recent bad weather may have played a part in these events. It seems clear that something causes the whales to enter shallow water. It may be that their navigational sense – still not fully understood – becomes disrupted. A mass stranding of 30 sperm whales on North Sea coasts in 2016 has been linked to unusual solar storms that year which may have interfered with the animals’ sense of direction. But a series of scientific papers have indicated that the use of military sonar and seismic surveys for oil may be to blame. In February this year, an Australian paper found a “strong association” between military exercises using “anti-submarine” mid-frequency active sonar and the deaths of beaked whales. It is thought the sonar may scare the animals into surfacing too quickly, causing decompression sickness – a condition also suffered by human divers when they rise too fast. Earlier this summer a major Nato anti-submarine exercise named Dynamic Mongoose was carried out off Iceland. Although it ended on 10 July, conservationists are concerned that its after-effects may now be being detected in the strandings of the past two weeks. The Dutch whale researcher Jeroen Hoekendijk, who has been monitoring the strandings in the Netherlands, wrote in a blogpost: “It is very likely that the strandings that are reported right now are a direct consequence of the usage of [military] sonar. If so, the beaked whales that we are seeing washed up on our shores could be just the tip of the iceberg.” Beaked whales are perhaps the most mysterious marine mammals. Some species have only been seen alive on a handful of occasions. They are the deepest-diving of all cetaceans – Cuvier’s beaked whales can reach depths of up to 3,000 metres and stay down for two hours hunting their favoured food source, squid. They consume these by sucking the cephalopods; only male beaked whales have teeth: a single pair set at the front of their jaws, which are used in mating challenges, as witnessed by the extensive scarring seen on some beaked whales. These teeth or tusks can arch over the whale’s mouth, sometimes to the extent that they become a muzzle, preventing the animals from completely opening their jaws. Most species of beaked whales are recorded as “data deficient” and their conservation status as “vulnerable”.",environment
"The track north-west of Abney is an old one, a packhorse route linking the village of Bradwell with Ashford and points south. Here it reaches its high point before dropping steeply into Bradwell, an exposed spot, often harsh on a winter’s day and sometimes on a summer’s one as well. I found myself leaning into a strong breeze pushing across the moor, shaking the hairgrass and ruffling the yarrow and selfheal growing prettily against a long drystone wall that bordered the trail and offered me some shelter. Abney Moor is a fine vantage point to consider the endless miles of these “Derbyshire hedges” and how varied they are, in function and form: how in one direction they can seem pleasing and complementary to the landscape, following the rise and fall of steep pasture, like a cast net, and yet in another appear angular and stern, laid ruler-straight with no feel for the ebb and flow of the hillside. Built into the footing of the one next to me were remnants of a medieval cross that once marked the boundary of three parishes, shown on the map as Robin Hood’s Cross, although originally named for a local baron and not the outlaw. Rather than follow the track down to Bradwell, I cut left here along Bleak Knoll, its crest split down the middle for more than half a mile by an unusually high wall, over six feet in places. And along its length every 15 feet or so, roughly a rod in old measures, a small rectangular aperture had been built into its base a few inches off the ground. It must have been the devil to work in so many of these things, and the obvious question was why. Holes in drystone walls have a plethora of names that sometimes explain their purpose: “lunky” is common in some parts of the country, “hogg hole” in others, a hogget being a yearling sheep. But these gaps seemed too narrow for all but the youngest lambs to squeeze through. Wallers might also build in a “smuse” or “smoot” hole for rabbits, to trap them as they passed through or stop them burrowing underneath and weakening the structure. This seemed more likely; 100 years ago, a rabbit farm nearby was supplying a London furrier.",environment
"Polluted air in the UK causes 3m working days to be lost every year owing to people getting sick or taking time off to care for sick children, new research suggests. Cutting air pollution and meeting the World Health Organization standards would benefit the economy by about £1.6bn a year, by improving productivity, according to the analysis carried out by the CBI. About 17,000 premature deaths of working age people each year would be prevented by meeting the guidelines. Workers would also see more pay, with about £900m a year in extra wages from the increased time at work. The £1.6bn economic uplift does not include the reduced costs to the NHS and social care budgets, estimated at £157m a year, which would also result from lower sickness rates. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist of the CBI, said employers and the government should aim for a “green recovery” from the coronavirus crisis, by investing in public transport and energy efficiency. “Not only is there a clear moral responsibility to address air pollution and the impact it has on human health and the environment, there’s also a striking economic rationale,” she said. “With air pollution hitting the balance sheets of businesses across the country, and cutting the earnings of their employees, cleaning up our air would help us to lead healthier and more productive lives, while delivering a green jobs boost for the economy.” The government has been pushing people to get back into the office, following the sharp rise in people working from home during the coronavirus lockdowns, with warnings of job losses if they fail to return. Ministers are motivated by concern over the loss of business to companies, from public transport providers to sandwich shops, that rely on people in offices. Jane Burston, executive director of the Clean Air Fund, which commissioned the report from CBI Economics, said this call could be counterproductive unless the government and local authorities made it easier for people to use cleaner modes of transport. Data compiled by the group found a 25% reduction in NO2 emissions in London during the morning rush hour and a 34% fall at evening commuting times, during the lockdown. “Encouraging people into their cars will increase pollution,” Burston warned. “The government needs to consider that building back the economy is not just about going back to the physical office. The consequences for air pollution are consequences for the economy, and the economic benefits [of reducing air pollution] are significant.” The report found that work absences alone related to poor air were costing Britain about £600m a year, owing to people missing work from poor health but also from taking time off to look after children, who are among the worst affected by air pollution. Jacob West, director of healthcare innovation at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Adopting ambitious World Health Organization guidelines could not only add years to our life, but also benefit the country’s finances. These encouraging figures should give the government confidence to embrace tougher air pollution limits in the environment bill.” The government’s environment bill has been delayed, but is set to return to parliament this autumn. However, as currently written it will not contain new targets on air pollution. Any binding new targets, to take over from the EU’s regulations, will not be set out until late 2022, after a consultation. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The World Health Organization has praised our clean air strategy as an example for the rest of the world to follow, and we continue to take robust and comprehensive action to tackle emissions in the UK. But we know there is more to do, which is why through our landmark environment bill we have committed to setting ambitious targets to improve air quality in the long term, and address the concentration of damaging fine particulate matter.”",environment
"Environment minister Sussan Ley has moved to revoke the export of shark fins and other seafood products from a Queensland government fishery over inaction on reforms to protect threatened species. Ley has written to Queensland’s fisheries minister, Mark Furner, saying the state had not met the conditions of its export licence for the East Coast Inshore Fin Fish Fishery, which would be revoked from 30 September. Conservationists and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have voiced concerns that threatened species including turtles, dolphins and dugongs are at risk of being killed in nets in the fishery. The fishery targets species including barramundi, flathead and whiting for sale domestically and operates both in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. But under an export licence granted by the federal environment minister, fishers also export products – mainly shark fins, mullet roe and the valuable swim bladders of black jewfish used in traditional Chinese medicine. One conservationist told Guardian Australia that revocation of an export licence – known as a Wildlife Trade Operation – was extremely rare. In the letter, Ley wrote: “It is deeply disappointing that the reforms underpinning these conditions have stalled and momentum has been lost in progress towards the sustainable management of this fishery.” Domestic trade from the fishery is exempt from the minister’s intervention, but the letter said the decision “will impact on those fishing businesses that export product from the [fishery]”. “I expect this will exacerbate the already difficult operating environment for those fishers who are affected. Therefore I suggest the Queensland government will need to consider how it could ameliorate those impacts,” Ley wrote. Separately, the environment minister told Guardian Australia that exports must comply with sustainability requirements. “If we are going to have sharks killed for fins or black jewfish targeted for their swim bladders to make cosmetics or as an aphrodisiac used in Chinese medicine, at the very least it needs to done in a way that complies with the sustainability requirements that the Queensland government itself negotiated and agreed to, as a condition of its WTO approval,” Ley said. As Guardian Australia reported last week, conservationists and some recreational fishing groups claim the reforms across all Queensland’s fisheries have stalled. Some recreational fishers have walked away from reform working groups in frustration at a lack of progress. Guardian Australia also reported the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority had highlighted how the use of large mesh nets in the fishery was a high risk to threatened species “due to potential entanglements and death”. Pressure from under-regulated fishing risked compromising the reef, which was already facing “unprecedented pressure”, the authority said. Global heating has driven three mass coral bleaching events in the past five years across the world’s biggest reef system. The marine park authority said it also had concerns for the future sustainability of black jewfish – prized for their swim bladders. The export licence was granted in December 2018 with conditions and timeframes, including four that Ley said had not been implemented in time. Those included having in place an independent data collection and validation program, rules to better monitor shark catch, a plan to prevent ecological impacts and harvest strategies that also included impacts on protected species. In the letter, Ley said actions needed to have been in place by January 2020 – well before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. She urged Queensland to “demonstrate compliance” as soon as possible so that exports could restart. Lawyers representing the conservation group Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) wrote to the minister in February asking her to investigate compliance issues. Ley said AMCS and WWF-Australia had both raised concerns about the fisheries export licence. Tooni Mahto, a fisheries and threatened species campaigner at AMCS, said it was “incredibly rare” for a minister to revoke an export licence. “This is strong action from the minister, but it is a fair reflection of the Queensland government’s failure to do what it committed to in 2018, and also to do what’s expected by recreational fishers, conservationists and the Queensland community. “The reforms should have delivered protection for reef wildlife – our turtles, dolphins and dugongs are drowning in these nets in the reef and at the moment there’s poor control in limiting the number of wildlife deaths.” In a statement, Queensland fisheries minister Mark Furner acknowledged receipt of Ley’s letter and was “considering our response”. He said the government was committed to its sustainable fisheries reforms and significant steps had been taken to ensure a sustainable commercial and recreational fishing industry “for generations to come”.",environment
"The partial skull of an armoured fish that swam in the oceans over 400m years ago could turn the evolutionary history of sharks on its head, researchers have said. Bony fish, such as salmon and tuna, as well as almost all terrestrial vertebrates, from birds to humans, have skeletons that end up made of bone. However, the skeletons of sharks are made from a softer material called cartilage – even in adults. Researchers have long explained the difference by suggesting that the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates had an internal skeleton of cartilage, with bony skeletons emerging after sharks had already evolved. The development was thought so important that living vertebrates are divided into “bony vertebrates” and “cartilaginous vertebrates” as a result. Among other evidence for the theory, the remains of early fish called placoderms – creatures with bony armour plates that also formed part of the jaws – shows they had internal skeletons made of cartilage.  But a startling new discovery has upended the theory: researchers have found the partial skull-roof and brain case of a placoderm composed of bone. The fossil, about 410m years old and reported in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, was unearthed in western Mongolia in 2012, and belongs to a placoderm that has been dubbed Minjinia turgenensis and would have been about 20-40cm in length.  “This fossil is probably the most surprising thing I have ever worked on in my career. I never expected to find this,” Dr Martin Brazeau of Imperial College London, first author of the research, said. “We know a lot about [placoderm] anatomy and we have hundreds of different species of these things – and none of them has ever shown this kind of bone.”  The new discovery, he said, casts doubt on the idea that sharks branched off the evolutionary tree of jawed vertebrates before a bony internal skeleton evolved. “This kind of flips it on its head, because we never expected really for there to be a bony internal skeleton this far down in the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates,” said Brazeu. “This is the type of thing [that suggests] maybe we need to rethink a lot about how all of these different groups evolved.” While the team say that one possibility is that bony skeletons could have evolved twice – once giving rise to the newly discovered placoderm species and once to the ancestor of all living bony vertebrates – a more likely possibility is that an ancestor of sharks and bony vertebrates actually had a bony skeleton, but that at some point in their evolutionary history the ability to make bone was lost in sharks. Brazeau said the new findings add weight to the idea that the last common ancestor of all modern jawed vertebrates did not resemble “some kind of weirdo shark”, as is often depicted in text books. Instead, he said, such an ancestor more likely resembled a placoderm or primitive bony fish. Dr Daniel Field, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work, welcomed the findings. “Evolutionary biologists were long guided by the assumption that the simplest explanation – the one that minimised the number of inferred evolutionary changes – was most likely to be correct. With more information from the fossil record, we are frequently discovering that evolutionary change has proceeded in more complex directions than we had previously assumed,” he said. “The new work by Brazeau and colleagues suggests that the evolution of the cartilaginous skeleton of sharks and their relatives surprisingly arose from a bony ancestor – adding an extra evolutionary step and illustrating that earlier hypotheses were overly simplistic.” ",environment
"Toxic pesticides banned for use in the UK are being exported to countries with less stringent regulations, under loopholes in international trade rules. Two companies, Syngenta and Ineos, are exporting from UK facilities large quantities of pesticides based on chemicals that would be illegal for use in the EU, according to documents obtained by Greenpeace UK’s Unearthed investigation and the Swiss NGO Public Eye, in freedom of information requests. Export notification data for 2018 showed Syngenta planned to ship more than 28,000 tonnes of pesticide containing paraquat, which was banned for use in the UK in 2007. Paraquat, which is fatal at small doses if ingested, can damage the lungs, eyes, kidneys and heart through long-term exposure. Inovyn, a subsidiary of the chemicals firm Ineos, made export notifications for 4,000 tonnes of the soil fumigant 1,3-dichloropropene, a suspected carcinogen banned in the EU because of the risks it poses to wildlife and groundwater. The UK was responsible for about 40% of the exports of these and similar products from the EU in 2018, the year to which the documents apply. While exporting these products is legal, despite the restrictions on their use in Europe, campaigners want the practice banned because of the likely harm to the importing countries. Baskut Tuncak, who from 2014 to 2020 was the UN’s special rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, said: “The UK must urgently end the export of paraquat and 1,3-dichloropropene. These pesticides are among the worst of the worst, unquestionably hazardous to human health.” In July, Tuncak and 35 experts from the Human Rights Council called for an end to such exports from rich nations to the developing world. France is enacting a ban, which will come into force from 2022, but other countries have been reluctant to place constraints on their industries. Some of the pesticides are destined for developing countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, India and Indonesia. Large amounts are also sold to rich nations: the US and Australia buy quantities of paraquat, according to the data, and Japan takes paraquat and 1,3-dichloropropene. “Just because a country is wealthy does not mean there are not grave human rights violations and abuses being committed against vulnerable communities,” said Tuncak. “In the US, where three times more pesticide products are registered for use, farmworkers suffer more chemical-related injuries and illnesses than any other workforce. The racial dimension can not be ignored, with so many agricultural and food workers from migrant and minority backgrounds.” Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said selling the pesticides was “exploitative hypocrisy” and urged ministers to end the practice. “The UK is at the heart of a European pesticide scandal that allows chemical giants to flood other countries – many of them poorer nations – with toxic chemicals on a major scale,” he said. “These pesticides are so dangerous that we’ve made the very sensible decision to ban their use in our own country and across Europe. What gives us the right to think it is morally defensible to continue producing and shipping them around the world?” Other European countries are also exporting thousands of tonnes of pesticides that would be disqualified for use in Europe. In terms of EU law, companies exporting certain substances must notify governments under a rule known as the prior informed consent regulation, overseen by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which provides a list of the exports. According to the agency’s latest report, from last December, the UK, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain together exported 9,016 tonnes of 1,3-dichloropropene, and the amount of paraquat and the herbicide trifluralin exported by the UK, Spain and Italy amounted to 15,983 tonnes. Greenpeace said its data differed from that published by the EU because it came from export notifications, so it was not certain that the exact amounts intended to be sent abroad were exported, while the ECHA data bundled together different chemicals for various purposes. A spokesperson for Ineos told the Guardian its 1,3-dichloropropene was exported under licence only to Japan, through the ECHA’s prior informed consent procedure, and that it was the most effective product against plant disease from nematodes (roundworms), helping to protect important food crops. “Japanese authorities approve the licensed import to ensure that they have all relevant details for the product relating to its safety, use and regulation,” the spokesperson said. “It is important to note that the product is still used within the EU in countries such as France, Spain and Italy where there is infestation of crops, under emergency procedures subject to national approvals. It is widely used in many other countries other than Japan and the EU.” A spokesperson for Syngenta said: “The crop protection industry is one of the most highly regulated in the world, with products subject to extensive evaluation before they are approved for registration and sale. To be exported and sold, any finished product needs to comply with the specific regulatory requirements of the importing countries. “The US is an example of one of these export locations. Paraquat has been subject to detailed scientific review and evaluation by the US Environmental Protection Agency over many years and it has been found to be safe and appropriate for use. We comply with the rule of law wherever we operate.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Decisions on the use of pesticides are based on careful scientific assessment of the risks, and this will not change after the [Brexit] transition period. We will continue to ensure our high human health and environmental standards are maintained as we implement our own independent pesticides regulatory regime. Chemicals currently banned will not become eligible for use in Great Britain.”",environment
"Across the sands of Traeth Bach, rearing above the Aber Iâ peninsula, Yr Wyddfa – the topmost peak of Snowdon – donned its habitual cloud cap. Arctic blasts of air wuthered across my evening perch on sea-wall rocks. A neap tide ran fiercely. Waders left off from feeding along its margins and scudded before the flood to roosts among the myriad of muddy inlets of Traeth Las. Oystercatchers, brilliant orange Pinocchio beaks and pied plumage catching the light, piped away upriver. The ice-polished crown of Ynys Gifftan reflected the sun dipping beneath the spreading cloudof an incoming front. I shivered, packed my rucksack, and turned for home. By the level crossing, I ducked into a thicket that made me think of Hardy’s “wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward” (The Voice), and plucked one of its heavy crop of purple fruits, biting through the skin’s bloom into bracingly bitter pale green flesh. I’ll go down there again soon with a bag and, rather than waiting for the first frost, will put the sloes in the freezer to make a winter favourite, sloe gin. But winter’s still months away. Now is the cusp of autumn, the air swarming with insects and the flutter-and-glide of house martins in pursuit of them. The swifts departed weeks ago, heading for Africa. I remember crawling through low caves in limestone cliffs at Mirleft on Morocco’s Atlantic coast with these strange members of the Apodidae – close relatives of the hummingbirds – shrieking through alongside. Next went the swallows, driven from Welsh coasts by gales before they’d even gathered on the wires. With their brilliant colours and graceful flight, these are the birds of summer I miss most. By now they’ll be streaming through the Pyrenean passes. Once, dropping down to the Ariège valley from the Pays de Sault, I saw them as a dark innumerable flow, at first below and then above, by Tarascon, where I was heading. Dr Johnson’s 1768 speculation – not founded on empirical observation – was that they “conglobulate” before plunging together, joined at claw and beak, beneath the surface of rivers to hibernate in mud at the bottom. It becomes almost plausible when they disappear as quickly and entirely as they did this year.",environment
"Ministers and MPs from all parts of the political spectrum have condemned Extinction Rebellion for blocking the delivery of newspapers across the UK on Saturday. Four national newspapers, including the Sun and the Daily Mail, were missing from some newsagents’ shelves on Saturday morning after more than 100 environmental protesters targeted printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp on Friday evening. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said: “A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public’s access to news in this way.” On Saturday morning, the Labour MP Dawn Butler tweeted “Bravo Extinction Rebellion”, but subsequently deleted it. The Labour party’s official line, which followed, read: “A free press is vital for our democracy. People have the right to read the newspapers they want. Stopping them from being distributed and printers from doing their jobs is wrong.” Protesters used trucks and bamboo scaffolds to block roads outside the Newsprinters works at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, on Friday night. The presses print the Sun, Times, Sun on Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and the London Evening Standard. Banners reading “Free The Truth” and “5 Crooks Control Our News” were hung on the site. By Saturday morning, police said about 72 activists had been arrested. A blockade in Glasgow was cleared at around midnight with no arrests. In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said the action was designed to disrupt and expose what it called a failure to adequately report on the climate emergency: “Our free press, society and democracy is under attack – from a failing government that lies to us consistently … Our leaders have allowed the majority of our media to be amassed in the hands of five people with powerful vested interests and deep connections to fossil fuel industries. We need a free press but we do not have it. They have failed us.” A former tabloid journalist, Steve Tooze, said he had joined the action at Broxbourne to support “one day with far less misinformation, division and hate”. Tooze, who said he had worked “for every one of these newspapers in the last 25 years”, had locked his arm into a concrete tube. “I feel that as a former insider, [these newspapers] hold a huge amount of blame for what we’re fed today by not telling the public what is really happening,” he said. “If it’s not in the newspapers, people don’t worry about it and, if people don’t worry about it, there’s no pressure on this government to treat this as the emergency it is.” But Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said the action would be “laughable if it wasn’t so serious”. “Everyone has the right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard: after all, that is what a free press is all about,” he said. “But it is not acceptable for those who wish only their voices to be heard to attempt to silence others.” A spokesperson for Guardian News & Media, parent company of the Observer, said: “We fully support the right to protest – but we do not condone any action that restricts the public’s right to access journalism and buy whichever newspaper they choose.” While Extinction Rebellion has largely enjoyed the support of David Attenborough, in an article on Saturday he said it was not “sensible politics” for environmental protesters to break the law. Attenborough, Britain’s most celebrated naturalist, praised the younger generation for their passion but said: “I don’t think it is sensible politics to break the law. If you are any good at all, some of your demands will be met and then you will be demanding people abide by those new laws. You can’t have it both ways.” But his article, which highlighted the climate emergency, may not have been widely read – it was in one of the newspapers that Extinction Rebellion targeted, the Sun.",environment
"Consumers are being exposed to an “avoidable risk” of disease after a reduction of official controls in food inspections of pig and poultry carcasses across the EU, European meat inspectors have said. Diseased meat is being eaten by consumers in the UK and EU, including pus from abscesses and tuberculosis lesions from pigs’ heads, said the European Working Community for Food Inspection and Consumer Protection (EFWFC) this week. The EWFC represents EU meat inspectors. In response to the claim, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the regulations for food safety had been developed to prevent meat that could be diseased or contaminated from reaching consumers. “If the FSA was aware of any breaches of these regulations it would be treated very seriously and we would take immediate action in response,” said a spokesperson. Ron Spellman, EWFC’s deputy secretary, said inspections should ensure that no carcass showing signs of disease entered the food chain, but that there had been an erosion of safety rules in the past decade. He highlighted changes in pig inspections by the European Commission in 2014, which moved from a thorough inspection to visual only. “Inspectors stopped cutting lymph nodes in pigs’ heads, which are known to contain abscesses and tuberculosis lesions. Under previous systems, the pigs’ head would have been rejected for food, but now the meat is minced to make sausages and meat pies, spreading the pus from the abscesses and TB material throughout these products. “I don’t think you can prove it’s safe to feed people abscesses, pus and TB material.” A spokesperson for the FSA said all pig heads were inspected visually. “If any of the lymph nodes is enlarged or abnormal, or there is any other reason to suspect that TB or any other infection might be present, then the nodes can also be incised to verify whether there are any lesions to confirm the suspicion. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) noted that routine incisions on all pigs heads without first relying on evidence or other reasons leads to cross-contamination between carcasses that is better avoided.” The EWFC is calling for food safety regulations at slaughterhouses to be “re-evaluated in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic”, and is also calling on the EU commission to reverse 2019 changes to poultry inspections that move away from 100% postmortem inspections, allowing for an official inspection of a “representative sample” if the abattoir has a history of food safety compliance and has a system to detect contamination and diseased meat. A spokesperson from the Food Standards Agency says: “Meat from healthy livestock prepared in accordance with good safety principles remains safe to eat. Although several animal species have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, these infections are not a driver of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The European commission based its decision to move away from postmortem inspections on scientific opinion that food-poisoning bacteria including campylobacter are not detected by visual meat inspection, and that carcasses visually contaminated by faeces are not more microbiologically contaminated than those not. The EWFC said these studies did not replicate EU slaughterhouse conditions and were flawed, pointing to a study that shows that carcasses contaminated with visible faecal spots carry significantly higher concentrations of harmful bugs than visibly clean carcasses and that postmortem checks to remove these are crucial. “There’s been a coordinated move away from meat inspections carried out by independent officials to a system where slaughterhouses get more control over that process, so they’re carrying out more of their own inspections,” said Spellman. “These changes are motivated not by science or a desire to protect the consumer but are politically motivated to give the meat industry what they want: the reductions and eventual removal of official independent meat inspection.” A spokesperson for the European commission said: “The European Union retains some of the highest food safety standards in the world – this is a key priority. This is why the European Food Safety Authority provides expert scientific advice and recommendations while national authorities are responsible to carry out inspections in accordance with the official controls legislation. “Any meat with lesions indicating an animal disease such as TB, or abscesses, or any pathological or organoleptic changes, must be considered as unfit for human consumption and not be placed on the market.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"It is a long time since images of a smoggy Beijing were in the news. India now leads the World Health Organization’s (WHO) league table of polluted cities. A new study shows that annual deaths from air pollution in China peaked in 2013 and are now below 1990 levels. Concerted action reduced particle pollution in 74 key Chinese cities by an average of 33% between 2013 and 2017. Industry and traffic were cleaned up and tackling fuels used at home played a big role too. In 2005, 61% of Chinese homes cooked using coal or wood. This reduced to 32% in 2017. Around Beijing coal heating was banned in favour of fossil (natural) gas, and clean energy was promoted countrywide. However, about 1.25 million Chinese people still die early each year as a result of air pollution. In 2005, the WHO set global guidelines for particle pollution and interim targets for countries to gauge progress. Today, the air breathed by 81% of China’s population has yet to meet the first interim target. Controlling air pollution is hard. Other countries can learn from China’s experience and avoid using fossil fuels, especially coal, to power their industrial development. ",environment
"Australian conservation groups have written to the UN’s peak environmental heritage body urging it to oppose the Coalition’s bid to devolve the approval process for projects to state and territory governments. In a letter to the director general of Unesco, the 13 groups warn of the “alarming moves … to weaken legal protection for Australia’s 20 world heritage listed properties” through changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. In an interim report on the EPBC Act released in July, Graeme Samuels found the laws to protect unique species and habitats were ineffective. Despite the findings, the Morrison government has proposed legislation to allow bilateral agreements with the states and territories to give them control over planning approvals as a means to cut approval times and spur economic growth. The bill to streamline environmental approvals was rushed through the lower house on Thursday after debate was gagged, and despite concerns it does not contain promised environmental standards and could increase extinctions. The letter, signed by groups including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Environmental Justice Australia, the Wilderness Society and WWF Australia, warns that Australia’s natural world heritage sites are “under more pressure from industrialisation and climate change than ever before”. It listed threats to world heritage areas including: The groups warn against handing national development approval powers to state and territory governments “without any safeguards in place”. “This is of grave concern because state and territory governments are often the proponents of these threatening developments and activities or have policies that encourage and fast-track them.” The groups asked the director general, Audrey Azoulay, to write to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, to “express alarm” about the bill and “seek clarification on how the Australian government will meet its international responsibilities under the world heritage convention”. “The Australian government must not walk away from its responsibilities to protect and conserve world heritage.” Australia’s responsibilities under the convention are to identify, protect, conserve and transmit to future generations its world heritage sites. Labor has resolved to oppose the EPBC Act changes, the Greens have pushed to refer them to an inquiry, and independent MP Zali Steggall attempted to amend the bill to require state deals to conform with national environmental standards to be drawn up by the minister. ACF’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Australia’s world heritage areas were home to “threatened wildlife like the koala, the cassowary and the grey-headed flying fox, but the plan to hand environmental powers to states and territories would make these species and their habitats more vulnerable than ever”. The Environmental Justice Australia co-chief executive, Nicola Rivers, said weakening protections would send a “shocking message that one of the wealthiest nations can’t manage to safeguard its 20 world heritage sites”. Suzanne Milthorpe, national laws campaign manager at the Wilderness Society, said: “It’s clear protections for Australia’s globally unique natural and cultural heritage are sorely lacking and we’re looking to the Morrison government to demonstrate that it is willing and able to address these shortcomings.”The other signatories to the letter were the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Birdlife Australia, the Bob Brown Foundation, the Colong Foundation for Wilderness, Fight For Our Reef, Humane Society International Australia, Protect Ningaloo, Queensland Conservation Council and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust.",environment
"Ayub Amin Jat treats his camels like his children. But then his camels are no ordinary ungulates: they are a unique breed of camels that swim. Amin Jat’s semi-nomadic ancestors have kept these camels in the Indian state of Gujarat for hundreds of years. Known as kharai camels, their name is derived from the local word khara, meaning saline. During the rainy season, they swim along the Gulf of Kutch, an inlet of the Arabian Sea, to small forest islands and graze on mangroves and other saline-loving plants. Their gently padded hooves help them navigate the wet and salty coastal land with ease and they can swim up to three kilometres (1.8 miles). Immediately after grazing, they drink the rainwater collected in the depressions of the islands. When there isn’t enough water, the herders take them to neighbouring villages to feed them. But kharai camels are disappearing. Although exact numbers are hard to find – kharai camels were only recognised as a separate breed in 2015 – local nonprofit Sahjeevan estimates that there were more than 10,000 in Gujarat about a decade ago. Now there are fewer than 4,500. Rapid industrialisation in the mangrove swamps and erratic rainfall are destroying the habitat kharai camels rely on for food, and pushing this unique breed to extinction, warn conservationists. “My ancestors gave me these camels,” says Amin Jat, 53. “They are like my kids. How can I see them die in front of my eyes?” Herders and local conservationists point to the activities of the many salt companies in the mangrove swamps. The companies create salt pans by restricting the entry of tidal water in the mangroves. This dries up the plants and eventually kills them. Power plants, ports and other industries are also responsible for the loss of the camels’ habitat, Sahjeevan says. “These companies create mud walls, locally known as bunds, around a portion of land which blocks the tidal water. Without the water, the mangroves die a slow death, making it easier for the machines to uproot them,” says Mahendra Bhanani, camel programme coordinator at Sahjeevan. “One company plundered over 4 sq km of mangrove cover for over a month like this in 2018.” The salt companies argue that they bring development and jobs to an area that is nothing more than wasteland. “The land allotted to us is saline wasteland, on which nothing can grow,” says Bharat Raval, president of the Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association, which represents more than 60 companies. “There may be a few defaulters but they are very small in number.” G A Thivakaran, a scientist at Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology who specialises in coastal and marine ecology, says that some companies have been going out of their way to get land declared wasteland. “Until about two decades ago, industries were rampantly destroying mangroves. In 2011, the government framed stricter laws and limited development in mangrove areas. But then the companies found a new workaround. They would block the tidal creek, leading the mangrove to die a natural death in about a year. The land would then be declared a wasteland and [could] easily be claimed by industries,” he says.  The Indian government has taken notice of the camels’ decline and in 2015 designated them endangered. “Health camps” for the camels were set up, and nonprofit organisations were given funds to provide breeding and veterinary support to herders. In September last year, herders also won a reprieve from India’s National Green Tribunal, which handles environmental disputes. It asked the Gujarat authorities to check any kind of obstruction in the flow of tidal creeks, and restore mangroves. It also warned against any kind of salt manufacturing activity in certain areas. But herders say their fight to protect the mangroves is ongoing. “It’s a constant struggle. We get one company removed, another one comes up within a week,” says Bhanani. “It’s like perpetual hide-and-seek.” According to India’s forest department, the mangrove cover in Gujarat has, in fact, risen from 1,140 sq km in 2017 to 1,177 sq km in 2019. But the camels are not allowed to graze on the department-owned land, Amin Jat says. “The animal husbandry land is being allotted to companies and the forest department people shoo us away from their land. Where do we go?” Thivakaran says that while the camels trample on the plants, they cannot be held responsible for the depletion of the mangrove cover. “It’s the industries [that are responsible]. Camels and mangroves have coexisted for generations. Moreover, kharai camels mostly graze on sparse or degraded mangroves.” Erratic rainfall in the region compounds the problem. Kutch has a variable rainfall and is hit by drought about every three years. “Because of the salt content in the mangroves, the camels immediately need to drink water after grazing. So low rainfall spells a crisis for us,” says Amin Jat. “We don’t need big buildings. We just need food and clean water for our animals.” Local nonprofits have been lobbying hard against increasing industrialisation in the area but are also working to persuade herders to start selling camel milk as a source of income. Traditionally the community has been averse to the idea of selling camel milk or wool. According to Amin Jat, a revered spiritual leader once discouraged the practice and advised herders to give away the products to anyone who asks. “But of late, many people have started selling the milk to sustain themselves,” he says, sitting in his wooden hut in a village in Kutch as his nephew, Hamir Bhachu Jat, serves us camel milk tea in wide-mouthed steel bowls. Local people believe that the milk of kharai camels is beneficial in the treatment of tuberculosis, diabetes and cancer. “Our people don’t get any major diseases,” Bhachu Jat says. “This milk is medicinal. My uncle sometimes goes without food for as many as five days during his trips to the islands, only surviving on camel milk.” Amin Jat has never had a permanent home. His family typically moves three times a year in search of grazing grounds for their camels. He belongs to the pastoralist community of Fakirani Jats, whose primary occupation has traditionally been camel breeding. Wherever they settle, the women of the family build houses made of reed grass, jute ropes and wood called pakkhas. They mostly use camels to carry their belongings during their migratory tours but, occasionally, sell off a male camel to sustain them through several months. But Amin Jat is not optimistic about the future. “If they don’t stop the industries soon, I will send my camels to a slaughterhouse,” he says.  “The camels’ extinction would not just be an ecological loss but also a cultural one,” Bhanani laments. “It would fundamentally alter the pastoral lifestyle of the Fakirani Jats and other nomadic communities in the region. Younger male members in their families are migrating to cities and seeking jobs to sustain themselves. Interestingly, some are employed by the same companies that are destroying their camels’ habitat.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",environment
"The summer boom may be over but there are still insects feeding from the sea hollies in my garden. There’s nectar in their steely grey tops though the lower flowerheads are browning and going to seed. White-tailed bumblebees work fast, probing the tiny clusters of five flowers, interspersed with spiny barbs, that are rhythmically arranged in tall domes. This is Eryngium giganteum, also known as Miss Willmott’s Ghost, which is named after Ellen Willmott, an early guerrilla gardener who left a trail of seeds in the gardens she visited. I’ve seen the native wild eryngo, E maritimum, growing in the gravels of the north Norfolk coast. A shorter plant, its flowers are metallic blue and burr-shaped and, like my garden variety, protected by a silver ruff of viciously spiked bracts. Sea hollies are actually umbellifers and, like so many of the apiaceae, very attractive to insects, in this case to wasps in particular. Hoverflies are now zipping between the flowers and a small copper butterfly is sunning itself in the cup of a pale bract. The sharply spined leaves are sheltering the plump button of a strawberry snail. A spider has anchored its nest to flowers and stems, linking the tops of the sea hollies in a seemingly random series of fine threads. Wisps of thistledown and grass seeds are caught in this chaotic criss-cross mesh. Inside the cat’s cradle of spiderweb is a darker shape, a fleecy rolled-up swaddle blanket studded with shiny petrol-blue fragments of bluebottle, the husk of a wasp. Within this spun chamber is a blue egg-sac from which has emerged a mass of tiny spiderlings with pale olive legs and little round bodies. The mother has long thin legs with dark knee joints, her rotund body a symmetry of brown white and black markings. She’s a mothercare spider, Theridion sisyphium, feeding her young on regurgitated food until they are large enough to share her meals. When she dies, they will eat her body before they venture out across my garden. Frost will pick out the shapes of the sea hollies, the wind will tatter them and in spring when I’m gardening I will find the lacy and beautiful skeletons of their bracts.",environment
"In these troubled times there comes a point where we all need to let off steam. For this huge geyser in Yellowstone park, the moment was now and the eruption was spectacular, after a six-year wait. But, for the rest of us, watching this natural phenomenon is strangely meditative and beautifully distracting from much of the bad news around, despite the violent geothermal forces propelling it. Giantess Geyser spouted for the first time in more than six years in Yellowstone National Park, which straddles part of Wyoming and a little of Montana, on 25 August, according to the US National Park Service (NPS). “She” has more typically erupted between twice and six times a year in the past, according to the NPS website, and blasts a spout up to 200ft high. “The surrounding area may shake from underground steam explosions just before the initial water and/or steam eruptions,” the NPS website adds. Giantess is one of the biggest geysers in the park, alongside phenomena such as the super-tall Steamboat geyser, the largest active geyser in the world, and the park’s most famous, Old Faithful, renowned for its punctual regularity as it soars from the ground about 20 times a day. Colorful hot spring features in the park include the blue-hued Morning Glory Pool and the psychedelic Grand Prismatic spring, as well as whiffy, sulfurous bubblers and roiling natural pots of scalding hot water fizzing out of the rocks. The features are among more than 10,000 hot springs and geysers in the park, a Unesco world heritage site.",environment

Chickens that cannot be slaughtered for food are usually gassed with CO2 and their bodies rendered for fat and other animal byproducts. They do not enter the food chain. The UK rears and slaughters about 20 million birds a week, according to the British Poultry Council (BPC). About 95% are chickens and the majority are processed through a few large slaughterhouses, each with a capacity of about 2 million birds a week. Production loss at even one large slaughterhouse can have significant impacts along the food chain and create welfare problems, the BPC said.Millions of US farm animals were culled on-farm earlier this summer after the closure of meat plants because of coronavirus outbreaks among staff that cut the country’s slaughtering capacity for cows and pigs by 25% and 40% respectively. In England, about half of the staff at Banham Poultry in Norfolk have had to self-isolate after 75 staff tested positive for coronavirus. The plant plans “to humanely cull 300,000 birds using a gas system”, said its director, Blaine Van Rensburg, in a statement.Asked about the risk of further culls, Rensburg said: “Given we don’t know how long this current situation will last, we won’t be speculating on how many others will need to be humanely culled.” Rensburg denied earlier reports that Banham had culled about 7,000 birds. “No birds have been culled at our site to date,” he said. “We are already diverting a quarter of a million birds to other suppliers and will continue to do so where possible.” In Scotland, a statement from poultry slaughterer Coupar Angus, which is owned by the 2 Sisters Food Group, confirmed that 110,000 birds had been culled. The slaughterhouse kills “almost one million chickens a week and is the only facility of its type in Scotland,” it said. There are two standard methods for gas poultry culls in the UK: whole house gassing and containerised gassing. The first involves filling the sheds where chickens live with CO2. The second involves putting the birds in specialised containers that are brought to the farm. The containers are filled with CO2 and sometimes other gasses such as argon. “Whole house slaughter is very rare, the sheds are not designed for it,” said Penny Middleton, the poultry policy manager at the National Farmers Union Scotland. “The containerised option is more controllable and would be done by someone like Livetec Systems, an approved depopulator, according to welfare regulations,” she said. No one interviewed would comment on how long gassed chickens take to die, other than to say it was legal and humane.The Coupar Angus statement said the chickens were “humanely dispatched in line with legislation” and that culls were supervised by the government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency and an independent veterinary officer. The statement said that although last week’s Covid-19 related decision to “cease production has brought many upsetting consequences” it managed “to successfully process the large majority of birds from Scotland” by sending them to other slaughterhouses in its UK network. The factory was due to reopen on Monday and no further culls are expected, it said. Middleton said the Coupar Angus plant reopening might take a while to get up to full speed, but that she was not expecting any further culls in Scotland. Peter Stevenson, a policy advisor with UK welfare organisation Compassion in World Farming, said the culls highlighted a food system failure. “Today’s chickens have been bred to grow so quickly that if they are left to continue growing after reaching their slaughter weight, many will become so lame they can barely walk, while others will die of heart disease.” The BPC’s chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said in a statement that because UK poultry processing was so efficient, with little spare capacity, losing a large slaughterhouse “will not only interrupt our national food supply, create shortages and job losses at a time when we can least afford it, but also result in bird welfare challenges on a significant scale”/ He said coronavirus outbreaks at meat plants demonstrated “that no amount of preparation and vigilance can guarantee complete protection against Covid-19. We have to prioritise the health of people in our community, but we also need to safeguard food supply and the welfare of our animals”. The BPC was working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) “and other relevant authorities to ensure reasonable steps are put in place to minimise welfare issues and maintain food supply”, he said. “We must ensure that poultry meat plants compromised by a Covid-19 outbreak are able to maintain throughput where possible, even if it means having skeleton staff onsite.” Defra did not confirm chicken cull numbers but said birds “would be culled using gas … in line with the rules on protecting animal welfare at the time of killing.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Sewage sludge containing human waste from the Netherlands has been passed for import to the UK, to be used on farmland as fertiliser, despite concerns over the safety of its use. Spreading the sludge on farmland is banned in the Netherlands, where incineration is preferred, but allowed in the UK. Dutch water authorities are eyeing the UK as a possible destination for their sewage, after problems at an Amsterdam incineration company left them lacking disposal options. A permit for the shipment of 27,500 tonnes of municipal sewage sludge was issued in February by the UK’s Environment Agency, according to a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Greenpeace’s Unearthed investigative unit and seen by the Guardian. The sludge is listed as coming from the Amstel, Gooi and Vecht water board but the identity of the recipient in the UK has been redacted. The permit is valid until February. It is legal in the UK to use sewage sludge on farmland but it must be first treated and then applied under strict regulations. However, the Environment Agency has raised concerns that the regulations are not always followed. In November 2017, the Environment Agency had a report drawn up that listed potential problems for human health from using sewage on farmland, including the presence of pathogens such as E coli and salmonella, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals and microplastics.  It also found the supply chain handling sewage from its origins to its destination on fields was “convoluted”, which raised the possibility of abuse of the regulations and contamination of farmland. Alistair Boxall, a professor in environmental science at the University of York, said Dutch sewage was unlikely to be any worse than that from the UK, but the government was not doing enough to ensure that sewage spread on fields was safe. “The government is doing very little to understand what harm sludge could be doing to humans – they don’t have the data,” he said. “If we can ensure that you don’t have harmful contaminants, then [using sewage] is a good thing. But at the moment really we don’t know whether some of the things in there are safe or not.” A further concern is that using sewage as fertiliser could foster the growth of superbugs, which are resistant to antibiotics. Cóilín Nunan, a scientific adviser at the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said: “Human sewage can be an environmental source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and of antibiotic residues. Wastewater treatment plants can reduce but not eliminate all the antibiotics and resistant bacteria. “If human sewage is spread on land growing food for human consumption, the possibility of antibiotic resistance being spread to people is greater than if it is spread on land producing other types of crops.” Dr David Spurgeon, an ecotoxicological researcher at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said there were benefits to using sewage on farmland: “It is a way of returning nutrients to soil, which means we can reduce the use of mineral fertilisers, it helps build soil structure which helps avoid soil erosion, and it returns carbon to the soil which can help with meeting carbon reduction targets.” Sewage treatment, though effective in removing many chemicals, was “not perfect, and there are some chemicals that can survive treatment” and other contaminants and pathogens that could get into the food chain, he added. “Sludge to land does need some management and that is why there is a code of practice to try to limit any issues,” Spurgeon said. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the government’s oversight was not working, and pointed to cases in recent years where the rules had been violated, and concerns raised in the Environment Agency’s 2017 report over enforcement. Sauven said: “The UK’s sewage sludge supply chains are already full of shady middlemen and waste brokers getting their hands dirty exploiting its opacity and the resulting regulatory failings. This is why the sludge that is spread on to our farms and fields has become such a toxic cocktail of plastics, chemicals and bacteria. “Add waste from the Netherlands into the mix and the risk of further contamination is only going to skyrocket. The Environment Agency really needs to get its own house in order before we allow the UK to become a dumping ground for other countries’ polluted sewage.” A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: “We take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously and our new sludge strategy ensures farmers’ use of this fertiliser is based on the latest scientific data. While spreading waste can have beneficial impacts on the land when used as a substitute for manufactured fertilisers, we are clear this practice must not harm the environment. “We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against those who fail to manage any risks appropriately – including prosecution in the most severe cases.”",environment
"Light brightens the tent and nudges me out of sleep. Dawn must have arrived. I open my eyes, expecting morning light, but instead see soft silver shapes flickering across the tent fabric – moonbeams, diffused through the swaying limbs of the huge Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) under which my tent is pitched. My watch says 3.34am. I unzip the door of the tent and look outside. The previous day was overcast, but the weather is restless and squally, and the wind has torn open a rift in the clouds. The moon is startling in its unsullied brightness. Metallic light plays across the dark forest. Blaeberry and heather bushes, wet with rain, gleam in the lunar glow. Moonlit scraps of cloud drift across the sky like smoke. The trees of Glen Feshie are an ecological link to 9,000 years ago: one of the few remaining remnants of the coniferous rainforest that spread across Britain after the last ice age. As the climate continued to warm, the conifer canopy retreated north into Scotland, but this “Caledonian forest”, as dubbed by Pliny the Elder, remained big enough 2,000 years ago to help halt the march of Roman armies. By the 20th century, human-driven deforestation and a wetter climate reduced the Caledonian forest to a handful of isolated enclaves; as little as 1% of its historic extent. But in Glen Feshie, as in many other parts of the Scottish Highlands, the forest is resurgent. Deer numbers in the area have been cut back, and in less than two decades the great 300-year-old “granny pines” that survived deforestation have been joined by a layer of vibrant new growth. Reaching this camping spot, in a natural dome created by the interlocking canopies of several veteran trees, involved careful “bushwhacking” past reefs of bright heather, clusters of infant pines, and grassy meadows vibrant with the late-season colours of devil’s-bit scabious, harebell and yarrow. This level of natural abundance is too rare in the mountain landscapes of Scotland and Britain. I zip the tent back up as the clouds close up and another squall approaches; but the trees shield me from the wind and rain, and I sink back easily into sleep.",environment
"Australian scientists say they are prevented from speaking openly about their work and their advice is being suppressed by government and industry when it comes to the impact of logging, mining, land-clearing and the climate crisis, new research suggests. A study by the Ecological Society of Australia, published in the journal Conservation Letters, surveyed 220 scientists across government, industry and academia on the extent to which their work had been suppressed. Forms of suppression include not being able to present or publish results, changes being made to findings before the work is released and self-censorship due to fear of retribution. The society found about a third of government and industry-employed ecologists and conservation scientists who responded said they had experienced undue modification of their work. About half the government scientists and nearly 40% of those working for industry said they had been blocked from releasing or discussing what they had found either publicly or internally where they worked. Slightly more than half of all respondents (56%) said they felt the constraints on public commentary had become more severe in recent years. This was most often the case in commentary about the plight of threatened species, with 56% of industry, 46% of government and 28% of university scientists working in the area reporting they felt limited in what they could say. University and industry researchers were more likely to avoid public commentary due to fear of misrepresentation in the media, while government employees were most often constrained by their manager or workplace policy. Don Driscoll, the lead author and a past president of the society, said the study showed that some of Australia’s best scientists were being prevented from sharing their work not only with the media and on social media platforms, but with colleagues and policymakers through peer-reviewed journals and at conferences. He said the potential consequences were profound as it meant policies on issues such as climate change, bushfires and regulation of development proposals may not be informed by the best science. “In reality, these findings may be the tip of the iceberg,” he told Guardian Australia. “It reflects on a type of corruption that’s going on in the system.” Driscoll, who is also the director of the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University, said many industry-employed scientists were consultants hired to assess the environmental impact of proposed developments. Those scientists were often left with no recourse if the work they did was modified before being presented to a government in a development application as their contracts prevented them speaking publicly. Similarly, he said, scientists that worked within government departments and agencies faced an increasingly politicised system in which information was often filtered by public servants and ministerial staff before reaching politicians. As the survey was opt-in it reflects only the experience of the sample who chose to take part, but the eight scientists behind the study said the respondents were an accurate reflection of the scientific workforce across age, gender and type of work. Driscoll said the findings suggested a politicised culture in how science was dealt with and showed the power of vested interests, and highlighted the need for an independent watchdog such as a national Environment Protection Authority to assess development proposals and determine whether they should go ahead. “It’s vital our environmental assessments are changed so that the people doing the damage are not employing the scientists doing the assessment of the damage to the environment,” he said. Euan Ritchie, a Deakin University associate professor in wildlife ecology and co-author on the paper, described the study as “pretty clear evidence the democratic process, which is based on having an informed public, is being interfered with”. He said it also showed that suppression of scientists’ work was having a heavy toll on their mental health. The paper includes anonymous quotes from respondents who said they had been threatened with losing their job if they spoke up after their advice was ignored, were intimidated by senior public servants on the phone and social media, and had quit their position due to stress and loss of motivation. Ritchie said the stress of having work suppressed ran alongside a “baseline eco-anxiety and eco-grief” that many scientists experienced. “It’s a serious and insidious mental health issue that hasn’t been addressed properly,” he said. The research was undertaken before an ongoing review of national environment laws by Graeme Samuel, the former head of the competition and consumer commission. In an interim report in July, Samuel found the laws were ineffective, the environment in decline, and advised the government to introduce an independent watchdog to ensure its protection.  Samuel also recommended the introduction of national environment standards to ensure conservation protection improved while the Morrison government handed greater development approval powers to the states and territories. The government last week gagged debate while forcing legislation to start that process through the lower house of parliament. The proposed changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act did not include environmental standards as promised. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said they would be introduced later. Driscoll said the government decision to rule out an independent watchdog and introduce laws without including environmental standards was “a major mistake” and showed what could happen when MPs did not listen to scientific advice.",environment
"AGL, one of Australia’s largest energy companies, has launched the country’s first subscription service for electric cars in a move that the EV industry hopes may boost the nation’s low uptake rate. The company announced a pilot phase for the new scheme, which also includes installation of charging stations at customers’ homes, to cover Sydney and Melbourne. The industry group the Electric Vehicle Council, which last month announced sales of electric vehicles had tripled between 2018 and 2019, said AGL’s move was a glimpse into the future of the electric vehicle market. AGL said it hoped the subscription service, available only to its own customers, would remove the barriers for people to drive electric cars – namely, the high upfront costs and the desire for a charging station at home. Under the service, subscribers pay an $800 set-up fee and then a weekly price for a car starting at $299 that includes the installation of a charging station as well as insurance, maintenance and registration. The AGL executive John Chambers told Guardian Australia the company was looking ahead at the rapid growth of electric vehicles and the role the vehicle’s batteries could play to store energy at homes as well as power vehicles. “That is a frontier for us,” he said. The car batteries were typically six or seven times the size of the residential batteries people installed to store their solar power. Several models of car will be available under the service, AGL said, including Nissan, Tesla, Jaguar and Hyundai. Customers would not be locked into a contract. AGL said the electricity used to charge the batteries would be carbon-neutral through offsets purchased under a government-accredited scheme. Last month AGL announced all its 400 corporate vehicles would be electric by 2030. The company is Australia’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and has a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In June the company announced it would be linking manager bonuses to its climate targets. The Melbourne-based company JET Charge will install the charging stations for AGL’s subscription scheme. JET Charge’s chief executive, Tim Washington, said the stations can recharge a car battery three times faster than a standard socket and complete a full recharge overnight. “The greatest way to get someone to purchase an electric vehicle is to just get them to try it,” he told Guardian Australia. “So this is a fantastic way for people to be able to try before they buy.” He said energy utility companies in other countries had also set up electric vehicle subscription services and AGL’s move was an example of how the energy market would converge around electric vehicles. He said energy companies were increasingly seeing electric vehicles as a way to store energy that could be fed back into the electricity grid. Washington said JET Charge had grown from employing one electrician in 2014 to a business with 40 staff and 150 contractors that had installed 4,500 charging stations. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, the company was installing about 20 electric charging stations a day.  Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council that represents major car brands and infrastructure companies including JET Charge, told Guardian Australia that upfront costs were a major barrier to people driving electric vehicles. “This is going to make electric vehicles available to more consumers,” he said of AGL’s plan. “More than half of all consumers say they want to buy an electric vehicle but the high upfront price gets in the way.” He said the subscription service for electric vehicles “hints at what the future of this market looks like”, with car sharing and ride sharing schemes also focusing on electric cars. Even though electric vehicles sales tripled in Australia from 2018 to 2019, the 6,718 sold in 2019 only represents 0.6% of new car sales. Jafari said 3,226 electric vehicles had been sold in 2020 up to the end of June. Sales in 2020 may not grow from 2019, he said, but he expected they would be steady when sales of non-electric vehicles were falling.",environment
"Urgent new measures are being taken to address the scale of untreated sewage leaks into rivers and seas as pressure grows on the water industry and government to act. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has set up a taskforce to cut the frequency of sewage discharges into rivers and seas from storm overflows, following revelations in the Guardian that water companies released raw sewage into rivers more than 200,000 times last year. The Environment Agency issues permits to allow water companies to release untreated human waste – which includes excrement, condoms and toilet paper – from storm overflows after extreme weather events, such as torrential rain, to stop water backing up and flooding homes.  But the Guardian data suggests the discharges have become a routine part of water and sewerage management, and critics say it has become a licence for water companies to pollute. On Wednesday, Defra said it had set up a taskforce with the Environment Agency, Water UK, which represents the water industry, and Ofwat, to “reduce the frequency and volumes of sewage discharges from storm overflows.”. Defra said the chief executives of 15 water companies met environment minister Rebecca Pow on Wednesday and she called on them to take further action to protect the environment, improve leakage levels and safeguard water supplies. Campaigners say the sewage releases into rivers are particularly damaging to chalk streams, which are a haven for wildlife. Defra said Pow told the water industry CEOs stronger action was needed to deliver on environmental priorities around the use of storm overflows, chalk streams and leakage, and that the environment minister was setting up a chalk stream summit next month. Pow said: “We discussed a number of issues I feel strongly about, including storm overflows, and how we can work together to see much more ambitious improvements. “This country’s green recovery from coronavirus can only happen if water companies step up and play their part.” The Conservative chair of the environmental audit committee, Philip Dunne, is also pursuing a campaign to change the law to forbid water companies from discharging raw sewage into waterways.",environment
"The UK government has rejected plans to develop an “environmentally unacceptable” coalmine near Druridge Bay in Northumberland after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists. The ministry of housing, communities and local government refused planning permission for the project for a second time, saying the plans for a new open-cast mine in north-east England were “not environmentally acceptable”. The decision brings an end to an almost five-year battle between environmental campaigners and the Banks Group, a Durham-based infrastructure firm, which hoped to extract millions of tonnes of coal for Britain’s steel and cement industries. Tony Bosworth, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, described the decision as “fantastic news for our environment, and a tremendous victory for local campaigners”. “Coalmines must be consigned to the history books if we are going to avoid climate breakdown,” he said. “Let’s leave coal in the ground where it belongs, and invest in energy-saving and renewable power to build the safe, clean and fairer future we so urgently need.” Bosworth said the Banks Group should “walk away” from Druridge Bay and “abandon plans for any more new mines”. A source close to the company said it was “highly unlikely” it would appeal against the decision, despite its claims that it could raise the UK’s carbon emissions. Ian Gregory, the Banks Group’s outgoing spokesman, said the decision to block its mine would “create massive extra greenhouse gas emissions” as the UK relies more on imported coal which is “dragged to the UK by train and ship”. The claim is disputed by campaign groups.  “This disastrous move simultaneously grows global CO2 emissions, undermines the north-east’s economy and makes us more strategically dependent on Russia,” he added. The Banks Group brought England’s thousand-year coalmining history one step closer to its end last month by shutting one of the country’s last remaining coalmines in Bradley, near Durham. The closure left only one open cast mine still producing coal in England, near Stavely in Durham. The Green party’s Berwick-upon-Tweed branch welcomed the government’s decision, and credited “five years of persistence and hard work by local residents”. “Northumberland was the cradle of coalmining in the UK, and is rightly proud of the role its communities played in the industrial revolution and of the strength and resilience of those communities,” the party branch said in a statement. “Having been at the forefront of one industrial revolution, this decision means that Northumberland can now be at the forefront of the next one, and lead the way into a post-carbon future.”",environment
"Gold Coast surfer Nick Slater was paddling in barely waist-deep water when he was attacked by a shark and the 46-year-old may have died before he was helped to the shore, witnesses have said. Tuesday’s incident was the first fatal shark attack at the tourist destination’s beaches since 1958 and it has reignited the debate about the efficacy of nets and drumlines. Witnesses say the shark came within metres of several other board riders on Tuesday evening at Greenmount Beach, a popular surf break with a shark control net and eight separate drumlines (baited hooks) in place to protect beachgoers. The attack is the only second death caused by a shark at a netted beach in Queensland since its shark control program was first introduced in 1962, a statistic often held up to laud the success of the state’s lethal protection measures. Fellow surfer Jade Parker was getting ready to hit the water when he spotted Slater – a local real estate agent – floating motionless next to his board. He waded out to help other surfers and lifeguards bring Slater back to the beach. Parker found a four centimetre tooth lodged in Slater’s board which he said was from “an obvious white pointer”. “It was a good size bite to the board,” he told the Seven Network on Wednesday. “I do not want to get to the gory parts but he was in a bad way. He was not conscious. It looked like he had already pretty much passed away at that point in time.” Fellow surfer Shane Dowling told Guardian Australia he “certainly” had sharks on his mind when he went for a surf at Greenmount beach about an hour before the attack. He and others saw seagulls diving for baitfish which are known to attract sharks. “Everyone thinks about sharks if you’re surfing – everyone knows they can come beyond the nets,” Dowling said. “The exact spot where he got attacked is where he was standing the day before. They’ve been packing in a lot of sand and it’s built the beach right out. It was really murky from the sand and really rough in that spot. It was only waist-deep water.” Dowling said he saw something out beyond the shark nets as he came in from his surf. “I had a good look at it because I thought it might be in the shark net. I could see splashing. It just looked odd. Maybe it was shark feeding on the school behind the net before I came in.” Witnesses said the shark took a large chunk – about the size of a basketball – from Slater’s surfboard. The wounds on his upper leg were significant. “It was a pretty severe attack and the ambulance and paramedics were here and did what they could, but it was to no avail,” the Gold Coast’s chief lifeguard, Warren Young, told the ABC. The Gold Coast’s reputation for relatively safe beaches is a drawcard for tourists. The incident on Tuesday has prompted new conversations about the effectiveness of nets and drumlines to protect beachgoers and whether they create a false sense of security for swimmers who mistakenly think are a catch-all defence. The local mayor, Tom Tate, a long-time advocate of shark control programs, on Wednesday flagged he would speak to the state government about additional measures. “It brings to reality, when we go off the land we go into the water, it is the shark’s domain. The danger’s there,” Tate said. “Let me speculate that maybe there are sonic solutions that could do better and we should have a look at that ... but one of the options might be to continue with the current solutions. “Together with the minister, I will be analysing what is the better remedy ... but let’s be guided by the experts. I’m sure we can come up with best solution for our beaches.” The state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she believed Queensland’s shark control program had been saving lives for generations. “If improvements can be made, then of course they should be, but the ultimate goal has to be protecting human life,” she said. The premier praised Parker and the other rescuers who helped Slater as “heroes”. “The courage to run into the surf moments after a shark attack is beyond admirable,” she told parliament. Shark experts said no protection measures can make any place safe. “The shark nets aren’t there to stop sharks coming through,” said George Roff, an ecology professor from the University of Queensland. “They’re 400-600 metres away from the main beach and they don’t [stretch across the length of the beach] to block everything coming in.” Roff said there was no evidence that nets or drumlines prevent or reduce attacks. He said drones and other detection measures were more effective at mitigating risk. “The idea that you can control sharks, in general, is wrong,” he said. Two tiger sharks have been caught in a net and on a drumline near Greenmount beach since the fatal attack but it’s not known if they are linked to Slater’s death. Beaches remain officially closed to swimmers from the New South Wales border to Burleigh Heads. - with Australian Associated Press",environment
"The Morrison government started preparing controversial legislation to amend Australia’s environmental laws before it had received a report from a formal review into whether the act was working. The environment department instructed the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to begin drafting the changes to the legislation on 19 June, 11 days before the government received the interim report of the review of Australia’s national environment laws. Labor, the Greens and environment groups say the evidence, provided in answers to a Senate committee, suggests the government never intended to adopt the expert advice of the review, chaired by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel. Samuel delivered his interim report, a once-in-a-decade statutory review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, to the government on 30 June. It found Australian governments had failed to protect Australia’s unique wildlife and habitats and recommended an overhaul of the laws to make the country’s systems of environmental protection more effective. Samuel recommended the devolution of approval powers to the states along with the introduction of national environmental standards and an independent regulator to enforce the law. In July, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, rejected the recommendation of an independent regulator, but said she would put a bill to parliament that streamlined the approval process and promised to introduce prototype standards to ensure environmental protection at the same time. But the bill introduced in August was a near replica of failed “one-stop-shop” legislation introduced under former prime minister Tony Abbott. It contained no reference to any of Samuel’s other recommendations, including national standards. It passed the lower house last month after the government gagged debate. In answers to the Senate committee, the environment department said it instructed the office of parliamentary counsel to start work on the bill after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, gave a speech on 15 June in which he said the government’s ultimate goal was to introduce “single touch” environmental approvals for developments. “The prime minister noted that this would be further informed by the EPBC Act review,” the department said. The department told the committee Samuel held meetings in May and June “in relation to the directions of the interim review, sharing his suggestion that devolution should be progressed”. This included a 4 June meeting with senior bureaucrats from the states and territories. Labor and the Greens said the responses to the committee showed the government had ignored the independent review process. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the government had been “caught out” rehashing Abbott’s failed 2014 environment laws before even receiving Samuel’s interim advice. “They have ignored their own independent review, broken their promise on national environment standards, cherry-picked the report, gagged debate in the parliament, and then rammed through a rehashed Tony Abbott bill, which is bad for the environment and bad for business,” she said. The Greens’ environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the government had been disrespectful to Samuel and engaged in bad process and policy. “The government has shown their absolute arrogance by dismissing the expert advice before it had even been made available to them,” she said. She said the Senate should not consider any changes to the laws until Samuel’s final report was tabled in October. A spokesman for Ley said drafting instructions on the bill were initiated by the department. “The government will consider a broader response and additional opportunities for reform once the reviewer provides his final report to government,” he said. Suzanne Milthorpe, the national campaign manager at the Wilderness Society, said it had “become increasingly obvious” that the Morrison government was running a “two-track process” – asking the public and experts for their views through the review while simultaneously acting on predetermined decisions made “in favour of vested interests”. “If they want to begin to re-establish trust here they should pull the Abbott-era bill before parliament, wait until the full review is completed and then bring the complete reforms forward together in one package,” she said. Basha Stasak, from the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Samuel’s report had warned against the approach adopted by the Abbott government in 2014, in part because it lacked legislated national environmental standards. “Yet before the federal government had even received Prof Samuel’s interim report, it was already drafting legislation to hand over environmental responsibility to weaker state regimes without national standards,” she said. Crossbench senators have indicated they will not support the proposed changes, in part because they include nothing to improve the protection of Australia’s ailing wildlife and natural heritage.",environment
"A mouse-sized elephant shrew that had been lost to science for 50 years has been discovered alive and well in the Horn of Africa. The Somali sengi mates for life, can race around at 30km/h and sucks up ants with its trunk-like nose. But it had not been documented by researchers since 1968. In 2019 scientists set out to search for the animal following tips from the region, but not in Somalia, from where the only past reports had come, but in neighbouring Djibouti. Locals were able to identify the creature from old photographs with Houssein Rayaleh, of Association Djibouti Nature, saying he had seen the animal before. The team tapped into local knowledge, and the fact that the sengis need shelter from birds of prey, to set traps in likely locations, baiting them with a concoction of peanut butter, oatmeal and yeast. They caught a Somali sengi in the very first trap set in the dry, rocky, landscape, identifying it by the tuft of fur on its tail that distinguishes it from other sengi species. “It was amazing,” said Steven Heritage, a research scientist at Duke University in the US. “When we opened the first trap and saw the little tuft of hair on the tip of its tail, we just looked at one another and couldn’t believe it. A number of small mammal surveys since the 1970s did not find the Somali sengi in Djibouti – it was serendipitous that it happened so quickly for us.” The team was happy not to witness any looming threats to the sengi’s habitat, which is largely unsuitable for human activities such as development or agriculture, suggesting a secure future for the creature. “Usually when we rediscover lost species, we find just one or two individuals and have to act quickly to try to prevent their imminent extinction,” said Robin Moore, of the Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC) group. The team set more than 1,000 traps at multiple locations and saw 12 sengis in total, obtaining the first photos and video of live Somali sengis for scientific documentation. DNA analysis showed that the Somali sengis are most closely related to other sengis that live as far away as Morocco and South Africa. This meant they have now been placed in a new genus, Galegeeska. It also meant that that an animal with a territory smaller than an average-sized backyard has somehow dispersed across great distances over time, leaving biologists with a new sengi evolutionary mystery to solve. Sengis are most closely related to aardvarks, elephants and manatees. Andrew Taylor, the chair of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s specialist group covering sengis, said: “In a single expedition to a part of Africa that is challenging to work in, the team have achieved remarkable success. Not only have they formally documented the continued existence of the Somali sengi for the first time in 50 years, they have also corrected our understanding of the species’ genus.” “For us living in Djibouti, we never considered the sengis to be ‘lost’, but this new research does bring the Somali sengi back into the scientific community, which we value,” Rayaleh said. “For Djibouti this highlights the great biodiversity of the country and shows that there are opportunities for new science and research here.” The GWC’s Search for Lost Species project includes a 25 “most wanted” list, with the Somali sengi previously the fifth creature waiting to be rediscovered. The others include Jackson’s climbing salamander, in Guatemala, and Wallace’s giant bee, in Indonesia. “This wonderful sengi rediscovery fills us with renewed hope for the remaining small mammal species on our most wanted list, such as the De Winton’s golden mole and the Ilin Island cloudrunner,” said Moore.",environment
"The surface of Wastwater is so immaculately still that the thought of disturbing it with a swim seems like blasphemy.  Earlier in the morning, social media reliably informed me that Wasdale was “overcrowded”. In the balmy grip of an August heatwave, Twitter gave the impression that the whole valley had been turned into a chaos of clogged roads, dirty campers and “wrong sorts” leaving devastation in their wake. But here on the shingly shore of Wastwater, on the edge of a wood, we have the place completely to ourselves. Where are the invading hordes? From here we can see right down the length of Wasdale: pyramidal Great Gable at the head of the valley, framed by the slopes of Yewbarrow and the Scafell massif. The view is a photographic cliche, but several days of stomping around the fells before this have rekindled my appreciation for Wasdale, with its formidable but familiar mountain forms, and right now it seems as beautiful as if I’d seen it for the first time. My girlfriend slips in first, sending perfect circles rippling out across the clear pane of the water. I wade into the pebbly, olive-green shallows and swim out into England’s deepest lake, with the water soon darkening beneath me. This is an oligotrophic lake, naturally nutrient-poor, but there are a few fish to be found here – including the rare Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) – and I hear soft gloops around me. A crane fly, a living legacy of the Cretaceous, skims over the surface of the water, seems to give me a quick inspection, and wobbles off. The craggy wall of the Wasdale Screes is big, brutal and sublime, but softened by rays of hazy morning sunshine streaking down between its gothic crags and buttresses. A peregrine flies through one of the sunbeams, pursued by a croaking raven. Some distance from the shore, I float on my back in the water, looking up at the sky and the Screes. When I come out of the trance, I look back in horror to see the masses have finally overrun our idyll: a young family playing on a paddleboard, seemingly having a great time of it.",environment
"Largely solitary, nocturnal, venomous and pint-sized, slow lorises are strong contenders for the primates that least resemble humans. Which may be why they are among the least studied, least protected and most poorly understood primates, according to Anna Nekaris, professor of primate conservation and biological anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. “Out of over 600 primate species, we have five great apes, and everybody wants to study them,” she says. While the plight of orangutans and gorillas has been well publicised, all nine species of slow loris, spread across southern and south-east Asia, are quietly decreasing in number and slipping down the IUCN red list. Philippine, Kayan and Bornean slow lorises are classed as vulnerable; Pygmy, Bengal, Sumatran and Sunda slow lorises are endangered; while Bangkas and Javans are critically endangered. Nekaris (pictured) has been devoted to lorises (there are slender lorises in India and Sri Lanka, too) since 1994, and is on a mission to help them through her research and conservation organisation Little Fireface Project. Spearheading these efforts is a field programme in Java, Indonesia, where she is directing the first long-term study of lorises in the wild. “It took about four years before the [local] farmers started taking us seriously,” says Nekaris. Key was teaching children about lorises through a nature club and the Slow Loris Forest Protector programme, making hunting and littering bans matters of local pride, and working with farmers on growing methods and infrastructure to benefit both them and the displaced Javan slow loris. Nekaris says the main threat to the animals has been habitat loss. Java is the most populous island on the planet, with about 130 million people on an island the size of New York state. Little more than 7% of its forests remain. “Somebody’s gone and taken all the tropical hardwoods and sold them for their wood … There are virtually no lowland rainforests left on Java,” says Nekaris. “It’s a miracle there are any [lorises] at all.” The protected national parks are at too high an altitude for naturally forest-dwelling slow lorises. Their home ranges can be 25 hectares (61 acres), but lorises creep rather than leap, and rely on vines in the canopy to get around. “The ones we’re studying,” says Nekaris, “are living in a human-dominated landscape, in hedgerows around tea, coffee and tomato fields.” While this has made it easier to attach radio collars to study them, says Nekaris, in the absence of joined-up forest the animals have to cross about 200 metres of ground to reach the next clump of trees. “There are predators such as leopards and dogs, and there are humans trying to catch them,” she says. Slow lorises are part of the illegal wildlife trade in Asia. Once they have been captured, their teeth are clipped to ensure they cannot bite and they are sold as cute, docile pets, or used as props for holiday photos in tourist areas. With those vast eyes in teardrop markings, they look like cuddly toys and get a lot of likes on social media. In reality, they grow bloated from a poor diet and their eyes fail from light exposure. But unlike the great apes, with their relatable facial expressions, a slow loris’s misery may be hard to spot. When tickled, they shoot their arms up as if enjoying the experience but it is actually a sign of distress. Their cry is ultrasonic, which means it is at too high a frequency for humans to hear. As well as their fatal cuteness, slow lorises are believed by some to be the animal that can cure a hundred diseases and are sought after for use in traditional medicines.  In December 2019, Nekaris published the results of a successful study into whether building a network of bridges could make up for the lack of safe passage in tree canopies and improve the lot of the Javan slow loris. It was a conclusion reached by trial and error. At first, Nekaris had installed some ladder-like bridges between trees that were used elsewhere in monkey conservation, but the lorises didn’t take to them. Then she realised that the answer might lie with some of the local farmers’ irrigation pipes. Because of the hilly terrain, some of the pipes were suspended high above ground level, and lorises had been seen crossing them. Nekaris hit on the idea of installing more of them, which would benefit the farmers, too. Twelve days after installation, motion-sensor cameras showed the animals starting to creep across the new pipes. Nekaris witnessed the animals grow in confidence, she says, “because they’re in the air. They’ve increased their home range sizes, and the areas within the home ranges that they can use.” With funding from the People’s Trust for Endangered Species in the UK, and Cleveland zoo in the US, there are now more than 20 water-pipe bridges in place. The bridges allow the lorises to reach previously inaccessible feeding trees, where they gouge out gum with their teeth. Nekaris also found the lorises could spend less time travelling, more time feeding and, crucially, get enough rest. An added benefit of using water pipes is that the farmers have a vested interest in their maintenance. “The longest bridge is about 400 metres,” says Nekaris. “Some of them have to go over multiple farmers’ lands so you have to negotiate with them to work together.” Getting the piping to the farms has become, she says, “a community event because people have to bring it up the mountain on motorbike. You have to find the water source to connect it to and then get it to travel where it needs to go. And then the interesting thing was, of course, other farmers started saying, ‘Well, I don’t have slow lorises on my land and I didn’t get a bridge. It’s not fair.’ So then as a contingency, we had to give other people bridges as well, even if they didn’t have lorises.”  Nekaris also introduced the idea of shade-grown coffee to the village, growing coffee in its natural habitat of the understory, pollinated by insects, in sustainably fertile soil. Last year, says Nekaris, “we went with the farming community to a herbarium and picked trees that were useful for the animals but also for fixing nitrogen in the soil and preventing soil erosion and landslides.” They included some “cash” trees, too, “which after 10 years could be cut for timber and replaced”. There was the extra incentive of certification from the Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network, which involved meeting criteria such as hunting bans, introducing FairTrade and organic practices and boosting habitat through shade-grown crops. A local ban on hunting endangered species was agreed in September 2019, says Nekaris, “with all the signs up by October, and that included birds as well”. The villagers agreed to a littering ban, too. “There’s plastic everywhere,” says Nekaris. “And it affects people’s livelihoods all the way down the mountain because it fills the streams that provide their drinking water.” Interest is growing in a new waste management system, and as this environmental awareness trickles down the mountain, so does the plight of the slow loris. A nearby village is discussing joining the hunting ban. Building bridges for the slow loris, says Nekaris, “has started to build bridges within the community”.

"Name: Unlikely face masks. Age: The one in the photo could be 10, 20, maybe even 30. It looks pretty big, but they can get bigger still – depending on the species, of course. I thought this was about face masks. It is, but one particular face covering, spotted in Greater Manchester this week, was a snake … Snake! Where? On a bus, travelling between Swinton and Manchester city centre. Snakes on a Bus! Like Snakes on a Plane on a budget. What kind of snake? Possibly some kind of a python. Alive though, and being used as a face mask? Correct. A man boarded the bus with the reptile wrapped around his neck and the lower part of his face. It must have been terrifying for the other passengers. On the contrary. “No one batted an eyelid,” one of them said. Manchester is so cool. Unless they were terrified – frozen with fear. No, this fellow passenger, who didn’t want to be named, said it didn’t seem to bother anyone and that she found it “really funny”. Massive snake, hahaha. Presumably live snakes can be used again and again, so there’s less environmental impact. Win-win, press the button, ding-ding, next stop Sssssssalford. No, wait, there is a problem. A python isn’t a legitimate face covering. Says who? Says a spokesperson for Transport for Greater Manchester. “Government guidance clearly states that this needn’t be a surgical mask, and that passengers can make their own or wear something suitable, such as a scarf or bandana.” So far so good, but I get the feeling there’s more to come. “While there is a small degree of interpretation that can be applied to this, we do not believe it extends to the use of snakeskin - especially when still attached to the snake.” Boo, boring Transport for Manchester. It’s a bit of fun, and a change from some of the novelty face coverings we saw when PPE was so hard to come by – the helmets, saucepan lids, Plague Doctor masks, coffee filters etc. Maybe, but actually a live snake isn’t a great mask. It can move away from the face; as it is clear from some of the pictures, this one did. And the man wasn’t wearing an actual, traditional, non-serpentine face mask underneath. Not “no masks” tweeter Ian Brown, was it? Maybe. Or Noel Gallagher singing Slide Away, hahaha. What is it about famous Mancs and masks? Anyway, that’s another story. Do say: “Thank you driver, we’ll just slither home from here then, shall we? Don’t say: “The snakes on the bus go hiss hiss hiss, hiss hiss hiss, hiss hiss hiss ...”",environment
"The year seemed finely balanced as we ambled down to the pond at Little Barbrook in the evening sunshine. Bracken was crisping to bronze and the birch leaves were turning, yet it had been the warmest day in weeks and heat was still radiating off the dusty track. So slipping into the chocolate-coloured water to cool off was a pleasure, knowing all the while that this might be the last swim of summer, a valediction of sorts and a reminder that the seasons still roll along, even in these strange and stressful times. Back on shore and half-dry, we had just started for home when I noticed something shimmering in the dirt. I scooped it up and marvelled: a dor beetle, counted among the dung beetles, its elytra, or wing cases, divided and the wings outspread, as though it had met its end in flight, perhaps taking off too late from the warm earth to escape a bicycle wheel. When I tilted my palm, its black body glittered purplish blue in the long rays of the setting sun, as though I’d discovered a jewel. No wonder the Egyptians thought scarabs divine. Broadly oval in shape, dors are the giants of the British dung-beetle world, and while there are only a handful of species, telling them apart can be difficult. This one was particularly big, being 26mm in length, and the markings on those glittering wing cases suggested Geotrupes stercorarius. We think of dung beetles as rolling balls of dung across the ground, but they are divided into “rollers” and “burrowers”. The genus – Geotrupes, “earth-borer” – gives the game away. This beetle digs, or rather dug, deep shafts under a nourishing pile of dung, and side chambers where the female lays a single egg, bringing small packets of dung for larvae to eat before sealing them inside. Some pupate in the autumn; others wait until spring. Flipping the beetle on its back, I studied its iridescent abdomen, fringed with violet and green, as well as a stronger version of the metallic blue that was a feature of its wing cases. I wanted to keep it, so I nestled my treasure in some damp clothes. But before we even reached the car the brilliance of its colours had faded.",environment
"Volunteers in this year’s Great British Beach Clean are being asked to record the personal protective equipment (PPE) they find, to get a clearer picture of the volume of plastic masks and gloves discarded during the coronavirus pandemic and their impact on the environment. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS), which organises the annual September event, is urging people to organise their own surveys with smaller groups of friends, family and “bubbles”, in line with government guidance. “It’s likely we’ve all seen masks and gloves littering our local area, whether that’s on the coast or on our street” said Lizzie Prior, MCS beachwatch officer. “Much like other single-use litter, face masks and plastic gloves put our seas and marine life in danger. PPE can be mistaken for food and ingested by marine life or trap animals in the elastic straps of face masks as we’ve seen recently. It’s so upsetting to see another form of single-use litter polluting the UK’s beautiful beaches, and we’re determined to ensure this doesn’t become a new normal.” Now in its 27th year, the annual event is a UK-wide long weekend of coastal cleaning from Land’s End to the Shetland Islands. This year it starts on Friday and finishes on Monday. Nearly 11,000 volunteers took part in last year’s clean-up, retrieving an average of 558 litter items for every 100 metres of beach surveyed. Plastic remained by far the most common form of litter (143 pieces per 100 metres), followed by cigarette butts (42) and glass items (33). There were six drinks cans per 100 metres. Among the more unusual items logged were a toilet seat, padlocks, false teeth and circuit boards. Data collected has played a key role in the introduction of the 5p single-use carrier bag charge, the ban on microbeads in personal cleaning products such as shower gels and toothpastes, the commitment to a deposit return scheme in Scotland and the consultation on one in England and Wales, and a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England.",environment
"I’ll never look at a tussock of grass in the same way again. Hidden within this one was a ball of woven fronds that once cradled life like a beating heart at the centre of the dense cluster of stems. We had spent more than an hour searching clumps of vegetation beside heathland in east Devon. The light was fading and the two of us, backs bent and several metres apart, moved from tussock to tussock, parting strands to carefully examine the inner recesses. Finally, my expert guide, Sarah Butcher, called me over. Concealed at knee height amid ranks of vertical stalks was a spherical mass, like a tangle of yarn caught in a loom. This hollow ball of dried blades of grass, small enough to be cupped between two hands, was what we had come to find – a harvest mouse nest. “Lovely to know they’re here,” said Sarah. “Though you’re unlikely to spot harvest mice in the wild – they’re really tiny, and too wary and quick.” The distribution of these thumb-length, gingery-brown mammals is most easily assessed by surveying nests, and Sarah organises the Devon Mammal Group’s harvest mouse project, which runs from October to March. At this time of year, when foliage dies back, the intricately woven constructions suspended above the ground are more visible. Equipped with a prehensile tail to aid climbing, harvest mice (Micromys minutus) live among crops, in reed beds, beside ditches and along field margins in the southern half of Britain. Females build several nests from late spring until autumn, in which they raise separate litters of offspring. Each breeding chamber is used only once and dries out by the time the young leave, after just over a fortnight. Nests that are still green are potentially in use and should be left well alone. We search on without finding another. Sarah would have expected to see more here, she told me, but their populations fluctuate and most don’t live much longer than a year. “They’re declining and incredibly susceptible to weather extremes and cold winters.” The single harvest mouse nest, the first I had ever come across, offered a glimpse into the secretive world where our smallest rodent dwells amid a towering forest of grass stems.",environment
"On his first day as the new science director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California in 2016, a giant blue storage locker caught Kyle Van Houtan’s eye. The locker was obscured by a dead ficus plant and looked as if no one had opened it for years. But the label on it intrigued him: Herbarium. He opened it and inside found hundreds of stacked manila envelopes. Each one contained a single piece of seaweed, pressed and preserved on white paper. The collection demonstrated a curator’s attention to detail, with neat labels in tidy handwriting that documented every seaweed’s origin and collector. And it gave Van Houtan and his colleague Emily Miller an idea. While all the hi-tech underwater drones and sensors monitoring the ocean today can document the present, and hint at the future, they have a big blind spot when it comes to telling the past. Modern record-keeping for ocean conditions began about 80 years ago, which might sound like a lot, but “in conservation we need a lot more data than we often have on hand to make an informed assessment of what a healthy ocean is,” says Van Houtan. If people were pressing seaweed even earlier than 80 years ago, they thought, could it be a way to go back in time, and read the history of the sea? “I don’t know how many people have contacted me and said ‘I found a bunch of seaweed [scrapbooks] in our attic, do you want them?” says Kathy Ann Miller, curator of algae at UC Berkeley’s University Herbarium⁠ (no relation to Emily Miller). “And I always say yes, because there could be treasures.” The 18th-century Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who founded modern taxonomy, practiced the art of pressing seaweed, but it  exploded during the natural history boom of Victorian Britain. These were the days of amateur scientists traipsing around the world, their sketchbooks in hand. While the racier pastimes of stuffing tigers or describing plant genitalia were off-limits to the “gentler sex”, it was socially acceptable for women to go “seaweeding”. Both Queen Victoria and George Eliot pressed seaweed in their day. Some went even further, publishing field guides, with suggestions on proper attire and etiquette. The collections themselves can be exquisite. “People spend a lot of time pressing seaweed, but also taking tweezers, separating out each beautiful branch, so that it’s splayed out nicely,” says Emily Miller, who later took over the study from Van Houtan. “They look like lace spread across the paper.” By the 1870s, the fad had arrived on the California coastline, transplanted by early American settlers who, just like their British counterparts, were mostly women, such as JM Weeks, an eagle-eyed collector who now has a red algae named after her. California, it transpired, was a paradise for seaweeders. As well as its vast kelp forests, the region is home to nearly 800 other species. There is the crinkly, electric-green sea lettuce⁠, the ruffled grape tongue, and hundreds of others, many of which were first identified for science by amateur seaweeders. The Victorian-era collections are true works of art, with purple, red, brown and green algae arranged in eye-catching patterns on sturdy white card and signed in flowing India ink. The seaweed in the Monterey locker that stood out to Emily Miller, however, was the tough, rather unremarkable gelidium, which turned up across the collection. Gelidium flourishes along the wave-battered west coast shore, and varies from sickly yellow clumps to purple coralline fans. Like all seaweed, gelidium needs nitrogen to grow, and Miller began to wonder if she could trace nitrogen samples back through the decades to see how it had changed over time. It was the kind of thinking in which the Ocean Memory Lab, which Van Houtan runs at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, specialises. The lab extracts historical ocean data from the tissues of long-dead marine animals: an antique collection of hawksbill sea turtle shells, for example, tells the story of an animal driven to vegetarianism by a declining coral reef; while seabird feathers dating back to 1890 can be used to better understand the impact of overfishing. Although the lab does not actively acquire natural history specimens, people send in donations: the curved fang of an orca, a giant South Pacific clam shell, a whale’s inner ear bone — all illegal to harvest today, but with a story of the sea to tell. The seaweed specimens only dated back to the 1980s, however, so Miller contacted institutions up and down the California coast, asking if they happened to have any older seaweed collections. Kathy Ann Miller of the University Herbarium was one of those who responded: she dug into her collection and donated tissue from eight gelidium specimens, the oldest 142 years old. After analysing the plants, the Ocean Memory Lab team discovered that the fluctuating nitrogen isotopes in the gelidium matched a historical cycle of upwelling in California. These powerful ocean currents affect everything from schooling sardines to prowling great white sharks, a shifting pattern of currents that oscillate between cooler and warmer phases. Miller realised that, had scientists known earlier that the cycle of upwelling currents could be measured by seaweed, they might have averted some of the great fishery collapses – such as Monterey’s great sardine crash of the 1940s, forever immortalised in John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row. “The original thinking was that overfishing caused the sardine crash,” Miller says. Now, they knew differently: “It was overfishing in combination with environmental factors and the Pacific Ocean experience.” The discovery was a major advance for the lab. Few had expected that anything as delicate as pressed, 142-year-old seaweed could tell such a lively story about the waters where it lived, and the people who pressed it for posterity. “We need these lenses into the past and who would have ever guessed that seaweeds would be the ones. Fish otoliths, sure. Coral, sure,” says Kathy Ann Miller, referring to studier specimens that scientists have investigated for years, “but seaweeds, which we think of as fragile and gooey, actually hold that history, not in their DNA, but in their tissues.” Their study, published in June, extended the record of Californian currents by a remarkable seven decades, back to the 1870s. It also hinted at the toll of human-caused climate breakdown: the shift between warmer and cooler phases once moved in lockstep, explains Miller, but “some of the correlations that we historically have seen are decoupling today.” For Van Houtan it is another step forward in the process of using preserved marine creatures to read the history of the ocean, something that can’t be done with a sensor or sampling equipment. “We have all these drones that are mining the historical ocean: they’re called birds, turtles, whales, and sharks,” he says. “And they’re doing so in a really standardised, rigorous and robust way. So those are our sensors. That’s our sampling equipment.”",environment
"This summer, Devil’s Pool – a basin where the Wissahickon and Cresheim creeks meet in Philadelphia’s Wissahickon Valley park – drew thousands of daily visitors from out of state, leaving mountains of trash and fresh graffiti on rocks and trees. The attention has concerned and frustrated locals, and brought back an unpopular proposal for deterring swimmers: filling the pool with rocks. Many residents say the real issue is not any new influx of people – but how the cash-strapped city doesn’t have enough park rangers. But after tensions came to head this summer, with most residents wanting more enforcement of the park’s rules and regulations by the city and some worried about keeping the park open for everyone, local officials seemed briefly willing to try anything: the city councilman Curtis Jones said he was supportive of constituents who wanted to fill in the natural pool. The idea has been around for a few years, even supported by some leadership of Philadelphia’s parks and recreation in 2015. But today, the department isn’t currently considering filling the pool. The proposal, while extreme, has become a flashpoint in a long-simmering local debate: how best to protect the historic landmark without completely cutting off the public’s access to it? Nancy Cresenzo, who grew up in and currently lives nearby Philadelphia’s Andorra neighborhood, is a leading force for change at the park, advocating for the city to bring more park rangers to the area and better enforcement of the park’s rules. She estimates about 90% of locals are against filling the pool – but that’s not to say they want visitors to swim, dive and party there either. “The problem is, Devil’s Pool is not safe,” said Cresenzo. “And if Devil’s Pool is a safety concern, why is something not being done?” Swimming in the city’s creeks is illegal and people have died after diving from high rocks or an arched sewer conduit at the pool. The Friends of Wissahickon (FOW), a non-profit that works in partnership with Philadelphia parks and recreation to maintain the park, also warns the water is a fecal-coliform-tainted cocktail of treated wastewater and storm runoff. The pool’s history and importance to numerous Philadelphians is what makes deciding what to do with the basin complicated. It’s unclear if the Lenni-Lenape ever used the basin for rituals, but Devil’s Pool’s name originates from how the tribe believed the water feature was an interface between good and evil. Later, a gazebo was constructed in the mid-1800s to encourage people to meet there during America’s Centennial Exposition, the first official World’s Fair held in the US. The park itself made history in 1868 when it became the first piece of public land set aside for preservation of its natural beauty. For Philadelphians, like Gregory Park who grew up in the Wissahickon Hills neighborhood, Devil’s Pool was one of the many places in the park he would visit as a child. Today, he visits the park with his children, where they explore the creek themselves. Based on estimates from FOW, daily usage of the park increased 10% on average between March and August, compared to the same time period last year. In July, when the number of visitors at the park was at an all-time high according to Philadelphia’s parks and recreation, park rangers reported 5,000 cars vying for about 100 legal parking spots. As an avid cyclist, Josh Haims, who lives nearby, notes that the increase in visitors over the years has hastened erosion of trails and walkways in popular areas due to increased foot traffic and people cutting new paths. In some areas, like those near Devil’s Pool, trails that were once narrow are now 5ft wide. He believes the park’s issues stem from the decrease in funding from Philadelphia’s parks and recreation, which just faced its largest cut of over $12.5m in funding for the upcoming fiscal year, and the city’s reliance on private organizations to supplement the difference. “States cannot rely on private funding to run their public parks. What’s happening here is a canary in a coalmine for what’s to come [nationwide] if we don’t invest in our park spaces,” said Haims. Philadelphia’s decline in its parks and recreation budget isn’t unique. Budget cuts to parks are common during times of economic uncertainty. In May, a survey by the National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA), found that 31% of park agencies are already making cuts to their 2020-21 budget. Another survey by the organization found that 94% of state and local leaders anticipated a decreased tax revenue to force cuts in a variety of park programs and functions next year. In response to the budget cuts and the few park rangers in the area, Philadelphia’s parks and recreation set up additional signage throughout the area and in July dispatched social distance ambassadors, who would’ve normally worked in the city’s pool system, at popular entrances to the park and trailheads to remind people that swimming is not allowed and the government-mandated mask mandate. Maita Soukup, a spokesperson for parks and recreation, said the program was a success, citing how ambassadors also handed out thousands of masks and trashbags, and will continue in some form next year. FOW doesn’t believe Devil’s Pool should be filled with rocks; instead, the organization is exploring a number of other ideas to keep the area clean, like increasing the number of bathrooms in the park, according to Ruffian Tittmann, the head of FOW. But she believes the city needs to seriously consider bringing back more park rangers. Cresenzo sees the battle over the future of Devil’s Pool as an extension of broader challenges facing the park – namely, how to keep it safe and open to all while the staff faces budget cuts – and remains optimistic that the community can do a lot to take care of the park while the city decides how to act next. The current changes alone, according to Cresenzo, have brought a “tremendous improvement to the park”. She’s still going to continue her advocacy for more park rangers and see what can be done at Devil’s Pool. “My friend was walking by Bells Mill Road Bridge [over the Wissahickon Creek] the other day and she said, ‘There’s no trash. There’s no trash on Bells Mill Road.’ It doesn’t mean we’re going to stop all the litter, but I’d say we’ve gained control of the park – and it’s a lot better for that,” said Cresenzo.",environment
"Ships carrying live animals are at least twice as likely to suffer a “total loss” from sinking or grounding as standard cargo vessels, the Guardian has found.  In the past year alone there have been two disasters involving animals in transit. Last November, at least 14,000 sheep drowned after the Queen Hind capsized en route to Saudi Arabia from Romania. And last month, Gulf Livestock 1, a carrier transporting almost 6,000 cattle, sank off the Japanese coast en route to China from New Zealand. Forty crew members remain missing and are presumed dead. “With the Guardian’s shocking findings … [it’s] time for an open and honest assessment of an industry that has caused one crisis after another,” said Prof Kristen Stilt, director of Harvard’s animal law & policy program, currently writing a book about the transport of live animals. “That assessment should recognise that the transport of chilled and frozen meat is the way that nearly all meat travels in commerce today. The idea of sending live animals is a holdover from a bygone era.” The global live export trade is worth nearly £16bn. For decades, campaigners have been calling on the EU to provide better protections for animals in transit, and an inquiry into the regulatory system is under way. According to Guardian analysis, between January 2010 and December 2019 five livestock vessels were recorded as lost to sinking or irrevocable grounding, killing crew and animals. The total equates to just over 3% of the estimated 150 livestock carriers above 100 gross tonnes (GT) known to operate worldwide. The 100 GT measurement is used by the shipping industry to separate smaller vessels, often owned for pleasure, from larger, more probably commercial, ones. The same loss calculation for the global cargo fleet of about 61,000 ships over 100 GT, shows that 471 vessels within that tonnage (excluding tugs, dredgers, fishing and passenger vessels), were lost to sinking or grounding in the same period – or less than 1%. The Guardian’s risk calculations are based on historical data from insurer Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty’s Safety and Shipping Review 2020, analyst IHS Markit and the International Maritime Organization.If the loss figure for livestock vessels expands to include two more vessels, sunk in December 2009 and September 2020, just outside the 10 years covered by the Allianz shipping safety report, used as a basis for the calculation, then the figure rises to 4.7%. Ships carrying animals appear to be at more risk because of a number of factors. Estimates suggest that least 80% of livestock carriers were originally constructed for other purposes and have been converted, rather than purpose built. “Historically, the majority of livestock carriers have been converted container ships and ro-ros [roll-on/roll-off vessels]. But even passenger vessels and oil tankers have been turned into livestock carriers,” said Capt Samson Rathaur, senior marine risk consultant with Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty. Adam Kent, managing director of market analyst Maritime Strategies International, offered similar figures. “Only about 20% of the current livestock fleet was originally designed to carry livestock,” he said. The age of the world’s livestock carriers can also be a problem. Rathaur said many were often already near or at the end of their shipping life, making the fleet “one of the oldest sectors in shipping”. Kent estimated the livestock fleet’s average age at 36 years, 16 years more than the 20-year average age for the global merchant shipping fleet. All of the livestock ships lost in this period were originally built for another purpose. In one case the ship – a ro-ro cargo vessel – had not even been converted to carry livestock. All but one of the livestock carriers lost were more than 20 years old. Owners of higher-end livestock carriers argue against tarring all ships with the same brush. For example, Livestock Express, which owns 13 purpose-built ships and one conversion, says the average age of its ships is 14 years. Livestock Express is owned by the Dutch company Vroon and is described as the “world’s biggest independent seaborne livestock carrier”. Asked about higher livestock ship losses, Paul Pistorius, the company’s managing director, said he was “obviously aware” of a number of tragic incidents over the past 10 years. “All of these casualties have involved converted vessels, many of which have been older than 30 years.” Kent said that while the Guardian’s calculation was “sound” and seemed to indicate “something amiss in the global livestock fleet”, the risk applied mainly to older conversions. He said that “some very good quality conversions” existed, “though we don’t tend to hear about these ships very often, only about those with which there are problems”. Another significant factor is that live animals move around in transit, unlike containers. “When these vessels are converted, animal behaviour is not always a factor in their design,” said Rathaur. Switching to a moving cargo without due consideration could affect a vessel’s stability, he said. “During heavy weather, animals can get distressed and move together to one side, which can potentially list the vessel.” The tiers that many livestock conversions add to increase carrying capacity were another stability risk, he said. Manure and urine also had corrosive effects on steel. Fermenting manure releases moisture, ammonia and carbon dioxide. In conjunction with chloride naturally excreted by animals, the resulting slurry could be “very corrosive to steel structures and ill-maintained ships and can, over time, have a serious impact on the structural strength of the decks,” Rathaur added. He said livestock shipping also had a human resources problem, because crews working on livestock carriers might have “little, if any” training or experience in livestock management before joining their first livestock ship. Using data from the Paris MoU shipping inspector, the Guardian found the most recent three-year rate for livestock ships being detained after inspections was almost 9%. For general cargo/multipurpose ships that average was just less than 6.5%. The Paris MoU is a memorandum of understanding between 27 countries that aims to eliminate substandard ships. It carried out almost 18,000 inspections in 2019. Detained ships are usually kept in port until problems identified by inspectors are resolved. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), a trade association, would not comment on the higher risk of loss for livestock ships exposed by the Guardian. In an emailed statement, the ICS marine director, Jonathan Spremulli, said: “We need all incidents to be thoroughly and robustly investigated and detailed reports to be made available as soon as possible so that lessons can be learned and appropriate actions taken to prevent similar occurrences.” Spremulli added: “The ICS continues working with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to ensure ships are built, maintained and operated in accordance with a robust regulatory framework which is continually under review and being improved.” In many, but not all cases, ship loss investigation reports are filed in the IMO’s Global Integrated Shipping Information System marine casualties and incidents database. Of the seven livestock ships lost since 2009, three reports are currently available. Two mention animal movement as an aggravating factor in already difficult circumstances. All three reports contain safety improvement recommendations. Most specifically, the report for the Danny F II, lost in December 2009 with the deaths of 40 crew and 28,000 animals, suggests a set of rules be established “for the construction and/or classification of the Lifestock [sic] carriers” because a “large number of livestock vessels currently in service are the result of a conversion from different type of original designs”. A spokesperson for the IMO said the suggestion had been considered by its maritime safety committee, but, for the “IMO to address this, a member state or states would need to submit a proposal for IMO to look further into this issue”.

"Mere glitter dazzles between air and water, disrupting shadows of the surrounding woods, distracting the eye, hovering over occult secrets underwater. The outer world is sedated by bright autumn sunshine while under the surface is a troubled subconscious that gives the place the “discouragement”, the “unbreathing quiet” that Mary Webb attributed to the fictitious Sarn Mere in her novel Precious Bane. Colemere is one of a sentence of meres written by dying ice at the end of its age 10,000 years ago. Down in the thick of the water are woods of weed haunted by carp, and fates with names such as “Jenny Greenteeth” that pull you in. Along the shoreline, where whirligig beetles draw orbital ripples, roots the least water lily, Nuphar pumila, which is similar to the yellow water lily but much smaller; its floating leaves have a bay in them, its stigma discs are starry and remain at the ends of brandy-flask seedheads. This little colony is a relict population; the next nearest to Colemere is in Scotland. They are marooned from the glacial story in a kind of magical substance between land and water, an ecology surviving in Shropshire’s meres and mosses, and now hanging on in the Anthropocene’s red list of endangered species. The water lily needs acidic water, open skies and glittering sunlight, and is doomed by the encroaching shoreline shadow of trees, toxic run-off from fields and canal spill. Some years ago, such pollution killed swan mussels, Anodonta cygnea, beautiful 20cm oval shells, like clasped cigarette cases, concealing the gentle sole of a creature that walks underwater; it is hard to imagine a more fragile innocence poisoned by our spit. The pixels of mere glitter can change into dragonfly or goldeneye, snipe or pochard; their twinkle is forever new, as if the place “was created but an hour gone, and not created for us”, as Webb says. A heron stands with studied indifference at the sailing club compound of parked dinghies, neatly sheeted to stow their playfully nautical traditions and the thrill of capsize. The mere is all so peaceful-looking but it is a place where “the moon would get lost in lily leaves, and times, a heron might stand in the sun”.",environment
"Brazilian meat giant JBS said on Wednesday that it will monitor its entire supply chain by 2025, including problematic “indirect supplier” Amazon farms it currently has no control over, some of which have been linked to illegal deforestation. “As a company we are assuming our responsibility to be a transformation agent for society, to be a catalyst. To build together with everyone a better world, a more sustainable Amazon and a better Brazil,” said JBS global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni in a virtual launch of the JBS Green Platform. The announcement marks a turnaround for the world’s biggest meat company. Environmentalists saw it as a positive step, but some said the deadline was too long to resolve such an urgent issue. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon and Brazil has come under increasing pressure from international investors and other countries over rising devastation and fires. With Wednesday’s announcement, JBS is the third Brazilian meat company to begin responding to the pressure. The company said its Green Platform will use blockchain technology and cattle movement documents, called GTAs (used for sanitary control), and suppliers that fail to cooperate and comply will be blocked from selling to the company. It will initially roll out the platform in Mato Grosso state, which has Brazil’s biggest cattle herd. “What we are doing will impact the life of future generations in a relevant way,” Tomazoni said. JBS will invest a minimum of £35m and match other donations to a total of £71m to create a Fund for the Amazon to foster sustainable development in communities in the region. One of Brazil’s leading climate scientists, Carlos Nobre, will serve on the fund’s consultative council. “If it works, it will reduce deforestation, because 80-90% of first deforestation is for cattle pasture,” Nobre said of the new tracing scheme. “This will have to be evaluated.” The industry’s problems with Amazon suppliers are well documented and were exposed in a 2009 report by Greenpeace. After its release, Brazilian meat companies cut deals with Greenpeace and federal prosecutors and set up complex systems to monitor farms that sell directly to their slaughterhouses. But in Brazil few cattle farms handle the entire life cycle of their animals, instead sourcing cattle birthed or fattened on other farms – the so-called “indirect suppliers”. And despite promising to monitor these indirect suppliers by 2011 in the deal signed two years earlier with Greenpeace, meat companies JBS, Minerva and Marfrig have so far failed to do so. Since July 2019, five investigations by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Brazilian agency Repórter Brasil, Greenpeace and Amnesty International have linked JBS suppliers to illegal deforestation. With pressure mounting, major companies have complained to Brazilian ambassadors and met with Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, in charge of its Amazon Council, and congress leaders. Nordea Asset Management – investment arm of northern Europe’s largest financial services group – dropped JBS from its portfolio in July. Last week a group of European countries – the Amsterdam Declarations Partnership, led by Germany – urged Brazil to take action in the Amazon. On Monday a coalition of NGOs and indigenous groups warned French food retailer Groupe Casino to stop selling beef linked to deforestation in Brazil and Colombia. In July, Brazilian meat company Marfrig promised to monitor all its suppliers 2025 using systems such as Visipec – developed by the University of Wisconsin and the National Wildlife Federation and made available for free. Meat company Minerva is also testing the Visipec system. Until now, JBS had made promises to resolve its supply chain problems but provided no deadlines. “This is very good because it recognises that monitoring indirect suppliers is needed. But the deadline is very long,” said Mauro Armelin, executive director of Friends of the Earth for the Brazilian Amazon. “It could already start using Visipec while it develops its own tool, and it should establish deadlines depending on the slaughterhouse, so plants near conservation units and indigenous lands where there is deforestation have shorter deadlines.” Others were fiercely critical, noting that JBS had promised to monitor its indirect suppliers by 2011. “The company is now giving itself an additional five years to continue to allow deforestation, illegality and human rights abuses in its supply chain in a bid to appease its investors,” said Greenpeace Brasil’s senior forest campaigner, Adriana Charoux. “This is simply unacceptable. The Amazon will have burned down by then.” She also noted that the JBS Green Platform did not include the Pantanal wetlands or Cerrado regions, where fires are currently raging. Some investors were also skeptical. “JBS’s 2025 target for tracing cattle is too far away, we need immediate action,” said Jeanett Bergan, head of responsible investments at Norway’s largest pension fund KLP. “It is a positive step but we have to see the detailed evidence in practice, not least given the controversies that have led to the company becoming a major global divestment target.” Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, said: “While blockchain solutions need time to develop, 2025 is a long way away - and there are other measures that can be effective before that, for instance stricter controls so that cattle is not bought from owners of approved farms, if they also own farms on disputed land.” Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a coalition of environmental groups, welcomed the plan but said JBS will need government help to make it work. “In theory JBS can do what it is promising. But to guarantee it, they will need help with tracing from state and federal governments.” Under far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, such help is unlikely, Astrini said. Bolsonaro has refused to admit Brazil has an environmental crisis on its hands. In his speech opening the UN virtual general assembly on Tuesday, Bolsonaro insisted the country was the victim of the “most brutal disinformation campaigns about the Amazon and the Pantanal wetlands.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"Global governments and major polluters must take urgent action to develop technologies which can capture and store carbon emissions or it will be “virtually impossible” for the world to meet its climate targets, according to the International Energy Agency. The global energy watchdog said carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects should play a central role in meeting climate targets as one of four key pillars in reducing emissions. Carbon capture, said the IEA, should sit alongside plans to electrify economies using renewable energy sources, replace fossil fuels with bioenergy and swap methane-rich gas for clean-burning hydrogen in factories, transport and homes. CCUS technologies typically trap the carbon dioxide produced by factories or fossil fuel power plants before they are emitted into the atmosphere where they contribute to global heating. Once trapped, the greenhouse gas can then be piped into permanent underground storage facilities or sold to buyers who can use the carbon to manufacture plastics, boost their greenhouse crop yields or even make fizzy drinks. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said the process is “critical” in the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives. “Without it, our energy and climate goals will become virtually impossible to reach,” he said. The IEA also highlighted the “significant potential” of direct carbon capture schemes, which absorb carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere to create carbon neutral economies, but it warned that costs would need to come down. The “slow start” for carbon capture projects means there are only 20 projects in commercial use worldwide but as climate targets begin to mount the race to invest in new carbon capture projects is gaining pace, according to the IEA. Norway is considered a global leader in CCUS but major projects operate in the US, Canada and China too. In the last three years plans for more than 30 commercial CCUS facilities have come forward, representing a potential investment of around $27bn, according to the IEA. But more must be done by governments and high-pollution industries to accelerate the uptake of carbon capture. “Action from governments will be essential for establishing a sustainable and viable market for CCUS,” Birol said. “But industry must also embrace the opportunity. No sector will be unaffected by clean energy transitions – and for some, including heavy industry, the value of CCUS is inescapable.” In the UK major energy companies are developing industrial clusters capable of capturing the carbon to store in subsea caverns in the North Sea seabed. National Grid, Drax and Norwegian state energy giant Equinor last year put forward multibillion-pound plans for the UK’s first carbon-neutral “industrial cluster” in the Humber including hundreds of refineries, factories and the Drax coal-fired power plant. The alliance plans to trial new technology to capture and store carbon emissions from the factory and power plant flues and also hopes to use carbon capture while breaking down natural gas to create hydrogen, which can be used in industry, heating and transport without creating climate emissions. Luke Warren, the chief executive of the UK’s CCS association, said the IEA has identified CCUS as an important weapon in the battle against rising atmospheric emissions due to its unique ability to reduce emissions from key areas of the economy as well as emissions which are already in the atmosphere. “The next decade will be critical for CCUS deployment globally,” he said. “We are confident that the first UK CCUS clusters will be operational by the mid-2020s. This would make a significant contribution to a strong post-Covid recovery whilst making the UK a global leader in this crucial net zero technology.” ",environment
"Scientists have developed a “tiny wind turbine” that can scavenge energy from the breeze made while walking. Imagine rubbing a balloon on your hair for a few seconds – can you hear the crackle of static electricity, see your hair stand on end? That energy, powered by the contact and separation of two materials, can be bottled up and stored for use, according to researchers working on the device. Scientists in China hope the device can generate sustainable power in a low-cost, efficient manner. Once placed on a person’s swinging arm, the airflow is enough to generate power, the researchers said. “Our goal is to solve the issues that the traditional wind turbines can’t solve,” said lead author, Dr Ya Yang, of Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, in a statement. “Unlike wind turbines that use coils and magnets, where the costs are fixed, we can pick and choose low-cost materials for our device.” The device comprises two plastic strips in a tube that flutter or clap together in the presence of airflow. A gentle breeze of 1.6 metres a second is enough to power the device, but it performs best at a speed that ensures the two plastic strips flutter in sync, when wind velocity is between 4 and 8 m/s, the researchers said. The device appears to be a simple, reliable method of generating a small amount of energy that could then be deployed in a variety of ways such as powering remote sensors, security cameras or even a weather station on top of a hill that is otherwise difficult to reach, said Richard Cochrane, associate professor of renewable energy from the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the study. “We won’t see this innovation replacing the big turbines, but we are seeing increasing numbers of these sort of technologies being used for energy harvesting …providing power in places that are otherwise quite hard to get electricity to.” So far, the device has been able to power up 100 LED lights and temperature sensors, its makers said. It also has a wind-to-energy conversion efficiency of 3.23%, which they claim exceeds previously-reported performances on wind energy scavenging. In their paper, published in Cell Reports Physical Science, the researchers show the frequency of the oscillation varies with the wind speed exerted on the device, noted Cochrane. “But what will be interesting is to see how sensitive the energy output is related to that frequency or the wind speed. Do they need a certain frequency to get any energy out of it? If it’s oscillating below 24 hertz, can it still generate energy?” Additionally, when something flops back and forward, you get fatigue in the materials – so how long these devices last would be interesting to see, he said. “And then how does the technology cope with ice, rain, dust and salty wind blown in from the sea? That would be nice to see proven – because that can be a challenge with conventional turbines.” Meanwhile, its makers are dreaming big. They hope to combine it with small electronic devices such as phones, to provide sustainable electric power, and eventually to make the device competitive with traditional wind turbines, where output is heavily dependent on high wind speeds.",environment
"Whale rescuers at one of the world’s largest stranding events on Tasmania’s west coast have now released 88 of the 470 marine mammals into the ocean, with about 20 of those remaining now well enough to be rescued. Vets at the scene in Macquarie Harbour recommended four of the long-finned pilot whales be euthanised. The task was carried out on Thursday morning. About 380 have died since the stranding was discovered on Monday. Rescuers are now focusing efforts on 20 remaining whales. Nic Deka, the coordinator of the rescue from Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said on Thursday morning that the focus was shifting to gathering hundreds of dead whales strewn across sandbanks, bays and floating in the water. “We think there are around 20 still viable to release from the sandbar [at Fraser Flats],” he said. “It is a complex site and many whales are submerged. It’s difficult to assess which are alive and dead. But we have about 20 that we think have the strength to be released.” Dr Kris Carlyon, a marine conservation program wildlife biologist, said rescuers had tried to release the animals to be euthanised. “These are animals that we have given them a chance and tried release and they haven’t done well and that’s purely down to the situation they’ve found themselves in.” A spokesperson for Tasmania’s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment said in statement: “Euthanasia is by firearm with a customised ammunition. This is in line with world best practice for euthanising a whale species of this size.” The stranding, near the town of Strahan, is one of the largest ever recorded anywhere in the world and the biggest in Australia’s history. The previous largest stranding, also involving long-finned pilot whales, was at Dunsbrough in Western Australia in 1996 when 320 of the mammals got stuck with only 20 surviving. Deka said the task of gathering up the dead whales had already started. There were concerns the whales would “bloat and float” and then start to drift, creating a navigation hazard in the harbour. “They could also attract predators such as sharks and that’s always a risk. The decomposition could also affect oxygen levels in parts of the harbour.” He said the preference was to tow the animals out into the ocean and, on Thursday afternoon, efforts were underway to stop the dead whales from floating away. Pilot whales vary in weight depending on age and sex but can weigh more than a tonne. A 32-metre barge with a crane attached is due to arrive from the state-owned TasPorts corporation on Monday to help with the operation to dispose of the carcasses. The MV Kulanda, which can carry a 92-tonne load, also has a crane attached. Boats from the harbour’s fish farming industry would also be used, Deka said. About 40 government staff, 20 volunteers mostly from the harbour’s fish farming industry, and about 17 surf lifesavers have made up the rescue crew. Deka said volunteers were “doing some hard yakka” in the water and everyone was tired, but were “bearing up well under the pressure”. “My focus is on doing the best job we can. Now it’s looking ahead to collect and dispose of the carcasses.” Carlyon said it was unlikely they would ever know for sure why the 470 whales made their way into the shallow water and into the harbour. “The most likely scenario is that something has brought them close to the coast – and most likely that’s food – and then they’ve got themselves into trouble.” The largest known whale stranding was in 1918 in New Zealand’s Chatham Island when about 1,000 pilot whales stranded. Pilot whales, which can live up to 40 years, have a strong social bond and travel in groups, with some staying in the same pod for life. Pods can be up to 1,000 strong.",environment
"Once the sun has set, there’s a chill in the air, but it’s still mild enough to leave my bedroom windows wide open at night. As soon as I switch on the lights, the glow acts as an irresistible invitation to every passing crane fly, moth, mosquito and midge, though they aren’t the only winged insects to be lured towards the light source – a phenomenon known as positive phototaxis. It’s the slight iridescence of its translucent, reticulated wings that first draws my eye to the creature clinging to my ceiling lampshade. Climbing up on my bed for a closer look, I discover it’s a common green lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea). Just 1.5cm in length, it has a slender, pale pistachio-green body, long thread-like antennae and oversized eyes the colour of burnished copper. Most lacewings perish after breeding, the next generation passing the bleakest months as dormant pupae in cocoons buried beneath undisturbed soil, but of the 43 species found in the UK, Chrysoperla carnea is unique, the only one of its kind to overwinter in adult form. Its name is something of a misnomer as, in synchrony with the turning of deciduous trees to shades of red, gold and brown, these insects fade from vibrant lime to dull straw-yellow or pinkish-beige, reverting to green the following spring. This seasonal colour-change is likely an enhancement of crypsis, allowing them to avoid detection by potential predators while hibernating in decomposing leaf litter. Perhaps because many gardeners take their tidying too far – eradicating the hollow plant stems, fallen leaves and log piles that provide natural nooks and crannies in which to hide – lacewings often find refuge in houses and outbuildings. Last autumn one cosied up in a crevice in my kitchen window frame, lying torpid until April when it emerged in search of a mate. It’s possible to purchase purpose-built lacewing “hotels”, but this year I’ve made a shelter from an empty plastic bottle stuffed with a roll of corrugated cardboard. My motives aren’t entirely altruistic. I’ve hung it from a branch of my Victoria plum in the hope that, come spring, the residents will lay eggs and, once hatched, their voracious larvae – colloquially known as aphid lions – will devour the inevitable infestation of sap-suckers.",environment
"Rio Tinto wrote to the Morrison government last year urging it to act quickly to transfer environmental approval powers to the Western Australia government, before a major review of national environment laws was complete. The move came 10 months before the Coalition announced it planned to change the laws to set up “one-stop shops” at state level for environmental approvals, starting with Western Australia. The legislation was introduced in August when the review of the laws, by former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel, was still under way. Rio urged the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, to consider a bilateral approval agreement between the two governments “as a matter of priority”, according to a letter obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. The mining giant also had meetings with government officials on at least four occasions dating back to August 2019 at which reform of Australia’s environmental laws was discussed. The letter was written by Rio’s then-iron ore chief, Chris Salisbury, one of the executives who stepped down after the company blew up a 46,000-year-old Indigenous heritage site in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. The letter refers to iron ore operations in that same region. In the 21 November 2019 letter, Salisbury said “duplicative” state and federal processes were causing delays and increased costs for the resources sector. He welcomed a speech by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a day before, signalling the government’s desire to further streamline environmental approvals. “For the reasons set out below, I would respectfully ask that the commonwealth consider as a matter of priority an approval bilateral agreement between the commonwealth and Western Australian governments,” Salisbury wrote. The letter goes on: “We do not consider the review of the EPBC Act needs to occur before such an agreement is entered into.” Salisbury wrote that although the statutory review was under way, national laws already provided a mechanism for the transfer of approval powers to states. He told Ley that WA’s environmental processes were “robust” and a deal between the federal and state governments would save costs and time for industry “without compromising environmental regulation”. Salisbury told Ley he had recently written to and met with the WA premier, Mark McGowan, about the same issue. Answers given to a Senate committee show federal environment officials had four meetings with Rio Tinto – on 27 August and 11 December 2019 and 6 March and 3 April 2020 – at which a bilateral approval agreement or reform of Australia’s environment laws were discussed. In July this year, on the day of the release of the interim report from the EPBC Act review, Ley announced the government would put a streamlining bill to parliament. But officials were instructed to begin drafting the bill 11 days before the review’s chair, Graeme Samuel, delivered his report. Rio Tinto’s iron ore projects were on a list of major projects the government announced in June would be “fast-tracked” and WA was the first state to signal it would pursue a bilateral approval agreement. Both governments said formal negotiations began in August. An environment department spokesman said the minister was not present at meetings its officials had with Rio Tinto and the company’s representations “did not play a role” in the bill before the parliament. Asked if the minister had further meetings with the company, a spokesman for Ley said: “The minister routinely meets with a broad range of stakeholders.” He added that the bill “reflects the interim findings of the Samuel review”. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company would not comment about meetings it had with government and declined to respond to a series of questions. He pointed Guardian Australia to the company’s April 2020 submission to the EPBC Act review and an October 2019 submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry which showed the company’s publicly-stated support for bilateral approval agreements. But Tim Beshara, the federal policy director of the Wilderness Society, said the company was “forum-shopping” for sign-off for its mines with the “lowest possible protections in place and before any independent review might suggest the protections are increased”. “When Rio Tinto is the one who gets to set the bar for what is acceptable damage to Australia’s natural and cultural heritage, we all lose,” he said. “It’s unconscionable that the Australian government, before, during and after the demolition of Juukan Gorge could be actively facilitating Rio Tinto’s future work program to go ahead with even lower standards than they are required to meet today.” Samuel’s interim report found Australia’s environment is in unsustainable decline and governments have failed to protect the country’s unique wildlife and habitats. His final report is due at the end of October. Conservationists have warned that the reforms the government is proposing would weaken already unsatisfactory protections. A spokeswoman for McGowan confirmed the premier received Rio Tinto’s letter but did not answer questions about meetings with the company. On 27 November last year, McGowan called for a bilateral approval agreement with the federal government. The spokeswoman said an agreement was being drafted and was expected to result in a “six-month reduction in decision-making timeframes without compromising environmental standards”. “Many industry stakeholders have been pushing for this for a longtime and we’re pleased it’s in train,” she said.",environment
"When the chorus stopped, one voice kept going. On and on, through the dog days of summer and into autumn, it sang with monotonous intent. It was still singing that morning. The breeding season was over, but nobody had told the wood pigeons to stop. Proof of their enduring fecundity was perched on the back of a garden chair. A messy fledgling wore its adolescence in sprigs of pin feathers sprouting out of its head, shoulders, breast and flanks as if it had come out of the nest via a tumble dryer. This young wood pigeon bore a striking in-your-face family resemblance, not so much to its parents as to a distant cousin that shared its big, hook-tipped beak, a horny upper mandible swollen over its nostrils. Perched three metres away, staring at us without any apparent fear or desire for flight, here was a 21st-century dodo. Innocence and naivety are not the best attributes towards a long life, but this youngster was learning life lessons by the minute. It evidently decided it wanted to turn around on its perch for a different view. Raising a hopeful right foot, it twirled its extended claw, stretching to effect a 180-degree turn of its toes, pawing its stubby digits at the top of the chair. But something wasn’t quite working. The bird lowered its head, baffled by the obdurate immobility of a standing leg that was failing to pirouette. The right foot dropped, the left foot rose; it made no difference. While the hapless wood pigeon was trying the can-can’t, we had walked up to almost within arm’s length. Still, those beautiful, muddy blue-grey eyes looked back at us in pigeon-blank ignorance. For its own sake, and as a kindness, it was time to teach this bird to be more wary. My wife, Sarah, hissed sharply and reached out as if to touch it. The pigeon gave a startled leap and flapped in a careening flightpath towards the top of the shed. Its toes touched down on the rim, its body pitched forward, and it scrambled up to the apex, running like a hunched chicken. The pigeon squatted, reflecting perhaps on its narrow escape, one step away from being dead as a dodo.",environment
"About 380 pilot whales were confirmed dead in Tasmania’s west on Wednesday afternoon with rescuers fighting to save the remaining 30 that are still alive. More than 450 long-finned pilot whales were caught on sandbanks and beaches inside Macquarie Harbour, with a rescue effort starting on Tuesday morning. Some 50 whales have been rescued and coaxed back to the open ocean. Rescuers were focused on 270 whales stranded near the town of Strahan, but on Wednesday morning a further 200 whales about 10km away in the same harbour were discovered from a helicopter. Officials later confirmed all had died. The stranding is likely one of the largest on record globally and is the worst in Australia’s history. Nic Deka, the coordinator of the rescue from Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said they were fighting to save the remaining 30 whales but focus was now turning to retrieval and disposal of the dead whales. “We will try and rescue as many of the remaining live animals as we can.” Dr Kris Carlyon, a marine conservation program wildlife biologist, said on Wednesday that the addition of 200 whales made this current stranding the largest in Tasmania’s history. Records show some 294 whales, also long-finned pilots, stranded at Stanley on Tasmania’s north-west in 1935. About 60 rescuers led by the Tasmanian government’s Marine Conservation Program entered the second day of the rescue on Wednesday focused on an area called Fraser Flats. About 25 whales were lifted off sandbanks and pulled by boat to open waters on Tuesday, but two had returned to the main stranded pod. A further 25 were rescued on Wednesday. Deka said the new group of 200 dead whales were in two bays between 7km to 10km south of the main rescue site. They appear to have gone undetected and likely entered the harbour about the same time as the others. The harbour is about 35km long and about 8km wide. Deka said: “From the air, most appear to be dead.” Asked why they hadn’t been seen before, he said: “The water is a very dark tanin colour and maybe they stranded and then washed back in to the bay. From the air they did not look to be in any condition for rescue.” He said even if those 200 whales had been seen late Monday when the group to the north was discovered, it was unlikely that it would have changed their strategy. When the first 270 whales were discovered, about 90 were estimated to be already dead. “We would still have focused our efforts on Fraser Flats because they are the ones with the best chance of survival.” On Tuesday, Deka told Guardian Australia that two methods were being considered. Burying the whales in a landfill was one, or towing them out into open water and using ocean currents to keep them offshore was another. “We do know we can’t leave them in the harbour because they will present a range of issues. We are committed to retrieving and disposing.” About 40 government staff and 20 volunteers, mostly from the harbour’s fish farming industry, are in chest-deep in water and manoeuvring large webbing under the whales and lifting them off the sand. About 17 surf lifesavers with six inflatables and a jet rescue boat joined the efforts throughout Tuesday. Tags are attached to the rescued whales to monitor them. Pilot whales are very social and need to be taken far enough away from the main group that they don’t turn around and go back. Deka said it was disappointing that two whales saved on Tuesday had returned to the stranding site, “but the majority of the whales [we saved] are still out in deep water and are still swimming. We have been more successful than not.” Carlyon said: “There’s nothing to indicate that this [stranding] is human caused. This is a natural event and we know strandings have occurred before and we know that from the fossil record. “As far as being able to prevent this occurring, there’s little we can do.” Even though Carlyon said the event was natural, there was a public expectation that the survivors should be helped. Euthanising some animals was an option, he said, but it was not a simple practice and at this stage it was not being considered. “We think we have a chance with the animals that are still alive.” Dr Karen Stockin, an associate professor at Massey University in New Zealand, is an expert on whale and dolphin strandings globally and is on an International Whaling Commission expert panel on the issue. She said the Macquarie Harbour stranding was likely Australia’s largest ever. “It’s fair to say this will probably rank third or fourth globally [in terms of the numbers of stranded animals].” Long-finned pilot whales, which can live for up to 40 years, were notorious for large strandings, Stockin said, because of the way they stick together in tight social structures. “Some will remain within their pods their entire lifetime,” she said. In a statement sent to the Guardian, Australia’s environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is heartbreaking to see these stranded whales in Tassie. I want to thank the hard working rescuers and all the amazing volunteers on the ground.” She said the Tasmanian government was leading the rescue, but the federal government had also offered support.",environment
"On winter nights for the past six years, a group of 20 people have rustled through dark, coniferous woods to emerge on a Canadian beach at the lowest possible tide, illuminated by a correspondingly full moon. An elder offers a greeting to the place and a prayer, then the team of researchers, volunteers, and First Nations “knowledge holders” lights a warming fire and begins its work. At sites outlined by stones placed hundreds or even thousands of years ago, some begin raking, or “fluffing”, the top three inches of the beach, loosening rocks and mud - and a remarkable number of old clam shells. When the tide comes back in, it will flush out any rotting organic matter, changing “some places that are compact and smelly into a good clam beach again”, says Skye Augustine, a member of the Stz’uminus First Nation. This spot was once a clam garden, an ancient indigenous form of mariculture that coastal First Nations people have used for millennia. It is estimated that they once numbered in the thousands along the Pacific north-western coast, though ruins are all that’s left of most. In collaboration with the W̱SÁNEĆ and Hul’q’umi’num nations, Augustine has spearheaded the first formal clam garden rehabilitations at two sites in the Gulf Islands, in British Columbia, with dozens more to follow. “My elders articulated to me that if we want to bring our beaches back to life again, we need to bring people back on to them to care for them as they have been cared for in the past. That became my inspiration for my education and career,” she says. “How do we make this clam garden thing happen?” For millennia pre-colonization, clam gardens epitomized sustainable food security for Pacific north-western coastal nations from northern Washington to south-eastern Alaska. Modern studies have found that clam gardens have historically been up to 300% more productive than unmodified beaches, that their clams grew larger and faster than average, and that the clams did not exhibit any signs of resource stress from over-harvesting. To create the beaches, indigenous people built rock walls parallel to a beach’s low tide line, which would trap sediment and flatten the slope of the shore. With continuing tending, such as tilling to improve aeration and the removal of predators like sea stars, these gardens increase or create habitat for butter, littleneck, and horse clams, as well as crabs, chitons, seaweeds, and other useful species. Recent carbon dating has revealed that the oldest clam garden known to science was built about 3,500 years ago. This runs counter to misconceptions that prevailed during colonial settlement of Canada – that First Nations peoples were foragers without established agricultural practices. Such ideas were used as justification for damaging policies that displaced communities from their ancestral lands and criminalized traditional practices. “It has always been our duty to be the stewards of the land,” says group member Nicole Norris, a knowledge holder for the Hul’q’umi’num and an aquaculture specialist. “It is the exact same land my ancestors walked, and all we are doing is completing the work that they started.” One day, Norris anticipates bringing younger generations of her family to these beaches to harvest again. “From the work that we’ve done, we’ve seen the greater ecosystem return – some of the people who live in the local communities have talked about the return of certain birds and plants, and that’s been heartwarming,” she says. In addition to providing food, clam gardens have historically provided the opportunity for “grandparents, aunties, and uncles to spend time at the beach with their grandchildren and younger generations, not only teaching about how to tend the environment … but sharing stories, language, spiritual ties to the place,” says Melissa Poe, who specializes in the social and cultural dimensions of ecosystems at the University of Washington. As the British Columbia restoration effort is demonstrating, clam gardens also help to challenge the idea that the only relationship humans can have with nature is a rapacious one. “I think that one of the most important things about restoring these places is that it requires that we restore people’s relationships with them,” says Augustine. “It forces us to rethink humans as only having negative impacts on our ecosystem, and remember that for millennia we have had really positive and reciprocal relationships with the places we belong to, and we can have those kinds of relationships once again.”",environment
"Looking across the estuary from the hills above Aberdyfi, the uncertain morning light gave both sea and sky the diffuse grey of long-abandoned pewter. Behind me, the broken slope of the hillside carried an expanse of bracken fronds – colouring now into autumn. Stirred in the sharpening breeze from the east, they fell into patterns echoing the movement of the river surface below me. The tide had just begun to ebb, with streamers of foam starting to build across the mouth of the Afon Dyfi as increasing volumes of water began to sluice energetically seawards. Far to the south the notched cliffs of Ceredigion retreated into the coastal murk, while closer at hand the dunes of Ynyslas defined the southern bank of the Dyfi. Caught in a dynamic balance of erosion and deposition, the pattern of dunes is edged to seaward with a ridge of rounded cobbles – visible as a grey band even from here, a mile or so distant. Beyond the sand dunes the great expanse of Cors Fochno, an impressive raised peat bog with its core still virtually wild, brought further diversity of colour and texture to the landscape. A line of silver, oddly straight in this almost fractal scene, marked the engineered course of the Afon Leri across the edge of the mire. The track across the hillside, edged with gorse flowers and a few late foxgloves, took me down towards the town, finally reached by a half-remembered path dropping between high hedges. The day had begun to warm, burning away the earlier mist and bringing solid colour to the landscape. Inland, the former mere suggestion of high ground resolved into familiar hills, framed by a deepening blue sky and fans of high white cloud. As I headed eastwards towards Machynlleth, sunlight reflected sharply from the choppy waters of the Dyfi, throwing into silhouette a good-sized flock of oystercatchers strung out along the widening foreshore. I lost count at 50, which was perhaps a quarter of the group, and was glad to note that this throng included a number of paler, slightly scruffy, juvenile birds. A healthy presence, but the gathering of flocks in the estuary is a sign of approaching autumn that can no longer be ignored.",environment
"Hundreds of elephants died in Botswana earlier this year from ingesting toxins produced by cyanobacteria, according to government officials who say they will be testing waterholes for algal blooms next rainy season to reduce the risk of another mass die-off. The mysterious death of 350 elephants in the Okavango delta between May and June baffled conservationists, with leading theories suggesting they were killed by a rodent virus known as EMC (encephalomyocarditis) or toxins from algal blooms. “Our latest tests have detected cyanobacterial neurotoxins to be the cause of deaths. These are bacteria found in water,” Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Botswana department of wildlife and national parks, said in a news conference on Monday. “However we have many questions still to be answered such as why the elephants only and why that area only. We have a number of hypotheses we are investigating.” Local sources suggest 70% of elephants died near water holes containing algal blooms, which can produce toxic microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria. Toxins were initially ruled out because no other species died – except for one horse – but scientists now think elephants could be particularly susceptible because they spend a lot of time bathing and drinking large quantities of water. Reuben said the investigation looked at how mortality affected the elephant population and injuries on carcasses, as well as testing water samples at laboratories in Botswana, South Africa and the US. He said the cause was a “combination of neurotoxins” but declined to give further details and declined to say at which institutions tests had been carried out. “I hope that what the government has said is true because it rules out some of the more sinister things,” said Dr Niall McCann, director of conservation at UK-based charity National Park Rescue, who initially suggested the elephants may have been poisoned or died from an unknown pathogen. To test tissue samples they need to be kept in specific conditions and quickly transported to specialised laboratories, but this was not done in Botswana which fuelled speculation about potential causes. “Just because cyanobacteria were found in the water that does not prove that the elephants died from exposure to those toxins. Without good samples from dead elephants, all hypotheses are just that: hypotheses,” said McCann. In July, the government’s official count was 281 deaths but this has now risen to 330 deaths. Reuben said he would be monitoring waterholes for blooms next rainy season to avoid another die-off. “It is important to monitor now to effectively detect the growth of these algal blooms in the water”, he said. Climate change is increasing both the intensity and severity of harmful algal blooms, making this issue more likely to reoccur. McCann confirmed he was working with officials to set up regional early warning systems. Across the border in Zimbabwe, more than 20 dead elephants were found between Hwange national park and Victoria Falls in August, with concerns that the two incidents could be linked. Authorities currently believe this die-off was caused by a bacterial infection. One leading theory is that it was caused by a strain of a bacteria called pasteurella, which killed 200,000 Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan in 2015, says McCann. “There are various options. Thankfully the UK government has collaborated with the government of Zimbabwe to export these samples and now they’re going to be tested in the UK,” he said. If it is something relatively common scientists should be able to detect it. “However, new emerging infectious diseases are happening all the time and the more we look into epidemiology the more we discover we don’t know. So it could be a complete mystery again,” said McCann. A spokesperson from the UK government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said: “Our world-leading scientists are currently running tests on samples sent from Zimbabwe, and will share findings with Zimbabwe Parks as soon as possible.”",environment
"Decoy eggs made by a 3D-printer and fitted with satellite tags have been placed in sea turtle nests on beaches in Costa Rica to track the illegal trade of their eggs. A quarter of the fake eggs put among 101 turtle nests on four beaches in Costa Rica were stolen, with some eggs successfully tracked as they moved from thief to trafficker to consumer. The egg decoy, dubbed the InvestEggator, was developed by the conservation organisation Paso Pacifico to track the illegal raiding of eggs from nests buried in the sand for trafficking and sale to restaurants, bars and individuals as a delicacy. Researchers found that the decoys did not damage incubating embryos and could successfully track the illegal trade of green and olive ridley turtles eggs and identify trafficking routes, according to a study published in Current Biology. The early evidence suggests that the eggs do not travel far from the beaches where they are snatched. One of the fake eggs was taken close to a nearby residential property, another travelled 2km to a bar, while the farthest-travelled went 137km inland, spending two days in transit. In one case, the discovery of the transmitter-egg led to useful intelligence. Eleven days after the decoy stopped responding in Cariari, a town 43km from the beach, the researchers received photographs, sent from Cariari, of the dissected egg. They also received evidence about where the egg was purchased and how many had been exchanged – useful intelligence for the local authorities seeking to protect the eggs. Helen Pheasey of the University of Kent and lead author of the study said: “Knowing that a high proportion of eggs remain in the local area helps us target our conservation efforts. We can now focus on raising awareness in the local communities and direct law enforcement to this local issue. It also means we know where the consumers are, which assists us in focusing demand reduction campaigns.” According to Pheasey, it is less important to find the people who take the eggs from the beach than identify those who are trafficking and selling the eggs, often door to door, and identifying handover locations. “As trafficking is a more serious crime, those handover points are far more valuable from a law enforcement perspective than catching someone taking a nest,” she said. Not every decoy was successful at deceiving the thieves. Six fake eggs were recovered on the beach, suggesting they had been swiftly discovered and discarded by collectors. Out of the decoys that remained in untouched nests, 32% failed, probably because moisture penetrated the seals and damaged the transmitter. Although the decoys were set to transmit every hour, some also failed to transmit because they were moved to areas where they could not obtain a signal. Researchers said this would improve as infrastructure developed on the Caribbean coast. The decoys were designed by Kim Williams-Guillén for Paso Pacifico after she was inspired by the tracking devices used to monitor drug dealing in Breaking Bad and The Wire. She said: “In one episode of The Wire, two police officers plant an audio device in a tennis ball to surreptitiously record a suspected drug dealer. Turtle eggs basically look like ping-pong balls, and we wanted to know where they were going – put those two ideas together and you have the InvestEggator.” Williams-Guillén said she hoped the technology could be used to protect more turtle populations, as well as potentially be adapted to monitor egg thefts from crocodile and parrot nests, as well as track shipments of shark fins. But she said to eradicate the turtle egg trade it must be part of “a multi-pronged conservation approach that uses education, building better economic opportunities, and enforcement to help fight sea turtle egg-poaching”.",environment
"Around the world, Covid lockdowns have led to improvements in air pollution. In northern India, the Himalayas were visible in the distance for the first time in a generation. And during the first nine weeks of the UK lockdown, nitrogen dioxide along London’s roads decreased by an average of 31% compared with the pre-lockdown period. Non-essential shops in the capital reopened on 15 June but life and traffic pollution have still not returned to normal. Compared with 2019, decreases of more than 40% have been measured along roads in the City of London and Westminster, including the Strand and West End. This builds on the improvements from London’s ultra-low emission zone. But there are emerging signs of a return to pre-lockdown pollution on some suburban roads. The town of Horley, north-east of Gatwick, has recorded a 60% reduction in residential areas close to the airport fence and about 40% in a nearby children’s playground. UK government measurement equipment near Heathrow detected a 46% improvement. The biggest reduction was 64%, recorded near the entrance to the Beech Street tunnel, which is closed to diesel and petrol traffic.",environment
"In 1802, when French naturalist François Péron slipped a small, chunky Australian fish into a jar of preservative, little did he suspect that his unassuming prize would be the only member of its species ever known to science. The smooth handfish (Sympterichthys unipennis) was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List earlier this year. This strange and spiny bottom-dweller made history with its passing. It became the first marine bony fish to be listed as extinct in modern times. Today, all that remains of the species is that discoloured specimen in the Natural History Museum in Paris. Scooped up off the coast of south-east Tasmania, Péron’s catch was one of the 14 handfish species living in southern Australian waters at the time. The relatives of the smooth handfish are a colourful family which crawl around the seafloor using adapted fins as “hands”. They look like grumpy ageing punks, each sporting a dorsal fin over its head like a mohawk, bulging eyes and a cantankerous expression. As a family, they have a lot to be grumpy about. Since colonisation, human activity has caused their numbers to plummet. Seven species have not been seen for more than 20 years and three Tasmanian species, the spotted, red and Ziebell’s handfish, are listed as critically endangered. “The smooth handfish must have been relatively common to be among the first species collected on the continent,” says Prof Graham Edgar, a marine biologist at the University of Tasmania, whose work contributed to the IUCN listing. With no living specimens to study, Edgar and his colleagues have had to infer much of what we know about the species from Péron’s records. Péron was on board the Géographe, a vessel fitted out for research that was captained by Nicolas Baudin and sent to the southern continent by Napoleon. Collection methods were limited to lines, shallow water dip nets and seine nets. “No handfish has ever been caught by line,” explains Edgar, meaning the fish was most likely to have been caught with a seine or dip net, suggesting it was a shallow water species. If smooth handfish were so plentiful that Péron could easily scoop one up in his net, why did they disappear? “It’s not possible to single out this or that particular cause,” says Edgar. However, he believes that historical dredging for scallops and oysters, sediment runoff from industry and climate change are the most likely causes for the extinction. Local ecosystems have been dramatically degraded by these factors. “About 40% of shallow reef species in southern Tasmania are showing rapid population decline, the whole marine system in the south-east has changed substantially in the last 100 years,” he says. With sea temperatures increasing at about four times the global average, climate change is hitting south-east Tasmania hard. This has created what Edgar describes as a “climate trap” for coastal marine life. As warm water moves south, species that require cold, shallow water are losing habitat. “The loss of the smooth handfish is potentially part of a much bigger issue, as a large number of other species have dwindling populations and are heading towards extinction in this cold temperate location.” Extinctions are often caused by cumulative factors, agrees Dr Tim Lynch, former chair of the National Handfish Recovery Team (NHRT) and a senior researcher at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. When musing on the smooth handfish, he points to the destruction of the shellfish reefs which were once a dominant feature of south-east Tasmanian seas. These reefs were ripped apart by a rapacious oyster and scallop dredging operation in the early 20th century. The catastrophic biodiversity loss witnessed by this region was revealed by comparing core samples taken from these dredging sites. Sediment samples from 1890 show a mean of 21 bivalve species, whereas the 1990 samples contain a mean of seven. The shellfish industry collapsed within decades, but Lynch explains that the reefs’ capacity to recover has been hindered by the northern Pacific sea star (Asterias amurensis) – a ravenous, predatory species, introduced via ship ballast to southern waters. “That’s the habitat that the soft sediment species of handfish would have thrived in, but it’s gone now,” Lynch says. Although the smooth handfish had not being sighted for more than 200 years, it took Edgar, Lynch and their colleagues decades of doggedly surveying the marine diversity of southern Australia before they were confident beyond reasonable doubt it was extinct. Until recently there was always the slight hope that there might be a remnant population or individuals clinging to survival. “If the smooth handfish were a mammal, bird, reptile or plant it would have been listed as extinct years ago. Because it was a marine species there’s always been that element of doubt,” Edgar says. The last smooth handfish probably perished decades before the species was declared extinct, which raises the question: have other marine fish gone extinct without us knowing? “Almost certainly,” says Lynch. “The likelihood that [species] have not come to the notice of western science before they have become extinct is quite high.” This is because marine biodiversity is so broad, and surveying the sea is a harder task. He emphasises that marine plants and invertebrates might also be in more trouble than records such as the Red List suggest. Edgar agrees that a lack of data might be veiling the true extent of biodiversity loss in the ocean. He points to more thoroughly researched marine life such as corals, sharks and groupers. He says: “When you look at these groups the number of threatened species is actually similar in the sea to on land.” The underrepresentation of marine fish on the Red List has led to the comfortable assumption that marine fish are in less trouble than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts. The landmark listing of the smooth handfish as extinct shows us that the ocean is not too vast to be touched by the extinction crisis.

"A Guardian Country Diarist for 23 years, my friend Sarah Poyntz was inspired and sustained by the beauty of the Burren in County Clare, Ireland, where she made her home in the 1980s. Curiously, in a limestone area renowned for its vast range of rare Arctic-alpine plants, Sarah, who has died from cancer aged 93, was a galanthophile – her favourite flower was the humble snowdrop. When she moved to live in the Burren in 1986, she wrote to the Guardian asking if the paper would like some contributions. The editor of the section warned her not to hold out much hope since 300 people were on a waiting list to write a column. Undaunted, she began in 1987 and continued with a regular diary – the sole Irish contributor – until 2010. Sarah was born in New Ross, County Wexford, where her parents, Frank and Nellie (nee Murphy), both worked in a local law firm. She was educated at Loreto Abbey school in Gorey and University College Dublin, graduating with an arts degree before becoming a teacher and moving to England. There she taught at Callington grammar school in Cornwall and was later appointed head of the English department at the Perse school for girls in Cambridge, before spending a number of years travelling first in the US and then in France. On one occasion, in the early 60s, her love of France led her to spend an afternoon sharing a bottle of wine with Samuel Beckett in Paris. She had written to him asking if they could meet, and he sent a postcard arranging a rendezvous. The Burren, though, was Sarah’s adopted home. It was a place that held a bewitching appeal for her, not just because of the flora, but because of the wild sea on her doorstep and rapidly changing landscape moods. Evocatively, she documented the thrills of nature, along with stories of the flourishing local community, frequently invoking literary quotations. Field glasses in hand, she roamed the limestone hills as well as the shorefront at her house near Ballyvaughan, delighting in seeing the first spring gentian – the floral emblem of the Burren – or spotting the elusive pine marten. She quartered the ground, searching for mountain avens, twayblade, early purple orchid, geraniums and ferns. Many of her best ideas were found by walking the fields and pavement, stumbling across a dolmen, an ancient ringfort or fulacht fiadh (cooking site). One of her hobbies was building model boats. Sarah’s Guardian diaries were collected in an anthology, A Burren Journal (2000), dedicated to her partner, Mary Ann Radzinowicz, whose father had served as a general in the US Army alongside Eisenhower during the second world war. In 2005 she privately published a memoir of her early days in Wexford, Memory Emancipated, and in 2010 she edited Burren Villages: Tales of History and Imagination. She is survived by Mary Ann.",environment
"Water companies in England were responsible for their worst levels of environmental pollution in five years in 2019, leading to condemnation from ministers and the Environment Agency. In its annual assessment of the nine privatised water and sewerage companies, Emma Howard Boyd, the chair of the EA, said their performance continued to be unacceptable. More investment was needed by several of the companies wich were failing to protect the environment, she said. The environment secretary, George Eustice, and Howard Boyd are summoning the worst performing firms – South West Water, Anglian, Northumbrian and Southern – to a meeting to demand they “step up” and do better. But Nick Measham, of Salmon and Trout Conservation, said it was time for a review into how the industry was run. “This is utterly unacceptable,” said Measham. “The current water industry setup is not working. The companies are being run to maximise returns to their mostly private equity owners with the environment taking second place. A regulatory reset to ensure our rivers get the protection they deserve is essential if government aims for water are to [be] anything [other than] lame platitudes.” The damning assessment of the way water companies treat the environment comes after the poor state of rivers in England was revealed last month. No river in England was found to be in a good overall state, amid concerns over the scale of sewage discharges and agricultural and industrial chemicals entering the water system. The EA performance assessment published on Friday revealed there were 2,204 “pollution events” last year – the highest number since 2014 – marking the worst record for environmental pollution from the water industry for five years. Southern Water was responsible for 458 pollution incidents, nearly double its 2018 total. Serious pollution events that have a major impact on rivers or seas by the water companies have hardly improved, the report says. In 2019, there were 52 category 1 events – the most serious – compared with 56 in 2018, and 48 serious pollution incidents took place at sewerage facilities, more than half of which were from Anglian and Thames Water assets. Only Severn Trent and Wessex Water achieved the highest level of performance, with 4 star ratings from the EA. Howard Boyd said: “We expect much more. This includes developing, publishing and implementing specific plans by the end of this year to reduce pollution incidents. We will closely follow the delivery of these plans and will apply tough regulation to ensure companies stick by them.” Southern Water became the first company to be given a 1 star (poor) rating since 2015, and was one of four companies rated as poor or requiring improvement. It was fined a record £126m last year over “shocking” failures at the company’s sewage treatment sites that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. Eustice said: “Water companies have a responsibility to act as custodians of the environment and this report for 2019 shows that some are failing to take their obligations seriously. That is not good enough. Certain water companies must step up and do better, which is why I will be meeting those who are falling short of our expectations to discuss how we can work together to drive better performance.” Howard Boyd defended the action taken by her agency against companies that continued to pollute the environment. In the last five years, she said, the agency had brought 44 prosecutions against water companies, securing fines of £34m. Water companies are being told to implement plans to reduce pollution incidents by the end of the year, as part of an action plan to tackle their unacceptable performance. She pointed to a new storm overflow task force to tackle the scale of raw sewage pollution released by water companies into rivers. The task force was set up after the Guardian revealed that water companies discharged raw sewage from storm overflows more than 200,000 times in 2019. The five-year high for environmental pollution by the water industry comes as analysis shows that the sector has paid out £57bn in dividends since it was privatised 30 years ago. Dave Tickner, chief adviser on freshwater science at WWF-UK, said: “Our own prime minister told the UN it is time to turn words into action to address loss of nature. To do that our government must provide more resources for the Environment Agency so it can do the job the public expects. “It should also demand that the Agency uses these resources to clamp down on polluters. In addition, Ofwat should have a duty, passed on to water companies, to protect river health.” Philip Dunne, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Today’s report ... offers a bleak picture of the state of UK water and sewerage companies, and it is deeply alarming that four out of the nine companies assessed require improvement. There seems to be a level of complacency resulting in terribly poor performance. All water companies must crack down on pollution which can be deeply damaging to the natural environment and human health.”",environment
"Fewer than 1% of Australian manufacturing jobs are in gas-intensive industries that would materially benefit from a massive gas industry expansion proposed by the Morrison government, according to an upcoming analysis. A report by the Grattan Institute, to be released in November, examines the number of manufacturing businesses and jobs across the country that are heavily reliant on gas. Its results contradict a suggestion by Scott Morrison that gas could be central to plans to re-establish a strong economy after the coronavirus recession. In a speech in the Hunter Valley on Tuesday, the prime minister announced $52.9m for plans to increase gas supply and transportation infrastructure, and issued an ultimatum to electricity generators, warning taxpayers would build a gas power plant if the private sector did not. Morrison said a gas expansion would be particularly important for the manufacturing sector, which he said employed more than 850,000 Australians. He quoted a gas industry estimate that 225,000 manufacturing jobs were in industries that relied heavily on gas and needed a cheap, reliable supply. The Grattan Institute, a Melbourne-based thinktank, found about two-thirds of the gas used in manufacturing was consumed at just 15 facilities that together employ just over 10,000 people. Gas was found on average to make up at least 10% of the input costs at those facilities, where it is used as a feedstock and fuel source to make plastics, alumina and products based on ammonia and other chemicals. They are owned by just nine companies, including Qenos, Rio Tinto, Alcoa, Orica and Incitec Pivot. Across the rest of the manufacturing sector the cost of gas was found to be less than 0.5% of total inputs. Guy Dundas, an energy fellow with the institute, said nearly 6,000 of the manufacturing jobs that were heavily reliant on gas already had an affordable supply as they were based in Western Australia, where the price was about $4 a gigajoule – roughly half that being offered in contracts on the east coast. He said there were only between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs in heavily gas-reliant manufacturing in the east, which was a focus of the prime minister’s announcement. Tony Wood, the Grattan Institute’s energy director, said the analysis showed the idea the government could stimulate a gas-led recovery was “unlikely at several levels”. “Gas prices are unlikely to be very low again, and even if they were low they would not create serious economic stimulus because seriously gas-reliant industries don’t employ many people,” he said. Wood noted the jobs lost during the recession were largely in retail, entertainment and hospitality, not energy and manufacturing, and said a gas expansion would require the government to back the sort of proposals recommended in a leaked draft report by a manufacturing taskforce, including significant taxpayer underwriting of new gas infrastructure and involvement in developing gasfields. “Even if the government is prepared to subsidise the entire industry, that would have limited impact. That would seem an extraordinary proposition, and it doesn’t seem to be going down that path,” Wood said. He said the economic argument against a major gas expansion was also undermined by the trend towards adopting cheaper clean energy. Gas has about half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal when burned, but its impact on the climate is greater once leakage of methane, a relatively short-lived but highly potent greenhouse gas, is factored in. The government’s gas strategy includes the option of taxpayer underwriting for priority gas projects and the construction of a gas power station in the Hunter Valley if the private sector failed to replace the ageing Liddell coal plant in 2023. Morrison last week said the government estimated “some 1,000 megawatts” of new dispatchable electricity was needed to keep prices down after Liddell’s closure, but on Sunday he gave the ABC an updated estimate of “about 250 MW, or thereabouts”. Analysis released by the government has not included either estimate. The idea of a gas-led recovery has been championed by the government’s business advisers, including Nev Power, the former Fortescue executive, and Andrew Liveris, a former Dow Chemical executive and current Saudi Aramco board member. In a speech last week, Liveris declared Australia could hit net zero emissions by 2050 by significantly expanding supply and use of gas even though it would release heat-trapping emissions. Liveris compared the opportunity to develop gas in Australia with that in the US, where fracking for shale gas has led to a comparatively cheap supply. Wood said there was little evidence gas prices would stay low in Australia, or that lower prices would drive an expansion of manufacturing. Manufacturing was not expanding on the Australian east coast before prices rose significantly last decade, and manufacturing businesses were not substantially investing in Western Australia now, despite low prices there. Gas prices on the east coast roughly tripled for some users, from about $4 to about $12 a gigajoule, after an export hub opened in Queensland in 2014. About three-quarters of the gas produced is sold overseas and the domestic gas price has been effectively set by the Asian market. A recent report by the consumer watchdog said there was evidence some contract prices for 2021 had fallen to less than $7 in Queensland and between $7 and $8 in southern states, but many business were still buying gas for between $9 and $11, more than twice the historic price. Dundas said the report would also make clear gas basins being considered for development on the east coast contained a dry type of gas that was not suitable for many types of manufacturing that had increased in the US in recent years. The Narrabri gasfield in New South Wales and the Bowen and Galilee basins in Queensland contained little ethane, which is an important feedstock in complex chemical processes to create plastics. It would be suitable for production of ammonia-based fertilisers and explosives.",environment
"Nearly nine out of 10 UK households say they “regularly recycle”, with more prepared to further change their lifestyles to help the environment, research reveals. Statistics released on Monday by the Recycle Now campaign show despite the challenges and restrictions of lockdown, the UK appears to be becoming more environmentally aware. Shortly after the lockdown, 73% of consumers said they were willing to do more to help the environment, up from 68% in 2019. At the same time, 93% of UK households believe “everyone has a responsibility to help towards cleaning up the environment”. Just under one in 10 (9%) admit they recycle only occasionally and one in 25 (4%) “rarely” or “never”. Recycle Now is the government-funded national recycling campaign for England, managed by its waste advisory body Wrap and used by more than 90% of English authorities. The figures are published at the start of the 17th annual Recycle Week from research during lockdown and a bigger survey in July. “It’s fantastic to see that despite everything that has been thrown at them this year, more people than ever in the UK are taking responsibility for the environment by choosing to recycle,” said Peter Maddox, director of Wrap UK. “However, we still have a way to go in terms of correctly identifying what can and cannot be recycled.” On average, UK households dispose of 1.5 items each day that could be recycled in the general rubbish – mainly foil, aerosols and plastic detergent or cleaning bottles. The majority (82%) mistakenly put one or more items in the recycling that are not accepted by local collections, predominantly plastic film/wrapping, toothpaste tubes and glass cookware. Wrap says its own data shows recyclable tonnage surged by a quarter early in lockdown but with the exception of garden waste “most kerbside collections were maintained throughout lockdown”. Separate polling published on Monday reveals the challenges of recycling in densely populated areas, with one in three in Londoners admitting they find recycling information difficult to understand. The findings came from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which will unveil a partnership with Innocent drinks and environmental charity Hubbub to try to boost recycling rates. Households will be urged to help catch “recycling’s most wanted” such as drinks cans, yogurt pots and bathroom plastics, which belong in the recycling, but sometimes manage to escape. Gavin Ellis, co-founder of Hubbub, said: “Lockdown transformed the way we live and work, including our recycling habits and we know from our research that 43% of people are more concerned about plastic pollution than before Covid-19. At a hugely challenging time for local authorities, supporting households to recycle better is more important than ever before.”",environment
"Red sky at dawn and dusk is part of weather lore and apparently a cause for delight or warning among shepherds and sailors. But, as huge areas of forest burn, the crimson colour of skies over the western US is a red alert for our air pollution and climate emergency. Even in New York and Washington DC the sun turned orange. This is because smoke from wood burning strongly absorbs purple and blue light. Longer wavelengths pass through and the sky takes on shades of red. This curiosity can be useful. In 2005 Swiss scientists noticed that the particle pollution from wood stoves that filled Alpine villages in winter strongly absorbed ultraviolet light, opening a way to routinely measure wood smoke in our air. Smoke from other solid fuels can strongly absorb purple and blue light too. This may explain the colours in the pea-souper smogs that enveloped London up to the 1960s. In 1855, the Times described the November sky as having the changing colours of a bad bruise. Even in 1947, Arnold Marsh wrote of red and yellow smog-filled skies. It is these tricks of the light that inspired Claude Monet’s iconic paintings of the UK Houses of Parliament.",environment
"The Morrison government has said it refused to sign a global pledge endorsed by 64 countries committing them to reverse biodiversity loss because it was inconsistent with Australia’s policies. Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern and Boris Johnson are among world leaders who signed the Leaders’ pledge for nature which was launched on Monday ahead of a major UN summit on biodiversity being hosted virtually from New York. The summit is working towards a Paris-style global agreement on nature. The federal government was invited to sign but refused because the 10-point plan calls for commitments that are inconsistent with Australian policy – including a greater ambition to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and reach net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesman for Morrison said: “Australia has already committed to a net zero emissions target by the second half of the century as set out in the Paris agreement.” “We will not agree to other targets unless we can tell the Australian people what they will cost to achieve and how we will achieve it,” he said. The spokesman said “we want to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible” and pointed to the government’s recently released technology roadmap. Apart from Australia, other countries that didn’t sign the pledge include the United States, Brazil, China, Russia and India. The pledge warns humanity is in a state of “planetary emergency” due to the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation and climate change. It states that the decline of the natural world is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. “Nature fundamentally underpins human health, wellbeing and prosperity,” the pledge states. “We need to appropriately value nature and the services it provides as we make decisions and recognise that the business case for biodiversity is compelling.” Australia was recently singled out for mammal extinction in a UN report that found the world had failed to meet a single target to slow the loss of the natural world and preserve land and marine ecosystems. The pledge promises a stronger global effort to reduce deforestation, halt unsustainable fishing practices, eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies and begin the transition to sustainable food production systems and a circular economy during the next decade. Leaders promised to ensure “biodiversity, climate and the environment as a whole” were at the heart of responses to the economic crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Against the backdrop of Covid-19, which has crippled the world’s economies and pressured governments everywhere to begin the process of rebuilding and renewing, decisions made now will have ramifications for all of us and for generations to come,” the pledge states. Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should explain why Australia would not commit to a stronger effort to protect wildlife. “Australia is in the midst of an extinction crisis, 3 billion animals have died or were displaced by last summer’s bushfires and 12m hectares of land burnt . But the Morrison government doesn’t think we have a problem,” Butler said. The Greens environment spokeswoman, senator Sarah Hanson-Young, said a global target on extinction, similar to the Paris target, was necessary to stem the rapid loss of biodiversity. She said Australia was “squandering an opportunity” to take a leading role after the bushfire crisis, which accelerated the loss of habitat and wildlife and has forced the government to consider new threatened listings for iconic species, including the koala. “Our biodiversity is under significant threat and with it our tourism industry and local economy,” Hanson-Young said. “Australia’s lack of commitment at this summit is shameful and ultimately will be bad for our economy, as well as our environment.” Tim Beshara, federal policy director at the Wilderness Society, said world leaders who visited Australia were immediately introduced to a koala. “If prime minister Morrison isn’t willing to tell the world we are committed to ending species extinction in Australia, what level of extinction is he willing to tell Australians he is happy with?” he said. Sir Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), described the pledge as “outstanding” and praised the links leaders had made between the destruction of the natural world and the sustainable development goals. But Watson cautioned what was possible without the signatures of major polluters. “Many of the most important countries in the world that are causing climate change due to their emissions of greenhouse gases, and/or are destroying their biodiversity, are not signatures to this pledge. Without countries such as the USA, Brazil, China, Russia, India, and Australia we cannot succeed in achieving the Paris climate goal or halting and ultimately reversing the loss of biodiversity,” he said.

"It’s 10am and the hens are getting excited and bustling around. Jo and Charles Mear are approaching the hutches carrying blue crates and the birds, heads popping up, know what’s inside: black soldier fly larvae or maggots. Watching chickens peck around for maggots should be utterly normal. Insects are a natural part of a bird’s diet, but most hens today never see one in their lifetime. Instead, they are kept indoors and fed a grain- and soy-rich diet, typically in the form of pellets. But insects are rich in protein and essential micronutrients. They require less space, produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and have a high feed conversion rate. And if they could reduce, even in just a small way, the dominance of rainforest-destroying soy as the feed of choice for UK chickens, the benefits could be enormous. “[Soy is] our Achilles heel. It’s the best pound for pound source of protein so it’s hard to convince farmers to move away from it,” says Charles. Scientists at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization certainly believe they can, concluding that insects contain the necessary nutrients, especially protein, to replace between 25–100% of soymeal for chickens. And here, on this chicken farm in Cambridgeshire, an experiment is being carried out that might bring that reality a little closer. The Mears keep around 28,000 birds across two barns in Cambridgeshire, supplying branded free-range eggs to the Co-op, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Tesco. “We’re trying to produce a more sustainable ‘over the hedge’ farm here where we source everything we need as locally as possible. So finding a way to replace soy has been the next step for us,” says Charles.That opportunity presented itself when by chance he heard about two Cambridge graduates who had recently founded the insect startup Better Origin. “With the guys being so close by I just said to them to come and use our farm to trial the insects,” says Charles. In March they began hosting the UK’s first AI-powered insect mini farm in a shipping container unit, growing larvae using food waste. The specialised insect-breeding unit was built off-site and delivered straight to the farm. Batches of maggot eggs arrive every few days, and the insects are reared in an automated setup that tracks their growth using thermal cameras and AI. All Charles and Jo need to do is keep the unit supplied with energy and waste feedstocks. The larvae grow rapidly: “5,000 times its body mass in less than a couple of weeks”, according to Better Origin’s co-founder Fotis Fotiadis, and happily live off food and crop waste. After two weeks they are ready to be fed to the hens, and a new cycle of eggs is delivered to the farm to maintain a continuous supply of insects. The results have been unequivocally positive, say the Mears. The birds – a wonderfully healthy and energetic flock – love it: they’ve worked out the time of the day when blue containers of maggots, rather than ready-made feed, arrive, and get particularly excited when they see them coming. It has also encouraged the hens to carry out natural foraging behaviours, says Charles, who has noticed that as a result they seem less inclined to peck other birds. “Even after the maggots are all gone they carry on looking and stay active doing little scratch dances, which is really healthy for them.” “It also brings a reduction in floor eggs [eggs laid on the floor which are downgraded by retailers and not able to be sold as fresh eggs]. As they are looking for food they don’t feel comfortable laying eggs out and about in the communal areas so go back to their nesting boxes to lay eggs.” “Normally improved welfare outcomes come at a cost to productivity, but that’s not the case with feeding live insects,” says Fotiadis. “This is what chickens have evolved for millions of years to do, hunting and pecking around for their food.” Feeding live insects has also been found to have a positive effect on the birds’ immune systems – the Mears haven’t used antibiotics on their farm this year – offering the potential to reduce antibiotic use, which continues to rise in the poultry sector. For now, the ambition is to replace 5% of the birds’ soy-based diet with insects. And while the welfare and environmental benefits are already clear, the main selling point for farmers is economics, says Fotiadis, who calculates that supplementing diets with live insects can add 80p–£1 per hen of profit per year. “We know there are welfare benefits, but these are hard to monitor. But we can prove to the rest of the farming industry the financial benefit of incorporating insects. It increases productivity (the birds produce more eggs), the quality of the eggs (less floor eggs) and improves feather cover (poor feather cover is linked to the need for more feed). It works for the farmer and makes them more money,” he says. He and his team, who are installing a second insect-rearing unit on a chicken farm in Wales next month, have also tracked a 3% increase in shell strength in the hens’ eggs due to the rich source of calcium provided by the black soldier fly larvae. “This type of larvae is a missing link in the food chain. In nature there is no waste. The apple rots and is either absorbed by the soil or eaten and converted into nutrients by larvae. We take wasted nutrients and put them back into the food chain. It’s closer to nature and a much better way of farming,” says Fotiadis. Back on the farm, Charles Mear can’t get enough of seeing how much his hens are enjoying the insects. “Psychologically, the hen always wants to go out and scratch about to loosen the soil and look for grub. I just love coming and seeing them itching to get out of the shed and look for it [the larvae] now they know it is going to be there.”Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"He might not have had the best homing instincts. But a New Zealand native pigeon – or kererū – named Pidge made it back, eventually, to the place of his hatching after 24 years missing in the wild.  Pidge, who was hand-reared at Rainbow Springs – a wildlife and nature park in Rotorua, on New Zealand’s North Island – disappeared in 1996 and was not seen again before his return in August. That would make the bird, identified by a numbered band on his leg, 29 years old; most references list kererū lifespans as between 15 and 25 years. “To have Pidge up there almost 30, older than some of the keeping staff, was really exciting,” said Emma Bean, the kiwi hatchery manager for the park. He is likely to be the oldest living kererū, she added. The park is investigating reports that a slightly older bird might have lived at Hamilton Zoo and has since died. The kererū – which triumphed in 2018 New Zealand’s Bird of the Year contest – has a distinctive white feather apron and noisy wingbeats. They are known for their drunk, gluttonous nature – occasionally falling out of trees after an over-consumption of berries – and generously rounded shape. But Pidge was “skinny” and in poor condition when a keeper found him on the grounds of the National Hatchery at Rainbow Springs, Bean said. The park had kept his return a secret until they knew he was “doing all right,” and he had spent a month feasting on grapes and bananas. “He’s starting to show signs that he wants to fly, so we’ll be moving him into the aviary this week,” she said. Records did not show whether Pidge had absconded from the park in 1996 or was released, but keepers assume he had lived nearby and returned for “a bit of TLC in his retirement years” when feeding became a struggle, Bean said. An 88-year-old trout keeper and another long-time staff member remembered Pidge from the early 1990s and were “delighted” by his return which came at a rocky time, just before the park was able to reopen after New Zealand’s Covid-19 lockdown. International tourists have been barred from entering the country, and the park was forced to lay off some staff before receiving a one-off shot of government relief funds this month to cover operating costs. “It just syncs in really nicely with the fact that Pidge was hatched and raised here and has come home to roost,” said Bean. He had also returned home close to New Zealand’s annual kererū census, a citizen science project to find out how many of the birds remain. They are not considered an endangered species but numbers have fallen in recent decades. One mystery of Pidge’s homecoming remains: kererū are often seen in pairs and it is unknown whether he left behind a girlfriend when he returned to the park. Once Pidge moved to the aviary, keepers would look out for a bird watching him from outside, Bean said. “If he does have a partner out there I’m sure she’ll find him,” she said. “It’s only been a month … I hope she hasn’t moved on too quickly.”",environment
"Farmers need more support from the government to plant the trees necessary to meet the UK’s climate targets, ministers have been told, as they consider wide-ranging changes to farming payments after Brexit. Tree-planting is expensive, difficult and requires patience as the trees take years or even decades to yield commercial returns. Farmers and green campaigners are concerned that they will be left out of government plans to bring in a new interim subsidy system – called the sustainable farming incentive – to tide farmers over between the end of European subsidies this year, and the phasing in of new environmental land management contracts in 2027. The Soil Association is calling for clarity on how the sustainable farming incentive will encourage tree-planting, and also urging the government to include agroforestry – where trees are grown among or alongside crops, rather than in separate plantations – in its plans.  Most of the UK’s tree strategy is focused on planting new forests, or extending existing woodlands. But where trees can be planted alongside crops, they provide additional benefits such as more wildlife habitats, reduced water use and better carbon dioxide retention in the soil. Ben Raskin, head of horticulture and agroforestry at the Soil Association, said: “Planting more trees on farms can be a win-win for climate, nature and health, and would support the huge ambition of the government’s national tree strategy.  “It seems a no-brainer for the government to provide a supportive policy framework and more clarity on payments, to increase the uptake of agroforestry.” Tree-planting rates have fallen behind government goals, but if the UK is to meet its long-term aim of net zero emissions by 2050, about 1.5bn new trees will be needed, according to the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers. Only 13% of the UK’s land area is made up of woodland, far below the European average of about 38%. David Wolfe and his brother manage Wakelyns, a 22.7-hectare (56-acre) farm in Suffolk planted by his parents in 1994 as an example of how agroforestry can work. Crops including wheat, lentils and squash are planted in north-south alleys with trees between them.  Harvesting among the trees is made easy by the alley layout, and the trees stop soil erosion, help retain water in the soil and provide a habitat for wildlife. They also constitute a crop in themselves, including cherries, walnuts, figs and apricots, as well as trees for timber and coppiced willow and hazel for thatching, fencing and fuel. Wolfe is concerned that the government will provide incentives for farmers to plant new trees but leave out farms such as Wakelyns that have long grown trees. “Most incentive schemes are for farmers to change what they’re planting, but where you already have changed practices, you need support to maintain them,” he said. Planting the right trees on farms could boost farm productivity by about 30%, according to Soil Association estimates, as well as capturing carbon dioxide, improving soil health and providing improved habitats for wild plants, insects, birds and other wildlife. The group conducted a survey of 346 farmers that found many would be interested in growing more trees, but felt there was not enough support from the government. Andy Dibben, head grower at the 600-hectare Abbey Home Farm in Gloucestershire, started planting trees among his 6 hectares of organic vegetables three years ago. His aim is for the trees to provide shelter from the wind and protect against soil erosion, as well as a habitat for insects, birds and small mammals that keep down pests, instead of resorting to pesticides. He warned that ongoing support is needed to help farmers growing trees. “There’s a lot of talk about mass tree-planting, but the question is, how many of those trees will survive to full maturity? They need to be managed over years to get the full benefits,” he said. Tom Fairfax, who runs a mixed farm, the Mindrum Partnership on the Cheviots in Northumberland, said: “Government policy on agroforestry is often incoherent when applied in context – I recently discovered that, like many landowners, I have been implementing agroforestry for over 50 years without realising it. I’ve implemented much of my agroforestry in spite of, rather than because of, government policy.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The environmental land management scheme will create cleaner, greener landscapes, helping build towards the government’s tree planting goals and net zero commitments.  “We have been working closely with farmers and land managers to consider how agroforestry can fit into the new scheme, and how we can reward them for an array of environmental work, such as planting and maintaining trees.”",environment
"Despite a warm and sunny British summer, fewer butterflies than ever were recorded in each count by the biggest butterfly survey in the world. Record numbers of people took part in the Big Butterfly Count in July and August, with nearly 150,000 15-minute counts of butterflies taking place in parks, gardens, woods and nature reserves across the country. But the Butterfly Conservation survey reported the lowest average number of butterflies per count – 10.66 – since recording began in 2010. “Unfortunately, this summer has not seen an abundance of butterflies across the UK,” said Dr Zoë Randle, the senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation. “Coming so shortly after the recent WWF and UN reports on the global biodiversity crisis these 2020 results illustrate the perilous state of wildlife in the UK.” But the low numbers – down 34% on 2019 and worse than the dire wet summer of 2012 – may not be as bad as they appear because a record-breaking sunny spring caused many butterfly species to emerge earlier and complete their adult lifecycle before the count began on 17 July. The record number of 111,628 participants, a big increase on 2019, may also have included novice spotters who recorded fewer butterflies than regulars. Randle said: “An unusually warm spring led many species to emerge earlier than usual. So we may have only caught the tail-end of the flight period for many species during this year’s Big Butterfly Count. Our scientists will use the data to try and understand what is happening and how we can work to solve it.” The two most-seen species in the 2020 count, the large white and the small white, are typically seen in highest number at summer’s end. Big falls in the numbers of peacocks (down 42% on 2019) and small tortoiseshells (down 41%) may have been because these species had already entered into hibernation by the end of July. This year’s count recorded the highest number of butterfly sightings ever submitted, with a record number of participants, counts and overall butterflies seen, with 1.4m common species spotted. Randle added: “The fact that so many people take part in this exciting citizen science initiative is encouraging and makes a huge difference to our understanding of how the natural world is responding to the crisis it is in. Now we need to see initiatives both here and across the world to put nature on a path to recovery.” The Big Butterfly Count results are used to gather a picture of how flying insects are faring in Britain alongside a more scientific survey, the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, the longest-running scientific database of butterfly records in the world. Three-quarters of Britain’s 59 native butterflies are in decline and, while global heating is helping some species expand, common species continue to disappear from towns and countryside. From 1976, when scientific recording began, populations of “habitat specialists” – butterflies requiring specific places to survive such as chalk grassland or coppice woodland – fell by 59% by 2019. But within that decline, between 2014 and 2019 habitat specialists increased from 37% to 41% of their 1976 levels. Such figures recently published by the government suggest targeted conservation action has helped revive rare species. 1. Large white (+44%)2. Small white (+7%)3. Gatekeeper (-14%)4. Peacock (-42%)5.

"Britain’s oil and gas rigs are the most polluting in the North Sea oil basin, according to industry data, with enough unwanted gas burned off every year to heat a million homes. Oil rigs in the UK continental shelf (UKCS) released 13.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere last year, according to data from Rystad Energy, significantly more than those from the Norwegian and Danish regions of the North Sea, which produced 10.4m tonnes and 1.4m tonnes of CO2 respectively in the same year. The report found that oil rigs in UK waters released 3m tonnes of carbon through routine “flaring” of unwanted gas totalling billions of cubic feet. Another 10.1m tonnes of CO2 were released in large part because the industry regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), continues to allow oil producers to run their rigs on fossil fuels, according to Rystad. These figures suggest that the UK emits 21kg of carbon dioxide for every barrel of North Sea oil produced, compared to only 8kg of CO2 in Norway, where oil producers run their rigs on renewable energy. This could hold serious implications for the UK’s carbon targets if oil production from the UKCS is allowed to rebound by 25% in the 2030s in line with forecasts by Rystad. The figures have emerged eight years after the World Bank warned nations that global gas flaring contributes as much to climate crisis as a major economy such as Italy. Olga Savenkova, an analyst at Rystad Energy, said there is “significant room for improvement” in cutting the carbon intensity of the UK’s oil industry, including plans to run oil rigs in the UKCS on clean energy rather than fossil fuels. Hedvig Ljungerud, the OGA’s director of strategy, said on Monday that the regulator was “looking to take a robust stance on flaring”, which is carried out with consent from the OGA, only weeks after it had outlined plans to call for the industry to run their rigs on power generated by nearby wind turbines. The OGA was originally set up in the wake of the 2015 oil market crash with the mission to “maximise” oil and gas production from the UK’s ageing North Sea industry but it is now under pressure to reduce emissions, too after the UK set a legally binding goal to cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050. “We believe there are clear opportunities for industry to go further to advance cleaner production,” Ljungerud said.",environment
"My friend Barry Rydz, who has died aged 98, was a civil engineer who concentrated most of his efforts on trying to improve the UK’s water infrastructure. He was born in Salford, Manchester, to Reuben Rydz, a proofreader on the Manchester Guardian, and Matilda (nee Lister), a teacher. His mother died when he was three, and so Barry and his older brother, David, were brought up by a maternal aunt, Kate Lister. After attending Central High school in Manchester and then the Manchester College of Technology, during the second world war Barry joined the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and, having gained a good grounding in engineering as a result, afterwards got a job with ICI in 1947. That move marked the beginning of a distinguished civil engineering career: his 12 years with ICI, during which he focused on the modelling of water resources, were followed by five years with Binnie and Partners (1960-65), a firm of consulting engineers. My brother Max was employed there, and it was through him that Barry and I met. After working for Binnie and Partners on the Johore river supply to Singapore and the spillway design of the Mangla Dam in Pakistan, Barry spent nine years (1965-74) as the senior engineer and assistant director of the Water Resources Board, where he was responsible for developing an integrated water plan for England and Wales. Finally he was director of resource planning with the Severn Trent Water Authority. He retired in his 50s, frustrated by the fact that his radical plans for meeting future increases in water demand were thwarted by the government. After retirement he increased his involvement and support for the Liberal (later Liberal Democrat) party. He was a one-time vice-chairman of the Chippenham Liberal party, chairman of its sub-branch in Box in the Cotswolds, where he lived for 57 years, and a parish councillor in Box from 1979 to 1987, in which role he was involved in the restoration of the nearby Box railway tunnel, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He also founded the Box-based charity the Gambia Connection.  Barry loved classical music and was passionate about gardening, especially in “the jungle” he created at his home. He never married, and in his later years he became progressively more reliant on his long-term friend Alpha Baldeh, who cared for him with great dedication.",environment
"Homeowners in England can apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their homes more energy efficient through the government’s Green Homes Grant scheme, which opened this week. In most cases it will pay two-thirds of the cost of the energy efficient improvements, up to a maximum of £5,000 a household – but if you’re on a low income and on certain benefits you can claim the entire cost up to £10,000. The government has said the work must completed by 31 March 2021, which may prove a testing timeframe. To get the free money you have to commit to installing what the scheme calls a “primary” measure. This could be solid wall, cavity wall, underfloor, loft or roof insulation, or low-carbon heating, such as air-source or ground-source heat pumps, a biomass boiler or a solar thermal system. Experts predict more applications for heat-based measures but it is early days. Once that work is done you can also apply for vouchers to cover a number of “secondary” measures. These include double or triple glazing, energy-efficient doors or smart heating controls. Smart controls look likely to be the most popular secondary measure, which also includes the installation of thermostatic radiator valves. If you home needs cavity wall and floor insulation costing £6,000, you will only pay £2,000, with the government vouchers contributing the remaining two-thirds. Agree to install an £10,000 air-source heat pump and the government will contribute the first £5,000 – or the whole amount if you are on benefits including working tax credit, child tax credit, universal credit and disability living allowance. To apply you must have received at least one quote from a Green Homes Grant-registered installer. If the price seems unreasonably high, the scheme administrator may request that you provide another quote. If your application is successful, you will be sent a voucher to give to the tradesperson carrying out the work. You can get the vouchers, you must own a home in England. Eligible properties include park homes, those on long leaseholds and shared ownership. Landlords can also apply. While some people will want to spend their money on better insulating their home, replacing an old fossil-fuelled boiler with an air-source heat pump could be a good move. This typically costs £10,000-£12,000. Households can use the £5,000 voucher in conjunction with the government’s Renewable Heat Incentive payments – combined with the potential savings on your energy bill this could cover the full cost of the new system. While the scheme has built-in protections, to ensure that work can only be done by approved tradespeople who have registered with TrustMark, Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says scammers are sending emails about the scheme and using a bogus weblinks to steal personal data. Homeowners have also reported being cold-called and sent texts from people claiming to be offering insulation as part of the scheme. Be on your guard and only use reputable tradespeople.",environment
"A new British standard for biodegradable plastic is being published which scientists say will cut through a jungle of classifications that leave consumers confused. Plastic claiming to be biodegradable will have to pass a test to prove it breaks down into a harmless wax which contains no microplastics or nanoplastics in order to make the grade, published by the British Standards Institution. The benchmark for the new standard was reached by a British company called Polymateria, which has created a formula to transform plastic items such as bottles, cups and film into a sludge at a specific moment in the product’s life. Once the breakdown of the product begins, most items will have decomposed down to carbon dioxide, water and sludge within two years, triggered by sunlight, air and water. The products that can be transformed include the most common litter items, such as food cartons, food films and bottles. The biodegradable products created contain a clear recycle-by date, to show consumers that they have a timeframe to dispose of them responsibly in the recycling system before they start breaking down. The bio-transformation chemicals created by Polymateria are added to plastic in the manufacturing stage of an item, with a bespoke element in the formula for each type of plastic item being produced. Niall Dunne, chief executive of Polymateria, said in tests using the biotransformation formula, polyethylene film fully broke down in 226 days and plastic cups in 336 days. Currently many plastic products in litter persist in the environment for hundreds of years. “We have designed this around the consumer,” said Dunne.  “We wanted to cut through this eco-classification jungle and take a more optimistic view around inspiring and motivating the consumer to do the right thing. “We now have a base to substantiate any claims that are being made and to create a new area of credibility around the whole biodegradable space.” To meet the standard, the polymer has to pass tests which show it will biodegrade to a harmless state in real-world situations. Scott Steedman, director of standards at BSI, said: “Tackling the global challenge of plastic waste requires imagination and innovation. New ideas need agreed, publicly available, independent standards to enable the delivery of trusted solutions by industry. “PAS 9017 is the first stakeholder consensus on how to measure the biodegradability of polyolefins that will accelerate the verification of technologies for plastic biodegradation.” The new standard was sponsored by Polymateria, based at Imperial College, London and agreed after independent review and discussions with stakeholders in the industry, the waste and recycling group Wrap, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Chris Wallis, vice-president of innovation at Polymateria, said the formula was designed to complement a range of scenarios for responsibly disposing of plastic waste, including recycling and reusing in a circular economy. “If any of these systems fails, if there are leaks into the environment because of unmanaged waste, we finally have a solution,” said Wallis. “We want to be complementary and part of multiple solutions that will reduce the problem of plastic pollution on the planet. “If plastic waste is not disposed of correctly or if waste management system ends up leaking the plastic into the natural environment, this technology is designed to kick in to chemically operate and turn the material into harmless waxes.”",environment
"Toilets specially designed to save water are wasting more than they conserve, the UK’s largest water firm has warned. Campaigners have warned for years that dual-flush toilets, introduced as more efficient alternatives that were expected to use less than half the amount of water per flush, are more prone to leaks. The problem is said to be so great that the costs are outweighing the benefits. “Because there’s so many loos that continuously flow all through the day and night, collectively that water loss is now exceeding the amount of water the dual-flush design should be saving,” said Andrew Tucker, water efficiency manager at Thames Water. “The volume of water loss is getting bigger every day as more people refurbish and retrofit older toilets and as more homes are built, so it’s a growing problem.” The campaign group Waterwise has estimated that about 400m litres of water leak from UK toilets every day. It says that would be enough to supply 2.8 million people; equivalent to the combined populations of Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool and Bristol. The group has said that a single leaking toilet wastes an average of between between 215 and 400 litres of water per day and that between 5% and 8% of all toilets are leaky. And the majority of those use the newer dual-flush mechanism. Thames Water said poor design and materials cause water to flow continuously into the bowl. And, according to the BBC, the Bathroom Manufacturers Association has acknowledged that the design of many dual-flush toilets is inherently more prone to leakage. The majority of them use the drop valve system, which sits at the bottom of the cistern and opens to allow the water to flow out when the flush is pressed. Debris and other issues can cause the mechanism to fail to close, meaning water continually flows from the cistern and into the bowl. Older cisterns tend to use a siphon system, which works by pushing water upwards until it reaches a point at which it can flow into the bowl. Because that point is above the waterline when the toilet is not being flushed, the system is less likely to develop the same sort of leak. “A siphon will not leak whereas an outlet valve – if we look at the figures we’ve got – they could leak within a week of installation. It could be two years but they will leak,” said Jason Parker, the managing director of Thomas Dudley Ltd, one of the UK’s largest plumbing manufacturers. He told the BBC: “If we’re serious about wasting water and we want to stop it, the only way to do that is put a siphon back in.” Dual-flush toilets have two buttons that allow different quantities of water to flow. They typically put out four or six litres, with the smaller quantity meant for clearing urine. Waterwise has said that fixing leaky toilets could “contribute around 10% of the additional water capacity needed to cope with an extreme drought in England by 2050”.",environment
"Digging the vegetable garden, I uncovered a potato, overlooked in an earlier harvest. I wondered if it was fit for the pot, then noticed the small hole in the side. A long column of pale, centimetre-long, thread-like animals marched out into the sunlight and fell to the ground. I captured a few of the army that had hollowed out the potato. The first question, in my mental identification key to soil animals, was how many legs per segment? Easy: two, so they must be millipedes, not centipedes. Second question: total number of legs? Almost impossible to count, because they were never still. Scores of limbs rose and fell, in a rippling, undulating wave – mesmerising choreography that travelled the length of the animals’ bodies, in an endless cycle. Count the segments and multiply by two, perhaps? That wouldn’t help much. I had 15 of these restless creatures, of various sizes, in the collecting vial. Some were just a few millimetres long. As millipedes grow, they add more segments, like adding extra carriages to the end of a train. I couldn’t be certain that any was a fully mature adult, but the longest seemed to have about 40 pairs of legs. When I shook the captives, a thousand feet stampeded. Fortunately, this species has a convenient identification feature. They were spotted snake millipedes, Blaniulus guttulatus, given away by red spots on the flanks of most of their segments: ozopores, stink glands, reputed to repel predators. Now it was time to let them go. They loitered on the surface briefly, then disappeared into a crevice, to resume their subterranean lives. I imagined them, head tucked down, forcing their way through gaps in freshly dug soil, driven forward by a relentless rugby scrum of 40 pairs of short, powerful legs. Back to the digging, with the aroma of fresh, damp soil and mouldering leaves rising from every turn of the garden fork. Nearby, a hungry blackbird hurled fallen leaves aside, foraging for whatever morsels lay beneath. Among the scents of autumn, millipedes’ stink glands might not protect them from its attention but, in the deep, dark caverns of the soil, repulsive body odour might be the key to survival.

"One-fifth of the world’s countries are at risk of their ecosystems collapsing because of the destruction of wildlife and their habitats, according to an analysis by the insurance firm Swiss Re. Natural “services” such as food, clean water and air, and flood protection have already been damaged by human activity. More than half of global GDP – $42tn (£32tn) – depends on high-functioning biodiversity, according to the report, but the risk of tipping points is growing. Countries including Australia, Israel and South Africa rank near the top of Swiss Re’s index of risk to biodiversity and ecosystem services, with India, Spain and Belgium also highlighted. Countries with fragile ecosystems and large farming sectors, such as Pakistan and Nigeria, are also flagged up. Countries including Brazil and Indonesia had large areas of intact ecosystems but had a strong economic dependence on natural resources, which showed the importance of protecting their wild places, Swiss Re said. “A staggering fifth of countries globally are at risk of their ecosystems collapsing due to a decline in biodiversity and related beneficial services,” said Swiss Re, one of the world’s biggest reinsurers and a linchpin of the global insurance industry. “If the ecosystem service decline goes on [in countries at risk], you would see then scarcities unfolding even more strongly, up to tipping points,” said Oliver Schelske, lead author of the research. Jeffrey Bohn, Swiss Re’s chief research officer, said: “This is the first index to our knowledge that pulls together indicators of biodiversity and ecosystems to cross-compare around the world, and then specifically link back to the economies of those locations.” The index was designed to help insurers assess ecosystem risks when setting premiums for businesses but Bohn said it could have a wider use as it “allows businesses and governments to factor biodiversity and ecosystems into their economic decision-making”. The UN revealed in September that the world’s governments failed to meet a single target to stem biodiversity losses in the last decade, while leading scientists warned in 2019 that humans were in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems. More than 60 national leaders recently pledged to end the destruction. The Swiss Re index is built on 10 key ecosystem services identified by the world’s scientists and uses scientific data to map the state of these services at a resolution of one square kilometre across the world’s land. The services include provision of clean water and air, food, timber, pollination, fertile soil, erosion control, and coastal protection, as well as a measure of habitat intactness. Those countries with more than 30% of their area found to have fragile ecosystems were deemed to be at risk of those ecosystems collapsing. Just one in seven countries had intact ecosystems covering more than 30% of their country area. Among the G20 leading economies, South Africa and Australia were seen as being most at risk, with China 7th, the US 9th and the UK 16th. Alexander Pfaff, a professor of public policy, economics and environment at Duke University in the US, said: “Societies, from local to global, can do much better when we not only acknowledge the importance of contributions from nature – as this index is doing – but also take that into account in our actions, private and public.” Pfaff said it was important to note that the economic impacts of the degradation of nature began well before ecosystem collapse, adding: “Naming a problem may well be half the solution, [but] the other half is taking action.” Swiss Re said developing and developed countries were at risk from biodiversity loss. Water scarcity, for example, could damage manufacturing sectors, properties and supply chains.  Bohn said about 75% of global assets were not insured, partly because of insufficient data. He said the index could help quantify risks such as crops losses and flooding.",environment
"A surfer is missing after receiving “a serious shark bite” in front of fellow surfers at a beach near Esperance in Western Australia. Police on Friday evening said several witnesses had seen the man being attacked at Kelp Beds beach in Wylie Bay before 11am local time. A surfboard with “obvious signs of shark attack” was recovered a short time later. “There were approximately six to eight surfers that were in the water at the time and a number of bystanders on the beach as well that all witnessed the attack,” Sen Sgt Justin Tarasinski told reporters on Friday. “So yeah it was busy at the time. A number of witnesses have seen the attack occur. We have obviously taken some witness accounts but we won’t go into detail on those accounts just at this point in time.” The state’s premier, Mark McGowan, revealed that another surfer had tried to pull the victim away from the shark. “Unfortunately he hasn’t been recovered at this point in time,” the premier told reporters. “It’s a very, very difficult and potentially tragic situation happening in Esperance.” The popular beach has seen shark attacks before. Laeticia Brouwer, 17, died following a shark bite at the same beach in April 2017. In 2014, surfer Sean Pollard lost an arm and his other hand in a shark attack at the same site. Witnesses told Nine newspapers that they had seen a shark while swimming in the water moments before the attack. “I spotted a shark, 2.5-3 metres big, about 50 to 100 metres away. I called out to [my partner] to get out and next minute we had [ambulances] fly past us,” Sammy Bamford said. Tarasinski said a large search crew had been looking for the surfer. It included two surf life saving jet skis, two volunteer Marine Rescue vessels, and two other vessels. The senior sergeant said the surfer’s board had washed up on the beach not long after the attack. “The surfboard washed up nearby to where the attack occurred with obvious signs of shark attack,” he said. “The search will continue today as long as conditions are favourable and for as long as those conditions allow us.” An earlier statement from the WA primary industries department said it was helping police with “a serious shark bite incident at Kelp Beds beach in Esperance”. Boats were in the water as part of a marine search and rescue operation, the statement said. Beaches were closed from Wylie Head to Cape Le Grand National Park. Earlier this week, drone footage captured professional surfer Matt Wilkinson’s narrow escape from a great white shark measuring about 2.5 metres off the coast of Ballina in northern New South Wales. There have been six confirmed deaths from shark bites in Australia in 2020. Experienced diver Gary Johnson, 57, was killed by a shark near Cull Island in Esperance on Western Australia’s south coast in January. A shark killed 23-year-old Queensland wildlife ranger, Zachary Robba, in April off North West Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Gold Coast surfer Rob Pedretti, 60, died after he was attacked at Salt Beach at South Kingscliff in northern NSW in June. In July, a 36-year-old Sunshine Coast man died after being mauled while spearfishing off Queensland’s Fraser Island. Later the same month, a teenager died while surfing at Wilsons Headland at Wooli Beach off northern NSW. A 46-year-old Gold Coast man, Nick Slater, died in September after being bitten by a shark while surfing at Greenmount Beach at Coolangatta.",environment
"The mass die-off of thousands of songbirds in south-western US was caused by long-term starvation, made worse by unseasonably cold weather probably linked to the climate crisis, scientists have said. Flycatchers, swallows and warblers were among the migratory birds “falling out of the sky” in September, with carcasses found in New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona and Nebraska. A USGS National Wildlife Health Center necropsy has found 80% of specimens showed typical signs of starvation. Muscles controlling the birds’ wings were severely shrunken, blood was found in their intestinal tract and they had kidney failure as well as an overall loss of body fat. The remaining 20% were not in good enough condition to carry out proper tests. Nearly 10,000 dead birds were reported to the wildlife mortality database by citizens, and previous estimates suggest hundreds of thousands may have died. “It looks like the immediate cause of death in these birds was emaciation as a result of starvation,” said Jonathan Sleeman, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, which received 170 bird carcasses and did necropsies on 40 of them. “It’s really hard to attribute direct causation, but given the close correlation of the weather event with the death of these birds, we think that either the weather event forced these birds to migrate prior to being ready, or maybe impacted their access to food sources during their migration.” The first deaths were reported on 20 August at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, with accounts of birds appearing lethargic and congregating in groups before dying. Most deaths happened around 9 and 10 September during a bout of cold weather that probably meant food was particularly scarce. In a weakened state, the birds seemed to become disorientated, flying into cars and buildings, some dying on impact and others landing on the ground, subsequently dying from cold temperatures or being eaten by predators. “We’re not talking about short-term starvation – this is a longer-term starvation,” said Martha Desmond, a professor in the biology department at New Mexico State University (NMSU), who collected carcasses. “They became so emaciated they actually had to turn to wasting their major flight muscles. This means that this isn’t something that happened overnight.” The birds probably would have started their migration in poor condition, which could be related to the “mega-drought” in the south west of the country. “Here in New Mexico we’ve seen a very dry year, and we’re forecast to have more of those dry years. And in turn I would say it appears that a change in climate is playing a role in this, and that we can expect to see more of this in the future,” said Desmond. “I think it’s just very sad,” she added. “Especially the thought that we are seeing some long-term starvation in some of these birds.” Sleeman could not say if this event was directly related to climate change but acknowledged that it is making extreme weather events more likely. Desmond previously described seeing so many individuals and species dying as a national tragedy. Most of the birds were insect and berry eaters that migrate from tundra landscapes in Alaska and Canada to winter in Central and South America. Most of them have to stop and refuel every few days on their migration. Concerns were raised about wildfires in California causing birds to re-route their migration inland over the Chihuahuan desert but necropsies showed no smoke damage in their lungs. The centre also ran tests for contagious bacterial and viral diseases, parasites and evidence of pesticide poisoning, all of which came back negative. Allison Salas, a graduate student at NMSU, said the volume of carcasses she had collected had given her chills. She said: “The fact that we’re finding hundreds of these birds dying, just kind of falling out of the sky is extremely alarming.” Desmond’s team is hoping to get funding to support more research into mass die-offs in birds so they can better monitor what is happening. Sleeman agreedthat large-scale mass mortality wildlife events are happening more frequently. “It’s something we definitely need to keep track of,” he added.

"The steep way up to James and my sister Mary’s documented orchard of local varieties is littered with shoals of trampled apples – too small to have been much temptation for the youngsters who dared to scrump in our grandparents’ day. Clusters of berries cover a 50ft holly beside an outgrown Norway spruce, while hazels in the sheltering hedge banks show tight catkins among fading leaves, and dark red haws load thorns. Cidery smells exude from fallen apples such as Mr North’s Cornish Pine, now surplus to the earlier juicing sessions; remains of Mrs Bull’s, a spectacular large crimson apple, lie almost submerged in bedraggled grass. Heavily laden boughs have split from the Herefordshire Pippin, but the fragrant, orange-striped apples hang on to intact branches, unlike the Listener, which has dropped all its primrose coloured fruit (shown by genetic tests as synonymous with Early Bower and the Sack and Sugar). As the afternoon sun shines through the turning leaves of cherries, a speckled wood butterfly pitches on a carpet of Hocking’s Green, but the yellowish-green Long Keeper and Hambling’s Seedling remain fixed to leafless twigs. Arching canopies spread across the avenues of maturing productive trees, with some sturdy trunks encircled in distinctive drifts of neglected early fruit such as Lizzy, conical-shaped and bright green, which was found at Golant above the River Fowey. The best keepers have been carefully gathered, stored in shallow drawers in the mouse-proofed, insulated shed. King Byerd, extra large this year, should last until May; Cornish Aromatic, with complex perfumed flavours, improves with keeping; the newer Christmas Pippin – officially named after trialling and patenting by an enthusiast who found the original chance seedling just off the M5 near Bristol – is another long-lasting dessert apple. Today, James and Mary are having a break from juicing, picking and the clearing away of prunings from the highest cherry trees – by visiting a cider maker on the north Cornwall coast. They have taken samples of their prolific Colloggett Pippin, the Philleigh, Trecarrell Mill Number 1 and Whitpot Sweet – too late to supplement this year’s sparse crops from orchards in that exposed and windy area, but perhaps useful in the future if the producer can organise pickers and transport for the fruit.",environment
"The river at the bottom of our garden is like a gigantic rain gauge. Normally it is a humble tributary, lurching past the garden almost grudgingly, with its head down, with barely the current to stir the duckweed. But after the deluges of the past few days, it has morphed into a confident swirl. Two things always happen when it gets into its macho flow. The first is that the otter appears, as it did today. The strength and heft of the main River Stour across the fields is perhaps a deterrent, a little too tiring for fishing, so the otter re-routes to our more manageable stretch. The other event is that our kingfishers vanish. Until recently the tributary has been a kingfisher highway. The pint-sized rockets of electric blue have been whizzing past every few minutes, making observation a little like a slowed down tennis match, head turning one way, then the other. The local pair had a brood, and several youngsters have used the backwater for training. They need it, too. Peering down into the sleepy shallows, they learn to adjust for refraction, to compensate for wind and rain, and figure out where the minnows like to hide. But their apprenticeship has been rudely interrupted by the floodwater. The river’s hissy fit has unsettled the social cohesion. There are fewer comfortable spots to fish, and those are taken up by territorial adult kingfishers and a few domineering youngsters. For several weeks we have seen skirmishes, individuals laying claim to their own stretch, as anglers often do. The kingfishers chase and jostle with iridescent incandescence, in deadly earnest, because a winter territory is a significant prize. Now that the first floods have come, the losers are being evicted and must take their chances elsewhere. Sometimes, apparently, siblings leave town together. Displaced kingfishers settle by lakes and marshes, and down here in Dorset a significant number also find their way to estuaries and coasts, where they look decidedly incongruous on seawalls and jetties. It’s a harsh reality that many don’t survive. Now that the torpor of early autumn has gone, we won’t see many more kingfishers on our stretch. We’ll miss them – and fear for them, too.",environment
"A new report has exposed the scale and impact of mining on indigenous reserves in Amazon countries as gold prices soared during the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 20% of indigenous lands are overlapped by mining concessions and illegal mining, it found, covering 450,000 sq km (174,000 sq miles) – and 31% of Amazon indigenous reserves are affected. The report, released on Wednesday by the World Resources Institute, said indigenous people should be given more legal rights to manage and use their lands, and called for better environmental safeguards. As pressure mounts over the issue, a leading Brazilian thinktank has called for regulations tracing gold sold by financial institutions. “The extent of mining concessions and illegal mining areas that overlap indigenous areas in the Amazon is much more significant than many people thought,” said Peter Veit, director of the WRI’s Land and Resource Rights Initiative, and one of the report’s authors. It used geospatial analysis and literature and science reviews, and estimated that half a million small-scale goldminers are active in the Amazon region. Only half of legal mining concessions in the Amazon are active, Veit said. But with mining seen by many Amazon countries as key to development, that could change. In Brazil, the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sent a bill to Congress to formally legalise mining on protected indigenous reserves. “The implications for the environment and for indigenous peoples could significantly increase if those concessions that have yet to be allocated were to start up,” Veit said. Rising gold prices – which hit nearly $2,100 (£1,625) an ounce in August – have helped to drive wildcat miners into the Amazon. “Gold prices had been rising for years but the threat to economies from the novel coronavirus led to a surge in prices – up about 35% this year – as investors sought the perceived safety of gold. As prices rise, so does demand and mining,” the report said. In Brazil, invasions of indigenous lands by garimpeiros – as wildcat miners are called – have increased since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. Many voted for Bolsonaro after he promised to legalise their work. In 2019, deforestation caused by garimpeiros in the Amazon rose 23% on 2018 to a record 10,500 hectares (26,000 acres), O Globo newspaper reported in May, following a freedom of information request to the environment agency Ibama. Army operations have failed to clear tens of thousands of miners from Brazil’s biggest indigenous reserve, the Yanomami. From October 2018 to March 2020 alone, nearly 2,000ha were degraded by mining in the reserve, the report said. The Munduruku Indigenous Reserve in the Brazilian Amazon state of Pará has been heavily affected. Garimpeiro investors have paid local indigenous people to help them enter the reserve and work within it, said Ademir Kaba Munduruku, a local leader. “This has been imitated by other Munduruku and become a big problem,” he said. “Alcoholism, prostitution, drugs, violence, division within the Munduruku people, contamination of river beds have all increased.” Federal prosecutors are investigating whether a Brazilian air force plane flew indigenous garimpeiros from his region to Brasília for a meeting with the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, during a military operation to control illegal mining, following media reports. The operation was suspended. The Brazilian thinktank Instituto Escolhas (Choices Institute) has opened a public consultation for a proposal it will present to Brazil’s central bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate gold purchases, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported. Garimpeiros presently just need to show ID and sign a form, it said. Brazilian gold exports rose 35% from January to August, hitting $3bn, Folha said. Legal mining can also come at a high cost, Veit said. “Many companies don’t adhere to the law, the letter of the law, many don’t seem to adhere to their agreements with the government,” he said. Case studies from Peru and Ecuador document legal struggles between indigenous groups, governments and mining companies. In Guyana, Patamona indigenous people from Campbelltown involved in artisanal mining have “shown some willingness” to work in a more sustainable way, banning mercury and rehabilitating mining sites, the report said. During a virtual press conference on Wednesday, Michael McGarrell, human rights coordinator for the Amazon indigenous organisation COICA, said his Patamona indigenous people in Guyana had long practised traditional, low-impact, artisanal mining. “Our people were mining before anyone came; however, it was done in a way that [meant] it had minimal impact and it continues to this day,” he said. But Amazon indigenous peoples lose out when mining companies and illegal operations enter their land. “We are under siege from legal and illegal mining and our governments are doing little to enforce the rights that do exist,” McGarrell said.",environment
"Heathrow will argue in the supreme court this week that its proposed third runway would only ever be built in accordance with Britain’s climate commitments, as it seeks to overturn a court of appeal verdict that stopped the airport’s expansion plans. A two-day hearing starts on Wednesday which could allow Heathrow to proceed once more with building an additional runway.  The expansion plans were approved in principle by parliament in 2018, under Theresa May’s government. Legal action by climate campaigners initially failed to force a judicial review. However, in a landmark judgment, the court of appeal ruled in favour of the case brought by the environmental litigation charity Plan B and Friends of the Earth. Judges found that ministers had failed to take adequate account of Britain’s climate commitments under the 2015 Paris climate agreement when drawing up the aviation national policy statement (ANPS) which permitted Heathrow expansion. The new government under Boris Johnson, a long-time opponent of the third runway, accepted the court ruling in February, leaving Heathrow to challenge it alone. The airport will argue that the runway will be bound to comply with Britain’s carbon targets when it seeks to obtain planning permission, regardless of whether the then transport secretary, Chris Grayling, adequately took account of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The hearing will be conducted by video conference because of Covid-19 restrictions, and streamed live online. The verdict is not expected to be delivered until at least January. Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, said the government could “at least see a problem in admitting it’s not taking the Paris agreement seriously, given that maintaining the Paris temperature limit is vital to our collective future … Heathrow Airport Limited, however, has no such concerns.” A Heathrow spokesperson said the airport fully expected to be held to account over climate obligations through the planning process, and that the ANPS made clear that approval for its runway “would be refused” if it had a material impact on the UK’s ability to meet its carbon reduction obligations. ”We’re appealing to the supreme court to allow this thorough planning process to proceed as it was designed. “Given the timescales required to deliver complex infrastructure of this scale in the UK, it’s critical that we get on with laying the groundwork today for future operations that will be essential for a successful global Britain in the decade after Brexit,” they added. The battle for expansion comes despite the pandemic leaving Heathrow with only a fraction of its normal air traffic and requiring just one runway to operate. The Unite union is balloting for a strike over plans by Heathrow to impose pay cuts of up to 20% on long-serving workers, which the airport has defended as a means to preserve jobs. John McDonnell, the Labour MP for the neighbouring Hayes and Harlington constituency, accused Heathrow of exploiting the pandemic to reduce wages, adding: “There is no excuse for the company imposing permanent wage cuts when we know that this crisis is temporary.”",environment
"Super-smart gulls flock to school playgrounds shortly before break times in order to hoover up the scraps, a study has shown. The birds also target rubbish dumps, but mainly on weekdays when fresh waste is being delivered. Having a snack snatched from your hand by a greedy gull is already a common, if unwelcome, occurrence. But the latest research shows the birds are even smarter than thought: they know where and when their meals are being served. The research was conducted in Bristol but related behaviour has been reported from Spain to Japan. The scientists think that the gulls’ ability to adapt to a human timetable is one reason populations of gulls have soared in cities in the last 40 years. In Bristol, the researchers followed herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls that nest on roofs near the city centre. A dozen had small GPS backpacks fitted in order to track their movements and the scientists also observed their behaviour at their favourite feeding spots in the summer of 2018. “They are super-smart,” said Anouk Spelt, at the University of Bristol. “At the school there were not many gulls around until break time. Then you saw them sitting on the rooftops. The moment the bell went off, they all flew up and started looking for leftovers.” She said she was not too surprised at the gulls’ ability to learn when food was available as they had heard stories, including birds regularly knocking on windows at 6pm looking for dinner leftovers. “We’d heard all these anecdotes but now we can show it’s definitely true,” Spelt said. The research is the most in-depth analysis of how urban gulls find food. Another recent study in Spain showed yellow-legged gulls can time their visits to rubbish dumps. Earlier work in Japan showed gulls visited fish processing plants and markets at the best times. The analysis, published in the journal Ibis, showed the average number of gulls present at the school was three times higher when the children were outside eating their snacks or packed lunches at morning break or lunchtime. The scientists spent a month observing a school, a waste site and a park. The GPS data showed the gulls visited 25 schools, with their visits always most common at break times. At the rubbish site, new waste was only unloaded during working hours on weekdays and this was when the most gulls flew in. “The predictable timing of food at these sites appears to have resulted in the birds adopting a sit‐and‐wait approach, instead of actively searching for food,” said the researchers. “This may allow them to minimise the time and energy foraging.” The gulls’ visits to the park were usually in the early morning and did not coincide with human activity. Instead, the researchers saw them searching for worms and insects, which are present in higher numbers during these early hours. “Most people don’t really like gulls – they are aggressive,” said Spelt. “So we wanted to show why these gulls are in cities and what moves them to be around humans.” Cities offer safer rooftop nesting sites, warmer temperatures and more readily available food. “So there are many different reasons, but we now think that [the ability to adapt to human timetables] is one of them,” she said. Spelt hopes research like this will help councils better understand gull behaviour and manage potential nuisances. For the problem of food being snatched out of people’s hands, other researchers reported a solution last year. Extensive tests in Cornish towns showed the bold birds back off from your snacks if you stare them out.",environment
"Illegal and destructive practices by industrial trawlers in Ghana have led to one of the worst overfishing crises in west Africa, with small pelagic species known as “the people’s fish” driven almost to the brink of collapse. Scores of small-scale fishers are now fighting back against illegal trawlers using a smartphone app that allows them to record, log and report any alleged fishery crimes they spot out at sea. Evidence gathered via the app, developed by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), an NGO working in Ghana and other west African countries to help combat overfishing, was used to report an alleged infraction of fisheries law to Ghana’s Fisheries Commission late last year. A canoe fisher who spotted an industrial trawler with its nets allegedly within the six-mile nautical exclusion zone reserved for small-scale fishers, used the app to photograph and film the boat, and a report was submitted to the Ghanaian government. When a user spots a vessel they believe is illegally fishing, coming too close to shore, or damaging canoes or gear, they use the app to take a photo of the boat, with its name or identification number. The app records the location and uploads it to a central database, managed by the EJF, where it can be used to catch and penalise perpetrators. The tool, called Dase, which means “evidence” in Fante, is also being developed for use in Liberia, where dangerous clashes between canoes and industrial trawlers have been reported. Researchers predict the total loss of small pelagic fish populations, the staple of coastal communities in Ghana, within five years unless urgent action is taken. “Illegal fishing is causing the collapse of Ghana’s staple fish stocks and the loss of food security, livelihoods and tens of millions of dollars in national revenue,” said Nana Jojo Solomon, executive member of the Ghana National Canoe Fishermen Council, at the launch event in Cape Coast. “This app means canoe fishers no longer have to stand by while industrial vessels fish illegally in their fishing grounds.” So far 100 small-scale fishers from communities active in surveillance along Ghana’s 350-mile coast have downloaded the app, according to EJF, which developed the app based on the Collect software platform under the EU-funded Far Dwuma Nkodo project.",environment
"During a break in the rain, I dashed down to the greenhouse at the bottom of the garden. I was seduced into lingering too long. A torrential downpour is hammering on the roof. It’s 70 paces back to the house, far enough away to be soaked to the skin: I’m trapped for a while. This creaky, leaky 8ft-by-6ft house of glass and aluminium is 40 years old. In autumn last year, an overhanging branch crashed through the roof during a storm. The decision to repair or demolish was made on a coin toss: heads; the frame was bent back into shape and reglazed, in time to plant pots of bulbs whose flowers brightened this spring over the Covid-19 lockdown. Despite the cacophony on the roof, and a dripping leak, it’s snug in here. There’s a pleasant aroma of damp earth, with a hint of rosemary and lavender fragrance from rooted cuttings. Shoots from the first of next spring’s daffodil bulbs are already poking through the soil in their pots. And some wildflower seedlings, from pinches of seed collected on autumn walks, are sprouting. Nothing in gardening is quite so satisfying as raising plants from seed, watching from the moment the embryonic root breaks through the seed coat to the unfurling of the first flower petals. Some wildflowers need winter’s chill to break their dormancy, but mignonette, agrimony and angelica are already through, their first leaves clasped like hands in prayer as they push up through the soil, then splaying wide to catch the brief daylight hours. The star performer is fox-and-cubs hawkweed, Pilosella aurantiacum. Its fulvous flowers, like miniature dandelions, the colour of glowing embers, were the reason for collecting seeds, but now I can see that the emerging leaves have their own peculiar beauty. Each is protected, above and below, by stockades of tall, silvery hairs. The sound of rain on the roof is fading, but I’m in no hurry to leave. Coaxing seedlings through the damp, cold winter months can be tricky; some will likely succumb to grey mould. But sowing them now, during lockdown, seemed like a small gesture of faith in the future, with the promise of brighter days to come.",environment
"Fur has never been less fashionable. In recent years a raft of designer labels – Gucci, Chanel, Versace, Armani, Coach and Prada, to name a few – have gone fur-free. In 2018, London fashion week banned fur from its catwalks. Celebrities have given up fur too, from the queen of social media, Kim Kardashian West, who announced that she had “remade” all of her fur coats in fake fur in 2019, to the Queen of the UK, Elizabeth II, who renounced fur in “any new outfits” the same year. Even US Vogue editor Anna Wintour – whose fox and mink coats were once as much a front row staple as her dark sunglasses – has been wearing fake fur recently, turning up to fashion week events in “fur-free” coats by Gucci and Stella McCartney.The recent development of luxurious, realistic-looking fur-free furs has helped some brands shed the animal hide from collections. So, too, has the zeitgeist: in the UK, interest in veganism quadrupled between 2014 and 2019, while 93% of the British population does not wear fur, according to a Humane Society International/YouGov poll.Even Fendi, which started life as a fur house in 1925, has scaled back its use of animal hides, emphasising the less controversial parts of its offering – from lace dresses to handbags – at recent catwalk shows. But fur still exists, for a certain customer who can afford, for example, a grey £14,900 inlaid mink parka or a £290 fox Pom-Pom bag charm, both currently selling on the Fendi website. Louis Vuitton, too, has customers who are fond of fur, as evidenced by current wares that include a £7,900 fox intarsia jacket and a £32,500 mink coat. China represents 80% of the fur trade, according to Jing Daily, and 35% of overall luxury spending. Euromonitor projects that the manufacture of fur in China will rise from £6.6bn last year to £6.9bn in 2021. Russia and the US are big fur markets, too, as is South Korea (one of that country’s best-known female rappers was photographed in a very real-looking fur coat this week). In the west, however, though fur still has its fans – the US produced £346m worth of fur for clothes and apparel in 2019, according to Euromonitor – fewer high profile figures will be photographed in a full fur coat. Outliers include Jennifer Lopez, who wore a huge fur coat in much of the 2019 movie Hustlers, though she was protested against at the movie’s premiere. Hip hop stars, including Cardi B and Diddy, have also been photographed in fur. Fur occupies a significant position within African American culture, Jasmine Sanders wrote in the New York Times last year, adding that “there is a sense among many black women that this broader, cultural disavowal of fur has coincided with our increased ability to purchase it.”  Scores of high profile figures wear fur in stealthier ways, too, with celebrities ranging from David Beckham to Emma Stone wearing Canada Goose jackets, which have coyote trim hoods. Such trims were one way the fur industry clung on to market share, until recently, but now even those are being rethought, after animal rights campaigns, with Canada Goose announcing that it would use reclaimed fur from 2022.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"The federal government was preparing to legislate to hand environmental approval powers to state governments at the beginning of the year, well in advance of recommendations from a review of national laws that proposed such changes. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show Scott Morrison told the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, in February he wanted to introduce a bill to transfer environmental approval powers to state governments by midyear. The documents, covering months of correspondence between the federal and WA governments, show McGowan pushed for the change and stressed it should not be delayed by a review of Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The two governments drew up a timeline and originally planned to reach “in principle agreement” on a bilateral approval agreement by 5 October that would then be signed by mid-December, allowing WA to take responsibility for decisions under national environment laws. The 5 October deadline has not been met, with legislation that would make the transfer of environmental approval powers to state and territory governments less open to legal challenge still to be debated by the Senate. The letters and emails show the federal and WA governments have been discussing the transfer of environmental approval powers for about a year. Suzanne Milthorpe, of the Wilderness Society, said the documents showed that every step taken by the government in relation to the review of national environmental laws had been “aimed at delivering a predetermined outcome”. The review of Australia’s environmental laws by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel received about 30,000 submissions. “None of these private discussions about the drafting of the bill that is currently before parliament or what a Western Australian bilateral agreement might encompass were informed by the evidence from the independent review,” Milthorpe said. Morrison has signalled the government’s desire to speed up environmental approvals and cut so-called green tape since last year, but the potential for changes to Australia’s laws was first mentioned by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, in April. Ley said at the time she would be prepared to introduce early pieces of legislation if an interim report by Samuel review indicated “sensible changes” could be made before his final report. In a speech in June, Morrison said there had been early discussions in national cabinet about moving to a “single touch” approvals process and it would return to the subject at a later date, informed by the Samuel review. The documents show McGowan wrote to Morrison on 22 November 2019 to say an agreement between the governments would “significantly reduce major project timeframes, duplication and costs”, the same date the Rio Tinto sent a similar request to Ley. The premier said he was confident WA’s existing systems were adequate to protect endangered species, habitats and heritage sites. Morrison replied to say he had asked Ley to consider whether a bill “could be introduced in the middle of this year”, given McGowan’s support for bilateral approval agreements, but stressed that any such bill would need bipartisan support, given the government “cannot preempt the outcome” of the Samuel review. On 10 March, McGowan wrote to Morrison again to say businesses and industry groups had welcomed the proposed bilateral approval agreement and believed it could be finalised “in the immediate term”. “It is particularly important that this matter does not get caught up in the wider, long-term independent review of the EPBC Act,” he said. Ley, and the assistant minister to the prime minister, Ben Morton, were also corresponding with Ley’s counterpart in WA, Stephen Dawson, about the matter. Ley wrote to Dawson on 26 May, again stressing the importance of not preempting the review, which would be “critical in determining the most effective ways to streamline environmental approvals”. “This is a once in a decade opportunity and bipartisan support will be key to implementing a balanced and substantive package of reforms.” But by 19 June the government had begun preparing legislation to change Australia’s environmental laws, 11 days before Samuel delivered his interim report, which found the country’s environment was in unsustainable decline. A briefing prepared ahead of a meeting between Ley and Dawson shows the federal environment department advised Ley on 23 June that Samuel would probably recommend the transfer of approval powers should be supported by clear standards that specified what environmental outcomes state governments would be expected to deliver. Officials wrote this was “underscored by recent events in WA” where questions had been raised about the adequacy of state-level protection of Indigenous heritage and the commonwealth’s role in protecting the national interest – presumably a reference to Rio Tinto’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old Indigenous heritage site in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. By 25 June, the federal and WA environment departments were discussing a bilateral approval agreement, and by 16 July the departments had begun meeting to “map out the process and timing”. Samuel’s interim report was released on 20 July, recommending that transfer of approval powers to states should occur under a framework of national environmental standards, with an independent regulator to enforce compliance with the laws. Ley rejected the proposal for an independent regulator, but said the government would introduce a bill in August to transfer approval powers and would “commence discussions with willing states”. She said interim national standards would be introduced at the same time as the bill. By August, the two departments had developed a timeline that included passage of a bill to streamline environmental approvals by 2 September. A draft approval agreement had been written by mid-August. The timeline refers to a plan to have interim national standards enshrined in national law by 3 September. But the bill the government ultimately introduced in late August contained no standards and was a near replica of the Abbott government’s 2014 one-stop shop laws. According to the timeline, the governments planned to put a draft bilateral approval agreement with WA out for public exhibition during September, with an “in principle” agreement to be reached by 5 October. This has not occurred. The government’s bill passed the lower house in early September but the Senate still has to debate it. The Wilderness Society’s Milthorpe said there was an “urgent need to restore credibility to this whole process”. She said the “only way I can see that is possible now” was if the government pulled the bill before parliament and retracted its offer to develop the agreement with WA until Samuel’s final report was tabled and the government produced a response that would turn around Australia’s record on extinction. A spokesman for Ley said the government’s support for “streamlining regulation” was well known and the proposed changes to the law that were before the parliament had remained government policy since the one-stop shop legislation was voted down in 2014. “Passing these amendments has remained government policy since that time,” he said. “Discussions with Western Australia earlier this year were within that context and the context of the existing legislation. “They coincided with negotiations on renewing the state’s agreement on bilateral assessments.” The government’s bill is listed for debate in the Senate this week. Ley’s spokesman said it was “the first tranche of legislative changes expected to follow the Samuel review”. A spokesman for the WA government said formal negotiations between the two governments began in August, after Ley issued a notice of intent to reach an agreement. The spokesman said WA “already has the nation’s highest environmental standards” and Samuel’s review had “confirmed the important role that bilateral agreements can play”. “The state government has made no secret of its desire to secure a bilateral agreement. We are committed to reducing duplication and unnecessary delays in project approval timelines,” he said. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench have raised concerns it has not been put to a committee for inquiry, was brought to the parliament before Samuel’s final report is released, and does not contain a reference to standards. Samuel delivered his final report to the government at the end of October.",environment
"Admirers of national parks and world-class trout streams in the state of Montana have expressed alarm over the election of a new Republican governor and his environmental plans. The governor, former software developer Greg Gianforte, has in the past sought to strip protections from 700,000 acres of wilderness, and his conservative “Montana Comeback Plan” election platform promises to “streamline” permitting processes to increase logging, coalmining, and oil and gas production. In May 2017, while running for a Montana congressional seat that he won, Gianforte was charged with assault after “bodyslamming” Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs to the floor. Gianforte pleaded guilty to assault and apologized for the incident, and also pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Donald Trump later praised Gianforte at a rally in Montana, saying “Any guy that can do a body slam – that’s my guy.” While in Congress, Gianforte made a habit of attacking protections for public lands and water. “I‘m concerned about loss of access [to public lands and waters], sales of public land to corporate interests, rolling back environmental protections, wet-blanketing efforts to address the climate crisis and innovations in clean energy, and the loss of funding for management and maintenance of public lands,” said Juanita Vero, a Missoula county commissioner and multi-generational rancher in the Blackfoot valley, who served as Montana Conservation Voters’ board chair for a time. A proposal formulated with Montana Senator Steve Daines would have stripped protections from more than a half-million acres of Wilderness Study Areas. If the move had been successful, it would have been the single biggest rollback of protected lands in Montana history.  Gianforte garnered headlines, many critical, in Montana for having sued the state to block stream access to a popular fishing access site on the East Gallatin River near Bozeman. Kristen Juras, his running mate for his gubernatorial campaign, once also penned an article arguing that Montana’s law guaranteeing river access to anglers and boaters goes too far.  This year, Gianforte introduced a federal bill that would have amended the US Endangered Species Act and delisted the grizzly bear. He also pledged to “review, roll back and repeal” regulations on extractive industries that he deems excessive or unnecessary, and is a proponent of exporting Montana coal and undoing emissions limits on power plants. “Gianforte is a major coal development booster,” Robin Saha, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana, told E&E News recently. “He has been silent on climate and energy policy beyond wanting to promote coal development and protect the coalmining and coal-fired power plant industries in Montana.” Gianforte did not respond to requests for comment. Given the evidence, the League of Conservation Voters, a not-for-profit that evaluates the environmental records of politicians, listed Gianforte on its Dirty Dozen in the States list of “the worst environmental candidates in the nation at the state and local level”. He has a lifetime score of just 5% from the LCV. A lifelong member of the National Rifle Association with a 92% rating from the organization, he invited it to move its offices to Montana a few months before the election. Montanans elected Republican candidates up and down the ballot, delivering the Montana GOP the biggest landslide a single party has received in decades. Gianforte rode his support for Trump to win by 16 points over his Democratic opponent. So did Steve Daines, who beat current Governor Steve Bullock for his second term in the US Senate, and Matt Rosendale, who will take over from Gianforte in the US House. Montana Republicans also swept the state downballot races. “If anything is going to get accomplished, the Democrats have got to figure out a way to work with our Republican majority,” said Vero, the rancher. “We’re not taking our marbles and going home. We’ve gotta stay at the table and play the game.”",environment
"Environmentalists have criticised a three-day tour of the Amazon that the Brazilian government staged for foreign ambassadors as a “sham” and “media propaganda” after it failed to stop at any environmentally devastated areas.  The tour ended on Friday and focused on better-protected areas of the northern Amazon. “The government prepared an itinerary that does not show the reality of the Amazon – the abandonment of indigenous peoples, the land grabbing, the illegal mining and the uncontrolled deforestation. It is a sham,” said Marcio Astrini, executive director of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella group of environmental NGOs.  Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, who hosted the tour and heads the government’s Amazon council, said seeing the effects of Amazon deforestation and fires close up was “not necessary”. Analysts said the tour was a sop to European governments wavering on ratifying a trade deal between the EU and the South American trade block Mercosur. Amazon deforestation and fires have accelerated since Jair Bolsonaro took office as Brazil’s president in January 2019 with an anti-environmental agenda, promising to develop the region. “Governments in favour of ratification want Brazil to do things like that in order to help them to make a case … back in their capitals,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a São Paulo business school. Others feared they had fallen into a propaganda trap as an official government Twitter account falsely tweeted that Brazil protected its environment more than anywhere else, and Bolsonaro’s claim that “shady interests” coveted Amazon riches. Many of the claims were debunked by the environmental factchecking site fakebook.eco. First mooted by Bolsonaro a year ago and organised after eight European countries, including the UK, in September urged Brazil to take “real action” over deforestation, the trip concentrated on the Amazon city of Manaus and the rainforest’s better protected northern region. It included a zoo, a deforestation monitoring centre, a sustainable farm and the confluence of the Amazon and Negro rivers near Manaus, a major tourist point. On Friday, ambassadors visited a military base in the Yanomami indigenous reserve and an indigenous health centre in the remote town of São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Greenpeace delivered an alternative route to ambassadors taking part before the trip began, suggesting they visit devastated areas such as the Jamanxim forest in Pará state. “I hope the ambassadors clearly understand this is nothing more than media propaganda that does not represent reality,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, an Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil. Before setting off, the UK’s acting ambassador in Brazil, Liz Davidson, tweeted that “it is a shame the trip does not include visits to areas more impacted by environmental degradation”. She told Brazil’s Valor Econômico daily that the UK wanted to see a long-term plan to combat illegal deforestation. In a last minute deviation from the official route, the ambassadors were due to fly over the BR-163 highway in Pará – the region suggested by Greenpeace – which cuts through heavily deforested Amazon forest, the G1 site reported. There were no plans to land. “We looked to fly over the BR-163 region … we weren’t able to because there was cloud cover in spite of flying low, but it is important to make clear that taking them in loco is not really necessary,” Mourão told reporters in Manaus, according to the city’s A Critica site. He heads an army operation to combat fires and deforestation widely derided as ineffective. Bolsonaro’s government has dismantled environmental protections. Environmental officials have been sacked, banned from talking to the media and forbidden to burn and destroy tractors and other equipment used by illegal loggers and miners. Deforestation hit a 10-year high between August 2018 and July 2019, reaching 10,129 sq kms, and indications are that the next figures, due next month, will be even higher. Fires in the Amazon also hit a 10-year high, rising 13% in the first nine months of 2020. Bolsonaro falsely claimed in a speech to the United Nations that the rainforest did not burn, blaming indigenous people and a “disinformation campaign anchored on shady interests” for negative media coverage. In April the environment minister, Ricardo Salles – who was also on this week’s trip – called for more deregulation while media was distracted by the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday the Climate Observatory said Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 9.6% in 2019. It said 2.2bn tons of carbon dioxide was released, driven by Amazon deforestation and making it impossible for Brazil to meet its 2020 emissions target.",environment
"I’m sitting by a pond with musician Cosmo Sheldrake, wearing a pair of headphones that are attached to a large, fluffy microphone a few feet away. An obstacle course of wires surrounds us and there are two more microphones hidden in a bush by a bird feeder. It looks like lockdown’s answer to a silent disco, but far from being engrossed in techno music we’re soaking up natural sounds performed by the birds of the dawn chorus. This is how Sheldrake has started many mornings since the Covid-19 pandemic began, in an off-grid cottage hidden in woods outside the New Forest near Fordingbridge in Hampshire. He has just made an album of avian conversations called Wake Up Calls and today he is showing me how he makes his wild recordings. I arrive at 6.30am to hear the moment howling owls sign off and pass over to songbirds making their morning announcements. Through the headphones, drizzle on the water sounds like a monsoon and a screeching blackbird sounds as if it’s sitting on my shoulder. Listening to the plucky protagonist is a reminder that this morning ritual is a fight for survival – males are serenading females but also warning others to keep off their patch. The Good Life is not all about joie de vivre. The whitewashed cottage belongs to Sheldrake’s girlfriend’s mother and when she started renting it 36 years ago there was a tree growing through the kitchen. The week before my visit an oak nearly crushed the shepherd’s hut (transformed into an office). Sheldrake is as eccentric as you’d expect, given that he is the son of the maverick biologist Rupert, and brother to fungi expert Merlin. Musically, he is most influenced by his mother, Jill Purce, who teaches and practises Mongolian overtone chanting. On the walls inside the cottage is a kaleidoscope of paintings, mainly depicting views from around the house (his girlfriend’s mother is the artist Lizzie Wallace). Sheldrake, who is normally London-based, doesn’t drive so it’s convenient that his source of inspiration comes from the woods hugging the house. These paintings are a visual reflection of the landscape, while Sheldrake’s album is a reflection of the noises it makes. His studio-cum-field-station is a metre from a bird feeder. Inside the studio is a bed, an armchair and a scruffy collection of boxes. He puts the sound recordings into his computer and slows down individual calls. It’s like intercepting morse code, revealing delicate cadences you don’t hear when the songs are rattled out at speed. The blackbird is a guttural, gritty character, while the robin’s voice has bell-like purity. “Birds live on a different time axis,” says 30-year-old Sheldrake. “There’s a spectrum of relationships with time – we look at birds and think they’re very ‘other’, but when you slow their song down, you get an idea of the tapestry of what they’re saying and they sound strangely human. These are very subtle, integrated phrases that we miss when they’re singing at their normal speed.” And so these little characters and conversations have been pieced together in an album that follows the natural acoustics of the day; it starts with a nightjar, which sings just after dusk and through the night, then goes to a nightingale, and then the dawn chorus, before working its way through the day. A chord can be composed of five or six different aspects of a song played simultaneously. Tracks are based on sounds that already exist and have their own identity and character. “It’s a collaboration,” says Sheldrake, “except without explicit consent from the birds.” At first, Sheldrake made songs as Christmas presents for friends and family to use as alarm clocks. People who got them then found they couldn’t sleep through the actual dawn chorus because they had tuned into it. Sheldrake wanted more people to be conscious of bird sounds so he decided to make an album.  “Once you can identify them as species or individuals, it just turns into this completely insane conversation across huge amounts of time and space,” says Sheldrake. “You have these themes essentially rippling through the woods. Everything that happens in a woodland is like a stone dropping into a pond. It sends out these ripples as those birds respond and then respond to those responses … there are so many layers and levels to it,” he says. Part of his aim is to highlight how we may not be conscious of the loss of wildlife from our lives. Many of the birds featured on his album, such as marsh warbler, mistle thrush and dunnock, are no longer a ubiquitous part of our soundscapes. The star performers from today’s chorus – blackbirds and robins – didn’t make it on to Sheldrake’s album because they are not (yet) on the red or amber list of endangered British birds. We go on a sonic field trip in the forest around the house, walking through old plantations – the beech woodland, with its dark canopy and little plant growth on the forest floor, sounds like a cathedral. Sheldrake describes it as a “slow, crashing surf sound, like an ocean”. The ash – blighted with dieback – has little canopy to hold sound in. Poplars have a “rushing, sucking sound”. Within these forest environments, sound is a critical method of communication. Birds have evolved acoustic as well as physical niches – and they use different frequencies and rhythms so they can still identify individuals. Historically, the sonic landscape has been underrepresented in research, but a new wave of acoustic ecologists are paying more attention to sound, led by the US musician and soundscape ecologist Dr Bernie Krause. Listening to the voices of the natural world propels that experience into another dimension, says Krause. “It’s important to heighten our awareness of natural soundscapes and, in particular, ‘biophonies’ [the name Krause gives to sounds collectively produced by wildlife], because they convey a sense of place,” he says. “The narratives are the origins of our music and language. They speak to the health of a habitat. They tell us how we’re doing in relationship to our environment. And they can serve as analgesics in these unsettling and stressful times.” As well as raising awareness about loss of natural sounds, Sheldrake has always liked the idea of “playing places” – playing songs back to the place they came from. He didn’t know this could potentially be beneficial until he looked at the work of Prof Steve Simpson from the University of Exeter on “sonic enrichment”, in which the sounds of healthy ocean reefs are played into degraded areas in order to attract life back to them. According to research published in Nature Communications last year, playing the sound of a healthy reef into a degraded and abandoned one can lure fish back to the area. Blasting “golden oldies” back on to a reef is like “putting it on steroids”, says Simpson. It’s not known whether a similar approach might work with birds. Krause believes that playing bird sounds back into a habitat risks stressing out organisms that have already carved out an acoustic niche for themselves. Sheldrake describes it as a “romantic ideal”, and half-hopes he might lure a passing cuckoo. For most people, the sounds in Sheldrake’s album are already noises from a more bird-rich past. The UK has lost 90% of its nightingales in 50 years, and more than 55% of skylarks and cuckoos. There are now only 80 breeding male  bitterns left. The album is a celebration of sound but also a warning of the beauty we’re losing.

"Coloradans have voted to reintroduce wolves, which were hunted and trapped to extinction in the 1940s, to the state by 2023. The proposition squeaked by with 50.4% of the total votes as of Thursday night. This is the first time American voters have ever weighed in on reintroducing a wildlife species, as that decision is usually left up to a state’s team of wildlife biologists. Gray wolves once roamed across two-thirds of the continental US. Without wolves at the top of the food chain, the whole ecosystem is out of balance, says Eric Washburn, a campaign manager at the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund, the advocacy group behind the proposition. Yellowstone national park reintroduced gray wolves to the park in 1995, and Washburn looks to it as a living laboratory and model for Colorado’s reintroduction plans. The return of the region’s apex predators set off a cascade of natural events that ultimately restored Yellowstone’s “ecological integrity”, says Washburn, and the reintroduction is hailed as one of the world’s greatest rewilding stories. Wolves were first listed as endangered 45 years ago, when the population dropped to 1,000 individuals in the continental 48 states. Now it sits at about 6,000. Colorado’s decision is complicated by the fact that just last week, the Trump administration delisted gray wolves from the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) after announcing the species’ “successful recovery”. Hundreds of biologists dispute this, in part because wolves still only occupy a sliver of their historic range. States will now decide if wolves can be hunted or trapped. And since wildlife cannot recognize state lines, wolves can move in and out of states where they can be killed, thwarting conservation efforts. For example, the gray wolf is endangered in Colorado but only threatened in Wyoming, where wolves can be killed on sight in 85% of the state. Last year, at least three wolves from north-west Colorado were killed when they moved into Wyoming. “We do worry about that, but there’s not a whole lot we can do about that because wolves will go where they see habitat,” said Washburn. “But the good news is, there’s 17m acres of public land habitat in western Colorado.”  Washburn also hopes that the decision to delist wolves from the Endangered Species Act will be overturned by a federal court.",environment
"The government’s conservation watchdog has been “cut to the bone”, with staff underpaid, undervalued and overworked and feeling unable to protect England’s most valuable wildlife sites, according to a new report and testimony from workers. Natural England, which is sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), has a range of responsibilities, including monitoring and protecting the country’s most valuable habitats such as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and national nature reserves (NNRs). It also works with farmers to protect biodiversity and advises the government on environmental policy, planning and licensing. Defra’s funding for the agency has dropped by £165m since 2008, and as a result it is struggling to carry out these statutory duties, according to Prospect trade union’s Natural England 2020-21 report. “There’s a certain weirdness to working in Natural England in that everyone knows that we’ve been absolutely cut to the bone,” one employee told the Guardian. “Everyone knows we can’t do basic statutory stuff, let alone the bigger, exciting projects we want to do.” Following a decade of cuts, this year the agency was awarded an additional £15m to recruit around 200 new staff, including roles to help deliver the Environment bill legislation going through parliament. While the report welcomes this investment, it calls it a “drop in the ocean” and warns that “urgent, radical investment is needed”. “Public awareness of the plight of biodiversity and fragility of our landscapes has finally come to the fore … but it is clear from the trajectory of both funding, pay and staff numbers that to meet the ambitions and challenges set out in this report, and to not let the green recovery fall flat, government must step up and make good the damage done,” the report says. Natural England’s “lack of money is affecting everybody because it is the paymaster for a lot of local nature conservation efforts – it’s the spider in the middle of the web,” said author and conservationist Peter Marren. “I don’t think most people have ever heard of Natural England, it’s not a high-profile public body. This is happening because nobody cares about it … apart from the tight circle that work in nature conservation.” Natural England teams are increasingly being centralised in small regional hubs due to staff shortages. Management of SSSIs – which cover 8% of England – is mostly dealt with remotely, by email and phone. Previously, one person would manage 10-15 SSSIs, now they have up to 40. More than 60% of SSSI sites are in “unfavourable” condition, and half of them haven’t been monitored in six years, which is a statutory duty, meaning the reality could be worse. Pay has been an ongoing issue at Natural England. Last year staff were in their eighth year of a 1% cap on pay, which has since been lifted. Only 9.5% of staff believe their pay adequately reflects their performance and the gender pay gap across the agency is 8.4%. One employee, who left last summer, told the Guardian she was earning £20,000 for four days a week and worked two extra jobs to make ends meet. She had been working for a decade before joining the agency and had two first-class degrees from Oxbridge. When she raised the pay issue with her manager she said she was told, “it’s normal for people in Natural England to have second and third jobs to get by”. She described working at the agency as stressful: “Natural England staff are the medics of the environment and they are watching their charges – the environment, species, habitats – going extinct and rotten every day. The grief and trauma of working in the natural environment in this country is intense. In Natural England it’s a nightmare.” This week staff were planning to strike over pay issues. In response, Natural England set up a pay reform project and union leaders have given the agency six months before it will consider industrial action again. A union representative told the Guardian; “It’s hurtful that we’re not valued like our counterparts in Defra. Our work is technical, specialist and high risk, but not properly recognised by the government and yet it depends on us for advice. It’s a plea, really, for the government to recognise the vital work that Natural England does for nature and people.” Public sector investment in conservation has fallen in real terms by 33% in five years, according to the 2020 biodiversity indicators report. Natural England chair Tony Juniper has previously said that ongoing budget cuts have left the organisation “massively depleted”, and he has been lobbying for more funding. Mike Clancy, Prospect union general secretary, said there was a “yawning gap” between the government’s rhetoric on climate change and biodiversity, and the reality of years of underfunding environmental agencies. “Protecting nature means investing in the people who do that work,” he said. “Natural England is at the heart of this agenda but it can only be effective if it is properly funded and the importance of its staff properly recognised.” Natural England has an “absolutely critical job” in turning around catastrophic wildlife decline, said Craig Bennett, chief executive of Wildlife Trusts. “If our nation is to have the natural world that we yearn for, then ministers need to give Natural England the money and powers it needs to do its job, and let it get on with it.” Green party peer Natalie Bennett said people protecting nature are doing so “on a shoestring” due to the severity of cuts. “We’re one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries, yet Natural England has been under-resourced at every turn and this threatens the work of its expert staff … clearly funding needs to be restored.” Marian Spain, chief executive of Natural England, said the agency is embarking on a nature recovery network, rebuilding resilient landscapes, restoring wildlife, improving soil health, and helping people to connect to the natural world. “Our staff do an extraordinary job in caring for the natural world and we are committed to making sure they are rewarded fairly for their hard work,” she said in the comment, which came via Defra. “This government has set out ambitious environmental targets, which Natural England is well placed to deliver on – however ongoing and significant investment will be needed if we are to truly realise the ambition of leaving the environment in a better state than we found it.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",environment
"The world’s largest mink producer, Denmark, says it plans to cull more than 15 million of the animals, due to fears that a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. At a press conference on Wednesday, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said 12 people are already infected with the mutated virus and that the mink are now considered a public health risk. “The mutated virus in mink may pose a risk to the effectiveness of a future vaccine,” Frederiksen said. She said the army, police, and national emergency service would be mobilised to help farms with the mink cull, which will eradicate the entire Danish herd. The authorities and breeders have already been culling the animals over the past few weeks in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. Reuters reported that Denmark’s health minister said about half of 783 infected people in northern Denmark, home to a large number of mink breeders, had been found to have infections stemming from the farms. Denmark is the world’s largest producer of mink fur and has 15 to 17 million animals on about 1,100 farms. According to reports, the latest figures from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, say Covid-19 infections have been found on more than 200 mink farms. The figures were confirmed by a Danish police press officer. Finnish fur auctioneer Magnus Ljung, CEO of Saga Furs, was watching the Danish announcement. “It’s a shock. They will kill all mink in Denmark. They are talking about the risk of Covid-19 mutating in the mink, and going from mink to humans, and potentially affecting a future human vaccine.” Ljung estimated the value of the 2020 mink population in Denmark to be between €350m and €400m (£270m-£360m). “They got control of [Covid-19 mink infections] in Holland and there were a few cases in Spain and in Sweden. But it was all kept under control. [The Danish cull] is unexpected, for sure. Yes, it could happen in other countries. But I don’t want to speculate,” said Ljung. “What we really need to do is end mink farming entirely and retrain the farmers,” said Birgitte Damm, policy adviser and vet with NGO Animal Protection Denmark. Speaking from Amsterdam, Dr Joanna Swabe, Humane Society International/Europe’s senior director of public affairs, said: “Denmark is one of the largest fur producers on the planet, so a total shutdown of all Danish mink fur farms amid spiralling Covid-19 infections is a significant development. “Although not a ban on fur farming, this move signals the end of suffering for millions of animals confined to small wire cages on Danish fur farms solely for the purposes of a trivial fur fashion that no one needs. We commend the Danish prime minister on her decision to take such an essential and science-led step to protect Danish citizens from the deadly coronavirus.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"A powerful coalition of the UK’s health professions has called for a climate tax to be imposed on food with a heavy environmental impact by 2025, unless the industry takes voluntary action on the impact of their products. The group says the climate crisis cannot be solved without action to cut the consumption of food that causes high emissions, such as red meat and dairy products. But it says that more sustainable diets are also healthier and would reduce illness. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (UKHACC) includes 10 Royal Colleges of medicine and nursing, the British Medical Association and the Lancet, representing the doctors, nurses and other professionals entrusted with caring for the country’s health. The alliance’s new report makes a series of recommendations including a swift end to buy-one-get-one-free offers for food that is bad for health and the environment, and for perishable foods that are often wasted. It also calls for public information campaigns on diet to include climate messages, for labels on food to reveal its environmental impact, and for the £2bn spent every year on catering in schools, hospitals, care homes and prisons to meet minimum environmental standards. A YouGov poll of healthcare professionals for UKHACC found two-thirds agreeing that environmentally friendly diets can also improve your health, while 40% had already changed their own eating habits due to environmental concerns. Food production is responsible for a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and a series of scientific studies have shown that red meat and dairy have far bigger impacts than plant-based food. People in rich nations already eat more meat than is healthy and in the UK only one in three eat the recommended five daily portions of fruit and vegetables. “We can’t reach our goals without addressing our food system,” said Kristin Bash, who leads the Faculty of Public Health’s food group and was a co-author of the UKHACC report. “The climate crisis isn’t something we should see as far in the future. It’s time to take these issues seriously now.” Bash said the report was not telling people to become vegans: “It’s just saying increase your consumption of plant protein. It’s a simple message and something that’s widely supported by health organisations around the world.” Nicky Philpott, the director of UKHACC, said taxes on plastic bags and sugary soft drinks had shown such policies can reduce harmful activities. The report said the government should state an intention to levy a food carbon tax on all food producers if voluntary action on the full climate impact of food products is not taken by the industry by 2025. Marco Springmann, at the University of Oxford and not involved in the report, said there was substantial scientific evidence on the close connection between public and planetary health: “The message is clear: without drastic reduction in the production and consumption of meat and dairy, there is little chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate change.” “UKHACC is right in stressing that dietary changes of the scale required will not happen without strong policy support,” he said. Henry Dimbleby, who leads the independent group developing England’s National Food Strategy, said: “Covid-19, painful though it is, could pale into insignificance compared to the turbulence created by climate change and the collapse in biodiversity. Healthcare professionals have an important role in shaping our diets, and I am very pleased to see their recommendations cover not only our health, but that of our planet too.” Some action is already happening in the UK to cut the environmental impact of food. In April, public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year pledged to reduce the amount of meat they serve by 20%, cutting 9m kg of meat a year. In October, the NHS set a target of cutting its net carbon emissions to zero by 2040 and included food in its action plan: “Healthier, locally sourced food can improve wellbeing while cutting emissions.” Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, said UKHACC’s recommendation of environmental labelling on food was important. “Today you can walk into a shop and buy something with an environmental impact many times higher than another food, and have no idea you have done so.” For example, Brazilian beef uses 200 times more land and causes 80 times more emissions than European tofu, he said. Prof Andrew Goddard, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: “I am the first to admit that I enjoy a steak every now and then, but it’s clear that if we are to avoid dangerous global warming we must start to reconsider our attitudes to food. We each have a responsibility and an ability to make a difference as individuals.”",environment
"The tall pines, oaks and birches shake in the wind, sounding like waves crashing on the shore. Small white clouds sail rapidly across the blue sky. I follow the path that winds down through the wood, passing fungi in the decaying vegetation, including sprouting yellow clumps of sulphur tuft and little purple domes of amethyst deceiver. The low sun gleams through the trunks and on to the brown, curling ferns as I approach the edge of the woods and look out across the flat brooks. Canada and greylag geese honk and feed on the grass, lapwings stand to attention or hoot and whistle in loops above the water. A single acorn sits on the flat metal top of a post of a nearby fence. As I wonder how it got there, a jay flies squawking out of the trees and lands on the post. It carefully places another acorn beside the first, and then returns to the wood. About five minutes later it comes back and deposits a third acorn, which it lines up beside the first two, in a row. After a pause, the jay picks up one of the acorns in its beak and jumps down, on to the ground. I can just make out its head moving up and down in the long grass, burying the acorn. After a few minutes, the jay flies up to the post and picks up a second acorn. It turns its head from side to side, eyeing the final nut. It flips its beak up, so the one it’s holding falls down in its crop, and picks up the last acorn. It flies back to the ground. There’s a commotion over the brooks – the lapwings are more agitated than normal and flocks of starlings swirl, rising and falling in spirals of black dots over the grass. An arrow-like merlin cuts through the birds, speeding low and out of sight. I watch for the small brown falcon, and finally it reappears and glides up to land on a fence post. The merlin slowly turns her head, almost in a full circle, to watch the settling birds around her. Then she leaps forward into the air and is gone. The starlings rise up in black clouds again.

"As parts of northern England were covered in frost, Hamish – the first polar bear to be born in the UK in 25 years – embarked on a 400-mile journey to his new home. The cub, who has shared an enclosure with his mother, Victoria, in the Scottish Highlands for the past two and a half years, was transported to Yorkshire on Wednesday. Hamish was born in December 2017 at Highland Wildlife Park, near Aviemore, and his name was chosen through a public vote. Since his birth thousands of people have visited the park to catch a glimpse of him. However, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) had always planned to move him to another zoo once he was old enough to leave his mother. Earlier this year the wildlife conservation charity announced that he would be moving to Yorkshire Wildlife Park’s Project Polar habitat following a recommendation from the European Endangered Species Programme. Rachel Williams, senior animal keeper at Highland Wildlife Park, said it was a natural time for the playful cub to move on but that he would be missed, although his mother would finally get to enjoy some quiet time. “In the wild, polar bear cubs will stay with their mothers for two to three years, so this is a natural time for Hamish to be moving on,” she said. She added: “It has been an incredible two and a half years watching him grow and he will be missed by everyone here at the park. “[But] we’re sure Victoria will appreciate some peace and quiet before any next steps in the breeding programme.” Hamish’s father, Arktos, remains in an enclosure in another part of the Scottish park. Williams said Victoria and Arktos could be “paired up” again next year. David Field, RZSS’s chief executive, said Hamish had been an incredible ambassador for his relatives in the wild, playing a crucial role in educating the public about threats faced by many species. “A critical part of our role as a wildlife conservation charity is education. Hamish has made a tremendous impression on the thousands of people who visited the park since his birth two and a half years ago, and the billions who saw the news around the world,” he said. He added: “He has helped to highlight the threats many species face in the wild and the changes we can undertake to really make a difference. “Changes in the Arctic climate mean the sea ice that wild polar bears, and other animals, depend on for survival is shrinking and it is predicted this will significantly decrease population numbers over the next 40 years.” Hamish made the seven-hour journey to Doncaster by road. Yorkshire Wildlife Park’s head of animals, Dr Matt Hartley, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Hamish to Project Polar where he will join our other male bears. “Our expansive reserves allow social interaction, play, exploration and behavioural development that is vital for bear wellbeing.”",environment
"Police are investigating I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! over concerns non-native wildlife could have escaped into the Welsh countryside during bushtucker trials, the Guardian can reveal. Rural crime officers from north Wales police are looking into complaints that non-native creatures such as cockroaches, maggots, spiders and worms could threaten wildlife in the 100-hectare (250-acre) estate surrounding Gwrych Castle in north Wales, where the show is being held this year. Normally, the show is hosted live from the Australian jungle, where celebrity contestants take part in dares and challenges with live animals, like being covered in insects or surrounded by rats. Authorities are investigating ITV after complaints by the TV presenter and naturalist Iolo Williams, who was appalled after watching the show last week and seeing thousands of cockroaches being poured over contestants. He described it as “madness” to use non-native species for entertainment. “I’m not sure which species they’re releasing, but I can tell you they’re not native. We don’t have those cockroaches here in the UK and we certainly don’t have them in north Wales,” he said. Although the challenge happens in a contained environment, contestants would still be carrying insects when they left the enclosure, said Williams. “There are going to be cockroaches in every nook and cranny along their bodies, you’re going to tell me that every single one of those is found immediately? Of course it’s not.” ITV said all of the insects used on I’m A Celebrity were non-invasive species, but declined to comment on which species were used. A spokesperson said: “They are only ever released in a contained area and collected immediately after filming. They are all purchased commercially within the UK and are normally bred as animal food.” While not all non-native species are invasive, some can permanently change ecosystems and are one of the five main drivers of biodiversity decline, according to the UN. Gwrych Castle woods is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), meaning it is home to some of the country’s rarest species or habitats. Half a kilometre away from the castle is another SSSI managed by the Woodland Trust, called Coed y Gopa, an ancient woodland home to ospreys and goshawks. The Springwatch presenter said it was particularly ridiculous considering it has so far been impossible to release beavers in Wales – even though they used to be a native species. Williams said: “Cockroaches are the ultimate survivors, and if they survive in north Wales and escape into the wild there, what effect are they going to have? I don’t know, nobody knows … I just find it incredible that they’re allowed to do this, and I’m not being a killjoy here. Why not use fish guts, or offal?” Natural Resources Wales, which gives out licences for the release of species, did not receive an application from ITV to release non-native species. If these species have been released without a licence it would be a breach of the Wildlife and Countryside Act. A spokesperson for north Wales police said: “The matter is being investigated by officers from our rural crime team.” Invasive species that are now established in the UK include the non-native fungus that causes ash dieback, and signal crayfish that transmit disease to native crayfish. There are an estimated 2,000 non-native species established in the UK, at an annual cost of £1.8bn to the economy, according to the environment audit committee. I’m a Celebrity has also faced complaints from the RSPCA. Last week the charity raised “serious concerns” about the welfare of animals being dropped, handled roughly and crushed by contestants on the show. It is concerned viewers may try to copy bushtucker trials at home, during which animals have been killed “for no other purpose than entertainment”. “We feel that deliberately portraying certain species as nasty or frightening or as objects that can be used purely for entertainment rather than sentient, living creatures sends out totally the wrong message,” the charity said in a post on its website. ITV said the programme “complies with animal welfare law concerning the use of animals, and we are proud of our exemplary production practices”.

"Governments across Europe are failing to protect their citizens from toxic air pollution, with most Europeans still breathing filthy air in their cities, according to data. Pollutants from farming, domestic heating and vehicles are beyond the levels needed to ensure breathable air within World Health Organization guidelines, despite EU legislation, government pledges and years of campaigning. Only Ireland, Iceland, Finland and Estonia showed levels of fine particulate matter – one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution – that were below the WHO guidelines in 2018, according to data released on Monday by the European Environment Agency. Exposure to such pollution caused about 417,000 premature deaths across Europe – including non-EU member states – in 2018. Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the EEA, Europe’s environmental watchdog, said: “[Our] data prove that investing in better air quality is an investment for better health and productivity for all Europeans. Policies and actions that are consistent with Europe’s zero pollution ambition lead to longer and healthier lives and more resilient societies.” There have been some improvements, but they fall short of the actions needed from governments. The EEA found that 60,000 fewer people died prematurely in 2018 than in 2009 from fine particulate matter pollution. There may also have been health improvements owing to the coronavirus lockdowns this year, the EEA noted, but further work is required to assess the full impacts. The watchdog said its preliminary data showed there were reductions of as much as 60% in air pollution this spring, confirming other findings. Studies have found links between high air pollution and increased harm from Covid-19, underlining the need to reduce air pollution. Green campaigners said governments must act urgently. Margherita Tolotto, the senior policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau, which represents campaigning groups across the EU, said: “How many wake-up calls do government officials need to take on air pollution? Their delay is costing us our health and a safe environment. They know what needs to be done to improve air quality: cleaner energy and industrial production, greener and smarter transport, and sustainable farming.” Emissions of pollutants from vehicles have fallen, though not to the extent required, and emissions from power plants have also tumbled as Europe has moved away from coal power. But cutting emissions from domestic heating, including wood-burning, and from agriculture – including ammonia from manure and fertilisers, which combines with other pollutants in the air to form particulate matter – has proved more of a challenge. Governments had failed to meet EU targets, the EEA said. Under EU rules, every member state should have submitted a plan for bringing air pollution within health limits in 2018. However, Italy’s plan is still at draft stage, while Greece, Luxembourg and Romania have yet to submit any plan. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU’s environment commissioner, said progress had been made but called on member states to do more, and promised an action plan as part of the European Green Deal. “It is good news that air quality is improving thanks to the environmental and climate policies we have been implementing,” he said. “But we can’t ignore the downside – the number of premature deaths due to air pollution is still far too high. With the European Green Deal we have set ourselves an ambition of reducing all kinds of pollution to zero. If we are to succeed and fully protect people’s health and the environment, we need to cut air pollution further and align our air quality standards more closely with the recommendations of the WHO.” Six member states – Italy, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and the Czech Republic – breached the EU’s limits for fine particulate matter, called PM2.5, in 2018. The EU limits are less stringent than WHO guidelines. There were 54,000 premature deaths from nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2018 in the EU-28, which includes the UK, which was then still a member of the EU. Ground-level ozone caused about 19,000 premature deaths in the EU-28 that year. The UK government has pledged to bring in new guidelines on air pollution to replace its targets under the EU. The framework legislation for these targets is contained in the environment bill, going through the committee stage in parliament after a long delay. Any new targets will not be set until late 2022 at the earliest, however, after a consultation. The UK government was repeatedly found in court cases over several years to have breached EU air pollution limits and ministers were ordered by supreme court judges to come forward with plans for reducing air pollution that would meet the targets.",environment
"The high-end French fashion brand Hermès wants to build one of Australia’s biggest crocodile farms in the Northern Territory that would hold up to 50,000 saltwater crocodiles to be turned into luxury goods such as handbags and shoes. But the proposal has come under fire from animal welfare groups, who say other fashion brands have moved away from using exotic animal skins on cruelty grounds. Advocates told Guardian Australia they had concerns about the welfare of the crocodiles, and that farming animals for luxury goods was “no longer fashionable.” The territory, a significant global supplier of crocodile skins, is already home to several crocodile farms owned by major fashion brands. Northern Territory crocodile industry figure Mick Burns is leading the proposal on a former fruit farm near Darwin purchased earlier this year by the company PRI Farming, of which he is a director. The NT government has already granted development approval for the project, with documents showing the farm would include an egg incubator laboratory, a hatchery, and growing pens, as well as wastewater treatment plants and a solar farm. According to documents submitted to the territory’s Environmental Protection Authority, the farm would employ 30 people and build from an initial 4,000 crocodiles to 50,000, which the ABC has reported would make it one of the biggest crocodile farms in Australia. An EPA statement to the Guardian said the project had been granted environmental approval, and that PRI had also indicated it would apply for a wildlife trade permit. Dr Jed Goodfellow, a senior policy officer at RSPCA Australia, said the society remained opposed to killing of any animal “where the purpose of their death is primarily to produce a non-essential luxury item like fur or skin”. He said the society was not aware of the details of animal welfare practices on the planned farm. But he said generally there were many welfare risks raised by crocodile farming in intensive conditions, “including injuries from close confinement, small individual penning arrangements, and the impacts of restraint and slaughter methods”. He said Australia’s national code of practice covering crocodile farming was “now over 10 years old and in need of review”. Nicola Beynon, of Humane Society International, said brands including Chanel, Mulberry and the owners of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger had adopted animal welfare policies “against using exotic animal skins such as crocodile”. “Consumers and fashion houses are walking away from animal cruelty as fast as they can,” she said. “It seems foolish to be investing in an industry that is no longer fashionable.” A 2017 report commissioned from Ernst & Young by the NT government estimated the crocodile farming industry was worth $106m to the territory’s economy. It said NT’s crocodile skin producers “are known as ethical providers and have encouraged high-end fashion producers such as Hermès and Louis Vuitton to purchase local NT farms to secure their supply chain”. The report said crocodile eggs were harvested under licence from the wild, with juvenile crocodiles “nurtured to minimise stress and protect their skins”. The report said: “Finally, the premium end product, crocodile skins, then often ends up as some of the world’s most expensive and sought-after fashion accessories (handbags, shoes, purses and wallets) being worn in the finest establishments throughout the world with key markets in the United States and Europe.” Documents with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show PRI Farming is wholly owned by another Darwin-based company, which in turn is wholly owned by Hermès. Burns did not respond to a request for comment. Guardian Australia sent questions to Hermès and asked to speak to a representative, but did not get a response. A 2019 corporate social responsibility report from Hermès said the company owned three crocodile farms and “two hide processing and inspection sites” in Australia.  The report said all the company’s crocodile farms were signed up to a best practices charter, and the company had worked across the industry to improve animal welfare standards which had been reviewed by a crocodile group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Hermès has an animal welfare policy which states: “The group has defined and implemented a very strict, science-based, animal welfare policy. This applies within its direct sphere of responsibility as well as for its external partners, with a specific supply-chain based approach.” In 2015, Burns helped the Northern Territory government develop a strategy to expand the region’s crocodile farming industry. That report said that in 2015 that Australia accounted for 60% of world trade in saltwater crocodile skins, with the territory responsible for two thirds of traded skins. Prof Grahame Webb, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature crocodile specialist group, told the Guardian crocodile farming had helped fund conservation efforts in the region. Webb said fashion houses had been “mercilessly attacked” by animal rights activists, but he said the companies had a “good story to tell”. “[Those companies] have to get more and more control over their supply chain so that they can guarantee the highest standards. “Hermès is a very conservative company – it’s them trying to do the right thing. Australia has an excellent reputation for its crocodile management program worldwide.” Webb said the scale of the new proposal from Burns suggested it would be able to produce about 15,000 crocodile skins a year. The harvesting of eggs from the wild population was sustainable, he said. Unregulated hunting of crocodiles in Australia drove numbers dangerously low until rules protecting them were introduced in the early 1970s, Webb has written. He said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the wild was now healthy and stable. “Our wild populations are full,” he said.",environment
"When Newcastle city council planned to reduce motorist access to Acorn Road in the leafy suburb of Jesmond back in 2014, hardware store owner Steve Robson helped to raise a petition against the £350,000 scheme, organised meetings to oppose the plans and told a local newspaper that the proposed changes would be “devastating”. The changes went ahead. And to date, Acorn Road has not been devastated. Far from it. Robson’s hardware shop – trading from the same small premises since 1912 – is doing so well that last month it expanded into an adjacent shop, doubling its floor space. “I’ve been happy with the changes made to the street,” says Robson. The campaign against the changes was ferocious. “We do not mind change to bring the area into the 21st century,” Robson said at the time, “but we don’t want to lose any of our parking spaces.” Council officers tweaked the scheme, but in the end much of the street makeover went ahead, including widened pavements, a contraflow for cyclists and the addition of a cyclist-only traffic light triggered by sensors. It had been a two-way street, with rush hour snarl-ups and the odd contretemps. Now motorists can drive – slowly – only one way. Bollards blotted out several parking spaces; concrete planters and double yellow lines replaced others. “Since the changes, Acorn Road has become more vibrant,” Robson says now. “With bike racks nearby, we get more cyclists coming in.” In fact, if he was given the job of Jesmond’s transport planner, the Robson of today would be a touch more radical than the Robson of 2014. “I’d like to see seats and tables to give a sort of holiday feel.” He would even widen the pavements more. So was his prediction that the changes would lead to the “death of Acorn Road” wrong? Robson laughs, and admits that yes, he got it completely wrong. Heather Stronach was killed by a lorry driver on 2 November when cycling on Edinburgh’s Portobello High Street. The 36-year-old was the second cyclist to die at the same location within 20 months. When Edinburgh’s transport and environment committee met to discuss a new LTN for an area in the city, both deaths were raised. “We need a safer environment for those most at risk on our roads,” urged committee leader Lesley Macinnes. “We have to reflect as a city where our priorities lie, and they have to lie with vulnerable road users.” But while Conservative councillors agreed with the sentiment, they continued to object and for the second time in as many months the committee was forced to refer the proposal to the full council. It’s yet more delay for a plan that has so far split the community. Introduced in August as a temporary measure to encourage cycling and walking during the pandemic, the LTN scheme for East Craigs met with immediate opposition. An anti-LTN group – Get Edinburgh Moving (Gem) – crowdfunded a legal opinion which suggested the LTN was “unlawful”. Gem chair David Hunter argued that, unlike elsewhere in Edinburgh, East Craigs has had no cyclist or pedestrian fatalities, does not suffer from rat-runs, and therefore does not need an LTN. Back in August, the SNP’s Macinnes had promised that the East Craigs LTN would “create safe, people-friendly streets”.  The scheme is likely to get full council approval eventually, but will have to go out to public consultation, yet again kicking the can down the (still open) road. Hunter told the Guardian: “East Craigs is already low traffic. The congestion problems are on the surrounding arterial routes.” Without the legal challenge “this hated and unnecessary LTN would have been imposed on the local community against its will”. But Janis Ross-Williamson, one of many local campaigners in favour of the LTN, was incredibly disappointed. She says that many roads in the area are “extremely busy” and there are problems with rat-runs and speeding. “I’ve lived here for 18 years, and the traffic has increased dramatically.” She hopes there will be some form of traffic reduction in the end, which will mean “quieter, safer streets for all of us. When it’s there and some start to use it for more active travel then more people are likely to change their habits and see the benefits of the scheme … at least that is my hope for the community.” Victoria Clasen delivers her flowers by bike. And for her Brixton-based flower delivery service Pop Florist, trade has been brisk since the LTN went in. “My sales increased, and my business has been busier than ever.” Riding along Railton Road on her Urban Arrow e-cargobike, she is a rolling advert for a greener future: “When you see a bike like mine, filled with flowers, even the most steely, cantankerous Grinch will smile, because it’s a business that spreads joy. “People recognise it’s a sustainable way of doing business, and it’s the way that all of us need to start thinking about getting around – we need to drive less, and LTNs can massively improve air quality and people’s health.” In April, Lambeth council introduced several LTNs in the south London borough, including the one on Railton Road, north of Herne Hill station. Some residents claimed to be trapped by the planters that blocked vehicle access on the sidestreets that feed Railton Road. But Giles Gibson, a business consultant and cycle campaigner, says that “access to every single front door has remained as it was”. Retailer Liam Plowman agrees. He delivers in the LTNs close to the Herne Hill off-licence Wild + Lees he has run with his wife Claire since 2016. “Driving now takes slightly longer, but I can drive to every address I could before,” he says. And Sarah Berry, voluntary co-chair of the Lambeth branch of the pedestrian organisation Living Streets, was encouraged to finally buy a bike – she hadn’t previously cycled in London. “When the LTN came in, it was ‘right, I’m out of excuses’. I went out and bought a bike on the same day.” It’s been a revelation. “I still haven’t gotten on a bus or a train or the tube since March. If I had been confined to only the areas I could walk to over the past six months, I’d be feeling a lot more isolated right now.”",environment
"There is only one thing more terrifying for a nesting bird than a person walking nearby: when that two-legged beast is joined by a four-legged companion. A study of how ground-nesting birds are disturbed on beaches in Spain has revealed how they are almost always scared from their nests by passing off-lead dogs, but seem unperturbed by motorbikes, helicopters and low-flying planes. Walkers accompanied by dogs flushed Kentish plovers from the foreshore nests 80% of the time when walking on paths over the beach, compared with just 12.9% of the time when without a dog. When walkers with dogs did not stick to paths but roamed the dunes, they scared the plovers from their nests 93.8% of the time. The study by Dr Miguel Ángel Gómez-Serrano of the University of Valencia found none of the 714 nest disturbance events observed on four beaches in Castellón and Valencia involved dogs on leads. “Fewer and fewer beaches have the capacity to host coastal bird breeding populations, so we should be concerned about conserving them,” said Gómez-Serrano, who called for dogs to be banned from more beaches during nesting season. “Dogs produce a disproportionate impact compared to that of people walking on the beach, so their entry into these areas should be limited at least in the most critical [breeding] season for these species. At this time, birds are incubating their eggs or guarding their chicks, and cannot change beaches to avoid disturbance.” The Kentish plover is a small, declining shorebird that lays camouflaged eggs on beaches across southern Europe. In Britain, similar shorebirds such as ringed plovers, oystercatchers, and little, common and sandwich terns nest on beaches. The ringed plover is on the “red list” of Britain’s most endangered birds. Its population fall of 37% between 1984 and 2007 partly attributed to nest disturbance as beaches become busier. While cordons are erected on some British beaches in spring to encourage walkers to keep off small areas of sand and shingle where birds nests, the string rarely keeps out dogs. Nesting birds will abandon their nests if disturbed too often, or their eggs may become too cold or too hot to hatch. Plover eggs have been found to tolerate temperatures between 15C and 42C before the embryo dies, with eggs rapidly overheating in Spain if left in direct sunlight without the bird sitting on them. The study, which was published in Ibis, the international journal of avian science, found that on busier beaches the flushed birds returned more quickly to their nests, suggesting they could become habituated to humans nearby. But with dogs banned from busy urban beaches in Spain during the holiday season – as is also the case on many British beaches – Gómez-Serrano said there were now more dogs being taken to remote, wildlife-rich beaches for exercise. Mark Cocker, a naturalist and author, said: “We’re in denial. We know dogs are genetically wolves and we have 10 million of them in this country. There’s clearly an environmental issue, but conservationists are scared of talking about it because it’s such a strong lobby. It’s about dog-owners showing restraint and understanding they are part of a very large cohort of people and the privilege of owning a dog comes with responsibilities. “It’s not about excluding dogs from beaches or public spaces but acknowledging that dogs off leashes cause significant problems. Dogs could easily be kept on a lead between the months of March and June when birds nest. For eight months of the year, they wouldn’t be interfering with birds’ reproduction on the beach and there should be no conflict.” Asked whether keeping dogs on leads during the spring breeding season would help nesting birds, Gómez-Serrano said: “Although the roaming movements of dogs are more reduced when on lead, dogs trigger an anti-predatory instinct in birds not comparable to that of humans. “In addition, unfortunately dog owners do not usually comply with the regulations about dog walking on leads, so surveillance is necessary so that these regulations are respected. Obviously, there is usually not enough budget for this purpose, and managers prefer not to address this widespread problem in coastal areas.”",environment
"Environment agency officials were under pressure on Monday to explain exactly what consent they gave to carry out extensive work on the banks of a protected river in England. Officials from the EA, Natural England and the Forestry Commission moved in last week to stop the work along the River Lugg outside Kingsland, near Leominster in Herefordshire. The officials – along with the police – issued a stop notice to the landowner, John Price, to halt the works, which the local wildlife trust said had devastated the river and would have dire consequences for wildlife and water quality. The EA said a legal notice requiring the works to stop immediately was served on the landowner by Natural England earlier last week, the Forestry Commission issued a stop letter requiring an end to any further felling work and the Environment Agency requested no further works to be carried out on the river. But the landowner Price, a potato and cattle farmer, has insisted that he was asked to do the work by the EA to try to tackle flooding in the area. On Monday the local parish council told the Guardian it had been in discussion with the EA since July about tackling the flooding in the area. EA officials had attended parish council meetings and walked the site in September. The EA wrote a short report seen by the Guardian. It said: “We have identified that some tree works are required on the left hand bank directly upstream of the bridge (see picture 0141) which we will again look to secure funding for and if successful make the land owner aware of our intentions. “In addition the left hand bank directly upstream of the bridge could do some reprofiling due to bank slumping probably as a result of cattle poaching (see picture 0132) to ease conveyance as it is currently partially obstructing the 3rd arch of the bridge and will look to the land owner to carry out these works.” The EA said on Monday it was continuing to investigate the damage to a river which is protected as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and a special area of conservation (SAC). As such no work should be carried out without permission from the EA. Minutes of parish council meetings confirm that the EA was in discussions with the council about flooding and what work was required to alleviate it. Minutes of Kingsland parish council meetings from July, September and October of this year contain items about the “maintenance of the Lugg”. In minutes of a meeting in July concerns were expressed about the risk of river flooding and reference made to discussions with the EA on maintenance of the Lugg. The minutes detail verbal discussions with the EA. “The levels reached during the floods earlier this year were the highest since 1976. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the riverbank has not been walked since the floods, however this is due to be done soon. “Dredging can be done where there is a need, but need to keep in mind the dynamic nature of the river which moves the bed levels anyway (diverse nature of river flow).” In October reference was made to the site visit in September with an EA official. “Cllr Rowsell reported on “a very useful” walkabout with the Environment Agency. Mr W Best, Environment Agency informed the meeting that riparian owners are responsible for maintenance but accepted that this may be beyond their capability at times and provided a helpline number.” A spokesperson for the parish council said on Monday they were not aware whether the EA had given the landowner official permission to carry out the works. He said: “We would not be told whether a permit had been issued for the works. The parish council supports work to improve the Lugg to help with flood alleviation measures. Environment Agency officials have been present in parish council meetings to discuss flood alleviation measures.” Price, of Hay Farm, told the Daily Telegraph, he had acted with permission. “I have watched this river all my life, and no one knows this river better than myself,” he said. “I have always looked after the river. I was asked to stop the erosion because I’m the landowner so I’m responsible for the river.” He said he had not uprooted any trees, but had only cleared those that had come down in floods. He said flooding in the area had been getting worse over the last 10 years, and that he had the support of the village and parish council in doing the work. The Environment Agency was asked for a comment. It had not been provided at the time of publication. ",environment
"It’s fair to say I learned two main things in trying to test out a series of commuter-type e-bikes over the past few months. One was more of a rediscovery: they’re fantastic fun. The other was a surprise: at the moment, they’re really hard to get hold of. The coronavirus pandemic changed the UK in many ways, and one of the minor impacts was to spark an explosion of interest in e-bikes, as people sought out ways to return to work while avoiding public transport and traffic jams. After months of back-and-forth emails with bike companies and PRs, I got hold of the four featured below. I wanted to test more models, and some cheaper ones, but it couldn’t happen. Before I get into the details, there are three general points to make. Enough preamble; let’s get to the reviews. This innovative Dutch company is so convinced by the prospects for e-bike travel that it has stopped making conventional bikes altogether, though the distinctive frame design remains, with front and rear lights in the crossbar tube. In fact, pretty much everything is built into the frame, including the battery and motor, meaning fellow cyclists at red lights might not even realise what you’re riding until you shoot into the distance with a gentle whirring noise. At least by e-bike standards, the S3 is not hugely expensive, but the feel is very hi-tech and high-end. Rather than a clunky bolted-to-the-handlebar display, a digital readout in the crossbar gives you the speed and battery life. An associated app lets you vary the automatic gears. Even the bell is electronic, with an app-selected choice of noise. To ride, the S3 is genuinely fantastic. The motor power, which comes via the cranks rather than direct to a wheel, is smooth and gradual, without the sudden jolt that some older e-bikes used to give when you hit 15mph. In fact, the bike initially felt almost unnervingly nippy, until I realised the last test rider had left the app switched to US settings, meaning the electric power stayed on up to 20mph, the legal limit there. This is actually a bit worrying, as to use the bike in the UK like this would be illegal. I’m told VanMoof now don’t allow UK users to switch modes. If you have the budget for a VanMoof, a lot of it will come down to its quirks. For example, the fully integrated battery looks very slick. But it can’t be removed, so if, like me, you live in a flat and keep bikes in a garage without electric power, it makes the S3 slightly pointless. Similarly, some of the techy features felt a bit solution-in-search-of-a-problem. I endlessly fiddled with the ratios for the four-speed automatic gears, but could never find a range that even approximated how I’d want to change manually. Even the two electronic bell noises were a bit too abrasive for my tastes. But others will, and do, disagree. The VanMoof was definitely the bike that prompted the most interest and envy from neighbours and fellow riders, and if the design suits you, it is a delight to ride. In terms of commuting practicality, the S3 comes with full mudguards and a chair guard, and VanMoof makes its own front and rear racks, with branded pannier bags to go on them. I had hoped to try the same-priced commuter model in Halfords’ own-brand range, or a slightly cheaper folding version. But if e-bikes are in short supply, then (relatively) cheap ones are like gold dust, so I tried out the mountain bike. Though officially designed for hills and trails, it is still quite commuter-friendly, with eyelets for mudguards and a rear rack, while the wide tyres and suspension forks laugh in the face of bumpy surfaces. Not so long ago, cheaper e-bikes could be jerky and jolting, but the Vengeance is enormous fun, and handles with surprising nimbleness. At 23kg, it is undeniably something of a beast, but the electric motor hauls you up inclines with ease. I even tried riding it, motor-less, up one steep hill, and while I wouldn’t call it fun, it wasn’t impossible. On picking up the bike, I had worried whether its brakes – cable-operated disc models, as against the VanMoof’s hydraulic versions – might be a bit weedy against such bulk, but they were fine. The main journey I took was a 20-plus-mile cross-London round trip to see a friend, on a day of constantly pouring rain, and it was a great illustration of the benefits of an e-bike. Even dressed in trawlerman-style waterproofs, there was no chance of overly sweating, while the sheer bulk of the bike mitigated against skittish handling. Guided by a phone app along a complex route of back streets and low-traffic neighbourhoods, I found it almost relaxing. Yes, I could have done the trip on my normal bike, but the chances are I wouldn’t have bothered. The contrast between the VanMoof and the Brompton is perhaps best exemplified by their bells. While the former gave me the choice between two highly audible if grating electronic beeps, the Brompton’s small, highly polished bell produces the equivalent of a frock-coated butler politely clearing his throat. To continue the parallel, if the VanMoof has everything sleekly integrated, the e-Brompton is basically a standard model with a motor hub and battery pack added to the front. This is perhaps unfair. The electrification is both neat and elegant, with the front-wheel mounting allowing the bike to completely fold in the normal Brompton way. The battery comes in an elegant bag that clips to the front, and can be removed with a click and then carried. Wheel-drive e-bikes used to sometimes feel a bit clunky, but the Brompton is ultra-smooth, and hugely nippy in full-power mode (the only one I ever use for e-bikes, I have to confess), and is very manageable to ride on zero power, even with the minimalist two-gear system. As with all Bromptons, much depends on whether you need a folding bike. One extra advantage here is that e-bikes are very stealable, and with a Brompton you can safely keep it inside, at home or in an office. But then, of course, comes the price. Even the cheapest manual Brompton leaves minimal change from £800, but an extra £2,000 might feel a lot for that electric assist, however well engineered. However, Brompton fans tend to be loyal, so for those who can afford it, this could be a price worth paying. If the other bikes I tried all had their quirks, or niches, perhaps the best thing you can say about the Motus is that it is gloriously ordinary – a very sensible and well-fitted commuter bike that just happens to have an electric motor. With full mudguards, a chainguard and rack, sensible, swept-back handlebars, and even a kick stand, this is a bike for getting around town efficiently and without drama. On a conventional commuter bike, suspension forks tend to be a weighty irrelevance, but here they helped make the ride even smoother. None of this is to say the bike is dull. Particularly if you’ve never tried one, riding an e-bike is one of the most instantly grin-inducing things you can do on two wheels, and the Motus is zippy, smooth and enormous fun, even though it is no slimline machine, weighing in at about the same as the Carrera. Whereas some might feel baffled by the VanMoof’s app-adjusted inner workings, the Motus is a very obviously a conventional bike, with standard derailleur gears and no-fuss hydraulic discs. The electrics are controlled via a straightforward handlebar display. One thing I’ve not mentioned for any of the bikes is range, in part as this depends on so many factors, including what power setting you use, how much you pedal yourself, rider weight, and terrain. But e-bikes increasingly only need to be charged every few days, even once a week, as opposed to the range-anxiety-inducing creatures of before. The Raleigh claims a standard range of 76 miles, which is more than enough for a week of commuting for most people.",environment
"Roger Payne has played the sounds made by humpback whales to thousands of people – “more than thousands,” he corrects himself – in the past 50 years. He has played sections in schools, in churches, on TV talk shows, at the UN; he’s played them to singers, musicians, politicians and other scientists. The response is always the same. For the first 30 seconds, there is mumbling, sometimes awkward giggling as the audience gets used to the deep, rumbling groans and high-pitched squeaks (this is when the TV shows usually cut it off).  But leave it longer – at least five minutes, ideally half an hour – and Payne finds a strange thing happens. “In that time, the audience would go totally silent,” says the 85-year-old, on a video call from rural Vermont. “You were unaware there was anybody in the room and then, when I killed it, there would be this… inhalation. You would hear people basically coming out of a kind of trance. That was the clue that, ‘This is changing the lives of these people.’ And that’s how I think we’ve got it to really make a difference.” In 1970, Payne led a team that released a five-track, 34-minute album called Songs of the Humpback Whale. To everyone’s surprise – Payne was a bioacoustics expert, not a musician – it became a hit: it sold more than 125,000 copies, making it the most popular nature recording of all time. Pete Seeger and Judy Collins, superstars at the time, wrote songs inspired by the record. When Nasa launched their Golden Record aboard the Voyager spacecraft in 1977, one of Payne’s songs was included on the 12-inch gold-plated disc, along with music from Bach, Mozart and Louis Armstrong. Then, in 1979, an extract from the album was sent to all National Geographic’s 10.5 million subscribers. This made it the largest single pressing in recording history – a record it holds to this day. On the 50th anniversary of Songs of the Humpback Whale, it can be hard to fathom how much has changed in our appreciation of the species. In the 1960s, tens of thousands of whales were slaughtered every year, mainly for soap, oil and pet food. Humpback whales, which numbered around 100,000 in 1900, had been hunted mercilessly and fewer than 7,000 remained. “They were headed towards extinction, no discussion,” says Payne. Payne’s own experience backed up this depressing picture. The first cetacean he ever saw was a dolphin that had washed ashore and died on the coast near Boston, when he was teaching at Tufts University. It was late at night and raining when he found the body. “Some bozo had chopped off its flukes and somebody else had stuffed a cigar butt in its blowhole,” he recalls. “I thought to myself, ‘Is this the only interaction that can occur between people and the wild world?’ I sat there, soaked to the bone, and decided it would be wonderful to do something about this. I had no chance of that at that moment, but a chance slowly appeared.” That “chance” was an encounter in 1967 with a man named Frank Watlington, an engineer for the US Navy, based in Bermuda . Since the 1950s, Watlington had been monitoring a large collection of hydrophones (microphones designed to record underwater sounds) 30 miles off the coast of the island, mainly with the hope of eavesdropping on Soviet submarines. “I never knew what his work was,” says Payne. “It was something secret: state-supported skulduggery in the ocean.” There’s no record of how effective Watlington’s official assignment was but the hydrophones proved to be the perfect tool for listening to humpback whales. We know now that, although many whales use sound to communicate, humpbacks are the only ones that “sing”: it might, on first hearing, sound like one drawn-out moan, but Payne, his first wife Katy and an associate, Scott McVay, proved that there is an intentional rhyme, repetition and structure in the noises. Female humpbacks do some quiet singing, but the loudest, most brazen crooning comes from males during the six-month breeding season. “My guess is that it is an advertising song, an invitation to females: ‘Hey, I’m a handsome dude ready to mate. Where are you baby?’” says Payne. “And the other function is that the sounds they are making would mean a threat: ‘Stay back buster or I’ll bust your ass!’” Either way, Payne realised from the moment that Watlington played him the tapes he had recorded that they had something special. He also knew, as he listened with tears in his eyes, that he potentially had the secret to stopping the massacre of these creatures. “It was dead obvious to me from sound number two or three that this was the most extraordinary thing ever heard in nature,” says Payne. “All I was interested in was trying to get the world to think: ‘Hey, folks, we’re killing off the largest animals that have ever lived in the history of the planet. This is nuts!’ Then here comes this fabulously beautiful thing. Suppose oak trees sang stunningly beautiful songs and you were concerned because oak forests were being levelled.” Songs of the Humpback Whale consisted of three of Watlington’s tracks, and two made by the Paynes. Payne sent out copies to the Beatles, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan: he heard that Dylan would sometimes stop his gigs and play a section of the recording. He met the Welsh singer Mary Hopkin, an early signing to the Beatles’ Apple label, best known for the No 1 single, Those Were The Days. After some initial confusion where she thought it was “the songs of Wales”, Hopkin listened rapt. “She said, ‘That’s the most beautiful sound I’ve ever heard. I wish I could sound that way.’ And of course she had a most beautiful voice.” Payne’s album did inspire a movement, much as he hoped. Support came with the foundation of Greenpeace in 1972, and in particular its Project Ahab in the mid-70s, in which activists parked their boats in front of the whalers’ harpoons. David Attenborough and Jacques Cousteau made popular documentaries focused on the creatures. In 1986, the International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling for all species, although Iceland, Norway and Japan still issue permits for scientific and commercial whaling. Whale song entered popular culture, becoming the main plot point of the 1986 film Star Trek: the Voyage Home and a gag in The Simpsons, where a college professor tries to woo Marge. And the numbers of whales has rebounded. Humpback whales have come back to pre-whaling populations, perhaps as many as 100,000. (Not all cetaceans have been so lucky: blue and North Atlantic right whales remain endangered.) “My whole thought was if we can build whales into human culture, then we can save them,” says Payne. “And I think that’s happened. Good God, I’m certainly not the one who did all the building. There are thousands, literally thousands of other people who did vast and wonderful things.” A half century on, Payne continues to write and lecture, and he has become involved in a pioneering group that is attempting to use machine learning to decipher what whales are actually saying – and maybe even, eventually, to communicate with them. It’s an outlandish concept but there are some high-powered individuals involved, including Britt Selvitelle, one of the founding team at Twitter, and Aza Raskin, who devised the now ubiquitous “infinite scroll” on webpages. Payne calls the endeavour a “wonderfully crazy thing”, but adds: “I think we have a hell of a good chance of it. Where you get stuff done is where you start mixing fields and discover these people are very close to knowing something I wish to hell I’d known 25 years ago.” Covid-19 has hampered any plans for a proper celebration of Songs of the Humpback Whale’s 50th birthday. But Payne believes that the record, not so fashionable these days, still resonates. “I listen to it frequently and it always hits me hard,” he says. “What is the main conclusion that whales build in your mind? My feeling is humility. Giant hurricanes build humility and so do tornadoes, but there’s nothing that does it better that I’ve ever encountered than a whale. And humility is something we need more experiences of. It’s just: God almighty, what a fabulous world exists around us and how utterly we’re destroying it.”",environment
"Mist is rising from the Water of Ae, turning gold as the dawn light slips across the valley through the forest of birch and pine. Fieldfares clatter down the path at our presence and a goldcrest calls sibilantly through the still air. Under the mist, a dipper stands up to its shins in the flow of clear water, bobbing with the ripples running over the rocks. I want to clamber down the bank and stick my finger in the river but by the bank I stop. A white branch catches my eye. I reach out a fingertip to feel that instead, and it crumbles to my touch like the powdery flakes of fresh snowfall. Hair ice. Uncommon but a speciality here. It is one of nature’s finest magic tricks: the freezing temperature revealing invisible processes. It needs damp air and a fungus, Exidiopsis effusa, to form. The fungus expels moisture along the radial rays of the wood and when this moisture meets the freezing air, it turns to ice. The wood keeps expelling water that freezes into thin wispy filaments, strands of ice that are almost invisible individually, that form a thick fur together. I hold one branch up to the sun: I see tiny water droplets suspended on the hair-like strings of ice. They burn white in the light, a cold blue in the shade. Best of all is how the name fits perfectly. The ice is coiffed. It has a parting. Either side of the branch its strands head off in different directions, neither crossing the parting but both curling around, ending up facing the same direction, almost as if it has been styled by the night’s air. Perhaps the greatest trick of all is in its disappearance. When we return down the path an hour later, the golden morning sunlight has crept across the river, warming our side of the bank. The ice has vanished, leaving only wood, damp from the thaw, clear of bark and moss. And I realise then something I’ve wanted to know all year. The clarity of ice is this: that nothing lasts for ever. The real trick is how to make the most of it.",environment
"The Norwegian fishing village of Bugøynes, 310 miles north of the Arctic Circle and a frigid, dark place for much of the year, was on the edge of ruin. Work was scarce. Years of overfishing and mismanagement had stymied cod quotas. Boats lay idle in cold waters. Those who chose to stay were forced to rely on what meagre wages they could still muster from fishing and processing. That is, until the crabs arrived. Starting in the 1980s, woeful fishermen began hoisting up mysterious, spindly giants in their nets in Varangerfjord. The aliens, brandishing two menacing pincers, weighed far more than the brown crabs they had seen farther south. Unknown to the fishermen, the crustaceans had traveled from Russia, where scientists had introduced red king crabs on the Murman coast during the 1960s with the goal of establishing a new, lucrative fishery. Slowly, the crabs scuttled the 60 or so miles over the border into Norway. The deep fjords in the Barents Sea near Bugøynes provided the perfect cover. The invasion of “Stalin’s red army” was initially seen as a disaster. The crabs became entangled in gillnets and longlines, removing bait and causing damage that allowed coveted fish species to escape. But when the fishermen learned of the million-dollar Alaskan king crab fishery, they realised the crab could be more boom than bust. Today the red king crab is largely credited with rescuing the fishing villages of the north during a time when cod was sparse. The monstrous crabs, which now number in the millions, have become the centre of a huge industry: this October alone, Norway exported nearly $9m (£6.7m) worth of king crab. The price of king crab has tripled in just over a decade, according to the Norwegian Seafood Council. The fishermen of Bugøynes can sell their catch for more than 210 Norwegian kroner ($24) a kilo to producers, who distribute the crustaceans to the world’s finest restaurants, hotels and casinos. The Norwegian government recently announced it was increasing the male crab quota by 18% to 1,810 tonnes in 2021. But while the crabs have largely been good news for fishermen and the economy, the same can’t be said for other species. Following the crab’s cross-border move, native seafloor species have rapidly declined. The crabs are continuing to expand their territory, and could soon arrive in the Lofoten Islands, one of the world’s largest seasonal cod fisheries. That puts government regulators in a tough spot, between securing the long-term economic viability of the crab fishery and limiting its takeover of native species and traditional fisheries. They ultimately can’t push for total eradication if king crab is to continue buoying northern coastal communities – but at what cost? Inside the Norway King Crab facility on the docks of Bugøynes, 3,000 red king crabs float in 30 giant round tanks. This is just one day’s catch. Soon they’ll be transported 1,100 miles by truck to Oslo, where they will be loaded on to cargo planes and shipped live around the world – to Dubai, Los Angeles, Kuala Lumpur. The fishermen of Varangerfjord place pots year-round, with peak season running from October to January. How many crabs they can catch is regulated by a quota set by the government each year to ensure the future of the commercial fishery. Every few days, fishermen check herring- and mackerel-baited pots that can trap up to 50 large crabs at a time. Then they return to shore to sell their catch. “When the crabs came here, it put life in our small places,” says Gentjan Kryeziu, operations manager of Norway King Crab, one of the largest crab producers in Troms og Finnmark county. The company buys roughly 20% of the annual quota from fishermen for processing. Kryeziu, originally from Albania, is one of many foreign workers who have moved to Bugøynes to work in the king crab industry. “If you’re a skilful, not lazy fisherman, you can get your full quota – two or three tonnes per boat – in two or three weeks maximum. Then you are done and get cash in your pocket,” says Roman Vasilyev, a Russian scientist who moved to Bugøynes in 2013 to help advance the technology for shipping live crabs, which sell for more money than processed ones – as much as 1,000 Norwegian kroner ($120) in restaurants. The king crab earned its spot at the top of the marine monarchy for a reason: it crawls along the seafloor eating starfish, worms, sea cucumbers and molluscs. The crabs have few natural predators in cold Arctic waters. When researchers surveyed the fjords of the Varanger region around Bugøynes in 2012, they found that the abundance of many seafloor species had dramatically declined since the crab’s arrival. In some areas, mussels and starfish had disappeared completely. Such changes ripple up the food chain: other native species, such as haddock, depend on these seafloor species for food. “[The crabs] could even change the oxygen conditions on the seafloor since they nip out the animals that dig up and turn over the sediment,” says Haakon Hop, a marine biologist at the Norwegian Polar Institute. A reduction in oxygen, known as hypoxia, can further trigger species die-offs in the marine ecosystem. These environmental changes have perhaps prompted higher red king crab fishery quotas to help conserve the native bottom-dwellers. “Over the last few years, the department of fisheries has decided on quotas higher than the recommendations,” says Ton-Ola Rudi, a senior adviser who is responsible for management of king crab in the north. The government has often dithered over whether to manage the crabs as a valuable fishery stock – setting the total allowable catch to ensure long-term sustainable harvesting – or as a destructive invader, with populations restricted to save other fisheries and species. In fact, there is already an “eradication” fishery established west of North Cape, about 100 miles from Bugøynes: anyone with a boat here is allowed to harvest king crab. The aim is to prevent the crabs from disrupting another lucrative industry: cod, which gather in abundance at the nearby Lofoten Islands. But around Varangerfjord, where crab density is extremely high, total eradication probably isn’t feasible. Moreover, fishermen can often make more money in less time catching crabs compared with other species and have grown accustomed to the financial rewards. A budding tourist industry is developing too. Edgar Olsen, who has lived in the town of Nesseby between Varangerfjord and the Tana River all his life, considers himself a fisherman of cod and haddock, but now also fills his crab quota, and works as a tourist guide on king crab expeditions in the fjords, taking visitors out into the fjord to see and, later, taste the crab. King crab, he says, has had a positive effect for some, but he’d be happier without them, particularly given that cod stocks have recovered in Norway. “It’s quick money,” he says of king crab. But people will lose their whole fish catch if a crab damages the gillnet or long line, he adds. For now, however, hundreds of small vessels continue to rove the fjords looking for the crustaceans. In parts of northern Norway, gillnet fishing has more or less stopped due to the crustacean’s takeover. As for its detrimental impact on the ecosystem, the problem is likely to persist as long as king crab retains its popularity on the plate over Norway’s native fish species. “The best parties always have king crab,” says Hop, the marine biologist. “At the confirmation for our daughter, we served king crab. We did not serve cod.”",environment
"I don’t usually take binoculars on my early-morning bike ride; if I did, I would stop too often to get any benefit. But after a swift circuit around the levels, I picked them up and headed down the lane behind my home to look for a stonechat I’d seen the day before. The stonechat had moved on; possibly because of the presence of a male merlin – the first I’d seen here in Somerset for a decade. I first noticed the bird as he flew away from me, and resigned myself to the usual brief views. But moments later, he landed on top of a tall hedgerow. As I freewheeled slowly closer, I feared my luminous yellow cycling top would spook him. Yet to my delight, he stayed put, giving me my best ever view of this, our smallest falcon. Gunmetal grey-blue above, his streaked breast tinged with orange, he first turned to look at me, then away, showing off the false “eyes” on the back of his head. These are supposed to deter larger predators; but they may actually be to goad smaller birds, such as skylarks and meadow pipits, into mobbing him. Then he dropped off the perch and flew away, direct and low, off to ambush those same pipits and skylarks, somewhere across the moor.

"One of the most remarkable creatures on the planet is the common octopus, or Octopus vulgaris, which is now well established in UK waters as our seas warm because of the climate crisis. It has three hearts, and eight limbs with 200 suckers that can feel, taste and smell its surroundings. Scientists remain divided over whether it has one brain or nine. In mammals, most neurons are in the brain, but with octopuses, two-thirds are in their body and arms, enabling each arm to do complex tasks, such as opening jars to obtain food, apparently independently from the central brain. After much experimenting with underwater mazes and other contraptions, scientists concluded that octopuses could solve various problems with one limb and then communicate the experience to other arms via the central brain. The creatures only live about two years, changing colour to merge into the background while wandering about the seabed eating shellfish and anything they catch. To escape being eaten themselves by sharks or fish such as cod they release ink and use a jet of water to escape to a hiding place. During winter storms, octopuses can be stranded on beaches and in rock pools. Rescuers report eye contact, possibly an attempt at communication, before they swim away. ",environment
"I’m out here again, as much because I need to be as because I want to be. In spring, during the first lockdown, our garden became very important to me and my family. In long hours out here, and only here, we got to know it more intimately than before. Noticed more. Felt the changes more acutely in its trees, leaves, its other residents – hedgehogs, bees, red kites passing overhead – as spring thickened into summer. Now, at the opposite end of the year, those things are thinning. Before, I tried to stand in one place, to deepen my observance of a suddenly smaller world. Now it’s autumn and, again restricted, I try to do the same, differently. I close my eyes, engage my other senses, and let them wander around the landscape surrounding my home. From a sensory point of view, autumn is my favourite time of year. There are the sights, of course: the way the sun rims the edge of everything, all day. Colours richer, or the light on them, or both. Morning mists; evening glow. But tune these out and you find other things easily eclipsed by those vivid sights. Sounds build a collage of the season. The hard concussion of a neighbour chopping logs.  The rattle of leaves dry and curled in the canopy of the sycamore, and the creak of the horse chestnut’s naked branches, both enlivened by a wind that seems to come from a colder place than the air. This comes and goes, making the landscape breathe with an ebbing, collective hiss. I lie on the ground, palms to the grass, and feel with fingertips the damp soil – soil that won’t be dry now until spring. I smell the acrid dew-damp leaves on the ground, that subtle odour of slow decay. And on the wind, woodsmoke from other houses; for however long, still the signature of winter. I look, too. It’s necessary in the windy season, if only to check the trees for damage. I find a little: a branch blown from a silver birch lies prone on rusty leaves, the shape of a tuning fork. Like spring, autumn is one of those directional changes. Here, the seasons meet a junction and the year takes the colder, darker, sketchier road.",environment
"After spending hundreds of hours observing pygmy seahorses for my doctorate, I knew exactly when Tom, a Denise’s pygmy seahorse in Sulawesi, Indonesia, would give birth. He swam with great resolve (1) from where he slept each night with his partner, Josephine, against the current, to the edge of the gorgonian seafan (a type of coral) that the two inhabited. He never faltered. At the edge of the coral, the current was at its strongest, offering the greatest chance of sweeping his offspring out to the relative safety of the open ocean. Having grabbed on to the edge of the gorgonian with his tail, Tom began to give birth. Over several occasions I witnessed him release between six and 12 fry. The labour was obviously arduous and he was crunched over, panting for breath. Two of the dark-coloured fry are seen here (2) forcefully being expelled from his brood pouch. With adults measuring less than 2cm in length, the fry are just 2-3mm long. Their dark colour gives them some degree of camouflage in the open ocean and they will spend two to three weeks floating freely in currents, before settling to a gorgonian of their own. It took Tom a little while of crunching, drawing in water and crunching again before the last baby finally popped out (3). The juvenile had been with its siblings for almost two weeks in the brood pouch. When they are born, aside from colour, they appear to be miniature versions of their parents. It’s not until they settle to a new gorgonian that they adapt in surface texture and colour to match their particular home. I recorded the transition of a juvenile pygmy seahorse and it took five days to become a perfect match with the gorgonian. After all the babies have finally been released, the male pygmy seahorse is perhaps the only male in the animal kingdom to truly suffer from stretch marks. His empty brood pouch was now wrinkled (4) following the birth of the fry he had been carrying. Although he was clearly quite exhausted, Tom immediately headed back to where Josephine was resting. There wasn’t a moment’s respite for him, as Josephine quickly emerged and began a series of ritualised quivers to convey her intention to proceed to the next part of the reproductive cycle. After a series of ritualised dances, Tom and Josephine both released their grip of the gorgonian coral and their tails intertwined (5). Tom was still very deflated after having given birth 20 minutes or so before. Josephine, on the left, is clearly rather plump because she is full of a clutch of unfertilised eggs. Females begin to hydrate their clutch a few days before mating. The daily courtship rituals are carried out to help synchronise the pair’s reproductive cycles. It is important the female doesn’t begin to prepare the eggs for mating too early as they may spoil if the male is not ready. It took 45 seconds for Josephine to push the unfertilised eggs across to Tom’s empty brood pouch (6). As they entered his reproductive system he fertilised them. The sequence allowed Tom to be certain that each and every baby he would carry would be his own. This certainty of paternity is extremely rare in the animal kingdom, and explains why male seahorses put so much effort into raising their offspring. It was an honour to be the first person to witness and record this series of events. Bargibant’s and Denise’s pygmy seahorses live exclusively on the surface of gorgonian seafans (7). These seahorses are very hard to find because of their miniature size and fantastic camouflage, so knowing which species of gorgonians they live on is a huge help. Gorgonians are fan-like corals that can get as large as a car’s windscreen. They attach to the reef where ocean currents hit, bringing large volumes of nutrients. They are covered in polyps that trap plankton for food. These are animals, not plants, so don’t need sunlight for energy. In 2013 I was in Okinawa in Japan to attend a conference. Years before, I had seen a picture of an unusual pygmy seahorse taken in Japan that piqued my interest. After hours trawling the internet, I tracked down a location where I thought I might find it and headed to the small island of Hachijō-jima, south of Tokyo. Amazingly, over the course of a few days I managed to find more than a dozen of them (8) and was sure they were distinct from all others I had seen before. It wasn’t until I was presenting at another conference a few years later that things started moving forwards. During my keynote presentation, I mentioned these pygmy seahorses and that I was sure they were a new species. Graham Short, an expert in seahorse taxonomy, came and spoke to me, which immediately began a flurry of seahorse excitement. Eighteen months later, we named the new 2cm-long pygmy seahorse Hippocampus japapigu (9). At the time, it was thought to only occur in the waters off Japan, but it has since been confirmed as far south as Taiwan. In May of this year, colleagues from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and I named a new species of pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus nalu (10). A few months earlier, a dive guide had spotted it in Sodwana Bay, in north-eastern South Africa. I went with a colleague to observe it first hand. It is the first pygmy seahorse to have been recorded anywhere in the Indian Ocean. The waters off South Africa are quite wild, and it wasn’t easy to find and photograph them as each surge wave dragged me several metres away from the subject. Several years ago a diver came across a strange fish and assumed it was New Zealand’s first indigenous seahorse. It was, in fact, a new species of pygmy pipehorse (11), a very close relative of the seahorse. I managed to capture one of the only images of this species in the wild in 2017. At that time, it hadn’t been seen in over six months. The pipehorse is only 5-6cm long with immaculate camouflage. I found a pair clinging to a tiny algal frond. An undescribed species of ghost pipefish, commonly known as the velvetghost pipefish (12), tends to live around brightly coloured sponges, and each individual pipefish matches exactly the colour of the sponge immediately adjacent to where it lives. There are half a dozen or so other ghost pipefishes found across the Indo-Pacific oceans, and each is highly adapted for its habitat. Some are white, others pink or even scarlet. They usually live in male-female pairs that hunt tiny shrimps and other crustaceans. Since the turn of the millennium there has been a flurry of discoveries of miniature fishes. I believe this is because the megafauna – such as sharks, turtles and rays – around south-east Asia have dwindled to such an extent that recreational divers and their guides began to look at smaller creatures to satisfy their curiosity. This thread pipehorse, Kyonemichthys rumengani (13), was described in 2007. It is just 2.6cm long and looks like several intertwined hairs moving around. Just like seahorses, these fish brood their young in a pouch on the male’s belly. Lynne’s pipefish, Festucalex rufus (14), was only named in 2015. Again, it evaded detection owing to its small size, habitat specificity and highly efficient camouflage. It is the size of a cocktail stick and lives only among little patches of a certain sponge found on coral reef walls below around 15 metres depth. It matches the sponge exactly in texture and colour, and even when you’re looking directly at one, it’s almost impossible to see it. Two risk factors for a species’ chance of extinction are their habitat specificity and geographic range. This pygmy seahorse (15) was named in 2009 as the Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus waleananus. In the year before it was described, I observed it in the wild and am one of the few to have done so. It is only found in one small bay in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it lives only on the surface of certain soft corals. There has never been any research on their biology but the relative risks to their populations are great. Just one species of pygmy seahorse was known before the turn of the millennium. Since then, another seven have been added to the list. I took this image of Pontoh’s pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus pontohi (16), which was named in 2008, in February this year in Indonesia. The dark-coloured Pontoh’s were originally described as a distinct species, but genetic analysis has shown that they are the same as the white form. Seahorses are extremely variable in colour and surface texture, which has led to many new species being erroneously named over the years. The Japanese pygmy seahorse (17) appears superficially similar to several others, but genetic analysis shows it split from all others around 8 million years ago. It has a few morphological differences, too, which allow the trained eye to identify it. Unlike Bargibant’s and Denise’s pygmies, which live on the surface of gorgonian corals, I found the Japanese species grasping to the algal tufts that cover the huge volcanic boulders found around Hachijō-jima. Because of this, it is much harder to find them. The large swells off Hachijō mean it’s difficult to stay still enough in the water to keep an eye on them. Sadly, pristine coral reefs like this one in West Papua, Indonesia (18), are becoming much harder to find. One of the greatest threats comes from coral bleaching. When the water around coral reefs is 2C above the average for the time of year, the symbiotic algae within the coral’s cells become stressed and leave. The algae contain photosynthetic pigments that provide energy to the coral. In exchange, the coral provides the algae with its own waste products, which act as a fertiliser. Without the algae, coral is left ghostly white. Some researchers believe coral reefs in their current form may not survive beyond 2050. That, in turn, means the pygmy seahorse faces an uncertain future.

"The capacity of the EU’s offshore windfarms in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea will be increased 25-fold, under a draft plan drawn up by the European commission. The move follows Boris Johnson’s announcement this year of his intention to generate enough electricity to power every home in the UK within a decade from the country’s offshore sites. Both the UK and the EU are seeking to make progress on the target of carbon emission neutrality by 2050 and pioneer potentially rival innovations that will put its industry at the forefront of the growing sector. The total energy generating capacity in Europe’s seas stands at 23 gigawatts (GW), with 12GW of the total from 5,047 grid-connected wind turbines across 12 countries, including the UK. Under a European commission strategy, the 27 EU member states alone would achieve a capacity of 60GW by 2030 and 300GW by 2050, with Germany set to hugely increase its investment in the sector. According to the leaked paper, the commission “estimates that an installed capacity of 300GW of offshore wind [and around 60GW of ocean energies] by 2050 would be needed in the integrated, greener and climate neutral energy system of 2050.” The commission writes: “This is feasible for a sector where Europe has gained unrivalled technological, scientific and industrial experience and where strong capacity exists already across the supply chain, from manufacturing to shipping and installation. Nonetheless, it is a very challenging horizon. It means that offshore renewable energy capacity should be multiplied by 25 times by 2050. The investment needed is estimated up to €789bn.” The UK, which left the EU in January, has the largest amount of offshore wind capacity in Europe, with 45% of all installations. Germany is second with 34%, followed by Denmark (8%), Belgium (7%) and the Netherlands (5%). The UK, home to the world’s largest windfarms in Walney and Hornsea 1 in the North Sea, is currently investing more in offshore wind than any other country. Walney windfarm generates power for more than 600,000 homes across Cumbria, while Hornsea 1 supports power for over 1m households across the UK. Over the summer, the German government said it would also increase its current 7.5GW of capacity to 20GW by 2030, with a target of 40GW by 2040. But the European commission has called for a more “resolute” approach across the bloc. According to a leak of the strategy obtained by the Euractiv news website, the “very challenging” target for new windfarms would come with an expected price tag of €789bn, creating 62,000 jobs in the offshore wind industry. To fully exploit the technology, the commission wants the EU member states to work across nationals to scale up capacity through so-called hybrid sites of which there is only one example in Europe as it stands. The Kriegers Flak site, an offshore windfarm located between Germany and Denmark, is also forced to operate under a transitional arrangement due to lack of enabling EU legislation. The commission strategy, set to be unveiled on Thursday, will call for investment in both classic fixed-bottom turbines and newer floating infrastructure which can be installed in deeper waters. There is concern that the European countries are failing to invest significantly enough in offshore sites. The strategy paper notes that “nearly half of global offshore wind investment in 2018 took place in China”. Iván Pineda, director of public affairs at WindEurope, the body representing the off-shore sector, said: “Offshore wind is cheap but requires huge upfront investment. So it’s crucial to minimise the finance costs. And the best way to do that is to ensure windfarms have stable income. It’s very important the strategy recognises this, both for conventional windfarms and the hybrid ones that connect to more than one country. “We need to rethink how offshore wind is deployed in Europe. Connecting windfarms to more than one country is a logical evolution and crucial step to optimise space at sea, reduce costs of grids, and send electricity where it is needed. The current EU rules put offshore hybrids at a disadvantage against regular offshore wind and interconnector projects.”",environment
"The world’s largest power station is planned for a vast piece of desert about half the size of greater suburban Sydney in Australia’s remote north-west. Called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, its size is difficult to conceptualise. If built in full, there will be 1,600 giant wind turbines and a 78 sq km array of solar panels a couple of hundred kilometres east of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. This solar-wind hybrid power plant would have a capacity of 26 gigawatts, more than Australia’s entire coal power fleet. The hub’s backers say the daytime sun and nightly winds blowing in from the Indian Ocean are perfectly calibrated to provide a near constant source of emissions-free energy around the clock. Most of it will be used to run 14GW of electrolysers that will convert desalinated seawater into “green hydrogen” – a form of energy that analysts expect to be in increasing demand as a replacement for fossil fuels in the years and decades ahead. Though still five years away from construction, the hub vaulted closer to reality in recent weeks after the federal government granted it major project status – a designation that should smooth the approval processes – and the Western Australian government greenlit its first stage. It is an ambitious undertaking, but it is not alone. The Asian Renewable Energy Hub heads a list of projects and potential developments, many private and some government backed, that are seeking to capitalise on what the economist Ross Garnaut described as Australia’s potential to be a clean energy superpower. While Australia’s climate politics remain stuck in gridlock, the government is focused on promoting gas-fired developments and – Covid-19 aside – national greenhouse gas emissions have largely flatlined in the years since the Coalition abolished an overarching federal climate policy. However, the plummeting cost of solar and wind energy is encouraging investments that seemed unlikely not long ago. The pace of investment in large-scale clean energy has slowed since the 23% national renewable energy target was filled and not replaced last year, but state governments and corporates are filling some of that gap. This week alone there were a string of extraordinary announcements. The New South Wales government plans to underwrite 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage over the next decade, Woolworths is promising to run its supermarkets and operations on 100% green energy within five years, and the country’s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, dumped its shares in Whitehaven Coal as it set a path to a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050. Perhaps most remarkably, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest foreshadowed that his Fortescue Metals Group would move aggressively into renewable energy, setting a goal of building 235GW across the globe. Here are some of the other green shoots and big ideas that are on the horizon or, in some cases, already with us. The Pilbara project was initially planned as a means to sell green energy to coal-rich Indonesia via sub-sea cable. That idea has been dropped in favour of hydrogen, based on the expectation that by 2035 the world will be looking for vast amounts of green fuel to replace coal, gas and oil. Alex Hewitt, the founder and director of CWP Renewables, an Australian-based partner in the hub, says the $53bn development is the country’s first “renewable energy project at oil and gas scale” – and a sign of where the world is headed. “The buzzwords here are scale and urgency,” he says. “When fully operational this will produce 1.8m tonnes of hydrogen every year for decades, with an energy content equivalent to 40% of Australia’s overall electricity generation.” All being well, Hewitt says, its first shipment of green energy into Asia will be made in 2027. Hydrogen has grabbed the attention of politicians and industry, including winning support at federal and state level in Australia. There are more than 20 smaller hydrogen projects under way across the country, but the hub dwarfs them. Hewitt says it will allow the fuel to be produced for less than $2 a kilogram, the level at which the Morrison government expects it to be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. “It’s amazing how fast the transition is coming,” he says. “All the technology we’re using is proven at demonstration level. We have the right backing, we have the partners and it will get done.” The consortium expects 3GW of its solar and wind capacity to be used locally to power mining sites and large trucks, replacing 3bn litres of imported diesel used in the Pilbara each year. Some of the energy may help create new industries such as green steel, which is seen as a significant economic opportunity once coal-fired processes can be affordably replaced with renewables and hydrogen. But most of the energy created will be exported. Because hydrogen condenses from a gas into a liquid only at very low temperatures (about -250C), it will be shipped as green ammonia, which is safer to transport and created by blending hydrogen with nitrogen. While not everyone is as bullish, the consortium believes the applications for green hydrogen and ammonia may be as broad as fossil fuels are today, including heavy road transport, long-range shipping and aviation, fertiliser production, energy-intensive big industry such as mining operations, and electricity generation. On the latter, they are closely watching a Japanese trial using ammonia to co-fire an existing coal power plant. The second of Australia’s two giant renewable export projects is no less extraordinary in its ambition, and also has been granted major project status from the federal government. Like the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, it is billed as the largest of its type in the world. The $22bn Sun Cable proposal, backed by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Forrest, involves building a 10GW solar farm with battery storage at the Newcastle Waters cattle station about 750km south of Darwin. Some of the electricity may be used to help power the Northern Territory capital and Indigenous settlements, but most would be intended for transmission via sub-sea cables that would snake 3,800kms through the Indonesian archipelago to Singapore. Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, has said the project could provide up to a fifth of the city-state’s electricity. Long-distance high-voltage direct current submarine cables are used in Europe, but this would be the world’s longest by some distance. The NT government last month announced the project had reached the first stage of the environmental approvals process, and Sun Cable has begun discussions with authorities in both Singapore and Indonesia and surveyed the first 750km of the route. Its goal is to start construction in late 2023 and, like the Pilbara hub, to be exporting by 2027. While onshore wind and solar have boomed in recent years as developers rushed to fill the national renewable energy target, Australia is yet to follow other countries – particularly in northern Europe and Britain – in building turbines off the coast. That may change with a proposal to construct a 2.2GW windfarm in Bass Strait off Port Albert and Mcloughlins Beach in South Gippsland. According to the proponents, the $10bn project would be one of the world’s largest offshore windfarms, and likely to meet about 20% of Victoria’s electricity needs. It would involve a yet-to-be-determined number of turbines – the company just says hundreds – of between 185 and 245 metres being built on the seabed between 7km and 25km offshore. It is potentially a sensitive place to build, with plans needing to factor in the impact on marine life and of grid connections to the Latrobe Valley inland. One of the questions hanging over the project will be its cost, but Star of the South maintains it makes economic sense – that the technology is becoming cheaper and the generation patterns of offshore wind will complement, rather than compete with, onshore renewables. It is seeking environmental approval from the Victorian government and waiting on the commonwealth to complete a legal framework for offshore clean energy developments, but has a goal of starting to generate by 2025. Where offshore wind is in its infancy, batteries are being built at a pace few expected. Just four years ago, the Australian Energy Market Operator forecast that the country might have only 4MW of large-scale batteries by 2020, and build no more before 2036. The reality is a marked contrast. There is already 287MW in operation or committed to construction, including several batteries built alongside wind or solar developments. Last week, the Victorian government announced a contract for a 300MW battery near Geelong – larger than everything built to date and billed as one of the biggest in the world. While batteries are often assumed to be storing surplus energy from the middle of the day for use when the sun goes down, the primary use so far in Australia is to bolster the security of the grid. When something goes wrong — such as a major transmission line being taken out by a tornado or a power station “tripping”, as happens more than 100 times a year — batteries are called on to plug the gap in a fraction of a second to prevent the grid collapsing. Simon Holmes à Court, a senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said they were an attractive option for state governments wanting to strengthen their grids at modest cost. Independent reviews found Australia’s first big battery, built at Hornsdale in South Australia in 2017, saved consumers $150m in its first two years in operation. Expect to see more of them, rapidly. “Falling costs and greater familiarity of the technology have led to solar and wind developers increasingly building batteries into their plans,” Holmes à Court says. Perhaps the Asian Renewable Energy Hub will one day pass it, but for now the biggest power plant in the country is spread across 29% of Australian homes. By the middle of this year, the country had about 12GW of solar rooftop panels, with installations continuing at a pace unaffected by Covid-19 or the gradual winding back of government incentives. Investment in large-scale renewable energy fell this year, but the growth in small-scale solar has increased to fill the gap. It is expected 2.9GW will go up this year, equivalent in capacity to a couple of average-sized coal plants. It has prompted authorities to take steps so panels can be temporarily disconnected from the grid if the influx of solar power causes problems for grid security. The 20th-century electricity system, based on a handful of large generators, was not built to cope with an influx of distributed power. A better solution may be to make it more financially attractive to install household batteries, which if pooled together can operate as a centrally controlled virtual power plant, charging or dispatching energy to the grid as needed. South Australia is trialling this sort of system, but for now incentives are limited in most states. In the meantime, analysts expect the skyrocketing installation rate to continue, reflecting the International Energy Agency’s observation that solar can now offer the cheapest electricity in history.",environment
"Support is growing internationally for a new global treaty to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, it has emerged, though so far without the two biggest per capita waste producers – the US and the UK – which have yet to signal their participation. A UN working group on marine litter and microplastics met at a virtual conference last week to discuss the issue. More than two-thirds of UN member states, including African, Baltic, Caribbean, Nordic and Pacific states, as well as the EU, have declared they are open to considering the option of a new agreement. The treaty would be akin to the Paris climate agreement or the Montreal protocol to prevent ozone depletion. Neither the UK nor the US have declared their desire for a new agreement. Britain, which leaves the EU at the end of the year, is considering one of two options: to support increasing calls for negotiating a new global treaty, or to strengthen existing agreements to reduce plastic waste. A decision by Zac Goldsmith, a minister for the environment, is understood to be imminent. The US has so far opposed an international agreement on plastic waste. The UN environment assembly, which set up the ad hoc working group (AHEG) on marine plastics in 2017, concluded that the existing international legal framework governing plastic pollution, including the Stockholm and the Basel conventions, is fragmented and ineffective. The flow of plastic into the ocean is expected to triple by 2040 if current trends continue, up to 29m tonnes a year – the equivalent of 50kg for every metre of coastline in the world. All efforts made and announced so far to curb plastic waste are expected to reduce the volume by only 7%. Once in the sea, it breaks down into microplastics, to be ingested by marine life. Political momentum for a global agreement to address the full lifecycle of plastic has been growing, with several high-level ministerial declarations in favour. Earlier this month, a resolution calling for the world community to agree to a binding global agreement was adopted by International Union for the Conservation of Nature members, and 2 million people have signed a petition calling for one to be adopted. At last week’s fourth and final meeting of the AHEG group, which will feed into UNEA’s 5th conference in 2021 and 2022, many delegates expressed concern that the crisis was being exacerbated by excess plastic pollution linked to personal protective equipment necessary to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Several delegations voiced support of a new global agreement, although there was no consensus on whether it would only address marine plastic litter or go further to tackle plastics pollution as a whole and if it would be legally binding. Ayub Macharia, the director of the National Environment Agency in Kenya, said the world required a global agreement to protect a “common heritage, our planet Earth”. He told delegates: “Kenya is on record in issuing a ban on polythene bags in 2017 and in single use plastic bags in protected areas in 2019.” Without international backup, however, Kenya’s actions alone did not reduce waste, Macharia said, declaring that “because of our porous borders which allow the illegal trafficking of plastic,” it was merely pushed across Kenya’s borders to other countries. Some industries that manufactured plastic bags in Kenya simply migrated to neighbouring countries, he said. Roxanne Blesam, chief executive officer of Palau’s environmental quality protection board, said the republic joined the “overwhelming majority of AHEG experts who have indicated support for a binding global agreement”, and supported a proposition put forward by the EU for an intergovernmental negotiating committee to start work on it. Hugo-Maria Schally, head of the multilateral environmental cooperation unit at the European commission, claimed the EU had been a proponent of a stronger global framework to address marine litter and marine plastic pollution for some time, and that the lack of participation so far by the US remained a huge obstacle. “We see moves by the US to come to some kind of understanding, but I’m not sure that the difficulties can be bridged,” Schally said. Many NGOs believe that an international agreement is the only viable option to tackle plastic waste. One model for such a treaty, drawn by the Environmental Investigations Agency (EIA), involves four key pillars: monitoring and reporting, to examine the extent of the problem; prevention; coordination; and technical and financial support, for example aid to developing countries. “Maintaining the status quo is not only untenable, it would have catastrophic implications for planet Earth,” said Christina Dixon, senior ocean campaigner at EIA. “It’s therefore heartening to see such growing convergence around a global and legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution.” Tim Grabiel, senior lawyer at EIA, said: “Support for a global treaty on plastic pollution is a critical action that the Biden administration can take to correct the wrongs of the Trump era. Over the last four years, we have continually encountered opposition from the Trump administration to truly address plastic pollution, slowing down progress and watering down international efforts. We are hopeful that, with a change in leadership at the top, the US will join its allies and support a global treaty on plastic pollution at UNEA-5.” In the UK, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “We are working with partners across the Commonwealth to prevent plastic waste from reaching the ocean, and have committed to establishing a £500m ‘Blue Planet Fund’ that will support developing nations to protect the marine environment and reduce poverty.”",environment
"Ministers’ pledges to preserve the UK’s food and farming standards after Brexit will not prevent the import of lower-standard products and could spell potential disaster for Britain’s farmers, a report has found. The government has repeatedly promised that a ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef would remain in place after Brexit, and has made changes to the way future trade bills will be scrutinised. But ministers have refused to sign safeguards on imported food into law, despite pressure from consumers and civil society groups. The headline bans on two products will still allow a large number of other lower-standard imports, while the changes to the way trade bills are managed are too weak to ensure a robust scrutiny of their impacts, according to the damning verdict of the Future British Standards Coalition (FBSC), which represents farmers and food producers, and animal welfare and green campaigners. Facing a potential second rebellion by its own MPs on the agriculture bill, the government agreed to strengthen the scrutiny of future trade bills with an expanded trade and agriculture commission (TAC), a statutory body with powers to advise on bills for the next three years. This was hailed by the National Farmers’ Union as heading off potential problems with trade bills lowering import standards. However, the FBSC found in a report on Friday that ministers would still have many powers to change the rules on food imports without parliamentary votes or robust scrutiny. Some standards on the use of antibiotics in farming, for instance, have already been scrapped, and rules governing the use of hormones on animals, and additives to food, will also be easier to alter. The FBSC also found that the TAC under current plans would not include representatives with expertise on public health, environment, animal welfare and consumer protection. Kath Dalmeny of the FBSC said she was “very positive” about the setting up of the TAC, but that it needed more powers and more expertise. She said “absolutely loads” of food products could be affected by a loosening of standards, done behind closed doors as part of trade deals. “There should be proper scrutiny, on issues such as antibiotic resistance, public health, [the impacts of products on] climate change and biodiversity loss,” she said. Antibiotic resistance was a particular problem, she said. The UK has high standards to prevent the overuse of antibiotics, and antibiotic use in farming has fallen in recent years. But many other countries still use antibiotics prophylactically and as growth promoters, which encourage the growth of resistant superbugs. The lack of rules on imports means that without strict measures to prevent it, meat and other products containing superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics could be imported under future trade agreements, threatening to spread such pathogens to the UK. “I think the government does not want its hands tied in any way when it goes into trade talks, so they have provided us with reassurances and advisory groups and given the impression that something robust is happening, but none of this holds anyone to account,” Dalmeny said. Some of the impacts of lower-standard imports are also being felt on the climate. Deforestation in some areas means agricultural production is harming the climate: beef from Brazil, for instance, has a carbon footprint about five times greater than the equivalent produced in the UK. Dalmeny called for ministers to strengthen safeguards by at least agreeing to widen the remit of the TAC, and ensure it is staffed with experts on the environment, public health and animal welfare as well as trade. “Consumers have consistently rejected the prospect of poorly produced food that hurts people, the planet and animals,” she said. “The government needs to show the public it is listening and taking advice from a wide range of experts.” George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “The unity of voice across farming, environmental, animal welfare and public health groups underlines the imperative that the UK government does not drop the ball in reaching trade agreements which undermine domestic food production standards. “Extending the tenure of the TAC will mean nothing if it is toothless, sidelined and ignored. Now is the time for the government to show that it is indeed determined to deliver its general election manifesto commitment to protect standards in trade.”",environment
"It took just a few decades for Brazilian agriculture to transform its tropical savannah hinterlands – the Cerrado – into an agricultural powerhouse. Farmers and the growing agribusiness sector celebrated rising sales of soya and beef, and the roads and towns that grew up with them. But environmentalists and Cerrado communities say the advances came at the price of roaring deforestation, land grabbing, violence and the loss of traditional lands. Nearly half (44%) of the Cerrado’s native vegetation, which includes scrubland, grasslands and forests, is already used for agriculture, the MapBiomas monitoring project calculates. And under Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is supported by powerful farming lobbies, the rest of its 2m sq km is disappearing fast. Last year alone, 6,500 sq km was cleared – adding to the 283,000 sq km of forest, grassland and scrub cut down since 2001. This year so far the Cerrado has seen more than 61,000 fire alerts – up from 39,000 in the whole of 2018, before Bolsonaro took power – raising fears for its future. It is an immense, important carbon sink, storing hundreds of tons a hectare in its soil and deep root systems. “The Cerrado is like the water tank of Brazil. This is impacting the fluvial regime of rivers, of important rivers,” said Britaldo Soares-Filho, professor of environmental modelling at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. “The Cerrado is a biodiversity hotspot and is under a lot of pressure.” A diagonal swathe across the middle of Brazil, the Cerrado covers around 22% of the country. Its rich wildlife includes 11,620 plant species and more than 200 species of mammals, including jaguars, anteaters, rhea birds and tapirs. Ignored for years, the region took on more importance after the country’s capital was moved to Brasília in the middle of the Cerrado in 1960 and states in the centre-west began filling with farms. Brazil’s military dictatorship from 1964–1985 launched programmes to modernise Cerrado agriculture, improve its infrastructure and colonise its remoter areas. In the late 1970s, a Japanese-Brazilian programme was launched to help colonise and develop the region to guarantee soya supplies. Big multinational traders such as Cargill and Bunge moved in. Chinese investment helped pave roads and improve ports. “They created a structure that favoured export,” said Roberto Miranda, a professor of sociology at the Federal University of Campina Grande. The Amazon – which is even larger than the Cerrado – was also being increasingly exploited. But that destruction was attracting international attention and concern: meanwhile the Cerrado stayed below the radar. In a 2017 paper, Soares-Filho and other researchers calculated that while 49% of the Amazon was in protected areas such as conservation units and indigenous reserves, just 7.7% of the Cerrado was. Under Brazil’s 2012 Forest Code, farmers are required to leave 80% of Amazon land as a “legal reserve”, but just 20% in most of the Cerrado region. “The Cerrado was the poor relation,” said Soares-Filho. As a result, agribusiness loved it. The region’s “agricultural frontier” is a huge area Matopiba, home to former president Dilma Rousseff’s Matopiba development agency. “In the agriculture area, we are still capable of picking low-hanging fruit – and at the same time, expanding the tree,” Rousseff said at the launch in 2015. “That’s why it’s a very special moment.”  Farmers who moved into the region were realistic. “Our ambition was never to get rich, but we wanted to have something in life,” said Paulo Dalto Neto, who came to farm here in 1997. Land was cheap in this dry, inhospitable region, but he has been able to improve his soil, develop the local roads and plant hardy soya strains with high yields. The losers were the Cerrado’s traditional communities, who usually did not have legal titles to land they had used for generations. Soya farmers prized this land and in some cases unscrupulous land dealers were able to buy or simply steal it by falsifying documents. “The soya here brought us very few jobs … and brought us many disadvantages,” said Juarez de Souza, 63, from the tiny Melancias community in Piauí.  De Souza’s community is now engaged in a legal battle to prove ownership of their land, while the river local people used for water and fishing has, according to De Souza, been polluted by pesticides. He says he has received threats from land grabbers looking for land to sell on to bigger farmers. “For them the soya is gold,” he said. “There is a lot of money.” Moreover, the change in land use is now altering the climate of the region. There is less rain and the temperatures are higher, he says: studies show deforestation contributes to droughts and erratic river behaviour. And meanwhile the farmers chop away, bit by bit, at its natural vegetation. The problem is that, while Brazil struggles with an economic downturn as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far resulted in 169,000 deaths, the Cerrado’s production of soya, sold mostly for animal feed, is booming – and expected to reach a record 135m tons for the 2020–2021 harvest. “This is the strength of our agribusiness,” Tereza Cristina Dias, Brazil’s agriculture minister, tweeted on 10 November. Brazil expects record beef exports in November – with the lion’s share of the country’s cattle raised in Cerrado states. With Brazil running a heavy deficit, worsened by its emergency pandemic payments to tens of millions of people and a record 14% unemployment, its booming exports of agricultural commodities such as soya and beef come as a relief, said Fábio Klein, a public accounts analyst at Tendências, a São Paulo consulting outfit. “Agriculture is a very competitive sector, and the income it generates, although concentrated, spills over the rest of the economy, which is good for the country and the government.” Brazilian soya’s high protein and oil count makes it especially popular in China, Brazil’s biggest soya customer, says Kory Melby, an American agribusiness consultant based in the Cerrado town of Goiânia. “International and domestic markets are telling Brazil that even though Brazil is expanding as fast as she can, we would like her to expand even faster,” he says. “That blows my mind.” The problem is that while the Cerrado may seem like low-hanging fruit, in the long term Brazil is losing yet more of its precious forests and wildlife. Their loss will come with a heavy cost. Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

"The Covid-19 mink variant that led to a cull of all mink in Denmark and the resignation of the country’s agriculture minister on Wednesday, is “very likely extinct”, said Denmark’s health ministry. The cull was sparked by research from one of Denmark’s public health bodies, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), which showed that a mink variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus called C5 was harder for antibodies to neutralise and posed a potential threat to vaccine efficacy.  A press release from the Danish Health Ministry on Thursday said the SSI had not found the C5 variant since September. It said: “the sequencing of the positive tests are showing we have not been able to find the mink variation with Cluster 5 since 15 September and because of this the SSI is estimating that this variant has very likely has died out.” Despite political backlash the cull has continued, and farmers have until midnight Thursday to cull all mink in the country. Scientists broadly welcomed the C5 extinction announcement. “This is good news, although I suspected Cluster 5 was extinct already,” said University College London (UCL) Genetics Institute director Francois Balloux. “Its prevalence was never that high and has not been observed since last September.” Balloux said, in his view, the “concerns over Cluster 5 may have been overestimated at the time”, but said this did not mean that the cull had been unnecessary. “No, the cull was not unjustified. Mainly because of the number of mink infected with Covid-19. The mutation was not really the justification for me. It was the large mink reservoir of Covid-19. I would also mention that minks escape regularly, so you don’t want that risk of infecting the wild animal population either.” He added that although C5 was just one of several mink mutations in circulation, it had been the most worrying because of its structure. “It had four mutations in the spike protein but only one in the receptor binding domain (RBD), the Y453F mutation. It is the RBD area that is the most important in terms of the risk of reducing vaccine efficacy.” Balloux’s UCL colleague, microbiologist Prof Joanne Santini, said this indicated the Danish had successfully contained its transmission, but sounded a note of caution. “I would be interested to know whether the claim of extinction was due to quarantining people infected, isolating their contacts as well culling the infected mink, or if C5 died out naturally.” It would be critical, as well, Santini said, to exclude the possibility of other animals being infected. “Time will tell,” she said. Nor does the C5 extinction rule out the risk of similar mutations, and much is still unknown, she said. Danish thinktank estimates put the cost of mink farm closures at about 3bn Danish kroner (£360m), and last week Denmark’s breeder association and the world’s largest fur auction house, Kopenhagen Fur, announced a “controlled shutdown” over the next three years. Sweden’s health agency said on Thursday that a number of Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in people who work in the mink industry. Authorities are analysing viruses from the infected people and infected minks to see if there is a link between the cases and their contact with minks, the agency said in a statement.

"Labour risks losing support among young people unless it does more to champion a radical green new deal (GND) to tackle the climate crisis and rebuild the post-Covid economy with well-paid, unionised jobs, according to climate activists and young Labour supporters. School climate strikers and key youth groups within the party say they have been dismayed by what they see as the party’s failure to fight for the full “green industrial revolution” programme set out at the last election. And they warn that the party risks losing support among young people who have backed Labour in the past few years. Joe Brindle, 18, an organiser of school climate strikes in the UK, said many young people who were deeply concerned about climate breakdown were becoming disillusioned with Labour. “It is just really disappointing … The leadership will say that the GND is central to what they are doing but they hardly ever bring it up. “Before the election it felt like their number one priority, it was absolutely central to everything the party talking about, but now it is hardly ever mentioned and it is becoming hard to persuade people concerned about climate change that the Labour party is their best option.” Labour insisted that it remained committed to a radical environment programme to decarbonise the economy and tackle the climate crisis, adding it should be judged on its policies at the next election. Ed Miliband, the shadow energy minister, said: “Climate and the green agenda are absolutely central to Labour’s plan for our economy, society and country. We want to be judged at the next election by our ambition in tackling the climate crisis.” But the campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal said the party’s recent green economic recovery plan appeared to water down or abandon key planks of the previous manifesto – such as public ownership of energy companies, levels of investment, the number of homes that would receive retrofitting and solar panels, and the number of well-paid unionised jobs a GND could create. Lauren Townsend, spokesperson for the group, which was instrumental in getting the party to back the 2019 GND policy, said: “Labour might claim it’s building on the 2019 manifesto, but in reality the party’s climate policies are going backwards. Labour’s green recovery plan abandons a 2030 decarbonisation target, scraps key public ownership commitments and fails to take on the corporate actors driving the climate crisis.” She said this was not just a failure to address the scale of the climate crisis but would also be hugely damaging to Labour’s electoral chances. “By scaling back its climate ambitions, Labour risks losing an election-winning coalition, ranging from Brighton to Bolsover. The green new deal agenda offers jobs, investment and security to working-class communities across the country, and last year made Labour the party of climate. Watering down our ambitions isn’t just bad for the planet – it’s bad politics.” However, a spokesperson for Labour said it remained committed to a radical green new deal including the target to achieve the substantial majority of emissions reductions by 2030 and the nationalisation of the energy sector as set out at the last election. They said its recent green recovery plan was just a short term response to the Covid crisis, adding the party should be judged on the full green new deal it puts forward at the next election. Miliband insisted the party was fully committed to a transformative agenda. “That’s why our green economic plan challenged the government to bring forward £30bn capital investment in the next 18 months to support hundreds of thousands of new jobs in low-carbon sectors, in line with ambitious independent proposals.” He said this was “just the start” of the party’s plans for a GND which “must both decarbonise our economy and transform our country.” “We want to see much greater ambition in the scale and pace of the UK’s approach to the climate emergency, including eliminating the substantial majority of our emissions by 2030, exactly the same call we made in the 2019 manifesto.” But Jess Barnard, chair of Young Labour, which represents members aged 14-26 said the party had failed to lead on the issue that mattered most to young people since last year’s general election. “We really have not seen very much from Keir [Starmer] in his time as leader around the climate crisis.” She said there was growing concern among many younger voters who backed the party at the last election. “At the moment we really risk disenfranchising younger voters because they felt they had this ally in Labour and now we are suddenly absent from the debate, absent from opposition, we are absent from demanding action.” Gaya Sriskanthan, co-chair of Momentum, the grassroots campaign group which backed Jeremy Corbyn for leader, said it appeared Labour was no longer listening to young people or the trade unions on the issue of a green new deal. “The most fundamental question here is who is Labour listening to on this, who is informing its policy because it is not the membership, it is not the unions it is not the youth strikers.” She said an increased focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the role of hydrogen in Labour’s recent green recovery plan would be welcomed by big oil. “The fact that they are emphasising CCS and hydrogen is very curious – because these are exactly the sort of things the fossil fuel industry push because they want to focus on things that don’t challenge their fundamental power.” Labour denied the claim and said it was committed to working with members, unions and climate activists to tackle the crisis. Some MPs are also calling on the Labour leadership to do more to push a radical climate justice agenda.  Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, said: “This should be a 1945 moment, with Labour promising a radical green new deal to rebuild the economy with climate and social justice at its heart. Anything less risks not only losing support from young people, but also of abandoning the hope to avert the climate catastrophe.”",environment
"A sea otter off the coast of California caused a splash when it was photographed apparently trying to eat a shark – though it appears it did not manage to complete its meal. Photographers Don Henderson and Alice Cahill captured the unusual event, which involved a small horn shark, in Morro Bay last week. The images were shared by Sea Otter Savvy, a non-profit which seeks to promote “responsible wildlife viewing, awareness of the effect our behaviour can have on sea otters and other wildlife, and a safer, healthier coastal environment for all of us, otter and human alike”. Michael Harris, of the California department of fish and wildlife, told the website For the Win Outdoors: “To my knowledge … this is the first documented horn shark capture by a sea otter. There are reports of sea otters capturing skates and rays, but this is the first report of a shark. Sea otters will feed on fish, but it’s a very rare observation in California.” Sea otters, the smallest North American marine mammal, typically eat invertebrates such as sea urchins, clams and crabs. But as Sea Otter Savvy posted on Twitter: “If you watch sea otters long enough you will see a range of sea life brought to the surface. While fish are not unusual prey for more northern sea otters (Alaska & Russia), they are quite uncommon in California.” Horn sharks live on the seabed, eating a similar diet to otters with an extremely powerful bite. Whether or not the shark seized by the otter managed to bite back, Sea Otter Savvy noted: “Not surprisingly, while some nibbling may have occurred, the prey was not consumed.” Harris told For the Win Outdoors he was “fairly certain” the otter was an adult female.",environment
"Endangered marine mammals and sea turtles are routinely being entangled in or are swallowing pieces of plastic that now riddle the oceans off US coastlines, a new report has found. The plastic-induced toll stretches from Florida, where a manatee was found dead with a stomach filled with plastic bags and straws, to Virginia where a sei whale died after swallowing a DVD case causing stomach lacerations, to California, where a juvenile elephant seal was discovered with a packing strap wrapped around its neck. In South Carolina, a loggerhead sea turtle defecated out almost 60 pieces of plastic while being rehabilitated. In total there is evidence of more than 1,800 marine animals from 40 species suffering from contact with plastics over the past decade, according to the first formal tally drawn from government and NGO data. Some examples of this phenomenon become well known – such as the whale that washed up with 40kg of plastic in its stomach last year – but the true toll is certainly far higher, with most entanglements unseen by humans. “We may never know the true number but the details we do have are heartbreaking,” said Kimberly Warner, a senior scientist at Oceana, the conservation organization that collated the report. “The plastic is everywhere, even within deep-diving animals that you rarely see, and it is getting worse.” Animals can inadvertently swallow floating pieces of plastic while feeding or may even mistake the pieces for food. The Oceana report found that plastic bags, balloons, recreational fishing line, plastic sheeting and food wrappers were the most commonly ingested items, causing internal injuries or hampering the ability of the animals to feed. Other pieces of plastic can become wrapped around necks, fins or flippers, causing deep injuries or hampering movement. In Hawaii, a monk seal was found with a plastic water bottle stuck on its snout while in California a food wrapper was discovered lodged in the esophagus of a dolphin. This blight could prove a material threat to the viability of some species, with the Oceana report finding that 88% of creatures recorded with plastic on or in them are from species listed as threatened or endangered by the US. Around 11m tonnes of plastic flow into the oceans a year, with this amount set to nearly triple to 29m tonnes a year by 2040 – the equivalent of 50kg for each meter of coastline in the world – if current trends continue. The plastic often breaks down into tiny pieces and is now ubiquitous in our oceans, found from the deepest reaches of the marine world to even sea ice in the Arctic. The Trump administration has blamed countries such as China and Vietnam for pumping large amounts of plastic into the seas but research has suggested the US is the planet’s third largest contributor to marine plastic pollution. United Nations talks were recently held on a new global treaty to tackle plastic pollution but without any signal of support from the US or UK, two of the largest per-capita waste producers in the world. Some jurisdictions within the US have moved to phase out plastic straws or bags – New York is now finally enforcing a ban on plastic bags after a pandemic-related delay – but advocates are hoping to push Joe Biden’s incoming administration to more aggressive national action. “We need to quit blaming other countries and pass laws limiting the use of single-use plastics,” said Warner. “I know Biden is very concerned about climate change and plastic is a huge supplier of greenhouse gases. I’m hoping the US will finally come to the party and do something about this.”",environment
"Britain has thrown its weight behind a new global agreement to tackle the plastic pollution crisis, which Lord Goldsmith said would go “far beyond” existing international agreements. This week, the Guardian revealed there is growing support for such a treaty internationally, but that neither the UK nor the US, the world’s biggest per capita producers of plastic waste, had yet pledged their support.  The minister for Pacific and the Environment said on Wednesday he believes it is time to start negotiations on a UN treaty on plastics similar to the Paris agreement on the climate crisis. He suggested the UK could provide a leading role in negotiating the terms of such an agreement, as it had with the leaders’ pledge for nature. Speaking via Zoom at a virtual World Trade Organization event, hosted by the UK in collaboration with the Global Plastic Action Partnership, Goldsmith said: “Plastic in the ocean is set to treble by 2025. The challenge we face is immense and urgent. We believe its time to negotiate a new global agreement to coordinate action on marine plastic litter and microplastic, one that goes far beyond the existing frameworks. With two-thirds of UN member states already on board we have a chance now to create an unstoppable momentum to tackle plastic pollution in a way that the Paris agreement has done for climate change and the Montreal protocol has done for ozone depletion. I hope many, many other nations will join us as well.” He spoke of the “ambitious” leaders’ pledge for nature signed in September by 64 world leaders from five continents including Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Jacinda Ardern and Boris Johnson. “I’m proud that the UK played a big role in strengthening that pledge, insisting on the strongest possible language, line by line,” Goldsmith said. The UK will be hosting the G7 and the all-important Cop26 in 2021, he said, and it is committed to doing all it can for nature and to “turn the tide” on plastic waste. Tim Grabiel, a lawyer at the Environmental Investigation Agency, welcomed the UK’s support for a plastics treaty and hoped that the US and Canada would follow its lead. He said: “The UK government is well positioned to lead global efforts and throw its political weight behind an issue so close to the hearts of the British public.” The UN environment assembly concluded in 2017 that the existing international legal framework governing plastic pollution, including the Stockholm and the Basel conventions, is fragmented and ineffective. More than two-thirds of UN member states, including African, Baltic, Caribbean, Nordic and Pacific states, as well as the EU, have said they are open to considering the option of a new agreement. Britain had been considering one of two options: supporting increasing calls for negotiating a new global treaty, or strengthening existing agreements to reduce plastic waste. The US has so far opposed an international agreement on plastic waste. At a UN working group last week to discuss the crisis, which will feed into the fifth UN Environment Assembly in 2021, several delegations voiced support for a new global agreement, although there was no consensus on whether it would address only marine plastic litter or go further to tackle plastics pollution as a whole, and whether it would be legally binding.",environment
"A 10km fence to keep out foxes, deers and cats will be built across the Yanakie isthmus on Victoria’s Wilsons Promontory to create a 50,000-hectare native wildlife sanctuary. The $6m fence is designed to protect vulnerable species including ground parrots, the southern brown bandicoot and long-nosed potoroo in the national park, south-east of Melbourne. Parks Victoria chief conservation scientist Mark Norman said the funding would help reshape the national park into a 50,000-hectare sanctuary. “The development of this predator and deer-proof fence across the narrow entrance to the park allows us to really create a wildlife haven at a huge scale. We’ll stop the wave of feral pests and really protect the special wildlife living there.” The fence will allow Parks Victoria to focus on eradicating any pests or predators inside the park. It will be built deep into the ground and almost 2 metres tall to prevent animals finding a way around, underneath or over it. Norman said that would allow conservationists to maintain the park’s populations of native animals. “The significance of the fence is huge, it’s like creating an island ark where all the native animals and their habitats are protected. It means all the work we do won’t be constantly going backwards with the stream of pests coming in. “It’ll also make an amazing experience for people to connect with nature. It would be like entering a modern Jurassic Park, or a native haven, where the animals bounce back and get the support they need.” The fence is part of a $23m upgrade to facilities, including a new visitor centre, tourism hub and new accomodation, as well as upgrading walking tracks, car parks and existing accommodation. It will turn the park something like an island, according to Matt Ruchel, Executive director at Victorian National Parks Association, protecting the wildlife there. But he said it wasn’t just the fence that would improve the park. “The fence is the iconic bit, but it’s the management following it that’s really important. There needs to be an integrated plan, and you’d hope down the track, you’d be in a position to reintroduce some of those species in a safe space where they can flourish.” “It’ll only work if there is intensive management of those pests in the reserve itself. What it does is then open the door to re-wilding animals and readjusting the ecology.” The Victorian environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the funding boost would help protect the environment and make it easier for more people to enjoy the park. “These are vital investments in conservation that will not only protect the biodiversity that underpins the health of Victoria’s environment but also take carbon out of our atmosphere, an important step in fighting climate change.” Norman told Guardian Australia the funding would go toward improving the walking track, making the facilities safe and more accessible, as well as replacing old “glamping” spots with eco-friendly pods. “I think it’ll engage the public and it’ll be a model for getting more people active in nature conservation and connecting with nature.” Ruchel welcomed the upgrades to visitor facilities, saying they are much needed in this current climate. “We know people are more inspired to visit nature, and we saw it after the first lockdown that there was an explosion in visitation, so the visitation needs to be managed.” “The infrastructure helps with that, but we shouldn’t forget we need core ecological programs to make sure it’s not just the physical assets that are protected, but also that we’re managing the parks to the highest level.” Authorities are hoping that by preventing predators and pests entering the park, they will be able to reintroduce native animals, such as the eastern bristlebird, eastern bettong and the spot-tailed quoll. “By getting rid of the feral pests, we’ll see an amazing bounce-back in endangered birds, endangered ground mammals, their reptiles and frogs. One feral cat can eat up to 5,000 animals a year, so they’re just pigging out on animals wholesale.” Ruchel said he was happy with the funding, and thought it was enough to get the upgrades installled and implemented, but that it wasn’t enough. “It’s good to see the Andrews government recognising the value of our natural areas by making this investment, but in the longer term we need better routine funding for management.” “The problem we have in park management is if its initial funding, it doesn’t always last. There is a question of needing ongoing long term support for these programs so that our ecosystems are managed consistently and for the long term.” Norman hoped the park could act as an emergency shelter for threatened species around the state, especially after last year’s bushfires. “In the bushfires, we almost lost the Victorian eastern bristlebird, and we’re going to set up an insurance population at the Prom, so if another catastrophic fire comes, they don’t go extinct in the state.” “The improvements will really come to show off the jewel in Victoria’s natural estate.”",environment
"Air pollution in many towns and cities across the UK now exceeds pre-pandemic levels, exacerbating the risk of Covid-19 and putting the health of millions of people at risk.  A study published on Thursday says that although air quality improved dramatically in the first half of the year as the country went into lockdown, pollution now meets or exceeds pre-Covid levels in 80% of the 49 cities and large towns that were analysed. There is growing evidence that exposure to toxic air increases the risks from Covid-19 and the authors of the study say their findings underscore the need for local councils to do more to reduce car use and improve air quality by prioritising walking and cycling. Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities thinktank, which carried out the study, said toxic air contributed to the deaths of thousands of Covid-19 victims this year and, even after the pandemic ended, would remain a big threat to public health – particularly for those living in urban areas. “City leaders can reduce the threat of air pollution, but it will take political will,” said Carter. “Discouraging car usage will be unpopular in the short term but, if coupled with the necessary improvements to public transport, the long-term benefits to public health and the economy will be huge and our cities will become better places to live in. Now is not the time for politicians to delay on this.” The study’s findings, based on an analysis of the latest data from Defra, reveal that while the spring lockdown reduced nitrogen dioxide levels by 38% on average across 49 cities and large towns, pre-pandemic levels had been reached or exceeded in four-fifths of the places studied during the second half of 2020. The authors say the surge in toxic air has been driven by a rise in the use of private cars and has happened even though 98% of the country remains under significant Covid-19 restrictions. This raises concerns that as those measures are eased in the new year, air quality will worsen even further, with dire consequences for public health. Since the pandemic hit, many local authorities have tried to encourage walking and cycling by building cycle lanes and creating low-traffic neighbourhoods to stop drivers “rat-running” through residential areas. But these efforts have faced vocal opposition from the pro-car lobby and some disgruntled drivers. Some councils have already backed down, pulling up new cycle lanes, while others shelved long-term plans to install low-emission zones, arguing that pollution levels had already fallen due to the lockdown. But Hubert Thieriot, from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said the new study highlighted the need for local leaders across the country to step up their efforts to limit the use of private cars as the country emerged from lockdown restrictions. He said the pandemic had caused “immense suffering both on sanitary and social fronts” but it had also reminded the public “that air pollution is not a given, and that bold actions on transportation could significantly improve people’s health and quality of life”. “The role of transportation in UK cities’ air pollution has become apparent to everyone during the Covid-related lockdowns,” Thieriot said. “That shared awareness offers policymakers a historical chance to implement bold transportation policies.”",environment
"The spread of a facial cancer that ravaged the Tasmanian devil population has slowed due to the animal’s “amazing evolutionary response”, increasing its chance of survival, new research suggests. An international team of scientists used a genomic tool typically used to track viruses such as Covid-19 to monitor the spread of the transmissable cancer that has led to devil numbers crashing by more than 80% over the past two decades. Called devil facial tumour disease, or DFTD, the unusual illness is passed between animals by biting. There was concern a decade ago that it could lead to the marsupial’s extinction as it moved into populations across most of the island state. But a new paper in the respected journal Science says the spread of the cancer has slowed – the curve has flattened – and it is now thought unlikely to wipe out the endangered species. Prof Andrew Storfer, a biologist from Washington State University in the US who led the research, said the results were “cautiously optimistic good news”. “I think we’re going to see continued survival of devils – initially at lower numbers and densities than original population sizes, but extinction seems really unlikely even though it was predicted a decade ago,” he said in a statement. The study expands on earlier work led by Dr Rodrigo Hamede, a disease ecologist at the University of Tasmania, which suggested a handful of devils had developed a natural immune response to the disease. The new paper found that while DFTD was still usually fatal, the reproduction number of cases from each primary case had fallen from a high of about 3.5 to less than one. The authors concluded devils were likely to have rapidly evolved to tolerate and possibly resist the cancer, and could now exist in a “steady state” with it. They screened more than 11,000 genes from tumour samples collected over nearly 20 years using a genomic approach known as phylodynamics, which allowed analysis of changes in DNA to track the evolution of the disease through the population. The researchers said there was increasing evidence some devils could recover from DFTD, which was not the case in its early incarnation. There are believed to be about 10,000 left in the wild. Hamede, a co-author on the latest study, said he was amazed at the pace at which devils had evolved in response to DFTD. “These things just don’t happen in four or five generations, they take a lot longer than that,” he said. “This new research shows evidence that the epidemic reached its peak a while ago. We expect in the future devils are going to be making a comeback.” The researchers said the results raised doubts about the future of programs that exist to release captive-bred devils into the wild, given breeding between animals exposed to the disease and those raised in captivity could slow or reverse the tumour-resistant evolution of the wild population. Hamede said these sort of programs should only be undertaken only if it was clear the benefits were greater than allowing populations to recover through natural selection. Storfer said: “Active management may not be necessary and could actually be harmful.”",environment
"In some rare good news from the top of the world, bowhead whale populations have rebounded and are nearing pre-commercial whaling numbers in US waters. Surprisingly, the whales’ recovery has actually accelerated as the Arctic warms, according to an update on the species published this week by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. “This is really one of the great conservation successes of the last century,” said J Craig George, a retired biologist with the North Slope borough department of wildlife management. Bowhead whales – the only baleen whale that lives in the Arctic year-round – were once on the brink of disappearing forever. The population near Alaska was targeted by commercial whalers beginning in the 1700s for their oil, blubber and baleen. Their large, rotund bodies and slow-moving nature made them easy targets, and they were nearly hunted to extinction by the turn of the 20th century. Once commercial whaling ceased, the western Arctic population living in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas began to rebound. The whales’ recovery has been in large part thanks to the natural inaccessibility of their ice-covered home, which has shielded them from commercial shipping and fishing activities that threaten their right whale cousins to the south. George also credits sustainable management and stewardship of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC), who have fought against offshore oil drilling and other activities that could harm the species. “No one has fought harder than the AEWC to protect bowhead habitat from industrial development in the US Arctic,” George said. Researchers work with Alaska native communities such as the Inupiat of Utqiaġvik, Alaska, who have hunted the whales at sustainable levels for at least 1,000 years, to monitor and study the species. “The general understanding of cetacean biology, anatomy and physiology and ecology has been greatly enhanced in the partnership with indigenous hunters,” George said. “It was the Inupiat captains that taught us how to properly count whales.” Bowhead whales can provide broader insights into Arctic marine ecosystem health. The species’ longevity and sensitivity to annual fluctuations help biologists track changes in the Arctic over long periods of time. Bowhead whales’ accelerated population expansion in recent decades has come as a surprise to biologists, who expected the cold-adapted whale species to suffer from the melting sea ice. Bowheads are highly specialized to their Arctic environment, with a pronounced bump on their heads used to break ice and blubber over a foot and a half (half a meter) thick. So far, however, the whales have proven resilient in the face of dramatic changes and have even benefited in unexpected ways. The Arctic is becoming more productive as temperatures rise and more light reaches the ocean surface layer where sea ice is thinner or absent. Less ice and more nutrients flowing north from the Bering Sea have led to an increase in bowhead whale foods like krill and copepods in northern latitudes. These changes have been helpful to bowheads around Alaska, resulting in fatter whales and more babies, according to Noaa. Bowheads have also been able to expand their territory north into waters where the ice was once too thick for them to break. While the western Arctic population was hunted down to just a few thousand individuals by the end of commercial whaling, they had rebounded to about 10,000 individuals by the turn of the 21st century and now number at least 16,800. But the species’ fate is far from certain as the Arctic rapidly transforms. Their thick blubber, which provides insulation against frigid icy waters, could become a disadvantage during warmer summers. They are also more likely to get tangled in fishing gear, face competition for food from other baleen whales, and attacked by their only natural predators – orcas – as the ice retreats and can no longer shield them. “They really are headed into an uncertain future,” George said.",environment
"A leading scientist has told an inquest there is no evidence that a nine-year-old girl was admitted to hospital with acute asthma complications when levels of air pollution were higher. Paul Wilkinson, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told a coroner he had analysed levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter on the days during her lifetime when Ella Kissi-Debrah had contact with, or was admitted to, hospital. He told the hearing at Southwark coroner’s court he had found no evidence to support the theory that Ella’s condition worsened to the point of requiring hospitalisation at times when air pollution was higher. “It’s a complicated thing to determine, no thing is entirely unequivocal,” he said “… What I set out to test was whether days of hospital admission were also days of higher air pollution. “Because if ambient pollution were a prominent driver of her condition you would expect to see that she was more likely to go to hospital when air pollution levels were high and less likely when air pollution levels were low. “The bottom line is there was no clear evidence that days of hospital admission or contact had higher concentrations or higher pollution than other days.” He concluded: “It doesn’t exclude the fact that air pollution may have been a contribution to some degree but it wasn’t a very determining effect.” Wilkinson said there was no doubt that Ella, who lived 25 metres from the South Circular road in London, was being exposed to higher than average levels of pollutants during her lifetime. “The South Circular is a busy road and she was within 30 metres of it. And levels from a main road by 30 metres are still above background levels,” he said. “So she was likely to be having above average [exposure] even within London.” Wilkinson said at the time Ella was ill – between 2010 and 2013 – it was clear and not disputed scientifically that air pollution was a factor in the exacerbation of the disease from day to day. “That has been recognised for probably about 15 years.” But he said it was a less dominant factor than allergens and respiratory infections. Air pollution, he said, was a stronger influence for some people than others, but it was not possible to identify which asthma sufferers would be more sensitive to air pollution than others. “Looking very carefully at the levels [of air pollution] there was nothing there in her case,” Wilkinson said. The inquest has heard that illegal levels of air pollution in the area where Ella lived and died should have been treated as a public health emergency. In a landmark legal case, the coroner Philip Barlow is being asked to rule that air pollution caused the death from an acute asthma attack of the primary school pupil in February 2013, a finding that would make legal history. It has never been identified as a cause of death before in the UK and this is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world. Ella’s mother, Rosamund, told the hearing on Monday that had she known about the impact of air pollution on her daughter’s illness, she would have moved house immediately. The hearing continues.",environment
"Money made available for wildlife conservation by the EU is based on a popularity contest, with vertebrates getting nearly 500 times more funding for each species than invertebrates, according to a new report. Brown bears, wolves, bitterns and Eurasian lynxes are the Hollywood stars of European conservation and receive almost the same amount as all invertebrates put together, according to analysis of funding under the EU’s Habitats Directive. This leaves little for less charismatic creatures such as spiders and crustaceans, many of which are crucial to ecosystem health and at greater risk of extinction, the study found. The paper, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, is the latest to show that invertebrates are being overlooked by conservation efforts, which usually focus on more eye-catching birds and mammals. A team led by Stefano Mammola, a cave ecologist at the Italian National Research Council, analysed the EU’s Life programme – which funds climate and environment action– between 1992 and 2018 to see how money was allocated. The study found that 23% of Europe’s vertebrates received funding compared with 0.06% of invertebrates. In total, vertebrates attracted €970m (£880m), six times more than the €150m for invertebrates. “The data was amazing in terms of how much bears, wolves, and a few birds got in terms of funding,” said Mammola. “The bias operates at different levels within mammals – you have a few species that get everything. There is only one spider included in the Habitats Directive, a few crustaceans, and not a single parasite.” The risk of extinction did not seem to influence how much money a species received. The brown bear and grey wolf received the most money: €47m and €33m. Both animals are “of least concern”, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The rate of extinction in insects is eight times faster than that of birds, mammals and reptiles, according to analysis published last year, with known declines likely to be the “tip of the iceberg”. The findings are released as the EU creates its biodiversity strategy for the next decade, with the aim of protecting 30% of land for nature by 2030, with an estimated budget of €20bn. The paper outlines a strategy for fair spending in the coming decade, and a recent EU proposal suggests it will try to account more for invertebrates in the Life programme. “We should have reached a point, in my opinion, where we do not have to explain why protecting biodiversity is important,” said Mammola. “I see the point of attracting people using charismatic species, I’m not denying that, but I think there are also lots of charismatic species in the invertebrate world. We need to change the perception of what’s charismatic and illustrate the larger diversity of what’s there.” Most species are declining, but investment in species-level conservation can reverse these trends. One of the biggest conservation successes has been the return of large carnivores such as wolverine and lynx across Europe. Sometimes, protecting “umbrella species” such as beavers or wolves benefits habitats more broadly, but this is not always the case. “The problem is that invertebrates have very different ecological needs to mammals – but the spatial niche of a spider or a beetle is totally different. You need to protect microhabitats and other elements that you don’t get when you’re protecting a wolf, for example,” he said. Putting more emphasis on protecting specific habitats such as decaying wood or aquatic systems could protect many rare invertebrates simultaneously. Extinction risk was assessed using the IUCN database, and public interest in a species was measured by scanning Google searches between January 2010 and December 2019. The top 30 invertebrates supported by Life funds were beetles, butterflies and dragonflies (large and colourful species seemed to do the best), but their funding was “minuscule” compared with funds for vertebrates, researchers wrote. Using Life project funding as a proxy for assessing spending on the conservation of different organisms is not straightforward because there are other mechanisms for nature conservation across the EU, said Prof Steve Ormerod, an ecologist at Cardiff University, who was not involved in the study. “A key finding, nevertheless, is that spending through this scheme has been biased towards ‘charismatic’ vertebrates (often mammals and birds) rather than invertebrates. While this strategy will have inevitably also benefited smaller organisms that live under the ‘umbrella’ of bird, mammal or fish habitats, there is clearly a case to ramp up protection and support for smaller organisms,” he said. Providing an unbiased European conservation agenda was an important aim, agreed Prof Michael Samways, an entomologist from Stellenbosch University, who was not involved in the research. “As human beings, we naturally gravitate to the feathery and the furry. This paper gets to the heart of this issue – biodiversity is not just vertebrates, it’s about invertebrates, and of course it’s about all the microorganisms as well as the fungi and so on. It’s really about making sure we can save life in its entirety,” he said.

"Microplastic pollution has been discovered in snow close to the peak of Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain. With plastic debris revealed in 2018 at the deepest point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, it is now clear that humanity’s litter has polluted the entire planet. The tiny plastic fibres were found within a few hundred metres of the top of the 8,850-metre mountain, at a spot known as the balcony. Microplastics were found in all the snow samples collected from 11 locations on Everest, ranging from 5,300 metres to 8,440 metres high. The highest concentrations of microplastics were found around Base Camp, where climbers and trekkers spend the most time. The fibres were most likely to have come from the clothing, tents and ropes used by mountaineers, the scientists said. Other recent discoveries of microplastic pollution in remote parts of the Swiss Alps and French Pyrenees indicate the particles can also be carried by the wind from further afield. “It really surprised me to find microplastics in every single snow sample I analysed,” said Imogen Napper, at the University of Plymouth, who led the new research. “Mount Everest is somewhere I have always considered remote and pristine. To know we are polluting near the top of the tallest mountain is a real eye-opener.” “With microplastics so ubiquitous in our environment, it’s time to focus on appropriate environmental solutions,” she said. “We need to protect and care for our planet.” Reducing, reusing and recycling larger items of plastic waste is important, Napper said, as they can be broken down into microplastics when discarded into the environment. But many microplastics are shed from clothing made from synthetic fabrics, and she said a focus on better fabrics was needed, as well as using natural fibres such as cotton when possible. Millions of tonnes of plastic are lost into the environment every year. It can contain toxic additives and carry harmful microbes and is known to injure wildlife that mistake it for food. People also consume microplastics via food and water, and breathe them in, although the health impact is not yet known. There have been longstanding concerns about litter on Everest, which was climbed by at least 880 people in 2019. But the new study is the first to assess microplastic pollution, which is less than 5mm in size and therefore too small to be picked up. The study, published in the journal One Earth, analysed samples collected by a National Geographic expedition in 2019. The scientists found an average of 30 microplastic particles per litre of water in the snow samples and 119 particles per litre in the most contaminated sample. They also assessed stream water samples from eight locations, but only three had microplastics, perhaps as the streams were able to wash away contamination. In her previous work, Napper has found that each cycle of a washing machine can release 700,000 microscopic plastic fibres, and that plastic bags that claim to be biodegradable were still intact after three years in the natural environment.",environment
"Malcolm Shabazz Hoover is rattling off his vegetable varieties to two potential customers from a local restaurant. “It’s called Brassica juncea, a west African mustard green,” Hoover says to Marissa Lorette and Ian Watson, co-owners of BeesWing, a local restaurant looking to work with Black businesses. He picks some from the ground and offers it to them. “Taste it.” “It’s sweet and spicy,” Watson says, looking pleased and happily confused, and Black Futures Farm bags another client. This brings the number of entities to which it sells produce through the city’s Community Supported Agriculture program to 17 – in less than a year of operation. I have come to meet Hoover on his micro farms at Portland State University’s Learning Gardens Laboratory. I’ve known this Black naval reserve vet for many years – and the silver-haired 50-year-old has, at times, been one of the most restive and unstable of my Portland associates. When I heard he had turned to farming, I had to see it for myself. As we walk along the immaculate rows of kale, I still cannot believe he has raised this produce from seeds to maturity. The Hoover I knew carried a whiff of self-destructiveness; this one radiates cultivation energy. In the imagination of Black America, farming has existed as a centuries-long, government-enacted crime scene. Now Hoover’s fledgling business, and others like it, are part of a nationwide movement seeking to address the systemic racism denying Black people land and food sovereignty. Predating Black Lives Matter, this movement has found its profile amplified during the latest protests and calls for justice after the murder of George Floyd. Small and independent, these farms produce the fresh food lacking in many communities of color and – most profoundly – restore a rightful heritage. It is a remixing of a broken song about the soil and the relationship of Black Americans to it. There were more than 900,000 Black farmers in the US in 1920, but of the country’s 3.4 million total farmers, just 45,000 are Black according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture. That’s just over 1% of farmers, despite Black or African American people making up 13% of the population. In 1997, a class discrimination lawsuit was filed, Pigford v Glickman, which would find that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) had discriminated against Black farmers from 1983 to 1997. Its controversial settlement injected $1bn (£740m) into Black farming, but dragged on for years. A paucity of Black-owned farms means a dearth of healthy food right in the middle of communities of color, which often lack decent supermarkets and fresh produce. According to a report from the National Institutes of Health studying trends in food insecurity from 2001 to 2016, “food insecurity rates for both non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic households were at least twice that of non-Hispanic white households.” Covid-19 has given food justice issues new urgency, as food insecurity rates among households with children have “sharply elevated – particularly so among Black and Hispanic respondents,” according to the Northwestern Institute for Policy Research. But here in Oregon things are changing. “The interest in urban farming has grown threefold” in this region, says Eddie Hill, co-director of the Black Food Sovereignty Coalition, a nonprofit organization that works with BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) growers. The number of Black-owned farms within 50 miles of Portland has doubled from eight to 16 during the last five years. Hoover tells me that he came to micro-farming the way so many others have: through networking and on-site learning. While working at the Oregon Food Bank he met Art Shaver and Shantae Johnson, who invited him to visit their farm, Mudbone Grown. He put himself to work. Shaver and Johnson are at right at the heart of some of the changes taking place here; the couple’s Pathways to Farming training program is well known throughout the area. After talking to Hoover, I want to find out more about this new wave of farmers, and so I go to meet them on their eight-hectare (20-acre) farm in the lush hills outside of Portland. Sitting inside an industrial-size tent, light rain tapping, they tell me they had wanted to farm for years. If you shake an African American family tree, a farmer is bound to fall out of it. Hoover has family who were land stewards in Texas and Tennessee. Johnson, 42, and Shaver, 46, grew up farming. Johnson’s grandmother had a seven-acre farm in Oregon City that would visit; Shaver’s grandmother had a small farm in Texas. His job was to ladle boiled fish guts, a rich soil additive, among her rows of carrots and cabbage. It made them feel grounded. “We just wanted to have some land, work it with our kids,” says Johnson, a gentle, curly haired woman who is on the Oregon Board of Agriculture. “We started talking about homesteading like our ancestors did,” adds the lean, bespectacled Shaver, two-dozen chicks in a box at our feet.  The couple, who now have six children, discounted farming because of the racism that meant farmland was passed down from white family to white family and denied to people of color. But they kept going back to the dream. In 2016, they cobbled together $5,000 to join Oregon State University’s Beginning Urban Farmer Apprenticeship, an eight-month training program for aspiring farmers. They left it halfway through. “Some of the stuff I was paying to learn I had already been exposed to through my grandparents,” says Shaver. “We were like: ‘Let’s quit and go out and do this on our own.’” Even with access to land, farming is prohibitively expensive. The couple scrambled to make it work, using food stamps to buy seeds and starts to grew bushels of food in a garden at their Portland rental apartment. There, they began to teach school-age children about land sustainability and to share skills that could help them in the job market. In 2017, the Oregon Food Bank offered them more acreage in Portland. They also launched the Pathways to Farming incubator program, designed to teach agriculture to prospective farmers. In 2019, they leased their current peri-rural space. His and Johnson’s place lies in the lush green hills of Oregon. The winding paths between properties in this setting calls lots of things to mind. Slavery is not one of them. A commitment to teaching others is crucial to the continued growth of Black farming. At the moment, there seems to be no shortage of people eager to learn. When Mudbone expanded last year, 99 Black Oregonians applied for its 10 open positions. When I revisit Black Futures Farm to see how Hoover is doing, he tells me a group of five volunteers have showed him how to build a needed irrigation system. “Having regular water … is the earmark of a serious farmer,” says Hoover. “When I [first] thought about working on a farm, I was like: ‘Shit, that’s like slavery.’ “Working out in a hot field for hours and hours at a time, that’s what I equated farming with. Now, having my own farm has taken me much further back than slavery. I’m an African.”  This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.

"Nearly all soya is used by the farming sector as a livestock feed for chickens, pigs and other animals. The biggest users are chicken producers; soya makes up around a quarter of the diet of birds. It has been the cheapest source of protein poultry available to farmers since the ban on meat and bonemeal after BSE. Soya remains key to producing fast-growing, low-priced chickens. Alternatives such as lentils or other legumes are more expensive and less available to farmers. Some poultry farmers have been experimenting with adding black soldier fly larvae to the diets of their birds, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimating that insects could replace between 25 and 100% of soymeal for chickens. However, at present insects are seen as a supplement, rather than a replacement, for soya.“[Soya is] our achilles heel. It’s the best pound for pound source of protein so it’s hard to convince farmers to move away from it,” chicken farmer Charles Mears told the Guardian last month. Soya is a smaller part of the diet of other farmed animals and appears to be easier to replace. For example, dairy farmers supplying M&S recently eliminated their use of soya, replacing it with rapeseed oil and sugar beet.  The vast majority of soya is grown in Argentina, Brazil and the US, which between them account for 80% of global production. Two of those countries – Argentina and Brazil – have serious risks of deforestation in soya production, and also provide most of the soya used by UK farmers. There is a small but growing supply of soya produced in Europe, but it is not yet competitive with producers in the Americas. It is currently more profitable for European farmers to grow alternative crops to soya. The main sources of organic soya are China, India, the US and Russia. Retailers are linked through their supply chains to deforestation because they buy meat and dairy products from UK farmers who use soya. In response to pressure, they have come out with a variety of policies that attempt to limit or eliminate links with deforestation. Most of them do this by committing to ensuring that their suppliers only use “responsibly-sourced” soya, relying on a range of certification schemes to deliver on this. There is no internationally-agreed definition of responsibly- or sustainably-sourced soya. Instead it is left to individual private certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Responsible Soy, which states that it guarantees zero deforestation and zero conversion in its certified soya production. But such schemes have different tiers of certification. The most basic tier involves buying offsets for soya in their supply chain. The money goes to support farmers producing soya responsibly, but the soya in the supply chain is not necessarily responsibly-sourced. Aldi and McDonald’s are among companies that say they use credits.The next tier up works on the basis of what is known as “area mass balance”. Certified soya is mixed up with non-certified soya, but the amount of certified soya is tracked. So while the actual soya you buy may not be certified, you create a market for certified ‘responsibly sourced’ soya by buying it through this tier. Tesco has said all of its soya will be covered by this tier by the end of 2020. The highest tier is buying only segregated soya, which means the soya comes from a certified source and is kept separate from other non-certified soya throughout its journey along the supply chain to farmers. Sainsbury’s has said it will work with its suppliers of fresh chicken, pork, eggs and aquaculture to only source area mass balance or segregated soya by 2023. Waitrose has set the same target for its suppliers by the end of 2020. The UK government has agreed to introduce new rules requiring companies to prove they have checked for risks of illegal deforestation in their supply chains. Companies would also be banned from sourcing commodities, including soya, that have not been produced in line with the laws of countries where they originate. A consultation on the proposals concluded last month. Details about the due diligence that firms will have to undertake to ensure products are deforestation-free have not yet been announced. It is also unclear if compliance with local laws would be enough to guarantee that soya has no links with deforestation. In Brazil, for example, president Jair Bolsonaro has disputed data on deforestation and called for further development of the Amazon region.“The only way supermarkets and fast food companies will actually achieve deforestation-free supply chains is by reducing the amount of meat they sell, not by replacing soya with other feeds, or by paying certification schemes,” said Anna Jones, head of forests at Greenpeace. “Feeding plant proteins to animals to produce meat is hugely inefficient and uses far more land across the world than we have to spare.”",environment
"For thousands of years, the dainty Fritillaria delavayi has grown slowly on the rocky slopes of the Hengduan mountains in China, producing a bright green flower after its fifth year. But the conspicuous small plant has one deadly enemy: people, who harvest the flower for traditional Chinese medicine. As commercial harvesting has intensified, Fritillaria delavayi has vanished – by rapidly evolving to produce grey and brown leaves and flowers that cannot be so easily seen by pickers. Scientists have discovered that the colour of the plant’s leaves has become more camouflaged – matching the background rocks on which they grow – in areas where there is more harvesting pressure from people. “Like other camouflaged plants we have studied, we thought the evolution of camouflage of this fritillary had been driven by herbivores, but we didn’t find such animals,” said Dr Yang Niu, of the Kunming Institute of Botany, and co-author of the study in Current Biology. “Then we realised humans could be the reason.” In the study by the Kunming Institute of Botany (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the University of Exeter, researchers measured how closely plants from different populations matched their mountain environment and how easy they were to collect, and interviewed local people to estimate how much harvesting took place in each location. In a computer experiment, people were found to take more time to discover the more-camouflaged plants, suggesting that humans are driving the rapid evolution of this species into new colour forms because better-camouflaged plants have a higher chance of survival. Fritillaria delavayi is a perennial herb that grows leaves at a young age before producing a single flower after its fifth year every June. The bulb of the fritillary species has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years but high prices in recent years have led to increased harvesting. “It’s remarkable to see how humans can have such a direct and dramatic impact on the colouration of wild organisms, not just on their survival but on their evolution itself,” said Prof Martin Stevens, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter. “Many plants seem to use camouflage to hide from herbivores that may eat them – but here we see camouflage evolving in response to human collectors. “It’s possible that humans have driven evolution of defensive strategies in other plant species, but surprisingly little research has examined this.”",environment
"When walking down the track to the estuary for my hour’s exercise, I picked up a feather from the green verge. It was delicately fringed, mottled brown, velvety – a tawny owl’s primary. I swished it through the air to admire its soundlessness, stuck it in my hatband, strolled on by the seawall to the millpool at Ynys where clamorous redshank roost. None were present. The only noisemakers around were a rackety mob of small birds – great tits, house sparrows – that darted in and out of sparse foliage on a great oak by the muddy path to Llanfihangel y Traethau. Focusing my glass, there, sure enough, the brindled presence of a sleeping tawny owl. By Traeth Bach again the following evening, with a bag of scraps from the Penrhyn butcher in my pocket, I sat on a great slate block by the end of the track to watch the scudding birdlife that accompanies each turn of the tide. This is my cynefin, my milltir sgwâr. For 50 years, I’ve lived around this estuary, and I know and love it as well as anywhere on the planet. From this rock I can look across the Afon Dwyryd to my old house, invoking memories of the fallen owlet that I reared in my workroom there and reintroduced into the wild 30 years ago. I laid out scraps of meat on a nearby rock, cupped my hands and, like Wordsworth’s Boy, “Blew mimic hootings” to the owls in the oak woods of the farther shore. Did “my” owl still live among those trees? Certainly I, and my late friend and neighbour Jonah Jones the sculptor, saw her often after she’d returned to the wild. Records exist of owls living to a considerable age, though few do. In the oldest extant Welsh story, Culhwch ac Olwen, the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd is third oldest among all creatures. So I sat and waited and hooted on. A sound from over my right shoulder! A hundred yards away on a fence post perched a tawny owl, devouring a chunk of meat from the slate below. She, or one of her granddaughters, had come. I summoned again. She answered with a shriek, and fed on.",environment
